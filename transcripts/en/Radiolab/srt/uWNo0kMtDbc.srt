1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,990
Okay. Ready? Yeah. Hey, I'm Jetta.
Boom, rod. And I remember Colbert.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,830
This is Radiolab, our fun drive addition,
when we're trying to prevail upon you,

3
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:11,460
give you all the reasons we can think
of to support public radio and radio lab

4
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:13,990
in particular. You know what Robert, why,

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,180
why should we even say anything when I
think it's more powerful when somebody

6
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:22,900
who uses radio lab who uses public
radio can say it for us. Well,

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,490
you have someone in mind. I do. I have
a story here that came into our inbox.

8
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:32,410
This is a true story where public
radio, you ready for this? Okay.

9
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,390
Literally saved a boy's life. What? All
right, so I'm exaggerating a little,

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,140
but it helped out in a pretty dire
situation. And if saving lives,

11
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:45,250
healing wounds doesn't make you want
to support this service, then well,

12
00:00:45,251 --> 00:00:46,420
frankly I don't know what will.

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,130
So anyhow, um, the woman who wrote,

14
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,290
we're just going to call her right
now. Her name is Jennifer Bab and how,

15
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:54,220
how would we be spelling [inaudible]

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:56,280
bad baptism. Yes sir.

17
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,390
Jennifer Bab as MBA. Yes.

18
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,870
That will be via the B.

19
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,570
Yup. And it involves her and

20
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,170
her son. Like

21
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,320
hello. Hi, is this Jennifer? Yes. Hey,

22
00:01:08,321 --> 00:01:12,640
this is Jad and this is Robert here
on the other microphone. Hi Guys.

23
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:15,800
Nice to meet you. Nice to meet
you telephonically. Now Jennifer,

24
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,640
I understand you have a,
you have a son, right?

25
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,870
Yes, I have two children you might send
is my oldest. He's seven and a half lake

26
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,430
blink. And so can you set the scene
for the story you're gonna tell it?

27
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,170
Well, let's see. So Blake,
um, he says when he grows up,

28
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:31,670
he's going to be an inventor.

29
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,740
What do you like to build most of all
is airplane airplanes and helicopters.

30
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,190
Okay. So the first one, the
belt were just, you know,

31
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:46,820
he'd take a couple of pieces of Tupperware
and lay them out on the floor in the

32
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:48,040
shape of the plane.

33
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:53,830
But lately he's been trying to
build planes that actually fly.

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,200
So he made this airplane.

35
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,040
He's sitting next to me now and he's
telling me it's more like a helicopter.

36
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,723
It's okay.

37
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,500
40 bucks cut out too long.

38
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,540
Propeller blades that he duct taped
together in the shape of an egg.

39
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,200
And the propeller, I have to say
the propeller is really cool.

40
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:14,520
The propeller actually flies.

41
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,900
So we have kind of a balcony on our
house and he stood up on the balcony and

42
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,980
like flung it off and
then hovered in there

43
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,670
really? Oh Wow. Moment

44
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,720
before falling to the ground.

45
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:37,520
Okay. So, so you, you, you've done a
bunch of tests with this propeller,

46
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:41,970
you see that it can fly and then
I'm assuming at a certain point, um,

47
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,510
he takes it to the next step.

48
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,433
Yeah.

49
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,980
So He's been learning about electricity
and about motors and things and he's got

50
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:53,030
a couple of toys that have motors on them.

51
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:57,920
So He's been trying to build an airplane
that'll hook up to the motor and he

52
00:02:57,921 --> 00:03:01,570
tried to attach his pillar
and it just fell over.

53
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,440
Yeah. See the motor
wasn't powerful enough.

54
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:05,821
Right.

55
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:10,560
And so there's only one thing that
we've got that strong enough to power a

56
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,720
propellor of this size
and IP human beings.

57
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,560
Oh yes.

58
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,900
So what he did was, since
the motor didn't work,

59
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:21,901
he made out of duct tape a harness system
so that he could kind of climb inside

60
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,140
the harness and hold on to the propeller.

61
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,330
And he's, is he going to twist the
propellors himself while he's flying?

62
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,480
Exactly. Grabbed my do it with his hands
in this kinda like spin to make it fly.

63
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,020
And so, you know, we have this
rock wall that's about, I dunno,

64
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,240
three feet high. And so he
climbed up on the rock wall

65
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,970
and jumped and he said,
you have retraced back.

66
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,590
Really? He felt it. He felt that.

67
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,120
So all kind of weird.

68
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:02,920
Hi. Hi Blake. Hi. So you felt like, uh,

69
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,290
so where did you jump from?
You jumped from the wall.

70
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,590
Hello? Hello

71
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,560
Blake, are you there? Blake is,
um, he's not a really big talker.

72
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,250
And did you mom know any of this
was happening at this point? Yeah,

73
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,200
I made a movie of it.

74
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,580
So you are aware of his
experiments in flight?

75
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,960
Yeah, well, it's fascinating to watch,
you know, to see how his mind works.

76
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:34,670
He's learning. Like I said, you
know, every time, every iteration,

77
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,980
you learn something from the
weight of one before fail.

78
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:40,650
Whoa.

79
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,830
So that was, um, that was in the evening.

80
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,250
That was like eight o'clock at night
and the next day he's was a Saturday or

81
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:50,850
Sunday and he's fussing
around in the garage. And, um,

82
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,730
my husband and I were in the
kitchen talking about whatever.

83
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:58,731
And Blake comes walking past with his
harness system on and he walks through the

84
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,610
doors to go into the backyard.

85
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,410
Just walks right through, right? There's
something slightly Calvin and Hobbes,

86
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,710
he about this pill for whatever reason,

87
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,870
not arouse our suspicion as
it should have, you know,

88
00:05:13,871 --> 00:05:17,610
I don't know what we were talking
about. And then, you know, two,

89
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,940
three minutes later we hear the cry.

90
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,400
[inaudible]

91
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,040
you know, the kind of cry that's not,

92
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,990
I'm scared or wham hungry. It's
the cry. That means I'm hurt.

93
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,903
Now just to jump in here.

94
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,280
Jennifer Warren's outside to the backyard
where there's this maple tree and she

95
00:05:43,281 --> 00:05:47,090
looks up and she sees her son

96
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,950
weakly entangled in the tree,

97
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:50,821
look to her,

98
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:54,480
like he'd climbed up to the top branch
with the harness of Dumont and then

99
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:59,090
jumped and got twisted and
he was really, really bloody.

100
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,400
He had scraped the whole back of his leg,

101
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,270
this big like foot long gash and
are just like, oh my God. Oh my God.

102
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,820
Just bleeding all down his leg. And,

103
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,930
and how my husband had to like push
him up so that I could untangle the,

104
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,240
like ropey bits of the duct tape harness
system to get him off and pull him

105
00:06:18,241 --> 00:06:20,130
down. So I, you know,

106
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:24,990
carried him through through the kitchen
and put 'em on the couch in the living

107
00:06:24,991 --> 00:06:25,610
room

108
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,760
and she says she tried to turn him over
so she could get a look at the cut.

109
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:30,710
But he kept squirming and
wouldn't let her see it.

110
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,990
And that was the moment it
occurred to me to put on radio lab.

111
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,473
Oh,

112
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,890
capture his imagination. So he buys,

113
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:46,891
still forget that his leg hurt him and
then I could look at it while he was

114
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:47,974
distracted.

115
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,290
What gave you that idea?

116
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,850
I don't know. That iPod was kind of
sitting there and I was like, okay,

117
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,000
I'll put on Radiolab and he can
listen to the bit about parasites.

118
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,320
So when you press go or, or begin on
your, on your iPod, what happened?

119
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:11,250
Oh, he was instantly fascinated. He
listened to the whole entire podcast,

120
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,970
the whole 45 minutes or whatever
it is and yeah, and I was able,

121
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,360
I got his, uh, wound cleaned off to
get a child like that to stop moving,

122
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:24,090
to stop twitching in some degree.
Like you should see him right now.

123
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:27,640
He's sitting here like tapping his
feet and playing with this spork. Um,

124
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:32,070
and you had his attention
from the first moment,

125
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,580
but it goes beyond that.
According to Jennifer,

126
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,040
after she'd been playing him
the show for a few minutes,

127
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:42,000
she paused it just shortly after a
segment we made about a parasitic wasp.

128
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,350
What it does is it flies around
and it looks for a cockroach.

129
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,490
That's the one. And she asked him,
did you understand any of that?

130
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,300
And he repeated it back to me. Yeah.

131
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,560
Almost word for word. Maybe
we should put Blake on. Yeah.

132
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,760
Okay. Let me go get them.
They are ready to talk to you.

133
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,180
Hi.

134
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,200
Hi. So we want to hear like what can
you remember about the radio show?

135
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,340
The one that parishes was um,

136
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,510
the parish wast is flying around.

137
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,210
Then it finds cockroach

138
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,190
that finds that cockroach.

139
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,170
They tumbled back and forth around.

140
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:28,150
Patricia Gwas mentioned this, stab it
in the stomach, right in the belly,

141
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,280
the cockroach, which is for a second.

142
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:35,281
And then it this fault
go and it's stings it.

143
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,500
The Stinger actually
started threads its way

144
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,090
to a particular spot in the brain

145
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:47,090
in a way they can
control the clock colors.

146
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,583
This stands up.

147
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,800
And so now the hall sits by the end,

148
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,740
the cockroaches contento

149
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,480
and start pulling out, down, down,

150
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,010
down, down.

151
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,720
He lays eggs and say the
cockroach. And then the eggs hatch.

152
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,010
You remember the entire story?
Yes. Jennifer too is flabbergasted.

153
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,270
And she says she turned to him
and was like, wow, Blake, what?

154
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,040
Excellent listening comprehension. You
have, you do understand what you hear.

155
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,310
And he said yes,

156
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,990
but I don't understand when
people are talking to me.

157
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:36,010
You mean like he doesn't understand that
when people talk at him or lecture him?

158
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,163
Yeah,

159
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,820
like when I'm in trouble I never
understand what you're talking about.

160
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:49,260
And so I did have the thought that if
only I had the means I could record some

161
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:52,790
of my lectures so that
I could play them back.

162
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,580
You know with the right sound effects,

163
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,460
that's the baby you would have that the
same like it tends to be of listening to

164
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:03,540
what I was trying to say.
Those two mothers everywhere,

165
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,780
mothers across America,

166
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,000
we were paying millions of
dollars for these lectures.

167
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,140
Which brings me to a really quick pitch.

168
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,990
Public radio is all about
making stories stick.

169
00:10:13,991 --> 00:10:17,170
That's what we try and do at radio
lab and all the shows. Try and do,

170
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,840
do you have um, lecturers
off the top of your head?

171
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,880
Because if you give them to us
we could give them back to you.

172
00:10:21,881 --> 00:10:24,250
And in that radio lab five version.

173
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,850
See there, I guess there is, there's
one thing, and this is, you know,

174
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:32,520
this kind of gets at the whole climbing
up into a tree with propellers.

175
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,580
Like you have to think things
all the way through to the end.

176
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,560
Hmm. Jennifer says she said
that to Blake millions of times.

177
00:10:42,561 --> 00:10:44,420
She's not sure if it ever gets through

178
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,880
things through to the end.

179
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,020
So we thought we would try
and give her a new spin on it.

180
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,300
I don't know if this is going to
work, but hey, let's give it a shot.

181
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,270
Here is our, uh, attempt to
make a sticky lecture for Blake.

182
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,930
Have to think things all the way through

183
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,413
[inaudible]

184
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:19,840
thing all the way. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks.

185
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,960
Thanks all the way through.

186
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:25,650
I think saying all the way,

187
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,490
all the way,

188
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,930
like what your mom is saying is that
when you want to have an adventure or

189
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,263
prevent something,

190
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,130
don't just think about the beginning of
it or what you think might happen in the

191
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,430
middle, in your mind. Take
it all the way through.

192
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,950
You know, it's okay to test
your theories. You know,

193
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,100
I encourage experimentation.
The only way you're

194
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,780
going to learn is if you fail.

195
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,740
She's not just saying that. I mean,
Take Thomas Edison, the king inventor,

196
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,580
he tried to invent a battery
and he failed 10,000 times,

197
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,880
but he needed to think about,

198
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,880
so you have to kind of consider
what kind of the best outcome,

199
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,190
the worst outcome, and imagine that
both of those things have happened.

200
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,440
Like imagine the scenario in
your mind and what you include.

201
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,700
Okay, let's do that. Scenario one,
you're in the tree, this is the good one.

202
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,400
And you see

203
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,300
being on the blade round, round,

204
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,540
round and round and round
and round and round in.

205
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,953
It works.

206
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,230
You're, you're flying all
through the neighborhood.

207
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,210
So here's the question. You've
got to answer. What happens next?

208
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:48,370
What he hasn't thought is, for
example, how is he going to land?

209
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,790
Hmm. So you gotta take it all the
way through to the landing part.

210
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:55,870
Now let's play out the other scenario.
The one where things don't go well.

211
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:01,550
Let's say you jump out of the tree and
you crash and you really hurt yourself.

212
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,300
Well think of how sad your
mom would be and your dad

213
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:08,943
and your sister

214
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:16,010
cases where you make up a little movie
in your head and you play it all the way

215
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:19,460
through and hopefully the good
one will happen, the best outcome.

216
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,310
But just in case you'll now be prepared

217
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,480
so that you can mitigate
the effects. Worst outcome.

218
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,030
And I probably wouldn't
say mitigate to my child,

219
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,190
so we're going to do something with
this lecture and send it to you.

220
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:33,610
Uh Huh.

221
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,560
No, seriously. Well thanks you
guys. I'll talk to you. Yes.

222
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,920
And we have no absolutely no connection
to any kind of further experimentation

223
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:48,931
of this kind of love yourself
and responsibility on his own.

224
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,590
Okay. Alright. Bye. Bye.
Bye. Bye. Right, bye.

225
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,973
[inaudible]

226
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,630
no, I don't exactly know what to say here,

227
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,300
but there is something about this story
that just kind of like gets to the whole

228
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,370
point of why we do this. Yeah.

229
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,160
And here you've got this kid
who's obviously in a lot of pain,

230
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,090
and he just sits still and listens
to a story about parasites.

231
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,900
You know what we're trying to do
here is tell stories that move you.
