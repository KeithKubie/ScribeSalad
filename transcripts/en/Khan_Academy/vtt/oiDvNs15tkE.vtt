00:00:00.626 --> 00:00:02.781
In the last video, we took a stab at

00:00:02.781 --> 00:00:05.572
modeling population as a function of time.

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:07.153
And we said, okay, well
maybe the rate of change

00:00:07.153 --> 00:00:09.114
of population with respect to time

00:00:09.114 --> 00:00:10.649
is going to be proportional to

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:11.885
the population itself.

00:00:11.915 --> 00:00:13.573
That the rate will increase

00:00:13.573 --> 00:00:15.526
as the population increases.

00:00:15.743 --> 00:00:17.471
And when you actually try to solve

00:00:17.471 --> 00:00:18.704
this differential equation,

00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:20.931
you try to find an N of
T that satisfies this,

00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:22.902
we found that an exponential would work.

00:00:22.902 --> 00:00:25.858
An exponential satisfies
this differential equation.

00:00:25.913 --> 00:00:27.577
And it would look like this visually.

00:00:27.912 --> 00:00:30.503
It would look like this,

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:32.450
it would look like this visually.

00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:33.987
Where you're starting at
a population of N not,

00:00:34.392 --> 00:00:35.981
this is the time axis,

00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:37.402
this is the population axis.

00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:38.708
And as time increases,

00:00:39.113 --> 00:00:41.122
population increases exponentially.

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:43.182
Now we said there's an issue there.

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:45.430
What if Thomas Malthus is right?

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:47.542
That the environment can't support...

00:00:48.041 --> 00:00:49.305
let's say that the
environment can't support...

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:50.815
let me do this in a new color.

00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:53.118
Let's say that the environment
really can't support

00:00:53.118 --> 00:00:58.118
more than K, more than a population of K.

00:01:02.252 --> 00:01:04.263
Then clearly the population can't just

00:01:04.372 --> 00:01:06.676
go and go right through the ceiling.

00:01:06.676 --> 00:01:07.882
They're not going to be able to have food,

00:01:07.882 --> 00:01:10.941
or water or resources
or whatever it might be.

00:01:11.472 --> 00:01:12.323
They might generate too much pollution.

00:01:12.323 --> 00:01:13.278
Who knows what it might be.

00:01:13.278 --> 00:01:18.147
And so this first stab
at modeling population

00:01:18.147 --> 00:01:19.445
doesn't quite do the trick.

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:23.690
Especially if you are
kind of in Malthus's camp.

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:24.135
And that's where PF, and once again

00:01:24.756 --> 00:01:26.522
I'm sure I'm mispronouncing the name,

00:01:26.638 --> 00:01:29.354
Verhulst is going to
come into the picture.

00:01:29.354 --> 00:01:30.680
Because he read Malthus's work,

00:01:30.068 --> 00:01:32.313
and said, "Well yeah, I think
I can do a pretty good job

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:35.197
"of modeling the type of behavior

00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:37.116
"that Malthus is talking about."

00:01:37.362 --> 00:01:39.763
And he says what we really want

00:01:41.104 --> 00:01:43.288
is something...

00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:44.755
Let me write it, so the rate...

00:01:44.922 --> 00:01:45.805
let's try to model.

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:47.444
Let's set up another
differential equation.

00:01:50.975 --> 00:01:52.800
And now let's say okay,

00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:57.008
instead of, if N is substantially smaller

00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:00.296
than what the environment
can support, then yeah,

00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:02.767
that makes sense to
have exponential growth.

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.479
But maybe we can dampen this,

00:02:09.513 --> 00:02:11.576
or maybe we can bring this growth to zero

00:02:11.576 --> 00:02:15.652
as N approaches K.

00:02:16.163 --> 00:02:18.940
And so how can we actually modify this?

00:02:18.094 --> 00:02:19.589
Maybe we can multiply it by something

00:02:20.635 --> 00:02:23.636
that for when N is small,

00:02:23.665 --> 00:02:25.693
when N is much smaller than K,

00:02:25.892 --> 00:02:28.407
this term right over here
is going to be close to one

00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:30.396
and when N is close to K,

00:02:30.396 --> 00:02:32.292
this term is close to zero.

00:02:32.292 --> 00:02:33.139
So let me write that.

00:02:34.221 --> 00:02:38.304
So these are our goals for
this term, right over here.

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.349
When N is much smaller than K,

00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:52.541
so now the population is
not constrained at all,

00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:54.275
people can have babies

00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:55.441
and those babies can be fed

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.474
and then they can have
babies, et cetera, et cetera,

00:02:57.078 --> 00:03:02.078
then this thing should be close to one.

00:03:02.914 --> 00:03:05.220
And so then you have
essentially our old model.

00:03:05.221 --> 00:03:06.930
But then as N approaches K,

00:03:10.713 --> 00:03:14.180
then this thing should approach,

00:03:14.426 --> 00:03:17.744
then this term or this expression

00:03:17.744 --> 00:03:19.438
should approach zero.

00:03:19.487 --> 00:03:21.219
And what that does is as N approaches

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:25.651
the natural limit, the
ceiling to population,

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:27.546
then no matter what this is doing,

00:03:27.546 --> 00:03:28.911
if this thing is approaching zero,

00:03:28.911 --> 00:03:30.765
that's going to make the actual

00:03:30.765 --> 00:03:33.200
rate of growth approach zero.

00:03:33.002 --> 00:03:35.363
So food is going to be more scarce,

00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:37.234
it's going to be harder to find things.

00:03:37.665 --> 00:03:40.670
And so what can I construct here,

00:03:40.067 --> 00:03:41.776
dealing with N and K that
will have these properties?

00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:44.970
And for fun, you might actually want to

00:03:44.097 --> 00:03:44.986
pause the video and see
if you can construct

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.194
a fairly simple algebraic statement

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:50.706
using N and K and maybe the number one

00:03:50.706 --> 00:03:52.215
if you find the need,

00:03:52.783 --> 00:03:55.500
for an expression that
has these properties.

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:57.715
Well, let's see.

00:03:57.715 --> 00:03:58.786
What if we start with a one

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:05.434
and we subtract N over K?

00:04:13.066 --> 00:04:14.649
Does this have those properties?

00:04:15.945 --> 00:04:16.961
Well yeah, sure it does.

00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:19.387
When N is really small, or I should say

00:04:19.387 --> 00:04:21.897
when it's a small fraction of K,

00:04:23.543 --> 00:04:24.644
this is going to be a small fraction,

00:04:24.644 --> 00:04:25.941
then this whole thing is going to be

00:04:25.941 --> 00:04:27.400
pretty close to one.

00:04:27.004 --> 00:04:28.933
It's going to be a
little bit less than one.

00:04:29.544 --> 00:04:30.958
And when N approaches K,

00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:33.247
as N gets closer and
closer and closer to K,

00:04:33.682 --> 00:04:34.774
then this thing right over here

00:04:35.602 --> 00:04:37.274
is going to approach one,

00:04:37.274 --> 00:04:38.587
which means this whole expression

00:04:38.587 --> 00:04:39.875
is going to approach zero.

00:04:39.875 --> 00:04:42.720
Which is exactly what we wanted.

00:04:42.072 --> 00:04:44.178
And this thing right
over here is actually,

00:04:44.968 --> 00:04:47.536
and this is used in tons of applications,

00:04:47.536 --> 00:04:50.582
not just in population modeling

00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:53.641
but that's kind of one of its first

00:04:53.641 --> 00:04:55.960
reasons or motivations.

00:04:56.186 --> 00:04:57.261
This differential equation right over here

00:04:57.936 --> 00:04:59.135
is actually quite famous.

00:04:59.359 --> 00:05:02.450
It's called the logistic
differential equation.

00:05:13.346 --> 00:05:14.169
And in the next video,

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.198
we're actually going to solve this.

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.360
And it's actually, this is a separable

00:05:17.036 --> 00:05:17.978
differential equation.

00:05:18.302 --> 00:05:19.365
You can actually solve it just using

00:05:19.932 --> 00:05:21.540
standard techniques of integration.

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:22.358
it's a little bit hairier than this one,

00:05:22.844 --> 00:05:24.498
so we're going to work
through it together.

00:05:24.498 --> 00:05:25.823
And we're going to look at the solution.

00:05:25.823 --> 00:05:28.768
The solution to the logistic
differential equation

00:05:28.768 --> 00:05:33.752
is the logistic function, which once again

00:05:33.752 --> 00:05:37.330
essentially models population in this way.

00:05:37.033 --> 00:05:39.209
But before we actually solve for it,

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:41.320
let's just try to interpret this

00:05:41.032 --> 00:05:43.239
differential equation and think about

00:05:43.527 --> 00:05:46.123
what the shape of this
function might look like.

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:47.602
And to do that,

00:05:52.723 --> 00:05:56.811
let me draw some axes here.

00:05:58.069 --> 00:05:59.323
Let me draw some axes here.

00:05:59.944 --> 00:06:01.508
So that's my time axis,

00:06:01.508 --> 00:06:03.201
that's my population axis,

00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:05.340
let me scroll up a little
bit because sometimes

00:06:05.034 --> 00:06:06.131
the subtitles show up around here

00:06:07.031 --> 00:06:08.552
and then people can't see what's going on.

00:06:09.454 --> 00:06:11.126
So let's think about a
couple of permutations,

00:06:11.126 --> 00:06:12.750
a couple situations.

00:06:12.075 --> 00:06:16.583
So if our initial, if our
N at time equals zero,

00:06:18.097 --> 00:06:18.738
remember N is a function of T.

00:06:19.648 --> 00:06:22.580
If at time equals zero N is equal to zero,

00:06:24.178 --> 00:06:25.231
then this term is going to be zero

00:06:25.708 --> 00:06:27.917
and then your rate of
change is going to be zero,

00:06:27.917 --> 00:06:29.988
and so you're not going
to add any population.

00:06:30.244 --> 00:06:31.128
And that's good.

00:06:31.554 --> 00:06:33.318
Because if your population is zero,

00:06:33.318 --> 00:06:34.703
how are you going to actually be able

00:06:34.703 --> 00:06:35.666
to add population?

00:06:35.666 --> 00:06:37.755
There's no one there to have children.

00:06:37.884 --> 00:06:40.326
So there's actually one constant solution

00:06:40.326 --> 00:06:42.487
to this differential equation,

00:06:44.648 --> 00:06:46.810
which is just N of T is equal to zero.

00:06:46.081 --> 00:06:49.057
And this satisfies the
logistic differential equation.

00:06:49.008 --> 00:06:50.903
Hey, if your population starts at zero

00:06:51.695 --> 00:06:53.843
if N sub not is zero,

00:06:53.934 --> 00:06:55.441
then you're just going
to be at zero forever.

00:06:55.441 --> 00:06:57.954
Well that's actually what
would happen in real life

00:06:57.954 --> 00:06:59.680
if there's no one there to have kids.

00:07:00.018 --> 00:07:01.097
Now let's think about another situation.

00:07:01.097 --> 00:07:02.081
What if our population,

00:07:02.954 --> 00:07:04.939
what if N not is equal to K?

00:07:05.904 --> 00:07:07.953
What happens if N not is equal to,

00:07:11.489 --> 00:07:12.685
so that's K right over there,

00:07:12.685 --> 00:07:14.788
what happens if at time equals zero,

00:07:15.182 --> 00:07:16.706
this is our population.

00:07:16.706 --> 00:07:18.640
Well if N is equal to K,

00:07:18.064 --> 00:07:19.077
then this is one minus one,

00:07:19.653 --> 00:07:20.665
then this thing is zero,

00:07:20.665 --> 00:07:21.833
and so our rate of population change

00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:22.835
is going to be zero.

00:07:23.223 --> 00:07:24.904
So essentially if my population is zero

00:07:24.904 --> 00:07:25.926
then after a little bit of time,

00:07:25.926 --> 00:07:27.342
my population is still the same K.

00:07:27.623 --> 00:07:29.867
If my rate of change
of population is zero,

00:07:29.867 --> 00:07:31.950
that means my population
is staying constant.

00:07:32.352 --> 00:07:34.390
And so my population's just going

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:35.498
to stay there at K.

00:07:36.084 --> 00:07:36.578
And that's actually believable.

00:07:37.334 --> 00:07:38.687
Malthus would actually probably say

00:07:38.687 --> 00:07:40.311
that you're gonna have, maybe it grows

00:07:40.311 --> 00:07:43.674
a little bit beyond the
capacity of the environment

00:07:43.674 --> 00:07:46.577
and then you have some flood,

00:07:46.577 --> 00:07:48.406
or some hurricane or some famine

00:07:48.406 --> 00:07:49.408
and it goes around.

00:07:49.534 --> 00:07:51.716
But for our purposes, you can never model

00:07:51.716 --> 00:07:52.758
anything perfectly.

00:07:52.948 --> 00:07:55.116
For our purposes, that's pretty good.

00:07:55.116 --> 00:07:57.110
You're at the limit of what the

00:07:57.011 --> 00:07:59.016
environment can handle,

00:07:59.115 --> 00:08:01.650
so you just kind of stay there.

00:08:01.065 --> 00:08:02.320
That's actually another constant solution.

00:08:02.905 --> 00:08:05.147
that N of T, if it starts,

00:08:05.147 --> 00:08:06.769
and now you can kind of appreciate

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:08.378
why initial conditions are important.

00:08:08.378 --> 00:08:09.530
If you start at zero you're
going to stay at zero,

00:08:09.053 --> 00:08:10.107
if you start at K you're
going to stay at K.

00:08:11.345 --> 00:08:13.947
So that is N of T just stays K.

00:08:14.694 --> 00:08:16.780
But now let's think of a
more interesting scenario.

00:08:17.253 --> 00:08:20.089
Let's assume an initial population

00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:22.492
that's someplace between zero and K.

00:08:22.492 --> 00:08:24.095
So this is going to be...

00:08:25.484 --> 00:08:26.575
I'm going to assume initial population

00:08:27.052 --> 00:08:30.958
that is someplace, it's greater than zero,

00:08:31.605 --> 00:08:34.030
so there are people to
actually have children,

00:08:34.025 --> 00:08:35.583
and it is less than K,

00:08:35.808 --> 00:08:38.823
so we aren't fully maxing
out the environment.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:40.885
Or the land or the food or the water

00:08:40.885 --> 00:08:41.874
or whatever it might be.

00:08:41.874 --> 00:08:43.138
So what's going to happen?

00:08:43.462 --> 00:08:44.535
So, and once again, I'm just going to

00:08:44.535 --> 00:08:45.636
kind of sketch it,

00:08:45.636 --> 00:08:47.595
and then we're going to
solve it in the next video.

00:08:48.215 --> 00:08:50.071
So when N is a lot less than K,

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:51.128
it's a small fraction of K,

00:08:53.548 --> 00:08:54.589
this term is going to be the main one

00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.427
that's influencing it.

00:08:56.427 --> 00:08:58.425
Because this is a small fraction of K,

00:08:58.425 --> 00:08:59.363
I mean even the way I drew it,

00:08:59.363 --> 00:09:02.441
it looks like it's about
a sixth or a seventh

00:09:03.143 --> 00:09:04.186
or an eighth of K,

00:09:04.501 --> 00:09:06.279
so it's one minus 1/8.

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:11.163
So it's gonna be 7/8 times this.

00:09:11.335 --> 00:09:14.883
So really, this is what's going to dictate

00:09:16.067 --> 00:09:17.125
what our rate of growth is.

00:09:17.417 --> 00:09:18.852
And if this is kind of dictating it,

00:09:18.852 --> 00:09:20.929
we're kind of looking more of a...

00:09:21.145 --> 00:09:22.532
well, let's just think of it this way.

00:09:22.582 --> 00:09:23.691
As the population grows,

00:09:23.691 --> 00:09:27.172
the rate of change is going to grow.

00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:32.484
So it's going to look something like this.

00:09:33.004 --> 00:09:34.076
As our population gets larger,

00:09:35.012 --> 00:09:37.101
our slope is getting higher.

00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:38.724
It's getting steeper and steeper.

00:09:39.153 --> 00:09:41.041
But then as N approaches K,

00:09:41.246 --> 00:09:42.951
then this thing is gonna become,

00:09:42.989 --> 00:09:44.698
this is gonna be close to one minus...

00:09:44.698 --> 00:09:46.099
close to one.

00:09:46.099 --> 00:09:48.118
And so this is going to
become a very small number,

00:09:48.118 --> 00:09:50.204
it's going to make this
whole thing approach zero.

00:09:50.646 --> 00:09:52.162
So as N approaches K,

00:09:52.771 --> 00:09:54.548
the whole thing, the rate of change

00:09:54.548 --> 00:09:57.029
is going to flatten out.

00:09:57.459 --> 00:09:59.440
And we're gonna asymptote towards K.

00:09:59.858 --> 00:10:03.441
And so the solution to the

00:10:03.441 --> 00:10:05.493
logistic differential equation

00:10:05.961 --> 00:10:07.874
should look something like this.

00:10:07.874 --> 00:10:09.679
Depending on what your
initial conditions are.

00:10:09.679 --> 00:10:10.756
If your initial condition is here,

00:10:10.756 --> 00:10:12.091
maybe it does something like this.

00:10:12.091 --> 00:10:13.415
If your initial condition's here,

00:10:13.415 --> 00:10:16.393
maybe it does something like this.

00:10:16.393 --> 00:10:17.559
And once again, this is what's fun

00:10:17.559 --> 00:10:18.361
about doing differential equations.

00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:19.964
Before even doing the fancy math,

00:10:19.964 --> 00:10:21.221
you can kind of get an intuition,

00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:22.987
just by thinking through
the differential equation

00:10:22.987 --> 00:10:26.325
of what it is likely to be.

00:10:26.438 --> 00:10:30.449
Down here, or when N
is much smaller than K

00:10:30.072 --> 00:10:32.056
its rate of increase is increasing

00:10:32.704 --> 00:10:34.106
as N increases,

00:10:34.148 --> 00:10:35.224
and over here as N gets close to K,

00:10:35.908 --> 00:10:38.996
its rate of increase is decreasing.

00:10:39.351 --> 00:10:40.458
Now let's actually in the next video,

00:10:40.458 --> 00:10:43.526
actually solve for what
N, a solution to this

00:10:44.138 --> 00:10:47.129
and see if that confirms
what our intuition is.
