00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.600
The mostly fluid pattern,

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.400
is very similar to column drop, but
it tends to be a bit more grid like.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.780
With more columns and

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.480
columns fitting in different ways,
depending on the viewport width.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.720
Just like column drop at its narrowest
viewport, the layout is stacked but

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.300
as the layout gets wider,
the grid pattern starts to appear.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.000
And eventually, once the layout
hits its widest viewport,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.990
margins are added on the left and
right, instead of expanding things out.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.400
I've made this one a bit more complexed,
with a few additional divs.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.660
Just like column drop,
I'm using flexbox and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.660
setting the width of each element to
100% at their narrowest viewport.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.635
At the first breakpoint, I'll make
the light blue div and the green div,

00:00:44.635 --> 00:00:46.420
50% width.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.224
Just like before,
I'll add a min-width query, to check for

00:00:50.224 --> 00:00:52.700
a min-width of 450 pixels.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.220
If that's the case, I'll make
the light blue and green 50% width.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.070
I want another breakpoint at 550 pixels.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.000
I'll add the media query, and

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.400
set the appropriate widths
on the right elements.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.010
And finally a lot of breakpoint
that adds margins to the side,

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.560
when the viewport is beyond 700 pixels.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.650
Let's take a look at it in the browser.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.120
Everything is stacked as I
expect at below 450 pixels.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.510
And as I expand up,
I get a switch and 450.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.980
I'll get a switch again at 550 pixels.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.400
And above 700 pixels, I'll start
getting margins added to the side.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.650
That's exactly what I wanted.
