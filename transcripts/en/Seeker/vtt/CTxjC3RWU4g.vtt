This episode of DNews is brought to you buy
LG G3

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.620
Researchers have found a way to make glass
tubes a tenth the thickness of your hair send

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.900
cat videos around the world.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.900
Better.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.219
They found a way to do all that but better.

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.099
HI!

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:18.640
Julian here for DNews.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.100
Your smartphone is super cool, you’ve got
all the DNews you could possibly want, anywhere.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.669
But you’re not really totally wireless.

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.000
You’re within a few miles of a cell phone
tower, but the tower may be hundreds of miles

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.950
from the servers where all that juicy knowledge
is stored.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.810
So how do you connect the two?

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.950
Why with laser beams, of course!

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.080
Let’s begin at the beginning, which is all
the way back in the 1840’s when Swiss Physicist

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.660
Daniel Colladon noticed he could shine a light
in one end of a water pipe and it would come

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.660
out the other side.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.020
170 years later, modern optic fibers are basically
the same thing, but they use optically pure

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.830
glass and are 9 thousandths of a millimeter
thick instead.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.910
You may be wondering, how does light travel
inside water or glass without just bouncing

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.070
out and being lost?

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.910
The answer is it all has to do with the angle
the light is shone in.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.990
If the light is hitting the walls of the glass
at a shallow angle, less than 42 degrees,

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.350
it’ll experience total internal reflection
and bounce back and forth down the glass.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.830
This property of light is the same reason
you can look out over a lake and see a beautiful

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.940
reflection, but when you look straight down
you can see into the water.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.750
To make sure none of that light does leak
out, the optical glass is encased in a cladding

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.110
with a higher refraction index that can bend
light back into the glass, then that’s put

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.290
in a buffer coating.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.230
Each one of these fibers can carry the equivalent
data of 10 million phone calls, and hundreds

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.850
of thousands are bundled together and stuffed
in a jacket to make a fiber optic cable.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.450
Because of them you can send a beam of light
to the other side of the planet in a seventh

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.480
of a second.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.530
Being able to shoot light through a glass
tube to China is all well and good, but you

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.229
still need a way to send information, and
that’s where modulation comes in.

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.340
Modulation is when you vary some property
of a wave to encode information.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.200
Then when it gets to the destination, it’s
demodulated to separate the carrier from the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.200
message.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.270
You’ve been dealing with it a lot and you
might not even know it.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.619
FM radio uses frequency modulation, which
is when a wave’s length is altered.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.260
AM is when a wave’s Amplitude is changed.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.769
and the Modem in your house is short for Modulator
Demodulator.

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.189
In fiber optics there are a lot of ways to
modulate the beam and send information.

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:20.810
There’s AM, Sine wave FM, Square wave FM,
pulse frequency modulation, which is basically

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.841
turning the beam on and off so it can be interpreted
as ones and zeroes.

00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:30.370
All of these methods need costly external
modulators, which are costly and inefficient.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.000
But Dr. Radan Slavik, who is a research fellow
at the Optoelectronic Research Centre and

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.650
probable Jame Bond nemesis, has improved another
method.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.409
They’ve devised a way of adjusting the current
of the laser beams so they can have better

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.790
control of the optical field and send more
information.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.989
Actually the words Dr. Radan Slavik used were,
“Exquisite control… over the optical field

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.329
generated directly from a current-modulated
semiconductor laser.”

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.409
Tell me he’s not a Bond villain!

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.579
There was another awesome breakthrough in
sending wireless signals a few months ago.

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.840
I talk about that and a bit more about Fiber
Optics over here.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.549
If you know of some interesting tech in the
pipeline and want us to cover it, let us know

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:14.980
in the comments and I’ll see you next time
on DNews.
