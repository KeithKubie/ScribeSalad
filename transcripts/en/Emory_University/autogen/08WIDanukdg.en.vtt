00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.900
Emory campus I remember having a teacher
father BOE's Nicky who he was polish and

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:51.910
father BOE's Nicky who he was polish and
 

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.060
father BOE's Nicky who he was polish and
had just come to America and at that

00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:54.070
had just come to America and at that
 

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.750
had just come to America and at that
time he was probably fifty years old and

00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760
time he was probably fifty years old and
 

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:00.320
time he was probably fifty years old and
in this metaphysics course he

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:00.330
in this metaphysics course he
 

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.120
in this metaphysics course he
essentially said that God did not exist

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:03.130
essentially said that God did not exist
 

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:07.140
essentially said that God did not exist
and so it created a lot of thought and I

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:07.150
and so it created a lot of thought and I
 

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.940
and so it created a lot of thought and I
think it from his perspective he had

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:08.950
think it from his perspective he had
 

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:10.850
think it from his perspective he had
come from Europe and he had seen

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:10.860
come from Europe and he had seen
 

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.950
come from Europe and he had seen
unimaginable destruction and he was

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:13.960
unimaginable destruction and he was
 

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.350
unimaginable destruction and he was
trying to to reconcile his faith and

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:16.360
trying to to reconcile his faith and
 

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.200
trying to to reconcile his faith and
going through his own crisis in the

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:19.210
going through his own crisis in the
 

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.090
going through his own crisis in the
classroom maybe was a way for him to

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:21.100
classroom maybe was a way for him to
 

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.400
classroom maybe was a way for him to
vent that but for the younger for the

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:23.410
vent that but for the younger for the
 

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:27.080
vent that but for the younger for the
students it was a thought-provoking

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:27.090
students it was a thought-provoking
 

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.270
students it was a thought-provoking
process to have a priest tell you that

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:30.280
process to have a priest tell you that
 

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.680
process to have a priest tell you that
there was no God and why and

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:34.690
there was no God and why and
 

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.260
there was no God and why and

this so I remember when I was very young
 

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.810
this so I remember when I was very young
he the first memory I have of pyramids

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:57.820
he the first memory I have of pyramids
 

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.970
he the first memory I have of pyramids
was when he was telling us about how

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:00.980
was when he was telling us about how
 

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.800
was when he was telling us about how
pyramids were built and the problem of

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:02.810
pyramids were built and the problem of
 

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.300
pyramids were built and the problem of
having these huge stones and how do you

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:04.310
having these huge stones and how do you
 

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:07.300
having these huge stones and how do you
cut him and move them and and how that

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:07.310
cut him and move them and and how that
 

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.790
cut him and move them and and how that
might have been done and he said well

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:09.800
might have been done and he said well
 

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.890
might have been done and he said well
how do you think they got the base level

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:11.900
how do you think they got the base level
 

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.720
how do you think they got the base level
to build a big pyramid because they

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:13.730
to build a big pyramid because they
 

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:15.160
to build a big pyramid because they
couldn't start with an unlevel base

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:15.170
couldn't start with an unlevel base
 

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:19.270
couldn't start with an unlevel base
because it would tilt and of course he

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:19.280
because it would tilt and of course he
 

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.340
because it would tilt and of course he
knew the answer and he eventually told

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:21.350
knew the answer and he eventually told
 

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.320
knew the answer and he eventually told
us but he would make us think through

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:23.330
us but he would make us think through
 

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:25.810
us but he would make us think through
well how could you do that which was

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:25.820
well how could you do that which was
 

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.470
well how could you do that which was
pretty much beyond us a small child and

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480
pretty much beyond us a small child and
 

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:31.060
pretty much beyond us a small child and
the answer was you dig a big trench and

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:31.070
the answer was you dig a big trench and
 

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.320
the answer was you dig a big trench and
then you put water in there and you

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:32.330
then you put water in there and you
 

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:33.940
then you put water in there and you
measure it then you start with your

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:33.950
measure it then you start with your
 

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:36.550
measure it then you start with your
level base but he was fascinated with

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560
level base but he was fascinated with
 

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:40.120
level base but he was fascinated with
things like that and how how there was

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:40.130
things like that and how how there was
 

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.910
things like that and how how there was
an alignment with us astronomy and so

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:42.920
an alignment with us astronomy and so
 

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.430
an alignment with us astronomy and so
forth and that caught my attention it

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440
forth and that caught my attention it
 

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:47.440
forth and that caught my attention it
allowed my intent of my imagination I

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:47.450
allowed my intent of my imagination I
 

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:50.250
allowed my intent of my imagination I
think to to wander when I was young so

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:50.260
think to to wander when I was young so
 

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.170
think to to wander when I was young so
given that basis which sounds like very

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:53.180
given that basis which sounds like very
 

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.650
given that basis which sounds like very
imaginative and also mythic and then the

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:56.660
imaginative and also mythic and then the
 

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.320
imaginative and also mythic and then the
questions that were raised and your

00:12:59.320 --> 00:12:59.330
questions that were raised and your
 

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.870
questions that were raised and your
youth by by your teachers by the priests

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:01.880
youth by by your teachers by the priests

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:22.460
so I really arranged the text I didn't
 

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.909
so I really arranged the text I didn't
write it I only had to make some slight

00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:24.919
write it I only had to make some slight
 

00:18:24.919 --> 00:18:28.049
write it I only had to make some slight
alterations to have some grammatical

00:18:28.049 --> 00:18:28.059
alterations to have some grammatical
 

00:18:28.059 --> 00:18:33.070
alterations to have some grammatical
consistency in a few spots I wouldn't

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:33.080
consistency in a few spots I wouldn't
 

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.430
consistency in a few spots I wouldn't
claim to know Egyptian right it's just

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:36.440
claim to know Egyptian right it's just
 

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.379
claim to know Egyptian right it's just
that I kept looking at the text and

00:18:38.379 --> 00:18:38.389
that I kept looking at the text and
 

00:18:38.389 --> 00:18:41.200
that I kept looking at the text and
looking at it until it started there was

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:41.210
looking at it until it started there was
 

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.230
looking at it until it started there was
a coherence that that made sense I would

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240
a coherence that that made sense I would
 

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.509
a coherence that that made sense I would
spend hours like looking for the word he

00:18:46.509 --> 00:18:46.519
spend hours like looking for the word he
 

00:18:46.519 --> 00:18:47.669
spend hours like looking for the word he
or

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679
or
 

00:18:47.679 --> 00:18:50.830
or
hours looking for another word and then

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:50.840
hours looking for another word and then
 

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.830
hours looking for another word and then
I over a long time I put it together I

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840
I over a long time I put it together I
 

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.289
I over a long time I put it together I
think there were about 25 edits like a

00:18:56.289 --> 00:18:56.299
think there were about 25 edits like a
 

00:18:56.299 --> 00:18:59.860
think there were about 25 edits like a
panel yeah to get it to the point where

00:18:59.860 --> 00:18:59.870
panel yeah to get it to the point where
 

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:02.860
panel yeah to get it to the point where
it is at this point and then how did you

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:02.870
it is at this point and then how did you
 

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:06.070
it is at this point and then how did you
connect the the ideas that you had and

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080
connect the the ideas that you had and
 

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.990
connect the the ideas that you had and
the the stories the narrative and the

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000
the the stories the narrative and the
 

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.980
the the stories the narrative and the
ideas to the actual music what was that

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:11.990
ideas to the actual music what was that
 

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.110
ideas to the actual music what was that
what was the connecting point so you so

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.120
what was the connecting point so you so
 

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.389
what was the connecting point so you so
you could you could imagine it you could

00:19:16.389 --> 00:19:16.399
you could you could imagine it you could
 

00:19:16.399 --> 00:19:18.490
you could you could imagine it you could
hear it you could feel it what how does

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:18.500
hear it you could feel it what how does
 

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:22.570
hear it you could feel it what how does
that magical composition occur because

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:22.580
that magical composition occur because
 

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.399
that magical composition occur because
you've got a concept but it becomes

00:19:24.399 --> 00:19:24.409
you've got a concept but it becomes
 

00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:27.070
you've got a concept but it becomes
embodied I think it's the oral

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.080
embodied I think it's the oral
 

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:30.159
embodied I think it's the oral
imagination where say if a composer is

00:19:30.159 --> 00:19:30.169
imagination where say if a composer is
 

00:19:30.169 --> 00:19:33.909
imagination where say if a composer is
given a visual or a story or something

00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919
given a visual or a story or something
 

00:19:33.919 --> 00:19:36.899
given a visual or a story or something
like that it's pretty natural to start

00:19:36.899 --> 00:19:36.909
like that it's pretty natural to start
 

00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:40.720
like that it's pretty natural to start
ascribing sound to this you know the

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:40.730
ascribing sound to this you know the
 

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:44.049
ascribing sound to this you know the
dramatic underlying sound of what

00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:44.059
dramatic underlying sound of what
 

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:47.919
dramatic underlying sound of what
happens and so going back to this idea

00:19:47.919 --> 00:19:47.929
happens and so going back to this idea
 

00:19:47.929 --> 00:19:49.509
happens and so going back to this idea
how the pyramids were built I was

00:19:49.509 --> 00:19:49.519
how the pyramids were built I was
 

00:19:49.519 --> 00:19:51.129
how the pyramids were built I was
thinking well what would it have been

00:19:51.129 --> 00:19:51.139
thinking well what would it have been
 

00:19:51.139 --> 00:19:54.279
thinking well what would it have been
like the music what would it have been

00:19:54.279 --> 00:19:54.289
like the music what would it have been
 

00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:56.840
like the music what would it have been
like at that time so we know

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:56.850
like at that time so we know
 

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:59.960
like at that time so we know
from descriptions that what some of the

00:19:59.960 --> 00:19:59.970
from descriptions that what some of the
 

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:01.930
from descriptions that what some of the
instruments were and how they were used

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:01.940
instruments were and how they were used
 

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.850
instruments were and how they were used
we know that they they had ritual music

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:04.860
we know that they they had ritual music
 

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.760
we know that they they had ritual music
in temples and in pyramids these are

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:07.770
in temples and in pyramids these are
 

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:11.120
in temples and in pyramids these are
young voices like 18 25 years old they

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:11.130
young voices like 18 25 years old they
 

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:12.860
young voices like 18 25 years old they
didn't live very long so the voices

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:12.870
didn't live very long so the voices
 

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:14.240
didn't live very long so the voices
would have had a certain quality and

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:14.250
would have had a certain quality and
 

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:18.580
would have had a certain quality and
they sang sometimes solo or in groups

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:18.590
they sang sometimes solo or in groups
 

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:21.140
they sang sometimes solo or in groups
there would be ambient sound in these

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:21.150
there would be ambient sound in these
 

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.390
there would be ambient sound in these
large spaces so you would get some echo

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400
large spaces so you would get some echo
 

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.340
large spaces so you would get some echo
and some kind of ambient acoustic sound

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:27.350
and some kind of ambient acoustic sound
 

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:30.680
and some kind of ambient acoustic sound
and also they did processions so you can

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:30.690
and also they did processions so you can
 

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:33.950
and also they did processions so you can
imagine some things would be in too but

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960
imagine some things would be in too but
 

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.480
imagine some things would be in too but
also there are descriptions one early

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:38.490
also there are descriptions one early
 

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:42.260
also there are descriptions one early
one is from Herodotus from I think the

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:42.270
one is from Herodotus from I think the
 

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.550
one is from Herodotus from I think the
4th century BCE where he talks about

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:45.560
4th century BCE where he talks about
 

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.890
4th century BCE where he talks about
Egyptian music and how it has its own

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:48.900
Egyptian music and how it has its own
 

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:50.930
Egyptian music and how it has its own
kind of music but you can find similar

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:50.940
kind of music but you can find similar
 

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.940
kind of music but you can find similar
music in Syria at the time and then

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:52.950
music in Syria at the time and then
 

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:56.260
music in Syria at the time and then
later in Greece and he describes a

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:56.270
later in Greece and he describes a
 

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:58.490
later in Greece and he describes a
procession where the system which is a

00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:58.500
procession where the system which is a
 

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:02.000
procession where the system which is a
little metallic instrument could be put

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:02.010
little metallic instrument could be put
 

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:06.110
little metallic instrument could be put
in Iraq and they would play that and it

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120
in Iraq and they would play that and it
 

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.840
in Iraq and they would play that and it
would he says would imitate the sound of

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:08.850
would he says would imitate the sound of
 

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:14.030
would he says would imitate the sound of
papyrus leaves also he says that the

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:14.040
papyrus leaves also he says that the
 

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:16.160
papyrus leaves also he says that the
music is similar to what was found in

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:16.170
music is similar to what was found in
 

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:19.130
music is similar to what was found in
Greece a little bit later and also

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:19.140
Greece a little bit later and also
 

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:29.000
Greece a little bit later and also
there's a Roman writer who's how puniest

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:29.010
there's a Roman writer who's how puniest
 

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:31.700
there's a Roman writer who's how puniest
I believe his name is who described

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:31.710
I believe his name is who described
 

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.610
I believe his name is who described
these rhythms like three beats and

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:34.620
these rhythms like three beats and
 

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:38.540
these rhythms like three beats and
arrests and how that this happened he

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:38.550
arrests and how that this happened he
 

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.730
arrests and how that this happened he
saw this in a procession of esis it was

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:40.740
saw this in a procession of esis it was
 

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:42.020
saw this in a procession of esis it was
an outdoor procession and had

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:42.030
an outdoor procession and had
 

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.700
an outdoor procession and had
instruments and part of the reason if

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:43.710
instruments and part of the reason if
 

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.770
instruments and part of the reason if
they had a lot of people they would use

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:45.780
they had a lot of people they would use
 

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.080
they had a lot of people they would use
something like a system much like in the

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:48.090
something like a system much like in the
 

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:50.480
something like a system much like in the
military just to keep people in the same

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:50.490
military just to keep people in the same
 

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:52.900
military just to keep people in the same
beat together rather than a crowd

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:52.910
beat together rather than a crowd
 

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:56.420
beat together rather than a crowd
wandering around so from that one can

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:56.430
wandering around so from that one can
 

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.370
wandering around so from that one can
extrapolate a lot of things of what

00:21:58.370 --> 00:21:58.380
extrapolate a lot of things of what
 

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.250
extrapolate a lot of things of what
could be sound could be heard so for me

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:01.260
could be sound could be heard so for me
 

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.290
could be sound could be heard so for me
the instruments are there they speak of

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:03.300
the instruments are there they speak of
 

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:07.490
the instruments are there they speak of
harps or liars the system the sassette

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:07.500
harps or liars the system the sassette
 

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.710
harps or liars the system the sassette
which is another percussion instrument

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720
which is another percussion instrument
 

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.000
which is another percussion instrument
and of course these are

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:11.010
and of course these are
 

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:12.710
and of course these are
small little instruments if you've seen

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720
small little instruments if you've seen
 

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.060
small little instruments if you've seen
them like in museums or pictures and so

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:17.070
them like in museums or pictures and so
 

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:18.980
them like in museums or pictures and so
what I wanted to do is blow this all up

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:18.990
what I wanted to do is blow this all up
 

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:21.500
what I wanted to do is blow this all up
like by a thousand times so I'm using a

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:21.510
like by a thousand times so I'm using a
 

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.570
like by a thousand times so I'm using a
lot of metallic percussion instead of

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:23.580
lot of metallic percussion instead of
 

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.340
lot of metallic percussion instead of
these little things and there are a lot

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:25.350
these little things and there are a lot
 

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.890
these little things and there are a lot
of crowd voices and you knew from the

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:27.900
of crowd voices and you knew from the
 

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.330
of crowd voices and you knew from the
beginning that it would be an orchestral

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:29.340
beginning that it would be an orchestral
 

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:34.120
beginning that it would be an orchestral
work right because I had this chance to

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:34.130
work right because I had this chance to
 

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:40.910
work right because I had this chance to
so our opportunity right and so what is

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:40.920
so our opportunity right and so what is
 

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:43.190
so our opportunity right and so what is
that process then of blowing it up so

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200
that process then of blowing it up so
 

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.460
that process then of blowing it up so
not the the types of instruments the

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:46.470
not the the types of instruments the
 

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:48.500
not the the types of instruments the
size of the sound the numbers of people

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:17.130
thinking about what kind of sound they
 

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:18.890
thinking about what kind of sound they
would use and that would probably have

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:18.900

thinking of the young people who are

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760
thinking of the young people who are
 

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.550
thinking of the young people who are
participating in this as well as the

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:55.560

part of a larger conference that will be

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:03.570
part of a larger conference that will be
 

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:05.420
part of a larger conference that will be
happening on campus on creativity and a

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:05.430
happening on campus on creativity and a
 

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:07.580
happening on campus on creativity and a
life cycle and that's related to its

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:07.590
life cycle and that's related to its
 

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:10.130
life cycle and that's related to its
premiere so there will be a wide range

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.140
premiere so there will be a wide range
 

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.290
premiere so there will be a wide range
of people for both from this campus and

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:12.300
of people for both from this campus and
 

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.640
of people for both from this campus and
elsewhere and then the students who are

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:16.650
elsewhere and then the students who are
 

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.160
elsewhere and then the students who are

that on this piece distinctly looks

00:32:03.789 --> 00:32:03.799
that on this piece distinctly looks
 

00:32:03.799 --> 00:32:09.310
that on this piece distinctly looks
backward to look forward and I I did a

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:09.320

Camille know were locked in the house
 

00:33:04.639 --> 00:33:07.000
Camille know were locked in the house
and we couldn't really get out

and we couldn't really get out
 

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:09.820
and we couldn't really get out
and so after the snow we were spoken

00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:09.830
and so after the snow we were spoken
 

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:11.980
and so after the snow we were spoken
well long story but we were stuck in the

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:11.990
well long story but we were stuck in the
 

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:16.960
well long story but we were stuck in the
house and finally the Sun came out and I

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:16.970
house and finally the Sun came out and I
 

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:18.820
house and finally the Sun came out and I
was supposed to write this guitar piece

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:18.830
was supposed to write this guitar piece
 

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:23.530
was supposed to write this guitar piece
and so I decided to use the instrument

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:23.540
and so I decided to use the instrument
 

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:26.680
and so I decided to use the instrument
to write it and whatnot at the piano but

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:26.690
to write it and whatnot at the piano but
 

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.270
to write it and whatnot at the piano but
at play at the guitar

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:28.280
at play at the guitar
 

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.659
at play at the guitar
and so I I had some ideas about what I

00:33:31.659 --> 00:33:31.669
and so I I had some ideas about what I
 

00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:33.400
and so I I had some ideas about what I
was going to do but I noticed that the

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:33.410
was going to do but I noticed that the
 

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:36.659
was going to do but I noticed that the
light was coming through the window

00:33:36.659 --> 00:33:36.669
light was coming through the window
 

00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:39.490
light was coming through the window
across the strings onto the fingerboard

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:39.500
across the strings onto the fingerboard
 

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.940
across the strings onto the fingerboard
and you could see these shadows of the

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:42.950
and you could see these shadows of the
 

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:46.030
and you could see these shadows of the
fingers and then this the strings and so

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:46.040
fingers and then this the strings and so
 

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.730
fingers and then this the strings and so
as I followed it it was fun to kind of

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:48.740
as I followed it it was fun to kind of
 

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.310
as I followed it it was fun to kind of
play with those shadows so it's kind of

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.320
play with those shadows so it's kind of
 

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.860
play with those shadows so it's kind of
what was happening right then so I

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:53.870
what was happening right then so I
 

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:57.730
what was happening right then so I
titled the piece silhouettes but kind of

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:57.740
titled the piece silhouettes but kind of
 

00:33:57.740 --> 00:34:02.440
titled the piece silhouettes but kind of
ended now so I think composers day they

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:02.450
ended now so I think composers day they
 

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:05.590
ended now so I think composers day they
jump around whatever is - inspiration at

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600
jump around whatever is - inspiration at
 

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.609
jump around whatever is - inspiration at
the time but this particular process

00:34:09.609 --> 00:34:09.619
the time but this particular process
 

00:34:09.619 --> 00:34:12.220
the time but this particular process
required a tremendous amount of research

00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:12.230
required a tremendous amount of research
 

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.169
required a tremendous amount of research
and so it is you know it is a very

00:34:14.169 --> 00:34:14.179
and so it is you know it is a very
 

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:16.750
and so it is you know it is a very
scholarly project yeah because of the

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:16.760
scholarly project yeah because of the
 

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.930
scholarly project yeah because of the
text right and and deer or other works

00:34:19.930 --> 00:34:19.940
text right and and deer or other works
 

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.480
text right and and deer or other works
require that degree of researcher is at

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:22.490
require that degree of researcher is at
 

00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:24.159
require that degree of researcher is at

those are sound samples and so it's kind

00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:46.960
those are sound samples and so it's kind
 

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.910
those are sound samples and so it's kind
of hard to hear the detail but this is

they're going through the water so you

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400
they're going through the water so you
 

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.140
they're going through the water so you
hear the strings are kind of rolling and

leads them to the afterlife and of
 

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:14.070
leads them to the afterlife and of
course all the deities if if they make

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:14.080
course all the deities if if they make
 

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.840
course all the deities if if they make
it then the rest of the deities can make

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:15.850
it then the rest of the deities can make
 

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:19.020
it then the rest of the deities can make
it and they can have this world in the

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:19.030
it and they can have this world in the
 

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:21.630
it and they can have this world in the
afterlife so when you and I talked about

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:21.640
afterlife so when you and I talked about
 

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.430
afterlife so when you and I talked about
it before and you played some of the

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440
it before and you played some of the
 

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.990
it before and you played some of the
parts for it there each of these

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:25.000
parts for it there each of these
 

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.960
parts for it there each of these
sections has really very distinctive

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:27.970
sections has really very distinctive
 

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:32.640
sections has really very distinctive
mood to it and which is is largely

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:32.650
mood to it and which is is largely
 

00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:34.500
mood to it and which is is largely
informed of course by the story and by

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:34.510
informed of course by the story and by
 

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:37.440
informed of course by the story and by
the text to create that mood but but

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:37.450
the text to create that mood but but
 

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:40.380
the text to create that mood but but
really requires you to to be in a

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:40.390
really requires you to to be in a
 

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:42.900
really requires you to to be in a
different kind of space or mood I would

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:42.910
different kind of space or mood I would
 

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:46.110
different kind of space or mood I would
think as a composer some of it being a

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:46.120
think as a composer some of it being a
 

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:49.980
think as a composer some of it being a
very very high energy or some of it

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:49.990
very very high energy or some of it
 

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:52.020
very very high energy or some of it
being very joyful other of it being more

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:52.030
being very joyful other of it being more
 

00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:55.380
being very joyful other of it being more
questioning or more serene and so how is

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:55.390
questioning or more serene and so how is
 

00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:57.630
questioning or more serene and so how is
it that you can create those states

00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:57.640
it that you can create those states
 

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.460
it that you can create those states
within yourself in order for it to be

00:43:59.460 --> 00:43:59.470
within yourself in order for it to be
 

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:00.870
within yourself in order for it to be
reflected in the music how does that

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880
reflected in the music how does that
 

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:03.420
reflected in the music how does that
work well each of the movements has its

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:03.430
work well each of the movements has its
 

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:09.240
work well each of the movements has its
own character its own themes and the

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:09.250
own character its own themes and the
 

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:11.720
own character its own themes and the
hope is that the overall typography

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:11.730
hope is that the overall typography
 

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:16.980
hope is that the overall typography
dramatically works and I mean that

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:16.990
dramatically works and I mean that
 

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:19.020
dramatically works and I mean that
that's part of the interconnected issue

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:19.030
that's part of the interconnected issue
 

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:21.120
that's part of the interconnected issue
the kind of goes back is the same

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:21.130
the kind of goes back is the same
 

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:24.240
the kind of goes back is the same
element that when you have mold amove

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:24.250

musical content and so in looking at

musical content and so in looking at
 

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:42.460
musical content and so in looking at
those you know the composer composers

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:42.470
those you know the composer composers
 

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:46.390
those you know the composer composers
are familiar with these things that you

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:46.400
are familiar with these things that you
 

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.640
are familiar with these things that you
need to impose some kind of architecture

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:48.650

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:12.250
go through this process and work because
it doesn't really reach the completion

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:12.260
it doesn't really reach the completion
 

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.570
it doesn't really reach the completion
in a way that work doesn't reach

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:13.580
in a way that work doesn't reach
 

00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:18.760
in a way that work doesn't reach
completion until it's performed right it

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:18.770
completion until it's performed right it
 

00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:21.160
completion until it's performed right it

in the main in the conductor score you

00:48:59.590 --> 00:48:59.600
in the main in the conductor score you
 

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:01.450
in the main in the conductor score you
see where things repeat and then there's

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:01.460
see where things repeat and then there's
 

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:04.030
see where things repeat and then there's
some verbal explanation of in these

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:04.040
some verbal explanation of in these
 

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.310

repeats like how many times and who's
doing what and then when that gets

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:08.840
doing what and then when that gets

to hopefully the informed audience they
 

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:20.500
to hopefully the informed audience they
know they're coming in and he conducts

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:20.510
know they're coming in and he conducts
 

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:21.850
know they're coming in and he conducts
them because he's prepped them before

00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:21.860
them because he's prepped them before

through with them hopefully they will
 

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:30.100
through with them hopefully they will
know and then he turns back around to go

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:30.110
know and then he turns back around to go
 

00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:32.350

into the coda of the thirteenth movement

00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:32.360
into the coda of the thirteenth movement
 

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.680
into the coda of the thirteenth movement
or the twelfth movement to finish the

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:35.690
or the twelfth movement to finish the
 

00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:38.500
or the twelfth movement to finish the
piece so the audience participation part

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:38.510
piece so the audience participation part
 

00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:40.840
piece so the audience participation part
is it not at the very end but just prior

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:40.850
is it not at the very end but just prior
 

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:45.430
is it not at the very end but just prior
to this just prior to the coda yeah so

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440
to this just prior to the coda yeah so
 

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.740
to this just prior to the coda yeah so
we'll see I mean there's a question of

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:47.750
we'll see I mean there's a question of
 

00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:50.830
we'll see I mean there's a question of
whether they will actually make any

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:50.840
whether they will actually make any
 

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:53.260
whether they will actually make any
noise or not right well presumably some

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:53.270
noise or not right well presumably some
 

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:55.720
noise or not right well presumably some
of us will be there so we'll have an

00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:55.730
of us will be there so we'll have an
 

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:59.860
of us will be there so we'll have an
early clue what we're supposed to do so

00:49:59.860 --> 00:49:59.870
early clue what we're supposed to do so
 

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:01.240
early clue what we're supposed to do so

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160
works this piece will be very hard to
 

00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:31.510
works this piece will be very hard to
get staged again there's it's possible

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:31.520
get staged again there's it's possible
 

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:35.950
get staged again there's it's possible
right but that would be hard to get this

00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:35.960
right but that would be hard to get this
 

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:40.270
right but that would be hard to get this
many forces together so I'll I'll

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:40.280
many forces together so I'll I'll
 

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.920
many forces together so I'll I'll
inevitably go back and add in things

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:41.930
inevitably go back and add in things
 

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:46.660
inevitably go back and add in things
which is natural and see if what I can

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:46.670
which is natural and see if what I can
 

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:49.510
which is natural and see if what I can
do with it but I have other pieces that

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520
do with it but I have other pieces that
 

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.330
do with it but I have other pieces that
I'm going to be on - so how does that

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:52.340
I'm going to be on - so how does that
 

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:54.280
I'm going to be on - so how does that
feel the idea that something that you

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:54.290
feel the idea that something that you
 

00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:56.950
feel the idea that something that you
created years and years and years of

00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:56.960
created years and years and years of
 

00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:00.220
created years and years and years of
work and effort has this this one

00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:00.230
work and effort has this this one
 

00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:02.080
work and effort has this this one
incarnation potentially this one

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:02.090
incarnation potentially this one
 

00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:04.720
incarnation potentially this one
incarnation and who knows what will

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:04.730
incarnation and who knows what will
 

00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:06.520
incarnation and who knows what will
happen after that is that a that's

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:06.530
happen after that is that a that's
 

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.770
happen after that is that a that's
something hard to live with or accept or

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:08.780
something hard to live with or accept or
 

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:09.970
something hard to live with or accept or
is it just the nature of

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:09.980
is it just the nature of
 

00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:13.410
is it just the nature of
that's more the nature of your at least

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:13.420
that's more the nature of your at least
 

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:17.560

the piece is done it's not just

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:17.570
the piece is done it's not just
 

00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:19.780
the piece is done it's not just
imagining right or I mean that's a

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:19.790
imagining right or I mean that's a
 

00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:22.150
imagining right or I mean that's a
horrible thing if you if you want to be

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.160
horrible thing if you if you want to be
 

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.180
horrible thing if you if you want to be
an artist and think well I can't do that

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:25.190
an artist and think well I can't do that
 

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:28.000
an artist and think well I can't do that
because blah blah or I can't do this and

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:28.010
because blah blah or I can't do this and
 

00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:33.520
because blah blah or I can't do this and
so why not why do anything and being an

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:33.530
so why not why do anything and being an
 

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:35.560
so why not why do anything and being an
artist you have to by the nature of that

00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:35.570
artist you have to by the nature of that
 

00:51:35.570 --> 00:51:37.090
artist you have to by the nature of that
you've got to put yourself out in front

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:37.100
you've got to put yourself out in front
 

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:40.030
you've got to put yourself out in front
of people who inevitably are going to

movement so much yeah so how do you

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:50.750
movement so much yeah so how do you

ultimately deem the work a success as

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:54.020
ultimately deem the work a success as

far as you're concerned what criteria do

00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:56.630
far as you're concerned what criteria do
 

00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:59.410
far as you're concerned what criteria do
you use to determine how you feel about

00:51:59.410 --> 00:51:59.420
you use to determine how you feel about
 

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:02.020
you use to determine how you feel about
it well I guess importantly how the

00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:02.030
it well I guess importantly how the
 

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:05.710
it well I guess importantly how the
composer feels about it maybe everyone

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:05.720
composer feels about it maybe everyone
 

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:07.330
composer feels about it maybe everyone
else doesn't like it but if you like it

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:07.340
else doesn't like it but if you like it
 

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:10.840
else doesn't like it but if you like it
then that's right that's good but part

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:10.850
then that's right that's good but part
 

00:52:10.850 --> 00:52:14.440
then that's right that's good but part
of it is is it a practical piece in

00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:14.450
of it is is it a practical piece in
 

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:16.540
of it is is it a practical piece in
terms of can the players play do they

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:16.550
terms of can the players play do they
 

00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:17.859
terms of can the players play do they
want to play this is it interesting

00:52:17.859 --> 00:52:17.869
want to play this is it interesting
 

00:52:17.869 --> 00:52:21.400

it just are there so many
 

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:26.920
it just are there so many
berrak barricades so that it's going to

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:26.930
berrak barricades so that it's going to
 

00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:30.599
berrak barricades so that it's going to
have difficulty the whole time and

00:52:30.599 --> 00:52:30.609
have difficulty the whole time and
 

00:52:30.609 --> 00:52:33.820
have difficulty the whole time and
virtually ever composers written pieces

00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:33.830
virtually ever composers written pieces
 

00:52:33.830 --> 00:52:36.490
virtually ever composers written pieces
that are just right the first time and

others that they've had to revise and

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:38.630
others that they've had to revise and
 

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:41.859
others that they've had to revise and
revise it's just the nature it's not a

00:52:41.859 --> 00:52:41.869
revise it's just the nature it's not a
 

00:52:41.869 --> 00:52:45.460

pleasant thing but it's the nature of it

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:45.470
pleasant thing but it's the nature of it
 

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:47.349
pleasant thing but it's the nature of it
it's kind of like Rilke who says you've

00:52:47.349 --> 00:52:47.359
it's kind of like Rilke who says you've
 

00:52:47.359 --> 00:52:49.330
it's kind of like Rilke who says you've
got to go visit the dark side of the art

00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:49.340
got to go visit the dark side of the art
 

00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:52.270
got to go visit the dark side of the art
before you really encompass it and that

00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:52.280
before you really encompass it and that
 

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:53.800
before you really encompass it and that
what that's actually kind of leads to a

00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:53.810
what that's actually kind of leads to a
 

00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:55.840
what that's actually kind of leads to a
final question I have for you we talked

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:55.850
final question I have for you we talked
 

00:52:55.850 --> 00:52:58.540
final question I have for you we talked
about some influences such as when you

00:52:58.540 --> 00:52:58.550
about some influences such as when you
 

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:00.390
about some influences such as when you
just mentioned a kind of literary

00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400
just mentioned a kind of literary
 

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:04.870
just mentioned a kind of literary
influences but are and in your art form

00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880
influences but are and in your art form
 

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.670
influences but are and in your art form
beyond the music and beyond the

beyond the music and beyond the
 

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.340
beyond the music and beyond the
literature of the text or their other

literature of the text or their other
 

00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:12.690
literature of the text or their other
artistic or influences things that

00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:12.700
artistic or influences things that
 

00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:16.000
artistic or influences things that
attract your attention or something that

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:16.010
attract your attention or something that
 

00:53:16.010 --> 00:53:18.910

comes back in your consciousness
that you may not even be aware of until

it has some sort of form in the music

00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:24.960
it has some sort of form in the music
 

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.859
it has some sort of form in the music
itself could you restate that

00:53:27.859 --> 00:53:27.869
itself could you restate that
 

00:53:27.869 --> 00:53:29.779
itself could you restate that
so other other influence influences

00:53:29.779 --> 00:53:29.789
so other other influence influences
 

00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:32.210
so other other influence influences
beyond perhaps the text or music other

kind of planed out so what is it about

00:58:33.770 --> 00:58:33.780
kind of planed out so what is it about
 

00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:37.540
kind of planed out so what is it about
that word that pieces and the work that

00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:37.550
that word that pieces and the work that
 

00:58:37.550 --> 00:58:40.700
that word that pieces and the work that
where is it located in the work that's

00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:40.710
where is it located in the work that's
 

00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:47.839
where is it located in the work that's
the ninth piece and so it's reached kind

00:58:47.839 --> 00:58:47.849
the ninth piece and so it's reached kind
 

00:58:47.849 --> 00:58:49.880
the ninth piece and so it's reached kind
of a low point and then it then it goes

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:49.890
of a low point and then it then it goes
 

00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:52.839
of a low point and then it then it goes
right and there's a lot of string

00:58:52.839 --> 00:58:52.849
right and there's a lot of string
 

00:58:52.849 --> 00:58:57.740
right and there's a lot of string
activity there that that helps and again

00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:57.750
activity there that that helps and again
 

00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:59.390
activity there that that helps and again

and then a part of big problem with what

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:27.210
and then a part of big problem with what
 

01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:30.660
and then a part of big problem with what
technological problem the file got so

01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:30.670
technological problem the file got so
 

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:33.000
technological problem the file got so
big it was I had to split it apart there

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:33.010
big it was I had to split it apart there
 

01:00:33.010 --> 01:00:34.530
big it was I had to split it apart there
were just all kinds of technical things

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:34.540
were just all kinds of technical things
 

01:00:34.540 --> 01:01:01.850
were just all kinds of technical things
that were occurring and still

01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:01.860
 
 

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:05.010
 
that's because my my father's father was

01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:05.020
that's because my my father's father was
 

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:11.070
that's because my my father's father was
a scientist who's a neurologist

01:01:11.070 --> 01:01:11.080
a scientist who's a neurologist
 

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.940
a scientist who's a neurologist
and so and he's extremely strict

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:14.950
and so and he's extremely strict
 

01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:17.160
and so and he's extremely strict
Catholic I came from a very strict

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:17.170
Catholic I came from a very strict
 

01:01:17.170 --> 01:01:21.420
Catholic I came from a very strict
family and you know where you didn't get

01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:21.430
family and you know where you didn't get
 

01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:23.190
family and you know where you didn't get
decide what to decide what you were

01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200
decide what to decide what you were
 

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.650
decide what to decide what you were
going to do you were told so my father

01:01:25.650 --> 01:01:25.660
going to do you were told so my father
 

01:01:25.660 --> 01:01:30.090
going to do you were told so my father
was forced to go in he wanted to be a

01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:30.100
was forced to go in he wanted to be a
 

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:32.100
was forced to go in he wanted to be a
writer and actually worked in Hollywood

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:32.110
writer and actually worked in Hollywood
 

01:01:32.110 --> 01:01:34.760
writer and actually worked in Hollywood
for about six or eight years in the 30s

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:34.770
for about six or eight years in the 30s
 

01:01:34.770 --> 01:01:38.760
for about six or eight years in the 30s
and he wanted to pursue that but it was

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:38.770
and he wanted to pursue that but it was
 

01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:42.060
and he wanted to pursue that but it was
very much against what his father would

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:42.070
very much against what his father would
 

01:01:42.070 --> 01:01:43.950
very much against what his father would
have allowed and so I think I was the

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:43.960
have allowed and so I think I was the
 

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:48.300
have allowed and so I think I was the
beneficiary that because I got I wasn't

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:48.310
beneficiary that because I got I wasn't
 

01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:50.670
beneficiary that because I got I wasn't
told I have to be this or that of the

01:01:50.670 --> 01:01:50.680
told I have to be this or that of the
 

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.980
told I have to be this or that of the
other I was given a little bit more free

01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:52.990
other I was given a little bit more free
 

01:01:52.990 --> 01:02:10.120
other I was given a little bit more free
rein

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:10.130
 
 

01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:16.120
 
you talk a little about that the

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:16.130
you talk a little about that the
 

01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:19.809
you talk a little about that the
distinction between creativity or moral

01:02:19.809 --> 01:02:19.819
distinction between creativity or moral
 

01:02:19.819 --> 01:02:34.620
distinction between creativity or moral
imagination versus verbal or textual

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:34.630
 
 

01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:41.039
 
I guess they they are different I really

01:02:41.039 --> 01:02:41.049
I guess they they are different I really
 

01:02:41.049 --> 01:02:45.200
I guess they they are different I really
like the word but that is different than

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:45.210
like the word but that is different than
 

01:02:45.210 --> 01:02:49.559
like the word but that is different than
sound of imagination it could be that

01:02:49.559 --> 01:02:49.569
sound of imagination it could be that
 

01:02:49.569 --> 01:02:52.680
sound of imagination it could be that
maybe for different people with a kid if

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:52.690
maybe for different people with a kid if
 

01:02:52.690 --> 01:02:54.299
maybe for different people with a kid if
they're experiencing some things that's

01:02:54.299 --> 01:02:54.309
they're experiencing some things that's
 

01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:55.859
they're experiencing some things that's
kind of in black and white and then they

01:02:55.859 --> 01:02:55.869
kind of in black and white and then they
 

01:02:55.869 --> 01:02:58.219
kind of in black and white and then they
get to something that they're very

01:02:58.219 --> 01:02:58.229
get to something that they're very
 

01:02:58.229 --> 01:03:01.739
get to something that they're very
practiced at or have a real interest in

01:03:01.739 --> 01:03:01.749
practiced at or have a real interest in
 

01:03:01.749 --> 01:03:03.420
practiced at or have a real interest in
doing in it and then all of a sudden

01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:03.430
doing in it and then all of a sudden
 

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:07.339
doing in it and then all of a sudden
it's in color more amplified and more

01:03:07.339 --> 01:03:07.349
it's in color more amplified and more
 

01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:10.200
it's in color more amplified and more
affects you more internally and then

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:10.210
affects you more internally and then
 

01:03:10.210 --> 01:03:11.849
affects you more internally and then
maybe the spectrum goes on you think

01:03:11.849 --> 01:03:11.859
maybe the spectrum goes on you think
 

01:03:11.859 --> 01:03:13.259
maybe the spectrum goes on you think
about something else and it's back to

01:03:13.259 --> 01:03:13.269
about something else and it's back to
 

01:03:13.269 --> 01:03:16.140
about something else and it's back to
black and white and people are have

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:16.150
black and white and people are have
 

01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:20.400
