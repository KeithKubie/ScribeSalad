IAN URBINA: So my
name is Ian Urbina.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:08.740
I'm a reporter at "The Times,"
have been there since 2003.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.900
And I do investigative projects.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.350
And that was always sort of my
dream when I joined the paper,

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.090
and have been doing that
for about five, six years.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.070
And essentially
what that means is

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.470
I have the luxury of
time with stories.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.870
So I'm not a beat
reporter and I don't

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.590
have to sort of sprint every
day to help fill the page,

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.820
feed the beast as we say.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.660
I can go longer
and work on things.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.880
The expectation though that
comes with that luxury of time

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:51.450
is that you will find
virgin snow, topically,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.276
which basically means old
topics but a new angle on them,

00:00:55.276 --> 00:00:58.850
or new information that
previously wasn't disclosed,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.190
or both.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.820
And that there will
be a level of polish

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.120
and a level of rigor
in what you produce

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.390
that is higher than would
be expected from someone

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.900
that had three days as opposed
to three months to produce.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.900
So this series was one
that I had pitched.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.470
I'd been kind of fantasizing
about getting the Gray

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.820
Lady to pay to send
me to sea, had long

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.420
been kind of a dream of mine.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.100
In grad school I
worked on a ship.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.580
And since I was a boy I was
always sort of fascinated

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.387
by the blue on the globe and
sort of the little specks

00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:38.220
in the middle of the
ocean, who lives there,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.886
and how to get there, and what's
it like being a teenager there,

00:01:40.886 --> 00:01:43.320
and can I ever go there.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.260
So I had pitched
the notion of our

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.020
doing a series on this
several times before.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.360
It's insanely expensive
and sometimes dangerous.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.000
And so previous
editors had kind of

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.960
looked at me quizzically and
said, OK, what else you got?

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.980
But this editor
liked the thought

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.970
and essentially said
sure, write me a memo.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.800
Let's see what story ideas
we would actually do.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.730
And the pitch was really simple.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.370
It was just this thought
that 2/3 of the planet's

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.200
covered by water.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.440
And much of that space is
ungoverned and ungovernable,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.880
in my view.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.780
And wouldn't it be amazing if
we could take our readers out

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.120
there to that space, a place
that they probably had never

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.210
been and may never get
to go, and just talk

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.360
about what happens out there.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.120
And the import is
90% of everything

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.240
we consume comes to
us by way of sea.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.780
50% of the oxygen we
breathe comes by way of sea.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.200
And it's just a strange
kind of last frontier

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.550
the commons, the tragedy of
the commons, outer space,

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.640
and international waters and
Antarctica, there a couple

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.250
places around that people can
access that sort of belongs

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.240
to everyone and no one.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.680
And the high seas
are one of them.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.530
So that was the thought.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.880
That was the pitch.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.960
My editor liked it.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.910
And off we went.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.460
It quickly became a
little bit more specific.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.920
It wasn't just sort
of let's go out

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.211
there and see what's out there.

00:03:30.211 --> 00:03:34.080
It was more let's
look at the range

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.480
of bad behavior, the crime
that occurs out there, and not

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.750
just environmental crime.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.290
In fact when I first pitched
it, as I left the office

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.010
sort of shocked that I had
made it past first base

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.580
on this, as I left my
editor-- her name is Rebecca

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.310
Corbett-- said, and by
the way, let's think

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.410
about an ocean series.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.910
But I don't want any fish.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.370
And I remember thinking-- I
turned back and said wait,

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.270
so you want a series about
the oceans but no fish?

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.160
And this was
brilliant in my view.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.860
What she meant
was that space out

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.280
there is covered often as
an environmental story,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.630
and for obvious reasons.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.241
But let's approach it-- we
can back our way into that,

00:04:17.241 --> 00:04:19.490
but let's approach it as a
human story, a labor story,

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:26.170
human rights story, and look
for those stories primarily.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.310
And then secondarily,
look at the space

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:37.920
as a kind of marine realm that
we're depleting and despoiling.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.400
So I'm going to blitz through.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.640
There are eight big stories.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.250
I think I'll probably get
through maybe five of them.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.867
I can't imagine
anyone working here

00:04:46.867 --> 00:04:48.450
has enough time to
have read them all.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.990
So I'll just talk
about sort of what

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.630
my goal was, tactics
were, findings

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.250
were for each of the stories.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.230
And then I'll stop.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.670
So when you're going
to do a big series,

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.680
you're sort of planning
out how to do these things,

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.380
the first story in the series is
often referred to as the throat

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.880
clear.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.590
And it needs to be
clearing your throat

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.120
to get the attention
of the room,

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.460
in this case, kind of
your reading public.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.200
And so it has to be kind
of an altitude that's

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.020
much higher in terms
of its perspective

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.090
and sort of authoritative tone
and a level of polish that's

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.510
beyond the rest of the pieces,
because you really kind of have

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.710
to establish kind of the
corners of your canvas.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.160
So this first story
aimed at that.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.130
And it had, at
its root, one kind

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:54.680
of core conceit, if you will,
from a writing perspective.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.470
And that was, my thought was,
rather than having a person

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.170
as the main character
in the story,

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.620
let's have a ship as
the main character.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:11.320
And let's find a ship that is a
well documented and repeat bad

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.124
actor and kind of a poster child
of scofflaw behavior at sea.

00:06:18.197 --> 00:06:20.280
And then let's sort of
let's just follow that ship

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.630
as it goes around the
planet and does bad stuff.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.560
And so I kind of
had a beauty contest

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.840
if you will-- the opposite of
beauty contest, an ugly contest

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.760
for the contestants
that we might

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.620
choose from for this
story and looked

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.930
at a bunch of different, really
well documented bad ships where

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.462
bad stuff had happened.

00:06:41.462 --> 00:06:43.670
And the "Dona Liberta,"
that's called the "Sea Pearl"

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.210
in this picture.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.626
And you can go in on some of
these photos and sort of blow

00:06:46.626 --> 00:06:50.368
up the actual photo
and maybe scroll

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:51.492
through some of the photos.

00:06:51.492 --> 00:06:52.940
It says the "Sea Pearl" now.

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:53.940
It's renamed.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.380
It's actually has since
been renamed again.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.940
But so the "Dona Liberta" was
the one that won the contest.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:04.150
And it won because
it had engaged

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.420
in-- you want to jump
past the autoplay one

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.960
and scroll all the way down.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.930
It engaged in three categories
of crimes that struck me

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.550
as either really compelling
and dramatic and/or

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.610
pervasive and important.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.860
One was abuse of stowaways.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.916
So the story there is this.

00:07:29.248 --> 00:07:32.780
The "Dona Liberta" is a
small ship, Greek owned.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.510
At the time it was
Italian captained, mostly

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.180
Romanian crew.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.300
It's called a mother ship.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.520
It's a refrigeration ship.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.600
It mostly transports
tuna from fishing vessels

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.810
to shore between countries.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.960
Real run down, broken
down ship, should

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.920
have been retired decades ago.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.150
And there are a couple
places in the world

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:02.940
that have robust stowaway
communities, repeat fliers.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.732
And Cape Town is kind
of the top of that list,

00:08:05.732 --> 00:08:06.690
for a bunch of reasons.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.280
It's port is porous.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.700
A lot of really big ships
come in and out of there.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.770
A lot of poor countries
in the neighborhood

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.060
that put out these guys.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.940
They're all guys, or
at least all the ones

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.300
I have ever read or interviewed.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.030
And so there's a
robust shanty town

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:25.870
that's just always or kind
of aspiring stowaways or just

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.990
return stowaways right in Cape
Town, right near the port.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.340
And so "Dona Liberta" was
in port 2011 in Cape Town.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.900
These two Tanzanian
guys, one of whom

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.039
had stowed away a
couple times before,

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.809
once or twice
quite successfully,

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:41.830
landed someplace nice.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.900
Stayed there, got a
girlfriend, a job,

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.840
undocumented, had a life way
better than what he was living

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.260
before, and then got caught
by immigration and sent back,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:52.850
tried again.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:53.630
That was one guy.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.020
The other guy had
never done it before.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.710
They team up.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.500
They sneak onto
the "Dona Liberta."

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.800
They hide out in
the engine room.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.540
They make it a couple days.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.960
They're discovered,
brought up on deck.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.400
And the captain says to
the crew, deal with them.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.250
OK, so let's pause everything.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:13.480
That moment in the movie is
kind of an important moment

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:18.230
conceptually because post-9/11,
the world became scared

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.350
and regulations came down
in every realm, airports,

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:23.850
et cetera, including ports.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.374
And one of those regulations
was you show up with guys

00:09:27.374 --> 00:09:29.290
on your ship that aren't
supposed to be there,

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.050
you're going to be hit with
huge fines because of terrorism

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.040
concerns.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.020
And so all these ports sort of
implemented these regulations

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:37.510
that had hefty fines.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:38.942
The fines go to the company.

00:09:38.942 --> 00:09:41.025
The company passes the
fines down to the captains.

00:09:41.025 --> 00:09:45.150
And the captains
say, you guys are

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.940
responsible for the
sweep of the ship

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.360
before we leave
port to make sure

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.700
that there are no stowaways.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.477
And if you guys don't
do a good job at that,

00:09:52.477 --> 00:09:54.810
it's coming out of your wages
if we get hit with a fine.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.690
The fines can be
$50,000 $100,000.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.420
These guys make
$40,000 $50,000 a year.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.370
It's serious business.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:06.720
So our Tanzanian guys somehow
slipped in, didn't get nabbed.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.920
So the captain in a very--
the captain turned to the crew

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.700
and said something
that we had heard

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.570
was said often in this
situation post 9/11.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:16.630
You guys deal with them.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:17.480
I don't want to know how.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.105
Deal with them.

00:10:18.105 --> 00:10:20.860
What that means is
get rid of them.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.590
And the more humane
way you get rid

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.477
of them-- obviously
there's some instances

00:10:24.477 --> 00:10:26.060
where they deal with
them by the book.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.268
They bring them back in port.

00:10:27.268 --> 00:10:29.480
They take the fines,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.000
There are also sort of other
ways, which are you just kill

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.934
them, throw him overboard.

00:10:35.934 --> 00:10:37.600
And then there's the
middle ground which

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.015
is you try to humanely deal
with him by doing what happened

00:10:41.015 --> 00:10:43.930
to these guys, which was
they built a raft, tabletop

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.580
raft, about eight by
eight, handles, real flat,

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.917
drums underneath, oil drums.

00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:51.750
Put it on the water.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.432
Tether it to the "Dona
Liberta" way off at sea.

00:10:54.432 --> 00:10:56.160
Bring the guys up from lockdown.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.340
Say climb on board.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.550
They cut the cord.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.430
And storms coming
on the horizon.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.950
"Dona Liberta" steams away.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.410
These guys are out there,
don't know how to swim,

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:07.540
and they're sort of holding on.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.850
I had heard about this incident
from an Interpol source

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:15.670
and thought wow,
that's dramatic.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:19.260
We didn't know the name of
the guys, the stowaways.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.530
We didn't know much.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.910
So thus began the scramble,
the fear, all that.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:23.880
We got lucky.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:29.010
And the raft survived out
there for a while, washed up

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.270
in Liberia.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:32.626
Both guys were alive
when they came ashore.

00:11:32.626 --> 00:11:34.000
One of the guys
was in bad shape.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.410
He died 24 hours later.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.530
The other guy survived.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.550
And that was crime
number one and the reason

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.520
I was really interested
in "Dona Liberta."

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.930
If we could find that survivor
guy and land his story,

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:49.230
that becomes cinematic
drama, and important news.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.890
Because in the 9/11 moment,
it's an interesting problem,

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:57.170
and also part of the
lawlessness at sea concept.

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:03.050
Second crime that "Dona Liberta"
engaged in-- every three years,

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.740
ships intentionally
dump more oil and sludge

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:11.240
into the oceans than the BP and
"Exxon Valdez" spill combined.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.110
So think about that,
how much coverage there

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.320
was of those two accidents.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.320
And then think about the
fact that intentionally

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.370
the sheer quantity
is every three

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:22.125
years put into the oceans.

00:12:22.125 --> 00:12:23.250
The oceans are a big place.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.130
Dilution's real.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.950
But it accumulates.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.299
A lot of the stuff
doesn't biodegrade.

00:12:29.299 --> 00:12:31.090
So I thought when we
crunched those numbers

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:32.714
and found out that
statistic, I thought

00:12:32.714 --> 00:12:35.580
wow, that's pretty striking.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.810
The "Dona Liberta" was
caught on satellite

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.756
doing just that, something
called a magic pipe.

00:12:40.756 --> 00:12:42.630
A lot of ships have it,
runs from your engine

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.860
room under the ship.

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.840
And it's essentially a flush.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.340
It's not what you're
supposed to do.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.965
You're supposed to
bring the stuff back

00:12:48.965 --> 00:12:51.550
to shore, have that
processed, costs.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:53.820
A lot of folks have
magic pipes installed

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.760
so they can get rid of the
waste cheaply and disappear it.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.170
"Dona Liberta" had a magic pipe.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:00.280
They caused a 90 mile
slick off the coast

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.340
of Africa, caught
doing it on satellite.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.860
Category two.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.030
Category three, less
dramatic, very pervasive,

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.320
abuse of mariners,
of deck hands.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.940
And it's low grade abuse in
terms of the drama scale.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.770
It's wage theft and
its abandonment.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:17.826
But it's a big problem.

00:13:17.826 --> 00:13:19.450
Most of these crews--
we're not talking

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.491
about "Captain Phillips,"
Maersk container ships.

00:13:21.491 --> 00:13:23.550
We're talking about
"Dona Liberta," shitty,

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.880
smaller kind of craft
that really make up

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.120
the true numbers
of people and ships

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.220
out on the world's
oceans-- not US waters,

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.000
but the rest of the world.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.630
And what happens often
with these companies

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:40.370
and these ships is the
corporate structure

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:45.180
is kind of something
out of a crime movie.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.670
It's like a PO box registered
to a guy who doesn't exist,

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:52.770
licensed in Nigeria,
owned by a guy in Greece.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.640
It's layers upon layers
and intentionally

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.540
designed to be
impossible to figure out

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.890
who actually owns that company
that owns that company that

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.980
owns that ship.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.560
"Dona Liberta" was
a textbook example

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.210
of this, papers and kind of
companies on top of companies,

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:10.690
some of which don't even exist.

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:15.280
And what happens often in these
cases is a ship rolls into port

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.730
or comes into port and
gets hit with some fine,

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:23.470
or some unpaid bill
catches up with them,

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:27.280
or the mother company
is moving money around

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.060
and hits some problem.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:33.270
And overnight it
becomes in the interest

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:36.990
of the company to basically
disappear, cut their losses

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.587
and walk.

00:14:37.587 --> 00:14:38.420
And so they do that.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.900
And the corporate culture
is almost built for that.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:47.340
But there are guys on the
ship out there in, wherever,

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.410
and they're kind of at a loss.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.369
A quarter of the
world's mariners

00:14:52.369 --> 00:14:53.410
are from the Philippines.

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.470
Interesting backstory as
to why that's the case.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:58.630
But most of these folks
are third worlders,

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.290
developing world crew.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:01.690
So they don't have
the resources.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:02.500
They don't have the lobby.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.370
They don't have the lawyers.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.661
They don't have anything to
really kind of logistically

00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:07.210
figure their way home.

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.570
They're on a ship that
no longer has an owner.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:11.330
They can't get any
calls answered.

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:12.955
They don't have the
money or the papers

00:15:12.955 --> 00:15:16.450
to get off because they're on
the coast of the US or Europe

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:17.690
or Africa or wherever.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:19.064
They're not allowed
off the ship.

00:15:19.064 --> 00:15:22.390
They're a mile off shore and
they're in port sometimes.

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.130
And the ship can't
move and leave

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:25.780
because they don't
have the fuel.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:26.590
So they're stuck.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.280
And these stories
get very dramatic.

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.080
Guys have died,
starved to death.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.690
A lot of guys have tried to swim
to shore and they can't swim,

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:34.717
they get drowned.

00:15:34.717 --> 00:15:35.800
They sneak in the country.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.900
They get nabbed for
immigration, et cetera.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.390
A big problem in the seafarer
world, and the "Dona Liberta"

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:45.020
had engaged in this
crime repeatedly.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.580
So we tracked down
one of the former crew

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:52.482
in this tiny town in Romania
who had experienced just that.

00:15:52.482 --> 00:15:53.690
So that's the "Dona Liberta".

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:57.880
And that was sort of the
first story in the series.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.990
So why don't we pull out
and go to the second story?

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:06.330
So I reported these differently
than we published them.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.640
And this second
story was a story

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:14.100
that I reported towards
the end of the process.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:17.770
And I bring that up because
in the course of reporting

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.210
these other stories, the
"Dona Liberta" and others,

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:25.320
I kept hearing about just
this insane level of violence

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.490
at sea.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:31.780
And there are a couple things
I kept hearing or inferring.

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.720
One was the type of
violence that we know of,

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:40.150
the sort of "Captain Phillips,"
RPG, fast boat Somali attack

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:46.860
on Western well endowed
kind of merchant vessels

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:52.090
is a tiny, tiny, tiny sliver of
really what happens out there

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.440
in terms of incidents,
in terms of bodies,

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.680
in terms of dollars lost,
in terms of just brutality.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:03.510
But it's kind of what we
consume in the Western world,

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:04.909
dramatic, and it's
the story that

00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:06.200
made it onto the silver screen.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.349
So it's what we all know.

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:10.520
And it was a real, real problem
in '08, '09, '10, but kind

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.380
of has subsided since then.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:15.450
The real realm of violence
is the "Dona Liberta" kind

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:17.060
of level of ship.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.839
And it's places you
wouldn't expect.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:21.140
Bangladesh, the
waters off Bangladesh,

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.920
probably some of the most
violent waters on the planet.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.700
Bay of Bengal, this
area called Sundarbans,

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.290
if you actually look at
the numbers of kidnappings,

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:35.560
hundred at a times put in these
villages and held for ransom.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:39.070
South China Sea, coast
of West Africa, these

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:40.510
are some really brutal places.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:43.550
And it's usually fishing
boat and fishing boat,

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:50.320
big boat on small boat,
fuel vessel, localized gangs

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.060
who specialize in this.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:54.260
It's armed robbery at sea.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.606
And there are
kidnapping rackets.

00:17:56.606 --> 00:17:58.320
All right, point one.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.440
Point two, so the
type of violence,

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.470
the target of violence, the
motivation of the violence

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:09.130
was different than kind of I
thought the public realized.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:15.730
And number two, the
"Captain Phillips" narrative

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:20.060
was actually often
used as a cover

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:24.470
for other types of violence.

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.880
And I'll explain that a
little bit more in a second.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.800
So I wanted to do
something on violence.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.440
But when you write
a 5,000 word story,

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.660
you can't write an article.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:33.500
You have to write a story.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.810
It's got to be a
narrative or else

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:36.270
your reader is not
going to actually sit

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:38.440
with you unless they're like
a professor of such and such

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.770
and they care a lot about it.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.120
But that's five people.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.530
If you really want
real people to read it,

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:47.090
then you have to
make it a narrative.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.080
So this violence one
was really tough.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.530
I couldn't figure out how
to make it a narrative.

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:51.696
I don't think I achieved it.

00:18:51.696 --> 00:18:53.980
But I wrote an article.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.260
But the thing that did
land in my lap that

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.120
made it a pretty striking
article was this video.

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.150
So I was on the South China
Sea for six weeks, photographer

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:07.850
and I, reporting a separate
story, the sea slavery story.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:12.900
And I got an email from a kind
of spooky law enforcement type

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.470
who I've known for a
long time and trust.

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:16.580
And he trusts me.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.810
And he sends me stuff.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:22.240
And he's a real serious guy.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.922
He never pops into
my inbox unless it's

00:19:23.922 --> 00:19:24.880
something pretty heavy.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:29.160
We worked together on sex
trafficking of minors, global,

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.740
kind of really brutal stuff.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.860
So when the email
came in, I'd been

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.400
out on boats in Indonesia
and Borneo for a while.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.080
And I was kind of worn out
and emotionally at wits end.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:44.790
And the email subject
line said brace yourself.

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:47.510
And that's like really
superlative language

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:48.440
from this guy.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.780
And I thought, if
he says that, then

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:55.170
what am I about to open in
this video that's in the email?

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:57.150
So I thought for a
second, should I open it?

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:00.300
And of course I did.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.530
What it is, is a 10 minute
and 26 second long video.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:04.660
It was on a cell phone.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:08.330
It was found in the back of
a taxi in Fiji by a student.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:11.580
The student saw it and
started scrolling through it,

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.460
saw this video.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.760
The video shows four
men in the water.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.210
Can't tell where--
we figured out

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:21.100
where-- kind of flailing
about trying to get away.

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:25.020
And in the surrounding
are four large ships

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:29.690
that turn out to be Taiwanese
tuna long liners, big ships.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.830
The guys in the water are brown.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:35.400
Grainy, cell phone video, can't
make out ethnicity exactly,

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.010
but they don't look
Scandinavian, put it that way.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:42.710
And there's wreckage, wooden
wreckage in the water.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.210
And some of them
are clinging to it.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:45.580
Others are trying to flee.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.350
And what proceeds
in the 10 minutes

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.900
is killing, a brutal
killing, where

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:54.940
someone with a semiautomatic
who was behind the camera

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.610
essentially takes
these guys out.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.170
It takes some work.

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:02.970
It's not a great shot, but
head shots, a lot of blood.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:08.950
And at the end, as if
that wasn't bad enough,

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:10.960
there's a celebration
where the deckhands

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.840
where they all kind of cheer.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.021
And they pose for selfies.

00:21:15.021 --> 00:21:17.870
So I get this video and
think, OK, well there's

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:19.312
my violence story.

00:21:19.312 --> 00:21:21.270
You know, I'm going to
investigate the hell out

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:25.660
of this video and figure
out what happened if we can.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.820
So we did.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.210
Well, we'll look at
a quick clip of it.

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:36.380
But the real crime
in my view occurred

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:41.834
after we published the
story, which is not before,

00:21:41.834 --> 00:21:43.000
even though we went to Fiji.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:43.749
We went to Taiwan.

00:21:43.749 --> 00:21:47.440
We went to all the relevant
players and leaned on them

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.850
and brought diplomats to
bear and the State Department

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:52.770
and Interpol, every
pressure tactic

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:55.170
I know to get a government
to step up and do something

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:56.050
about this.

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.822
None of them were willing
to investigate it.

00:21:58.822 --> 00:22:00.280
And then after the
story we thought

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.380
OK, this will shame a
government into doing something.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.630
To this day no governments
are willing to investigate.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:07.590
Not because it's
so hot or scary.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:09.470
This isn't the My Lai
massacre or anything,

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:14.230
but because no one cares
really, I mean, crassly put.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:16.730
More sophisticated
is to say, it kind of

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:18.280
gets to the nature
of the high seas.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.940
On a ship you have maybe
10 different nationalities.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.330
It's tied to three
other countries.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:30.870
And the people on board,
either the deckhands

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.380
who are conducting the
crime or the victims of it,

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:37.820
are typically poor
and not the types

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:41.170
who have a government that's
going to go to bat for them.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.680
In this case what
was interesting--

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.940
now we loop all the way
back to "Captain Phillips--"

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.750
the governments that
we really leaned on,

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:53.480
Taiwan in particular, Fiji
also, said we've looked into it.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.270
We didn't open a
formal investigation,

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:56.400
but we looked into this.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.592
We looked at the
evidence you have.

00:22:58.592 --> 00:23:01.050
And we've come to the conclusion
that the guys in the water

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:01.591
were pirates.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:06.790
The guys in the water-- you
can see the front of one

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:09.890
of the Taiwanese two
longliners in that picture.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:13.240
The guys in the water could
be Attila the Hun's cousins

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.250
for all I care.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:16.820
There's no way that those
guys are still threats.

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.600
This is murder period.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.720
And so it brought
me back to something

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.590
I had been inferring for the
entire year of reporting.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.300
And now was like a
perfect example of it

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:32.460
where piracy, Somali piracy, the
fear of the rhetoric around it

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.530
was now being used
as a pretext to not

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:37.133
do anything about something
that was clearly a murder.

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:44.290
So that was the core
ingredient of that story.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.650
And because I'm way
over time, I don't

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:49.530
think we'll watch the video.

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:51.360
But I encourage you
to keep me employed

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:55.055
and go to the website
an click there.

00:23:55.055 --> 00:23:57.180
The other thing that was
in this story-- and again,

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.200
it was not a narrative.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.366
It was sort of a hodgepodge.

00:23:59.366 --> 00:24:01.650
It was something else that
struck me as fascinating,

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:03.350
maybe you guys too.

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:10.870
So post-9/11, a lot of new rules
came down around the world,

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:14.187
including in the maritime
space, one of which was--

00:24:14.187 --> 00:24:15.270
let's do it the other way.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:18.910
So post 2008, 2009, Somali
piracy, serious problem,

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:22.500
more attention, big players
getting hit, scary stuff

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.660
happening.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:28.000
And the industry, shipping
industry, turned to governments

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.280
and said we know
you've long-- i.e.

00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:36.900
two centuries-- had a policy of
discouraging weapons on board.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.020
Everyone's got guns
on board, but kind

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:42.670
of discouraging the conspicuous
display or use of armed power

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:45.650
on private vessels.

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:47.250
But we're getting
our ass kicked here.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:49.130
And we need some help.

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:51.199
And the governments said
OK we'll look into it.

00:24:51.199 --> 00:24:53.240
And then governments looked
back to the Navy guys

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.350
and realized they had
reduced their Navy power.

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:57.600
And there are jurisdictional
issues and all sorts of--

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.100
and they're like, we're
not in the business

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.230
of doing law enforcement.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.410
We're kind of protecting
geopolitical issues

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.830
and other stuff,
but we're not cops.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:08.310
And so governments turned
back to the industry and said,

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:11.530
look, sorry, you've got
to deal with it yourself.

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:14.360
Literally in six
months a $20 billion

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:19.080
industry emerged,
Blackwater on the oceans.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.035
So the private maritime security
industry was born in 12 months

00:25:22.035 --> 00:25:24.160
and became this
massive industry.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:28.680
And it was a lot of
exsoldiers, a fair number

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:33.480
of British American ex-Iraq,
ex-Afghanistan soldiers,

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:38.330
and a huge number of
Pakistanis and Sri Lankans.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.260
Sri Lankan are a really
interesting story.

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:41.650
They got ahead of
this, partially

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:42.733
because of where they are.

00:25:42.733 --> 00:25:45.160
They're real close to a lot
of the rough neighborhoods.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.930
But they cornered a big
chunk of the market.

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:49.580
And a lot of Tamil
Tigers-- anyone

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.110
who knows Sri Lanka, you get
a lot of demobilized Sinhalese

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:55.720
government soldiers and
a lot of former rebels

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:58.590
who had training in arms
went into the business.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:01.670
And that's some of where the
worst behavior is coming from,

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:03.550
including the shooter
in this video.

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:08.510
At least that's what I
concluded and others concluded.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:11.340
So on the one hand
you had governments,

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.020
in writing, including
the US government,

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.600
turning to the industry and
saying OK, arm yourselves.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.519
You need guys with guns.

00:26:18.519 --> 00:26:20.560
So companies emerged and
they had guys with guns.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.810
For man teams initially, then
insurers said three is fine.

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:25.260
Now we're down to two man teams.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.120
And most of the guards
say that's insane.

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:31.360
Some of these ships are two,
three football fields large.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.595
And when they get hit, they get
hit from four different boats,

00:26:34.595 --> 00:26:35.470
different directions.

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:38.000
Two guys cannot handle that.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.300
So they said arms yourselves.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:43.480
And that was one
phenomena, '08, '09.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.820
The other phenomena
was post 9/11,

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.400
ports saying no guys with guns,
like all over the world saying,

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.440
look we're afraid.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:54.250
Mumbai was hit by guys on boats.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.920
And there was just
a general fear

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.840
of terrorists coming by boat.

00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:02.230
So the world said OK, we've
got to figure something out.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:04.350
The port guy, what
do you suggest we do?

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:07.270
I say we have a new rule
that says no guys with guns

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:08.720
come in our national waters.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.010
National waters are
12 miles from shore.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.000
International start at 13.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.800
So all these countries passed
these rules, no guys with guns.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.520
So what happened?

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:20.484
You got lots of guys with guns
and no guys with guns allowed.

00:27:20.484 --> 00:27:22.400
So what they started
doing the first 12 months

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.255
is they just dumped the
guns, keep the guys.

00:27:24.255 --> 00:27:26.750
So whenever they entered,
you got stuff-- grain,

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:30.990
fuel, Nike shoes,
whatever, Apple computers.

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:35.142
They come into port, dump
the guns at 13, sink them.

00:27:35.142 --> 00:27:37.000
Come into port, unload.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.450
Come back out, there's a
gun dealer at 13, 14, 15.

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:41.840
Buy new guns, off you go.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.340
It was cheaper than
dealing with all

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.590
the red tape and [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:46.050
But then some
smart entrepreneurs

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:47.130
were like, that's crazy.

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:48.540
We've got a better system.

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:52.130
So they created this business
called floating armories, which

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:56.490
are these boats which are
usually 13, 15, 20 miles out.

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:01.000
And they're just one part
bunk house, one part gun demo.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.700
And you essentially take
your guys with guns.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.180
You unload them.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.820
They stay there in
between deployments.

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:11.286
And it's this weird place.

00:28:11.286 --> 00:28:13.380
And of course I
wanted to get there.

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.130
That's when I'm in
the business of doing

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.130
is finding weird places
and trying to get there.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.210
And so a photographer and I
went to some of these floating

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:20.293
armories and stayed there.

00:28:20.293 --> 00:28:22.440
Partially just to
access the guards

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.480
and hear what they had to
say about violence, but also

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.520
just to see what this
niche business was like,

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.640
and also what it could tell
us about the types of violence

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.352
that are out there, the types
of arms dealing, et cetera.

00:28:34.352 --> 00:28:37.397
All right, so that's the
hodgepodge to number two story.

00:28:37.397 --> 00:28:38.230
We're at 28 minutes.

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:40.720
I'm going to stop at 40.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:46.330
The third story was a
story about sea slavery,

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:48.480
which is sort of a loaded term.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.220
And it generally refers
to, in the maritime space,

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:59.420
trafficked and/or child and/or
forced and/or indentured labor

00:28:59.420 --> 00:28:59.956
on boats.

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.170
Think of it as a
spectrum, right?

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.950
So you've got soft to hard.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:12.970
On the soft end, you
have maybe indentured.

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:19.310
So that is-- what that looks
like-- so a couple points.

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:22.600
One, a lot of attention has
been paid to sea slavery

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.470
in the last 20 months,
good attention.

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:27.790
It's worthy of it.

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:31.080
It's mostly focused on the
South China Sea and Thailand,

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.770
which is where we went to.

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:34.720
That's a problem.

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:38.330
Because truth be told,
it is a global problem.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:39.780
You go off the
coast of Falklands,

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.800
you go off the coast
of New Zealand,

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:45.160
go off the coast of
South Korea, you go off

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:52.680
the coast of West Africa, Bay
of Bengal again, Indonesia,

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.580
you will find the same and
worse problems of this.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.580
And what it looks like--

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.288
But Thailand's a really
interesting case,

00:29:58.288 --> 00:29:59.070
and here's why.

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:01.560
Thailand is essentially
a middle class country.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.910
It's got less than
2% unemployment.

00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:06.870
If you're Thai, you don't take
jobs in the shit industries.

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:09.290
So you won't find Thai
women, for the most part,

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:10.900
in the sex industry.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:13.880
And you won't find Thai
men, for the most part,

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.762
on fishing boats.

00:30:14.762 --> 00:30:16.970
But those two industries
are the biggest money makers

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:17.940
in Thailand.

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:22.500
And they depend almost entirely
on Cambodian, Laotian, Burmese,

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:28.620
Rohingya, import,
undocumented, indebted labor.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.330
Those surrounding countries
are super poor, super unstable,

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:34.760
and big out pushers of people.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:44.140
So what we had heard was there
was an interesting intersection

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.606
between sort of environmental
and labor issues in Thailand,

00:30:46.606 --> 00:30:47.230
and everywhere.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:48.730
But Thailand is a
great place for it

00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:51.760
because what you had was
in the last two decades,

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.600
there's been so much
overfishing close

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:59.560
to shore that the stocks of fish
are depleted closer to shore.

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.580
It can take two days to
catch what it took two

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:05.250
hours to catch two decades ago.

00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:07.600
So ships were having
to go much further

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:11.090
out from shore to reach quota.

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:17.730
And there's a point at which
the economics don't make sense,

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:19.740
because fuel is
your base expense.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:22.850
And if you get so far out,
you can't catch enough fish

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:24.420
to break even.

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.590
So that is what led to something
called transshipment, which

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:30.840
is essentially a system where
these fishing vessels, big ones

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.200
like your tuna ships
there, transshipment

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.590
is the system where the fishing
boats go way out 200, 250,

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.730
300 miles from shore,
and they stay out there.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:41.900
And they just keep fishing.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.190
And they don't come back in.

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:45.640
And mother ships like the
"Dona Liberta" go out.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:53.120
They bring ice, fuel, food,
parts, drugs, women out,

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.030
and they bring
fish back-- labor.

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:59.380
And the vessels
just keep fishing.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:01.310
What we had learned
was that if you

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:06.580
want to find really egregious,
like yesteryear type slavery,

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.380
go to the transhipment vessels.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:09.085
Go way out.

00:32:09.085 --> 00:32:11.460
Those are the ones who are--
because for obvious reasons,

00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.800
because they're
staying out there.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.758
They're way beyond the
reach of any government,

00:32:14.758 --> 00:32:16.450
and they're just
fishing all the time.

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:18.430
So our goal, the
photographer, a guy

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:21.530
named Adam Dean, an amazing
photographer as you can see,

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:23.900
and I was to see if we
could get on these vessels.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:29.830
And it took some work, took a
lot of time and luck and rats

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:31.370
and roaches.

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:34.790
But eventually we got out
onto several, one of which

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:36.450
was the one that
we really profiled,

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:41.820
which was a kind of textbook
example of this model, which

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:45.240
was four officers, all Thai.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.930
One bo's'n, he's
your middle man.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:48.790
On a plantation
he's the guy that

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:52.830
is-- he's of the ethnicity
of the forced labor,

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.650
but he answers to and gets
to stay in the big house.

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:57.750
So the bo's'n on the ship.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:01.490
And he is always going to be
of the ethnicity of the crew.

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:03.650
And the crew is never
going to be the officers.

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:07.220
So on these ships, the officers
are all Thai, only speak Thai.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:12.700
On this ship the crew of
40, mostly boys, some men,

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:17.120
all Cambodian, all indentured,
two shanghaied-- meaning

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.950
went to a bar, talking to
a prostitute, passed out.

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:22.950
Next thing they know
they're on a ship.

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:25.330
And the bo's'n is Cambodian.

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:27.270
So he speaks both
Thai-- and he's

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:32.870
the guy that beats
people, kills people.

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:35.470
And I say kills people
like in passing.

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:39.160
So in '09, just so you don't
think I'm being hyperbolic,

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:42.620
in 2009 the UN did a survey of
this demographic in the South

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:48.030
China Sea, these boats--
escaped crew, rescued crew--

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:52.540
and found that 59% of them--
and this was a peer review,

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.460
kind of vetted survey.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.990
59% of them had
witnessed a murder

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:58.985
by officers on crew-- 59%.

00:33:58.985 --> 00:34:01.820
I'd done coal, trucking,
sex trafficking,

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:03.990
like really dark
spaces on the planet.

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:05.990
I'd never seen the
level of brutality

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:08.850
that you'll find
these type of boats.

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:11.159
So we went out and
made it on this boat

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:14.219
and spent time out there and
essentially sort of documented,

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:15.100
how did you get here?

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:16.070
What's work like?

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:19.260
What are the conditions?

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:22.409
And this story was a
close look at the problem

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:25.290
of this kind of
labor, and sought

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:26.900
to-- whether we
achieved it or not, go

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:28.219
read it and you be the judge.

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:33.739
But I'll sort of explain it
from the captain's perspective.

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:39.400
Why are you so insanely brutal
and you kill people or beat

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.510
the hell out of them if there's
even the slightest kind of hint

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:46.338
of insubordination?

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:52.469
Why do you think
it's fair that you

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:55.580
can take a person,
what we would call

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:57.790
slavery-- what do you call it?

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:01.400
What they call it is a
simple labor contract.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.360
A broker came to them.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:07.490
The kid came to the border
with the trafficker.

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:08.860
The kid didn't have any money.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:09.760
And these are kids.

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.968
I mean, you look at these
pictures-- the captain said

00:35:11.968 --> 00:35:13.360
they're all over 17.

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.140
I don't how well
you can see these.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:19.010
But look at the faces on
these kids, they're 13 maybe.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:23.750
And there, the
captain's view is look,

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:29.350
I paid the labor broker,
trafficker, $400-- huge amount

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:31.220
of money-- for this guy.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:33.330
And I'm out that money.

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:37.900
This guy is going to work
for me to pay back that debt.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.754
Now of course what's ridiculous
about that is you leave port,

00:35:41.754 --> 00:35:42.920
there's no like bookkeeping.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:47.190
Hey Johnny, you earn
$20 today working.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:49.840
You leave port, you're on
that ship as long as it takes.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:53.270
So for example in
this same story,

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:56.010
not on that ship
but a prior ship,

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:58.220
we focused on one
guy named Lang Long.

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.350
Secretary Kerry and
others have sort of

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:02.930
picked up Lang Long's story and
run with it, which is great.

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:04.388
It's what you want
as a journalist.

00:36:04.388 --> 00:36:08.240
But Land Long was this
very well vetted case

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.190
that we found of a
guy who was shackled

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:13.760
by the neck for two
years at sea, sold

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.980
between three different boats.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:17.694
Standard kind of--
he's Cambodian,

00:36:17.694 --> 00:36:18.860
came in through traffickers.

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.200
He thought he was getting
a job in construction,

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.260
ends up on a boat,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:27.440
Tried to escape when a mother
ship came out, jumped over, got

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.530
brought back on board.

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:31.400
And whenever he wasn't
working he was in a shackle.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:35.590
And this isn't me saying it,
this is a separate mothership

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:39.370
came out and a guy saw that and
said, what the hell is this,

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:41.330
and proceeded over
the next nine months

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:44.960
to report back to an advocacy
group, the Thai government,

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:48.420
and negotiate the purchase
of that guy off the ship.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:50.745
And Lang Long was someone
that whose story we landed,

00:36:50.745 --> 00:36:51.620
had him in the story.

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:57.410
So anyway, so this was the
third-- three minutes--

00:36:57.410 --> 00:37:01.200
the third story in the series,
probably one of the toughest

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.470
to report.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:03.970
So let's pull out
and let me just

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:09.050
figure out what would be the
best one to move to next,

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:10.090
and finally.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:12.660
So let's do that one.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:16.810
This was one of those stories
that you almost kind of

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:18.620
are a channel for.

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:23.530
I didn't write this story,
this story wrote through me.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:25.200
It was just a great yarn.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.330
And it spoke to larger
issues about lawlessness,

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:29.770
but here's the story.

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:34.100
So again, I got a call
when I was out at sea.

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.180
I had a satellite phone.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.740
I got a call from a
source, a law enforcement

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.780
person who knew I was on the
market for really good maritime

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:42.630
stories.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.620
The person said, have you
heard about this chase?

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:47.110
No.

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:49.970
It's the longest chase
in nautical history.

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:51.490
And it's a law
enforcement chase,

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:52.781
but there are no cops involved.

00:37:52.781 --> 00:37:54.710
I said OK, I'm sold.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:56.270
How do I get on it?

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:57.110
Is it going on now?

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:58.800
Yes.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.470
So the story is
simply that there's

00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.810
this group, you guys probably
know them, Sea Shepherd.

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:06.690
It's an offshoot of Greenpeace,
a more radical, direct action

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:07.190
group.

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:09.010
They're on the
show "Whale Wars."

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:11.890
They've had all sorts of run ins
with the Japanese government,

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:18.550
well-funded, Hollywood kind of
backed sort of marine advocacy

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:19.520
group.

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.860
They have a bunch of ships.

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:25.860
And they kind of conducted
an interesting experiment,

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:29.370
which was so Interpol has a
list called the purple list.

00:38:29.370 --> 00:38:35.180
And it is the list you get on
as a ship if you're really bad.

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:39.250
And you have to work to
get on the purple list.

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:41.029
But it's an arrest
on sight list.

00:38:41.029 --> 00:38:42.820
And at the time there
were only seven ships

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:46.080
in the world that were on
Interpol's purple list.

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:48.250
And essentially if
you're on that list,

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:50.490
every country in the world
is supposed to stop you.

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:52.652
No one ever does.

00:38:52.652 --> 00:38:54.860
The top of that list was a
ship called the "Thunder."

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:56.540
and the reason it
had top ranking

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:59.250
was because it had
earned $67 million

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:03.164
worth of money
poaching, stealing fish

00:39:03.164 --> 00:39:04.580
from places it
wasn't supposed to,

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:06.580
mostly from
Antarctica and mostly

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:09.960
Chilean sea bass, more
commonly known as toothfish.

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:14.930
You buy it at restaurants,
high end restaurants, hotels.

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:19.290
So the "Thunder," which is
the one that's sinking there,

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:21.810
had a decade and a
half of stealing fish.

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:24.380
And Sea Shepherd
said you know what,

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:26.230
we're sick of governments
not doing anything

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.447
about these guys.

00:39:27.447 --> 00:39:28.280
They're right there.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.363
Everyone knows about them.

00:39:29.363 --> 00:39:30.190
No one stops them.

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:32.370
We're going to go out and
find the seven purple list

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:33.800
vessels, wherever
they are in the world,

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.110
and we're going to chase them.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:36.568
And we're just
going to chase them.

00:39:36.568 --> 00:39:38.566
And we're going to raise
holy hell every time

00:39:38.566 --> 00:39:39.690
they try to come into port.

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:40.190
That was it.

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:41.180
That was their goal.

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:44.240
And literally when they
kind of floated the idea

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.780
within the maritime
community, some people sort of

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:49.100
rolled their eyes, like
good luck finding them.

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:52.300
Within two weeks, Sea
Shepherd in Antarctica

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.730
found the "Thunder,"
nets in the water.

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:57.380
And how they did that is really
interesting, to me at least.

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:59.274
But they did it.

00:39:59.274 --> 00:40:00.440
And they began chasing them.

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.480
And thus began a
10,000 mile chase

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:05.130
that went from Antarctica
to the coast of Africa.

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:08.010
And it's like this
epic, cinematic story.

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:10.050
The "Thunder" tried
to shake their chasers

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:12.540
by going through this
really impossibly

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:15.137
dangerous area of
icebergs in Antarctica--

00:40:15.137 --> 00:40:15.970
couldn't shake them.

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:17.870
Two ships, the "Bob
Barker" and the "Sam

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:19.120
Simon--" I'm not making it up.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:19.953
Those are the names.

00:40:19.953 --> 00:40:22.580
Those are the benefactors.

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:23.950
These ships just chased them.

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:26.060
They went through a
category five storm.

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:29.980
We have footage on the website
of the insane conditions.

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:31.380
Couldn't shake them.

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:32.630
Tried to outrun them.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:36.770
At one point the Sea Shepherd
guys, the "Thunder" guys

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:38.082
needed food.

00:40:38.082 --> 00:40:39.540
Well we don't know
why they did it,

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.040
but they put nets
back in the water.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.310
And the Sea Shepherd guys
said we're taking your nets.

00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:44.710
And they went out,
they took their nets,

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:45.280
pulled them on board.

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.560
The "Thunder" captain--
we have the audio of it.

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:50.330
He's a Chilean and I speak
Spanish, so I listened to it.

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:55.030
But he, profanity
laden pissed, and says

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:56.200
we're coming after you.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.530
So for six straight
hours, the "Thunder"

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:00.590
chased the Sea Shepherd guys.

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:02.560
So it's just like you
can't make these stories.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.940
I was like, I'm not sure I
can live up to the story.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:08.560
I don't even have to get this
story, I just have to write it.

00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:10.630
So this was this great story.

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:13.450
And again, it fit perfectly
in my conceptual umbrella

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:17.160
of lawlessness out in the void.

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:23.290
And I left and headed home
thinking wow, how can I get

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:26.210
that into 5,000 words or less.

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:28.730
I'm at Amsterdam or somewhere,
I can't remember where,

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:30.230
but a layover.

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:31.024
I get a call.

00:41:31.024 --> 00:41:32.440
You're not going
to believe what's

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.565
happening to the "Thunder."

00:41:33.565 --> 00:41:35.980
And I thought, the story's
already dramatic enough.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:39.190
And I left before it had
culminated because it

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:40.530
was going on and on and on.

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:43.380
And it wasn't clear when they
were going to stop running.

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.589
And they might get refueled
by some sketchy Nigerians

00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:46.880
that they were heading towards.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.180
And I was just like, this
is going to go on forever.

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:49.930
So I left.

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:50.516
I get a call.

00:41:50.516 --> 00:41:52.390
You're not going to
believe what's happening.

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:53.760
The "Thunder's" sinking.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.396
And literally I remember turning
to the board, the big board--

00:41:56.396 --> 00:41:58.354
you, know, airports--
and trying to figure out,

00:41:58.354 --> 00:41:59.730
can i get back to Ghana?

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:02.475
Is there any way to
get back to this?

00:42:02.475 --> 00:42:03.350
Obviously I couldn't.

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:05.690
It took days and days
to get out there.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.040
So the "Thunder"
ultimately sunk itself.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:08.860
The crew got off.

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:09.750
The officers got off.

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:13.100
What's the word?

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:14.730
I'm having a stroke here.

00:42:14.730 --> 00:42:17.480
They're rescued by
the Sea Shepherd

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.100
guys, taken to Sao
Tome and Principe,

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:21.580
handed over to the police.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.320
They've since been
prosecuted, convicted.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:27.150
The officers are looking at
two years and $5 million.

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:31.390
The crew just following orders,
all Indonesian, sent home.

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:34.430
But that ending I never
would have predicted

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:36.640
and is the perfect sort
of capstone to the story,

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.370
because down with it,
a mile and a half,

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:41.110
went the evidence
of their crimes.

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:43.220
Now they got
prosecuted, so it ended

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.260
in a way that often
doesn't happen.

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.640
But many of these
stories end this way

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:52.300
where, when the jig is up,
you just sink the evidence,

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:54.170
and it's very hard to
prove things at sea.

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:58.730
And that gets, again, to the
difficulty of law enforcement

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:00.080
on these waters.

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:03.570
So I'm going to ungracefully
and really abruptly stop there.

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:08.170
There are about four other
stories in the series.

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:11.661
I think it's better to just
open up the Q&amp;A and we can talk.

00:43:11.661 --> 00:43:12.160
So thanks.

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:15.555
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:24.542
You have the first.

00:43:24.542 --> 00:43:26.000
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for writing these.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.090
I've really enjoyed them.

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:31.720
I spent a lot of time on small
boats in nice neighborhoods.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:36.430
So I have a hard time kind
of thinking of a world

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:38.890
where I see a lot of
kindness and people

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:41.070
help you if you're in
trouble and so on with this.

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:43.620
Is it really a matter
of bad neighborhoods,

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:46.360
or have I just been sheltered?

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:47.405
And what do you think?

00:43:47.405 --> 00:43:48.780
IAN URBINA: It's
a good question.

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:53.380
So it's such a huge
space that most of what

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:56.750
happens out there, in my
view, is people staying away

00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:59.120
from each other, by design,
by decision, or just

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.780
by the nature of how big it is.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:07.780
So the bad stuff isn't
all the time, everywhere.

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:10.480
It's not packed in.

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.630
At the same time, what struck
me wasn't the frequency,

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:16.610
it was the impunity.

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:19.799
And so I wouldn't
try to put a number.

00:44:19.799 --> 00:44:21.340
We did with the
violence story and we

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.980
crunched all sorts
of data and tried

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:26.670
to get some estimates on how
often that stuff happens.

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:28.600
And the numbers are
pretty striking.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.725
Take a look at that story and
what we had was very partial.

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:36.280
But what I will say is
there are some places

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:41.260
in the world and some
orders of vessels where

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:43.120
it's a really brutal place.

00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:48.120
So I would say if you're
looking to find bad stuff, go

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:52.510
get a job on a Taiwanese
tuna longliner,

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:55.950
or many of these mother ships
that service the third world.

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:02.750
The discipline that's
exerted on the crew

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:07.060
and what happens on those
boats is pretty severe.

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:09.000
So I don't think it's
just where you are,

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.630
I also think it's the
type of vessel you're on.

00:45:14.452 --> 00:45:16.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thanks
for writing that series.

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:18.030
I really enjoyed it.

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:20.950
So the sea has
historically been a place

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:25.720
of both danger and criminality,
but also adventure.

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:28.910
I was wondering is the fact
that in this day and age

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:33.690
it still exists as like a Wild
West of lawlessness-- obviously

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:36.100
you've exposed a lot of the
horrible stuff that goes on

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:36.890
out there.

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:39.150
Is there any tinge
of romance left to it

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:42.710
that there's an ungoverned
place left on Earth?

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:45.210
IAN URBINA: Yeah, I think
you put it really gracefully.

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:47.550
And it is something that
I give short shrift to,

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:50.370
because sort of by
the nature of my beat,

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:52.499
I'm supposed to focus
on what's broken.

00:45:52.499 --> 00:45:54.290
I have a 12-year-old,
and he's always like,

00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:56.980
Dad, another negative story.

00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:00.110
You know, why can't you--
I'm like, this is what I do.

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:05.440
So just to riff
on what you said,

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:07.940
there's this notion of
"Mare Liberum," which

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:12.490
is sort of in some ways
a conceptual precursor

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:13.640
to international law.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:17.380
And this Dutch lawyer named
Grotius came up with it.

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:20.850
And it was kind of what gave
rise intellectually and legally

00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:22.890
to free trade.

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:25.820
And it had lots of
components, one of which

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:29.420
was hey look guys, us
governments that are starting

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:33.420
to form, let's agree that
we leave each other alone

00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:35.970
out in that space,
the high seas area.

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:37.200
And the 12 is interesting.

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.310
It's a cannon shot.

00:46:38.310 --> 00:46:40.080
That's where that
number originally came.

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:44.620
So when people get too close and
they can hit you with a cannon,

00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:45.800
that's national waters.

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.990
But out beyond that, it's
international waters.

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:52.220
And let's have that be
a kind of public space

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.720
where we don't mess
with each other.

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:58.130
And let's all agree that those
guys that do, the, pirates, we

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:00.550
will team up together
to kick their ass.

00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:02.860
Like that's the core
and really crass version

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:04.850
of "Mare Liberum."

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:08.780
And it's also the core of
just what you hint at, which

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:10.470
is the romance, which is real.

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:11.680
It's a beautiful space.

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:12.720
It's an open space.

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:19.540
It's really kind of an
embodiment of freedom

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:21.400
because of its huge expanse.

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:25.270
And it's also an essential
space for commerce in the sense

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:32.810
that part of the way that
a designer in New York

00:47:32.810 --> 00:47:35.920
can think up a new
style of dress,

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.490
and a week later it's
on a monitor in Taiwan,

00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:41.800
and a week after that it's being
mass produced in Bangladesh,

00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:44.570
and the dye is
coming from Tokyo,

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:46.750
and then it's in a
container on a ship

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:48.960
and headed back to
New York for sale

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:53.940
a week after that, part of the
way you can have rapid commerce

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:58.790
is because there are
no checkpoints and toll

00:47:58.790 --> 00:48:01.780
booths on the high seas.

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:05.250
That's why 90% of commerce
comes by way of sea,

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:07.570
because it's fast-- relatively.

00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:11.460
Not as fast as a plane--
and cheap and unfettered.

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:13.550
So from a philosophical
point of view

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:16.090
it is a beautiful place
where people go, historically

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:18.590
and presently, to get
away from governments

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:21.200
and to get away from people.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.600
But it's also an
economic thruway

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:28.660
that, because it's
lawless, is essential

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:31.910
to globalized markets.

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:34.020
And I obviously didn't
spend much time on that,

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:38.250
but I do really
think you're right.

00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:40.654
AUDIENCE: So I know this is
kind of going against your--

00:48:40.654 --> 00:48:42.320
I was going to bring
up a point that was

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:44.450
against your editorial dictate.

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:47.550
But in addition to all of
these bad issues of slavery

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:50.270
on the high seas and violence
and brutality and everything

00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:52.520
else, there's also sort of
the environmental issues

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:57.480
of them using bunker fuel, also
with like scrubbers systems

00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:58.620
whatsoever.

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:01.020
So one really big ship can
put out as much pollution

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:03.460
as all the cars
in New York City.

00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:06.440
So what's the point of
fixing things on land

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:07.920
if the ships are so polluting?

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.910
So just with all
those issues, and it

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:12.890
tinges on human rights and the
environment and everything,

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:15.500
can anything actually be
done to solve these problems,

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:17.940
or is there anything
that's going to be done?

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:20.360
Or is it just permanently
kind of a lawless land

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:24.770
and let it be?

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:27.110
IAN URBINA: Yes, a lot
can, and already is,

00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:30.456
and each day I think
is more being done

00:49:30.456 --> 00:49:31.580
on the environmental front.

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:35.590
And I would think that there
are two different categories

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:37.050
of environmental concerns.

00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:39.120
There's above water
and below water.

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.860
So above water, like you say,
the type of fuel that's burnt

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:45.760
is really, really polluting.

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:50.160
And there are large
quantities of it.

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:53.700
And below water,
technology has meant

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:56.980
that fishing has become more
like industrial harvesting

00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:59.750
and less like fishing.

00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:07.690
So you have bigger ships, more
effective ships, better sonar,

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:09.370
better GPS.

00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:12.280
It's a glass top
table now, and you

00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:14.910
can see everything down below.

00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:17.880
And so what that has meant
in the last three decades--

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:19.610
and if you would jump
to the Palau story.

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:23.570
It's the very last story
Craig, the very last story.

00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:25.960
So the very last
story, which I ended up

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.850
going to the magazine to
do, is the fish story.

00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:31.190
It's the environmental story.

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:35.530
And it's about this tiny
archipelago nation of Palau

00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:38.870
which has the landmass
of Philadelphia

00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:41.490
and the water space of France.

00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:44.320
And they have one
ship and 18 men.

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:48.680
And that country, Palau,
has been more aggressive

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.560
probably than any
country in the world,

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.060
for lots of
self-interested reasons.

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:53.930
50% of the GDP
comes from tourism,

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:55.500
and that's all water tourism.

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:57.440
That's shark and coral.

00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.940
And they're in a rough
neighborhood in terms

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:02.470
of poachers, near
the biggest markets,

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:05.480
both the biggest fleets and
the biggest consumers of fish

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.350
in the world are
all around them .

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:10.150
So you've got this in
amazing David and Goliath

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:14.550
or Sisyphus story, whichever
way you want to go.

00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:15.590
And so I went.

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:16.660
That's not their ship.

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:18.660
Thankfully that's one of
the ships they boarded,

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:19.760
the one you're seeing.

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:25.370
But I went for an embed with
that kind of police force

00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:28.490
and sort of used that
synecdoche as sort

00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:34.440
of what might the world learn
about the importance of getting

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:37.830
a handle on how
quickly we're depleting

00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:42.900
the ocean of its residents
and what we can now,

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:47.010
in the era of big data
and drones and satellites,

00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:51.440
potentially do to
police those waters.

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:54.336
And Google, your employer,
is actually in the story

00:51:54.336 --> 00:51:58.009
and is playing an important
role on the big data front.

00:51:58.009 --> 00:52:00.932
You may already know about that.

00:52:00.932 --> 00:52:02.390
So to answer your
question, yeah, I

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:03.980
think there's a lot
that can be done.

00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:07.990
I do think technology
in particular

00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:12.750
can be a force for good
in slowing technology's

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:15.590
role in the force for bad.

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:22.146
And I think also you
have more awareness now

00:52:22.146 --> 00:52:25.830
of how all these things relate.

00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:28.590
You know, Secretary Kerry
said the other day-- not

00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:34.290
to keep quoting him-- but
in an interview said, look,

00:52:34.290 --> 00:52:39.750
our view is that the chase
story is the Lang Long story,

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:42.540
or the illegal fishing story
is that sea slavery story.

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:46.180
These are integrated,
connected stories.

00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:48.460
And that's the
transshipment point.

00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:51.270
The more desperate things
get, the harsher things

00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:54.240
are going to get, from a labor
and human rights perspective

00:52:54.240 --> 00:53:01.270
and also-- So I'm a
little bit more hopeful

00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:03.680
than the series may imply.

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.264
Someone else has got
a question, yeah.

00:53:05.264 --> 00:53:06.680
AUDIENCE: I mean,
governments used

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:07.950
to take a pretty active role.

00:53:07.950 --> 00:53:09.590
I mean they would
send ships out there

00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:11.450
and they'd hang everyone
they brought in.

00:53:11.450 --> 00:53:14.630
Or if they caught you fishing
where you weren't supposed to,

00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:17.170
they took your boat and
they tossed you in jail.

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:19.734
What are governments
doing about these things?

00:53:19.734 --> 00:53:22.400
Now it sounds like you're saying
that they're largely abdicating

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.420
their historical role?

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:27.690
IAN URBINA: Well so I come
down in altitude a little bit.

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:30.040
I don't know if I can answer
for governments writ large.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:31.320
It varies drastically.

00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:34.350
So in the case of Palau, there's
this interesting exchange

00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:37.440
we had in the wheel
room with those cops.

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.590
And they were kind of
looking at Indonesia

00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:43.830
which has a fisheries manager,
this woman named Susi who

00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:46.260
has kind of really stepped up.

00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:47.840
And part of that
is geopolitical.

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:49.070
And it's Spratly related.

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:50.680
And it's Indonesia
flexing its muscle

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.179
saying you come in
our waters, we're

00:53:52.179 --> 00:53:53.810
going to do something about it.

00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:56.190
But part of it is
genuinely concerned

00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:58.590
about human rights and
environmental concerns.

00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:01.062
But Indonesia has taken
a very aggressive role.

00:54:01.062 --> 00:54:02.520
They catch your
boat, they burn it.

00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:03.350
They take you off.

00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:04.510
They send you home.

00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:06.360
They burn your boat.

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:09.360
The Palauans looked
over at the Indonesians.

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:10.530
They're cops, right?

00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:12.680
These are macho
guys and they also

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:15.800
want to succeed in their
job like we all do.

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.587
And they were seeing
repeat fliers.

00:54:18.587 --> 00:54:20.920
There's this funny anecdote,
didn't make it in the story

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:23.490
but made it in the
second story, about this,

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:28.090
where these guys are at the end
of the day pretty nice guys.

00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:30.400
And they're sympathetic
with the deckhands who

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:33.210
are just very poor
guys following orders

00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:34.260
on these poacher vessels.

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:35.680
They're not getting
rich from it.

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:38.010
Not even the captain's
getting rich, it's the owner.

00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:40.340
And so when they would
arrest the poachers,

00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:43.980
they'd bring them back in and
they'd take a clothing donation

00:54:43.980 --> 00:54:45.560
from their families.

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.060
And oftentimes the
shirts that would end up

00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:51.740
in the donated box for
the arrested deckhands

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:52.901
would be campaign shirts.

00:54:52.901 --> 00:54:53.400
Why?

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:55.024
Because they're cheap
and they're free.

00:54:55.024 --> 00:54:57.376
You know, they're handed
out at each presidential--

00:54:57.376 --> 00:55:00.200
The Palauans were saying
that every couple months,

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.610
they would see these same
deck hands on other boats

00:55:03.610 --> 00:55:07.320
with like elect Smith,
the Palauan Kennedy.

00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:10.120
These guys are Filipino
or Taiwanese or whatever,

00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:12.450
and they're realizing,
these are repeat fliers,

00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:14.600
and this is sort of
really frustrating

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:16.720
because are we really
doing anything here?

00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:19.030
They're coming back and
they're coming back.

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:21.800
But to answer your
question, it ranges

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:28.040
from really aggressive
postures like Indonesia

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:32.810
to really permissive postures
like Seychelles and Fiji

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:36.130
that just you can do anything.

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:38.000
And the problem with
maritime enforcement

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.540
is it's insanely expensive.

00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:42.290
To really do it,
you either need help

00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:45.510
from big muscular institutions
like Google in Oceania

00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:47.300
or the US government,
US military.

00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:50.422
Or if you're on your own,
you need boats and planes.

00:55:50.422 --> 00:55:52.630
A lot of these countries
that have the richest waters

00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:54.980
don't have boats and
planes to be patrolling.

00:55:58.165 --> 00:55:59.530
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:55:59.530 --> 00:56:00.990
I sort of have a
similar question

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:04.480
on countries abdicating
their role in a lot of this,

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.730
but I think it's interesting
is a lot of the headlines

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:10.619
that we see other than these are
stories about South China Sea

00:56:10.619 --> 00:56:12.410
and how a lot of
countries are aggressively

00:56:12.410 --> 00:56:15.760
trying to claim territory,
ocean territory, as their own

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:17.850
for their own
geopolitical interests.

00:56:17.850 --> 00:56:20.174
So I'm sort of curious
from your perspective,

00:56:20.174 --> 00:56:21.840
in some ways it seems
like they wouldn't

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:25.290
want to abdicate this role
because it shows that they

00:56:25.290 --> 00:56:26.460
have control over an area.

00:56:26.460 --> 00:56:29.600
So I'm curious if you looked
into that part of it at all

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:32.680
or where that overlaps with
what you were interested in.

00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:34.000
IAN URBINA: Yeah, so there
are different things going

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:34.590
on there.

00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:36.634
So you look at
Spratlys And for those

00:56:36.634 --> 00:56:38.350
who haven't been
following it, this

00:56:38.350 --> 00:56:42.320
is this area that's
a contested area.

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:43.730
And the Philippines lays claim.

00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:44.670
The Chinese lay claim.

00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:45.610
And others lay claim.

00:56:45.610 --> 00:56:47.640
And the Chinese are the
big boys on the block

00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:49.672
and they're building an island.

00:56:49.672 --> 00:56:52.180
They're taking ownership.

00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:54.810
Possession is 9/10 of
the laws as they say.

00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:57.710
And so the Chinese government
has built an island

00:56:57.710 --> 00:57:00.860
where there wasn't one and
have now a landing strip.

00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:02.920
They have soldiers on there.

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:03.654
Why?

00:57:03.654 --> 00:57:04.820
Has nothing do with fishing.

00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:07.180
It has to do with
mineral rights.

00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:09.020
There's oil and
there's gas and there's

00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:12.950
subsea minerals that are
insanely valuable, much

00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:16.080
for the computers that we
use, like rare earth stuff,

00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:17.520
but also oil and gas.

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:19.020
And that's really
what that's about.

00:57:19.020 --> 00:57:20.450
That's what the
Spratlys is about.

00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:21.960
And that's really
where governments

00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.310
tend to flex muscle.

00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:27.890
Fishing isn't lucrative
enough, generally

00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:35.445
speaking, for countries with big
militaries or navies to care.

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:41.640
Mineral rights, now
you're in big money.

00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:45.970
So what you do have
is symbolic clashes

00:57:45.970 --> 00:57:48.550
where it seems like it's
over the fisherman who

00:57:48.550 --> 00:57:50.260
was shot by that other country.

00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:50.820
It's not.

00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:53.250
Really it's about
something higher order,

00:57:53.250 --> 00:57:56.700
but it's playing out over that.

00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:59.560
And so you have
these clashes where

00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:03.530
the Vietnamese and the
Indonesians and even

00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:07.360
the Palauans will arrest.

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:09.450
So for example
with Palau, there's

00:58:09.450 --> 00:58:14.950
this bizarre incident where the
Palauans were really, really

00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:15.870
frustrated.

00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:20.170
And there was this
one atoll where

00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:25.140
they kept spotting this one set
of poachers, day in, day out.

00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:25.900
They chased them.

00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:27.297
These guys had souped up boats.

00:58:27.297 --> 00:58:27.880
They got away.

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:28.320
They got away.

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:28.903
They got away.

00:58:28.903 --> 00:58:31.460
And finally they went
after them and they tried

00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:32.720
to shoot out their engines.

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:36.630
And they say that bullets
ricocheted off the engine.

00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:39.270
The guy had four
bullet holes on him.

00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:41.760
But a Chinese
deckhand was killed.

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:45.850
And thus began this
dramatic incident,

00:58:45.850 --> 00:58:47.040
which is in the story.

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:52.380
But that spurred this
huge diplomatic row

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:55.460
between China and Palau.

00:58:55.460 --> 00:59:00.420
And It played out over fishing
rights and mining rights

00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:03.890
and tourism subsidy dollars
and all these other things.

00:59:03.890 --> 00:59:07.740
And the newspapers focused
on the dead deckhand,

00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:10.760
but it really had to do
with much bigger things.

00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:12.970
So anyway, to answer
your question,

00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:19.840
yeah, countries are exerting
their jurisdictional claims

00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:23.710
with their navies when there
is a lot more at stake.

00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:28.320
That doesn't usually play
out on a fishing level.

00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:29.612
I can talk about this forever.

00:59:29.612 --> 00:59:31.070
You guys have a
job to get back to.

00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:35.090
So any other questions?

00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:37.180
All right, well
thanks for coming.

00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:41.420
[APPLAUSE]
