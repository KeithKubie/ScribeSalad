The way the GPU, usually solves the visibility problem, is by using what is

00:00:04.848 --> 00:00:09.450
called a Z buffer or if you have British meanings, it is pronounced zed buffer.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.212
The artist Lennart Anderson once said, landscape painting is really just a box

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:16.803
of air with little marks in it telling you how far back in that air things are,

00:00:16.803 --> 00:00:20.508
it's not the[UNKNOWN] of quotes, but this is a pretty good description of the Z

00:00:20.508 --> 00:00:25.024
buffer algorithm. The Z in the Z buffer stands for distance from the camera.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:29.578
Buffer is just another word for a data array like an image. So, for the image,

00:00:29.578 --> 00:00:33.484
in addition to storing a color at each pixel we also store a distance which is

00:00:33.484 --> 00:00:37.792
called the z-depth. The z-depth is often considered as a floating point number

00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:42.082
that ranges from 0, meaning close to the eye to 1, meaning the maximum distance

00:00:42.082 --> 00:00:45.854
from the eye. The z-buffer is initially cleared by filling O with 1s.
