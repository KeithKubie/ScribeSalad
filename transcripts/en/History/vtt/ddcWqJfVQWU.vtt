00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.210
NARRATOR: Rendlesham Forest,
Suffolk County, England.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.330
200 miles east of Rudloe
Manor lies six square miles

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.040
of woodlands that
has become notorious

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.330
as the site of Great Britain's
most incredible UFO encounter.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.920
On December 26, 1980, near an
air base leased to the United

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.080
States Air Force by
the RAF, strange lights

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.170
are reported on the horizon
in what appears to be

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.580
a possible downed aircraft.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.750
Two US servicemen are
dispatched to the site.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.250
According to accounts, radios
failed as they approached

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.880
the targeted area, and the
air itself felt electrically

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.500
charged as they closed in.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.250
Once at the
so-called crash site,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.500
the men observed a
strange triangular

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.250
craft on the ground
approximately three meters wide

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.000
at its base.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.460
NICK POPE: It appeared to be
either hovering or on legs,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.460
and it had clearly come down
into this small clearing

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.210
and smashed some of the
branches off the tree.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.540
So there was physical evidence,
which was looked at afterwards.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.210
And so the men looked
at this strange object.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.040
JAMES PENNISTON: I noticed
that there was an inscription

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.880
on the side of the aircraft.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.290
I was expecting to find--

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.250
I don't know-- USAF,
something like that.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.120
And what I find is
glyphs, pictorial glyphs,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.920
making no sense at all.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.210
And then I was running my hand
over the side of the craft.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.460
It was very warm to the touch.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.620
At this time, we were getting
the feeling of electricity

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.580
that was just bouncing.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.500
It was much, much stronger.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.500
There was this feeling
of being drawn into it

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.420
or being pulled into
it, like someone

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.120
was holding a picture
up of zeroes and ones

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.830
in my mind's eye.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.000
NARRATOR: The strange
vision Sergeant Penniston

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
had upon touching the craft
has made this one of Britain's

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.580
most famous UFO encounters.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.290
But ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.290
that even more compelling
is what happened after.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.500
The following evening,
further strange sightings

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.750
occurred, and also the night
after, reported by US Air Force

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.330
Colonel Charles
Halt. Colonel Halt

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.000
led his own search party to
put an end to the confusion.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.210
But instead of finding
a logical explanation,

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.120
they discovered high
levels of radioactivity

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.790
where Burroughs
and Penniston had

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.790
previously seen the strange
craft and three impact holes

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:46.380
in the ground.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.540
They then spotted a
light in a nearby field

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.040
that suddenly came towards
them through the trees

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.500
at high speed.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.620
One of the people with me
said, look there to the north.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.210
There were four or five
objects in the sky.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.000
They were elliptical and round.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.670
They changed shape.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.710
They moved at very
high speed, made

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.250
sharp angular turns, as
though they were doing

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.880
some type of a grid search.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.500
One came at high speed, stopped
directly overhead 3,000, 4,000,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.420
maybe 5,000 feet, and sent
down a concentrated beam

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.880
about 8 or 10 feet from us.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.170
It was about a foot in diameter.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.420
I would describe it today as
probably like a laser beam.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.920
We noticed the other
object in the sky

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.250
sending down similar
beams on Woodbridge Base.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.580
Apparently, these beams
were falling down into or

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.000
near the weapons storage area.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.500
I was really concerned then.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.210
[music playing]

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.080
I suspect it was some
kind of scam to see what was

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.620
inside, the ordnance inside.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.420
What we do know is Lieutenant
Colonel Halt saw Colonel

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.620
Williams just a few hours later
and told him that beams had

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.790
been shown down into the
storage bunkers, and he said,

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.420
I think the ordnance
needs to be checked out.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.460
NARRATOR: If Colonel
Halt's report is true,

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.960
why were these craft
emitting beams of light

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.960
down into the Woodbridge Base?

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.120
According to some ancient
astronaut theorists,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.710
they may have been
conducting a search,

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:26.790
not for nuclear weapons, but
for one of their own craft.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.250
NICK POPE: They were
moving around erratically,

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.500
he said, as if it was conducting
some sort of grid search.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.920
And the reason he said that
was that beams of light

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.920
were firing down from this
UFO into one of the most

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.290
sensitive parts of the base--

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.000
the weapons storage area.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.670
Maybe the aliens would be
looking for crashed UFOs, maybe

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.330
their own alien
technology, to prevent

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.670
us from trying to
back engineer it

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.670
and build our own spacecraft.
