00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.210
You are solving a system
of two linear equations

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.520
in two variables.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.530
You have found more
than one solution

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.270
that satisfies the system.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.184
Which of the following
statements is true?

00:00:10.184 --> 00:00:11.850
So before even reading
these statements,

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.475
let's just think
about what's going on.

00:00:13.475 --> 00:00:15.580
So let me draw my axes here.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.820
Let's draw my axes.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.510
So this is going to
be my vertical axis.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.290
That could be one
of the variables.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.984
And then this is
my horizontal axis.

00:00:23.984 --> 00:00:25.400
That's one of the
other variables.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.890
And maybe, for sake of
convention, this could be x,

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.900
and this could be y, but they're
whatever our two variables are.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.430
So it's a system of
two linear equations.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.920
So if we're graphing them,
each of the linear equations

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.850
in two variables can be
represented by a line.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.290
Now, there's only
three scenarios here.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.856
One scenario is where the
lines don't intersect at all.

00:00:44.856 --> 00:00:46.230
So the only way
that you're going

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.890
to have two lines in two
dimensions that don't intersect

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.200
is if they have the
same slope and they

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.634
have different y-intercepts.

00:00:52.634 --> 00:00:54.050
So that's one
scenario, but that's

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.280
not the scenario that's
being described here.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.350
They say, you have found
more than one solution

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.460
that satisfies the system.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.280
Here there are no solutions.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.870
So that's not the scenario
that we're talking about.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.340
There's another
scenario where they

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.110
intersect in exactly one place.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.420
So they intersect in
exactly one place.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.110
There's one point, one
xy-coordinate right over there

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.970
that satisfies both
of these constraints,

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.330
but this also is not the
scenario they're talking about.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.640
They're telling us that you have
found more than one solution

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.840
that satisfies the system.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.740
So this isn't the
scenario either.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.790
So the only other scenario
that we can have-- we

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.760
don't have parallel lines
that don't intersect.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.010
We don't have lines that
only intersect in one place.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.150
The only other scenario is that
we're dealing with a situation

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.430
where both linear
equations are essentially

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.740
the same constraint.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.640
They both are
essentially representing

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.190
the same xy-relationship.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.850
That's the only way that
I can have two lines,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.620
and this only applies to
linear relationship and lines.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.010
But the only way that
two lines can intersect

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.880
more than one place is if
they intersect everywhere.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.550
So in this situation,
we know that we

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.610
must have an infinite
number of solutions.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.500
So which of these
choices say that?

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.250
This one right here-- "there are
infinitely many more solutions

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.580
to the system"--
right over there.
