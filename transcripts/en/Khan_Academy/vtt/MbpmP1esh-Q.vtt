00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.036
Let's divide 3,771 by 8.

00:00:06.036 --> 00:00:08.119
So we're going to do a
little bit of long division

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.480
is the way we set it up.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.350
So the first thing we
want to do and think

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.340
about is, well,
does 8 go into 3?

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.200
Well, no, 8 does not go into 3.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.210
So we'll keep moving.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.580
Does 8 go into 37?

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.100
Sure.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.900
8 times 4 is 37.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.950
8 times 5 is 40.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:22.930
So that's too big.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.840
So 8 goes into 37 four times.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.170
4 times 8 is 32.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.267
And we subtract, and we
get 37 minus 32 is 5.

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:39.600
And just so you have a little
glimpse of what's actually

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.150
going on here,
we're really saying

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.080
how many times does
8 go into 3,700?

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.964
And we're saying that 8
goes into 3,700 400 times.

00:00:48.964 --> 00:00:50.630
There's 4 sitting in
the hundreds place,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.640
and that 400 times 8 is 3,200.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.210
And then when you subtract 3,200
from 3,700, you're getting 500.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.010
But we'll revert back to just
the traditional long division

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.510
mechanics.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.780
But that's what's
really going on here.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.680
When we say 8 goes
into 37 four times,

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.050
we're really saying 8
goes into 3,700 400 times.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.310
But let's keep going.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.989
So now, we have
this 5 to deal with,

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:12.530
which is, as we
already talked about,

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.654
it's in the hundreds place.

00:01:13.654 --> 00:01:15.370
It's really a 500.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.020
But now, let's bring
down another place value.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.690
So let's bring down the 7.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.780
And let's think about how
many times does 8 go into 57.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.580
And we're really thinking
about how much 8 goes into 570.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.110
But 8 goes into 57-- let's
see, 8 times 5 is 40.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.350
8 times 6 is 48.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.350
8 times 7 is 54.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.750
So let's go 7 times.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.869
7 times 8.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.160
Oh, actually, I did that right.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.110
8 times 7-- my multiplication
tables are weak.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.000
It is 8 times-- so it
does go in seven times.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.120
But 7 times 8 isn't 54; it's 56.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.280
I always have trouble
with that one.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.120
It is 56.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.340
And so now, we subtract again.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.970
And 57 minus 56 is 1.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.140
And now we have one more
place value to bring down.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.949
We have-- let me do it in in
a color I haven't used yet.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:10.930
I'll do blue.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.404
We have a 1 to bring down.

00:02:13.404 --> 00:02:15.320
And now we're literally
saying, how many times

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.510
does 8 go into 11?

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.600
Well, 8 goes into 11 one time.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.060
1 times 8 is 8.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.730
And we are left
with-- because we

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.080
have no more places to bring
down-- 11 minus 8 is 3.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:39.740
So 8 goes into 3,771 471 times,
and the remainder here is 3.
