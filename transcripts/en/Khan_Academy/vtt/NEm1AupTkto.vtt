00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.466
- In an attempt to rescue
a small isolated population

00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:05.316
of snakes from decline,

00:00:05.316 --> 00:00:06.586
a few male snakes

00:00:06.586 --> 00:00:08.347
from several larger populations

00:00:08.347 --> 00:00:10.650
of the same species were introduced

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.335
into the population in 1992.

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:15.728
The snakes reproduce sexually,

00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:18.703
and there are abundant
resources in the environment.

00:00:18.703 --> 00:00:20.490
The figure below shows the results

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.747
of a study of the snake population

00:00:22.747 --> 00:00:25.154
both before and after the introduction

00:00:25.154 --> 00:00:26.909
of the outside males.

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:30.392
In the study, the numbers
of captured snakes

00:00:30.392 --> 00:00:33.264
indicates the overall population size.

00:00:33.264 --> 00:00:36.993
So, let's look it, let's look
at this, at the study here,

00:00:36.993 --> 00:00:38.344
the data from the study.

00:00:38.344 --> 00:00:42.145
So 1989, they captured a bunch of snakes,

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:43.662
the total snakes captured,

00:00:43.662 --> 00:00:47.022
but a small fraction
of them were juveniles.

00:00:47.022 --> 00:00:52.022
It looks like about five of
the 19 snakes were juvenile

00:00:52.028 --> 00:00:54.848
and we see that the total
population seems to be declining.

00:00:54.848 --> 00:00:57.381
The total snakes captured,
which they say is a...

00:00:58.866 --> 00:01:01.400
is an indication of overall population.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.771
That that is declining, and
then they introduced the males

00:01:04.771 --> 00:01:07.993
from the outside and then
it takes a couple years

00:01:07.993 --> 00:01:12.553
but then the population
seems to increase again.

00:01:12.553 --> 00:01:14.586
So, let's see what the questions are.

00:01:14.586 --> 00:01:17.800
Describe one characteristic
of the original population

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.503
that may have led to
the population's decline

00:01:20.503 --> 00:01:24.316
in size between 1989 and 1993.

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:27.246
So, we can only theorize,
they haven't told us a lot,

00:01:27.246 --> 00:01:29.952
they have told us it's a small population.

00:01:29.952 --> 00:01:32.159
So they say small and it's a small,

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.703
isolated, small isolated population.

00:01:35.703 --> 00:01:38.308
So when you have a small
isolated population,

00:01:38.308 --> 00:01:40.395
some things can happen
that are a lot less likely

00:01:40.395 --> 00:01:43.103
than if you have a large
un-isolated population.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.981
For example, you might have,

00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:47.329
actually I'll just answer it right here.

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.256
You might have an uneven distribution

00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:51.494
of males, females so not enough males.

00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:56.503
Not enough males.

00:01:56.503 --> 00:01:57.759
That's less likely to happen if you

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.304
have a really large population,

00:01:59.304 --> 00:02:01.052
but a small isolated population,

00:02:01.052 --> 00:02:03.903
well, you know, there's a
chance that you could skew

00:02:03.903 --> 00:02:06.722
one way or the other and if
you don't have enough males

00:02:06.722 --> 00:02:08.206
you're not going to have
enough reproduction,

00:02:10.176 --> 00:02:11.734
you might have

00:02:11.734 --> 00:02:15.744
too few young snakes in their prime

00:02:15.744 --> 00:02:17.339
of their reproductive age,

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:21.329
so, too, too few young,

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.945
young reproducing snakes,

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:28.839
reproducing snakes,

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:30.828
and there could be a bunch of reasons why

00:02:30.828 --> 00:02:34.305
this maybe happened, maybe
there was some type of

00:02:34.305 --> 00:02:36.868
calamity that happened, you know, in 1988,

00:02:36.868 --> 00:02:38.778
where a lot of the young snakes died

00:02:38.778 --> 00:02:40.935
or some type of a predator
and so all the snakes

00:02:40.935 --> 00:02:42.655
that are left are the ones that are older

00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:45.961
and they're not as viable
in terms of reproduction,

00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:48.351
but that's one possibility there.

00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:51.314
You could have some type
of, it's a small population,

00:02:51.314 --> 00:02:53.918
you could have, because of the lack,

00:02:53.918 --> 00:02:56.978
you could have a mutation
that is just disproportionatly

00:02:56.978 --> 00:02:58.665
showing up in that population which makes

00:02:58.665 --> 00:03:00.589
it less likely to reproduce.

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:03.769
So, mutation,

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:08.500
mutation in population,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.506
that makes it less likely to reproduce.

00:03:11.506 --> 00:03:13.465
For the actual test, you
just have to describe

00:03:13.465 --> 00:03:15.140
one characteristic and these are

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.358
all possible characteristics.

00:03:17.358 --> 00:03:19.883
Then in part b, they
say, propose one reason

00:03:19.883 --> 00:03:21.919
that the introduction of the outside males

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:24.690
rescued the snake population from decline.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.182
So, for part b, I'll do
that right over here.

00:03:27.182 --> 00:03:30.072
Part b, well, if you had not enough males,

00:03:30.072 --> 00:03:34.442
introducing males, so it could re-balance,

00:03:34.442 --> 00:03:36.236
could re-balance

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.470
male female ratio,

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.725
male female ratio,

00:03:44.725 --> 00:03:47.515
it could have introduced
some genetic diversity

00:03:47.515 --> 00:03:49.107
so you don't have the mutation,

00:03:49.107 --> 00:03:52.197
could introduce,

00:03:53.277 --> 00:03:57.136
introduce genetic diversity

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:59.106
Once again this is a
small, isolated population,

00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:00.907
those are triggers in your heads, okay,

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:03.061
there might not be a lot
of genetic diversity there.

00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:05.344
Introduce genetic diversity.

00:04:08.142 --> 00:04:10.535
The introduced male snakes
might have been younger.

00:04:10.535 --> 00:04:11.766
So, could...

00:04:12.927 --> 00:04:13.828
introduce...

00:04:16.197 --> 00:04:17.040
younger,

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.140
younger snakes.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.176
They didn't tell us whether
the males from the outside,

00:04:23.176 --> 00:04:25.402
what age they were but
these are just theories

00:04:25.402 --> 00:04:26.230
based on what they did tell us

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.053
that that's one of the possibilities,

00:04:28.053 --> 00:04:29.747
and once again, you only
have to describe one,

00:04:29.747 --> 00:04:31.552
so you could just say,
could have re-balanced

00:04:31.552 --> 00:04:34.651
the male female ratio, and then part c,

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:39.955
part c, describe how the
data support the statement

00:04:39.955 --> 00:04:42.526
that there are abundant
resources in the environment.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.022
Well, you know, if you just saw this data

00:04:46.022 --> 00:04:47.961
you could have said, well
maybe one of the reasons

00:04:47.961 --> 00:04:50.462
for even part a is that you
didn't have abundant resources,

00:04:50.462 --> 00:04:53.408
but notice when you introduce
males from the outside,

00:04:53.408 --> 00:04:56.239
now all of a sudden, the
population keeps increasing.

00:04:56.239 --> 00:04:58.868
So, the fact that the
population keeps increasing

00:04:58.868 --> 00:05:01.956
and actually goes above
where it was in 1989,

00:05:01.956 --> 00:05:03.078
well, that's a pretty good indication

00:05:03.078 --> 00:05:04.796
that you have abundant
resources, there's nothing

00:05:04.796 --> 00:05:07.145
that's putting a ceiling
on this growth once you

00:05:07.145 --> 00:05:10.852
somehow fix the problem by
introducing these outside males.

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:13.671
So, I could say, population,

00:05:14.818 --> 00:05:16.137
population

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.965
keeps growing

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.992
from '93, or especially from '95,

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:30.222
1995 onward, onward,

00:05:30.222 --> 00:05:33.215
wouldn't happen if we
had limited resources,

00:05:33.215 --> 00:05:36.959
wouldn't have happened

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:38.479
without abundant resources.

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:39.597
Wouldn't have happened,

00:05:42.297 --> 00:05:43.283
happened...

00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:47.782
without abundant resources.

00:05:49.396 --> 00:05:53.657
Abundant resources.

00:05:53.657 --> 00:05:54.614
And we're done.
