00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
There's a famous poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow called, "The Arrow and the Song."

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And it begins, "I shot an arrow into the air. It fell to earth, I knew not where."

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Well, it's a very nice poem, but from a physics point of view it sort of defeat us.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Using our new physics knowledge, I think we can make a slight revision to this poem.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
If I were Longfellow's editor, I would suggest a slightly different second line.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Maybe it fell to earth, I can predict exactly where by first calculating

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
horizontal and vertical components of velocity and then utilizing the equations of motion.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Okay, maybe his flow is a little better, but mine is better from a physics point of view.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
For this two dimensional motion problem, we're just going to start simply.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Can you tell me for an initial velocity so the arrow was fired at 100 m/s at an angle of 30Â°

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
to the ground, can you use your knowledge of trigonometry from unit one to tell me

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
the x and y components of the initial velocity?
