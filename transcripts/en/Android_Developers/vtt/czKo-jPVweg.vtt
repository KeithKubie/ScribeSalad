SPEAKER: We have never added
a new programming language

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:03.870
to Android.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.840
And today, we're making
Kotlin an officially supported

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.658
language in Android.

00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:11.098

WOJTEK KALICINSKI:
At Google IO, we

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.320
announced that we're adding
Kotlin as an officially

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.300
supported language for Android.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.340
Kotlin is a mature
and fun language

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.250
that many developers are already
embracing for their production

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.330
apps.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.240
For those of you who want to
try Kotlin for the first time,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.950
we're now bundling
the Kotlin plug-in

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.884
with Android Studio 3.0.

00:00:35.884 --> 00:00:37.550
When creating a new
project, you can now

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.220
choose to enable Kotlin
support, and any template

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.680
will be generated in
that language for you.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.780
Because Kotlin plays
well with Java,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.510
you can also start adding Kotlin
to your existing projects.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.880
Try converting a single
Java file to Kotlin

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.130
using this Android
Studio command.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.990
Or add a new code
template and select

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.180
Kotlin as the source language.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.790
When taking first steps
with programming in Kotlin,

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.120
you might also find it useful to
migrate code snippets from Java

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.160
by simply copying and
pasting them to Kotlin files.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.170
And Android Studio will convert
to code for you on the fly.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.720
Refer to our blog post
on Android Developers

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.150
for a quick tour of
the Kotlin language.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.630
You'll also find links to the
full reference pages there.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.030
We're just starting with
Kotlin as a support language

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.390
for Android, so expect to see
more documentation, samples,

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.390
and Android specific
guidance in the future.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.420
And in the meantime, I hope
you have fun exploring Kotlin.
