00:00:07.054 --> 00:00:10.536
In the 1950s, a group of ranchers in Idaho

00:00:10.536 --> 00:00:16.395
were baffled when their sheep gave birth
to lambs with a singular deformity.

00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:18.906
Mystified by these cyclops sheep,

00:00:18.906 --> 00:00:23.898
they called in scientists from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture to investigate.

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:27.036
The researchers hypothesized
that the pregnant ewes

00:00:27.036 --> 00:00:31.621
had snacked on poisonous 
birth defect-causing plants.

00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:35.806
They collected the local flora
and fed samples to lab rats,

00:00:35.806 --> 00:00:38.477
but struggled to replicate the effect.

00:00:38.477 --> 00:00:41.391
So they decided 
to directly observe the sheep

00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:45.902
with one scientist even living
with the herd for three summers.

00:00:45.902 --> 00:00:50.949
After a decade of trial and error,
the scientists finally found the culprit,

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.032
wild corn lilies.

00:00:53.032 --> 00:00:57.297
The lilies contained an active molecule
with six connected rings

00:00:57.297 --> 00:01:01.907
that they named cyclopamine
in reference to the cyclops sheep.

00:01:01.907 --> 00:01:06.207
They didn't know exactly
how cyclopamine caused the defect

00:01:06.207 --> 00:01:09.029
but told ranchers to steer clear.

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:12.389
It took about four decades before
a team of biologists,

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:14.614
led by Professor Philip Beachy,

00:01:14.614 --> 00:01:16.760
stumbled upon the answer.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.699
His lab was studying a specific gene
found in many species,

00:01:20.699 --> 00:01:22.642
from mice to humans,

00:01:22.642 --> 00:01:25.118
called the hedgehog gene.

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:30.229
It was named by two scientists, who later
shared the Noble Prize for their work,

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.497
who found that mutating 
this gene in fruit flies

00:01:33.497 --> 00:01:37.490
produced pointy spikes like a hedgehog.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.344
Beachy and his colleagues performed
genetic modifications

00:01:40.344 --> 00:01:43.470
to turn off the hedgehog genes in mice.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.690
This resulted in severe defects 
in the development

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.750
of their brains, organs, and eyes

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.770
or, rather, eye.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.030
Then while perusing a textbook, Beachy 
came across photos of the cyclops sheep

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.230
and realized what had eluded scientists
for four decades.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.110
Something must have gone awry 
involving the hedgehog gene.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.781
Let's take a step back.

00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:12.530
Genes contain instructions that tell
cells what to do and when to do it,

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.150
and they communicate their directives
using proteins.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.692
The hedgehog gene itself tells cells
to release a so-called hedgehog protein,

00:02:21.692 --> 00:02:26.201
which kicks off a complex 
series of cellular signals.

00:02:26.201 --> 00:02:29.211
Here's how it works in normal
healthy development.

00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:32.612
Hedgehog protein latches on to
a protein called patched.

00:02:32.612 --> 00:02:36.023
That inhibits, or holds, patched back,

00:02:36.023 --> 00:02:41.333
allowing another protein called
smoothened to freely signal the cells,

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:45.453
telling them where to go
and what kind of tissues to become.

00:02:45.453 --> 00:02:49.863
Cyclopamine, say in the form 
of a delicious corn lily,

00:02:49.863 --> 00:02:53.772
interrupts this pathway
by binding onto smoothened.

00:02:53.772 --> 00:02:57.622
That locks smoothened up so that
it's unable to send the signals

00:02:57.622 --> 00:03:00.923
needed to mold the brain 
into two hemispheres,

00:03:00.923 --> 00:03:04.744
and form fingers or separate eyes.

00:03:04.744 --> 00:03:08.133
So even though the hedgehog
protein is still doing its job

00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:10.352
of keeping the way clear for smoothened,

00:03:10.352 --> 00:03:15.517
cyclopamine blocks smoothened
from passing along its chemical message.

00:03:15.517 --> 00:03:18.213
That settled the science
behind the one-eyed sheep,

00:03:18.213 --> 00:03:20.414
but Beachy and his team 
caught the glimmer

00:03:20.414 --> 00:03:23.495
of another more beneficial connection.

00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:27.124
They noted that uncontrolled activation
of the smoothened protein

00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:29.875
was associated with a human syndrome.

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:36.174
It's known as Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome,
and it predisposes people to certain cancers.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:37.996
The scientists proposed

00:03:37.996 --> 00:03:42.473
putting cyclopamine's smoothened 
binding powers to good use

00:03:42.473 --> 00:03:44.454
as a treatment for these cancers,

00:03:44.454 --> 00:03:47.176
as long as the patient wasn't pregnant.

00:03:47.176 --> 00:03:50.695
Unfortunately, researchers eventually
found that cyclopamine

00:03:50.695 --> 00:03:52.424
causes negative side effects,

00:03:52.424 --> 00:03:56.145
and its chemical properties
make it difficult to work with.

00:03:56.145 --> 00:04:00.996
But they did discover that closely
related molecules are safe and effective,

00:04:00.996 --> 00:04:07.707
and two of these drugs were approved
in 2012 and 2015 as skin cancer medicines.

00:04:07.707 --> 00:04:10.385
When those farmers first saw
the cyclops sheep,

00:04:10.385 --> 00:04:14.586
they could have chalked it up to
a freak genetic mutation and walked away.

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:19.578
Instead, their decision to investigate
turned a mystery into medicine

00:04:19.578 --> 00:04:23.426
showing that sometimes
there's more than meets the eye.
