00:00:00.686 --> 00:00:02.640
MALE SPEAKER: Welcome
back to the Googleplex,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.940
and a new release of
Google Play Services.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.980
That means new,
cool stuff that you

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.270
can use to build better apps.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.905
Let's go inside
and check it out.

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:13.191
ROBOT: Stop right
there before you start.

00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:14.065
Fix your deprecation.

00:00:14.065 --> 00:00:16.148
MALE SPEAKER: What do you
mean fix my deprecation?

00:00:16.648 --> 00:00:17.730
ROBOT: Deprecated logo.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.682
Identity matters.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.500
MALE SPEAKER: Gee, thanks.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.166
ROBOT: That's better.

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.590
[WINDCHIMES]

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.770
MALE SPEAKER: The
new Google logo.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.689
ROBOT: Thank you.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:33.483
Proceed.

00:00:33.483 --> 00:00:34.586
MALE SPEAKER: All right!

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.661
[WINDCHIMES]

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.150
A big part of this release
is about handling your user's

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.460
identity, because we've made
significant changes to the sign

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.220
in with Google API that
will simplify your code

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.410
and also improve
the user experience.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.190
First off, the new
Google branding

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.730
is reflected in the button.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.920
With a new sign in
API, you can get one

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.450
of these two standard buttons.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.570
All updated, with a
new nice looking logo.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.330
It's even possible
to create buttons

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.260
with your own
customized look and feel

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.090
as long as you follow the
branding guidelines located

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.920
here.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.740
And that's not the
only improvements

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.040
visible to the user.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.030
Prior to this release,
when the user pressed

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.200
the Sign In button,
they would potentially

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.910
have several steps to follow.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.340
For example,
selecting an account,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.210
potentially creating
a new profile,

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.305
and needing to grant even the
most basic of permissions.

00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:30.100
A not so great user experience.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.230
So I'm happy to say
that we have now

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.440
streamlined this experience.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.510
And with the new
sign in API, the user

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.790
only need to complete a single
step for basic profile access.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.010
Just selecting their account.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.480
And that's a really, really
great user experience.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.820
But you get even more
with this new API

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.160
since it also
simplifies your code.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.980
Before, the sign in process
was tightly entangled

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.770
with the Google API
client connectivity flow,

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.270
making the code to connect
multiple APIs difficult.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.570
But now they have
been separated,

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.980
leading to much simplified code.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.160
So why is this helpful?

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.699
Well, if your app
adds additional scopes

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.570
or connect APIs
dynamically then you

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.360
don't need to write code
to reconnect the Google API

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.130
client.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.120
Also, the new sign in
flow has better support

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.100
to manage recoverable errors.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.460
So you don't have to write as
much code to deal with that.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.660
And that's great.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.450
I mean, less code
means less complexity.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.290
[DING] Perhaps.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.530
Well, [HORN] not necessarily.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.210
But less code is better for
you [DING] most of the time.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.120
I think.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.490
So anyway, there you have it.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.460
The new sign in API
making life easier

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.410
for you, and the experience
better for your users.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.220
And there is also some updates
for Fused Location Provider

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.720
API.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.360
You know the technology in
Google Play Services that

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.890
combines multiple things
like GPS, cell towers,

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.300
as well as Wi-Fi to
identify your position as

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.310
accurately as possible.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.450
When in this release,
we've added methods

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.670
to defuse location provider API.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.510
With previous
releases it was not

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.800
possible to get the batch
location if you decided

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.020
to turn location updates off.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.360
But that limitation
is now history

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.300
with the new flush
location method.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.320
And we also have announcements
for the app invites API.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.190
You know the one that allows
your users to invite and engage

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.540
their friends with your app.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.750
In this release we've added
the get invitation method.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.540
This method will set
up a result callback

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.770
that you can use to launch
your deep link activity.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.810
This dramatically
simplifies your code,

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.520
so check out the
samples in the end.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.690
And last but not least, we have
updates for the wearable data

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.240
API where you can now specify
a sync priority for data items.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.880
So if you have something that
is really, really important

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.110
to sync as quickly
as possible, then you

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.940
should check this API out.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.740
And that's it for this release
of Google Play Services,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.810
but be sure to check out
these resources as well.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.850
Now it's your turn to build
better apps with Google Play

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:08.600
Services.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.860
So go out there and
create some great apps.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.320
And don't forget to
tell us all about it.
