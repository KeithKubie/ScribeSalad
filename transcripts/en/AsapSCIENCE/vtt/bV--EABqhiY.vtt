00:00:00.351 --> 00:00:04.661
Most of us have experienced the rush of a
big scare - the racing heart, sweating palms

00:00:04.661 --> 00:00:10.740
and fast breathing. But could these symptoms really
--BOO!!!! Scare ya? It’s a full body

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.041
experience, and it can even feel dangerous
at times, but could you really be scared to

00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:16.880
death?

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.331
Science suggests that today’s most commons
fears stem from the things that most frequently

00:00:20.331 --> 00:00:25.011
killed our ancestors. Animal phobias like
arachnophobia, natural environment phobias

00:00:25.011 --> 00:00:29.851
like the fear of heights, situational phobias
like claustrophobia and blood-injection-injury

00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:34.311
phobias like the fear of needles are the four
most common categories today. And these make

00:00:34.311 --> 00:00:39.250
sense as most have been relatively consistent
threats throughout our evolution. As a result,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.641
the genes preparing us to instinctively avoid
them became more common, while genes that

00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:48.461
did not faded away. Chances are, if you have
one of these fears, you may have inherited

00:00:48.461 --> 00:00:49.511
it from your parents.

00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:53.930
Of course, day-to-day learning also helps
shape your personal fears. At the end of the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.140
day, it’s not the actual threat, but instead
your perception of the threat that controls

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.960
the amount of fear you will feel.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.411
So could it kill you? The short answer is
yes. Not to scare you...of course! The chances

00:01:05.411 --> 00:01:09.751
of being scared to death depend greatly on
how healthy your heart is. When you’re scared,

00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:13.681
your Fight or Flight response is trigger and
adrenaline is released, making the heart beat

00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:17.991
quicker to pump more blood and oxygen to your
muscles. As a result you become temporarily

00:01:17.991 --> 00:01:23.491
stronger and faster. But something really
scary can kick this into overdrive. Too much

00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:27.801
and your heart simply can’t keep up, which
could damage heart tissue and even stop it

00:01:27.801 --> 00:01:29.321
from beating all together.

00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:33.510
Hundreds of athletes have experienced a fatal
rush of adrenaline as a result of simulated

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.321
threats during intense competition. And you’re
no safer in the stands - studies found the

00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:42.391
number of heart attacks during World Cup Soccer
matches more than doubled in countries and

00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:44.741
cities where the home team was eliminated.

00:01:44.741 --> 00:01:49.000
So should you lock yourself away in a closet
to avoid all these fears? The truth is, while

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.180
scientists don’t know exactly who is most
vulnerable, we do know that the incidence

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.320
is extremely low for people with healthy functioning
hearts. More food for thought is thought itself.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.320
It turns out that training ourselves to think
differently about fears can actually reduce

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.500
the amount of adrenaline they produce.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.101
But that’s not always easy - and some people
have some pretty crazy fears. In fact, our

00:02:07.101 --> 00:02:12.161
