JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.970
We have Audu in the house.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.356
AUDU MAIKORI: Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

00:00:10.356 --> 00:00:12.772
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: So
welcome, once again, to Google.

00:00:12.772 --> 00:00:13.400
AUDU MAIKORI: Thank you.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.399
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
And welcome particularly

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:17.060
to Talks at Google.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.772
It's really great
to have you here.

00:00:18.772 --> 00:00:19.980
AUDU MAIKORI: It is an honor.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.625
I'm shaking.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:22.666
I'm really-- I've never
had a Google talk before.

00:00:22.666 --> 00:00:23.524
So this is exciting.

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:24.940
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Well, it's

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.314
being watched by
the whole world.

00:00:26.314 --> 00:00:28.420
AUDU MAIKORI: Wow.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.152
Hi, world.

00:00:30.152 --> 00:00:32.110
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
So you're very welcome.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.109
AUDU MAIKORI: Thank you.

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:34.110
Thank you so much.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.568
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: We're
focusing our discussion today

00:00:36.568 --> 00:00:40.250
on redefining leadership through
music and entrepreneurship.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.200
And I'm going to
start by just reading

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.182
a few lines from your
profile, and then we'll

00:00:44.182 --> 00:00:45.265
get into the conversation.

00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:45.973
AUDU MAIKORI: OK.

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:50.210
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
So Audu Maikori

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.800
is a Nigerian lawyer,
entrepreneur, social activist,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.270
public speaker, creative
industry professional, founder

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.990
and president of the Chocolate
City Entertainment Group.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.160
Maikoro is also well-known in
Nigeria as a former "Nigerian

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.640
Idol" judge and
has been compared

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.400
to Simon Cowell due to his
tough stance on contestants

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.580
during auditions.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.420
Maikori's Chocolate City is
arguably one of the biggest

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.541
record labels in Africa.

00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:25.290
I think that deserves
a round of applause.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.762
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:28.762 --> 00:01:30.416
AUDU MAIKORI: Thank you.

00:01:30.416 --> 00:01:32.540
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Helping to guide and manage

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.030
the careers of several artists,
including Femi Kuti, MI,

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.630
Ice Prince Zamani,
Victoria Kimani, Asa,

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.700
Jesse Jagz, Nosa, Brymo,
Koker, Dice Ailes, et cetera.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.140
A multi-award-winning
entrepreneur

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.530
and creative
industry specialist,

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.830
Maikori soon took on the
role of social activism

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.330
by funding and participating in
a variety of youth empowerment

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.010
projects.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.190
He was a key member of the
Enough Is Enough rally in 2010,

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.580
which was aimed at
addressing poor governance

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.520
issues in Nigeria, during which
he had a face-off with Nigerian

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.800
military police, when he refused
to back down when a rifle was

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.670
pointed at him in a bid
to stop him from leading

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.850
the peaceful protest to the
gates of the National Assembly.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.810
Maikori received a special
judge's commendation

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.430
at the finale of the
international young music

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.310
entrepreneur of the year, where
he beat nine other countries

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.290
to win the global
award in June 2007.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.380
In 2011 and 2015,
he was recognized

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.740
by the "CityPeople Magazine"
for his outstanding contribution

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.190
to the Nigerian music industry.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.600
Once again, welcome, Audu.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.866
AUDU MAIKORI: Thank you.

00:03:01.866 --> 00:03:03.374
Thank you very much.

00:03:03.374 --> 00:03:04.790
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
You've had

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.660
quite an interesting career--
started life as a lawyer,

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.650
and then went on
to set up a very

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.260
successful, one of the most
successful record labels

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.550
in Africa.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.960
I can understand the
transition in terms

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.580
of-- because besides
the glamor, there's

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.180
a lot of contracting,
intellectual property rights,

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.380
and all of that involved
in running a record label.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.430
But you could have done
a number of things.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.910
You could have set up your
own legal practice, et cetera.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.860
Why music?

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.850
AUDU MAIKORI: Well, I did set up
my own legal practice, indeed,

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.670
before Chocolate
City even started.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.920
I think for me, one of the
things that I've always

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.140
been kind of guided by is
the need to improve things.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.990
Because I kind of think that
you're put on this Earth

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.282
to leave the Earth
better than you found it.

00:03:55.282 --> 00:03:58.300
So if there's a problem, it's
not about complaining about it.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.840
It's about doing something
about that problem.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.201
And one thing that I saw
was that I was interacting

00:04:05.201 --> 00:04:06.450
with a lot of creative people.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.674
I found out that
they had-- I keep

00:04:08.674 --> 00:04:10.090
telling this story
about a guy who

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.965
had a contract that had no
expiration date, no termination

00:04:13.965 --> 00:04:15.280
date.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.709
So I started getting
involved in promoting them,

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.769
and I just thought, OK.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.187
There's a problem.

00:04:22.187 --> 00:04:24.520
Maybe you need to set up
something that is the solution.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.010
And that is what
kind of informed

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.270
registering Chocolate
City, getting a team,

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.520
and then trying to
change and kind of raise

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.892
the standards in terms
of how those are managed.

00:04:34.892 --> 00:04:36.600
And then, of course,
the legal background

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.190
helped to put things in
proper perspective, as well.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.660
So that's the story.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.280
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: Fantastic.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.560
And a lot of people have ideas
and also have an ambition

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.850
to transition either
from what they studied

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.790
or where they started
life out, et cetera.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.190
But not many people successfully
make that transition.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.720
How did you develop yourself?

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.220
What are the things
you had to learn

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.280
to be able to step into the role
of running a successful record

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.384
label?

00:05:06.384 --> 00:05:08.550
AUDU MAIKORI: Well, for any
lawyer that's out there,

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.010
I always tell people,
like my father told me

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:15.930
before-- my father said to me
before that law is probably

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.080
one of the greatest
professions you can read simply

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.670
because it gives
you the dexterity

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.390
to work in almost any field.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.360
So you're right
that whether it be

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.870
music or movies or the
whole creative sector,

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.890
there's clearly a place for
lawyers to be part of that

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.410
because the whole thing
about intellectual property

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:38.000
is a set of rights and how those
rights are controlled, managed,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and exploited.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.040
So everything cuts across,
whether it be software,

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.920
whether it be--
even Google itself

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.320
has a set of different rights.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.430
It's creative ideas.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:53.520
So lawyers fit into almost
every sphere of human endeavor.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:00.170
But you're right that there
was no blueprint, so to speak,

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.690
because when I started, one
of the things that we noticed

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.980
was that, OK, so
there's a lot of talent.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.164
And it seemed that all
the talent was in Lagos.

00:06:08.164 --> 00:06:09.830
But we found out that
most of the talent

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.970
actually migrated to Lagos
because the infrastructure

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.239
wasn't there elsewhere.

00:06:14.239 --> 00:06:16.030
And one of the things
that we set out to do

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.510
was start off in the north.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.960
So we started of in Abuja
and tried to defy those odds.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.170
So we've been in business
for about 11 years now.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.890
For the first seven or eight
years, we were in Abuja.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.780
So everything we did was in
Abuja, actually, which I think

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.090
is phenomenal
because what it did

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.720
now was begun to change
people's mindsets about what

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.800
the creative sector was in
that part, which is generally

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.520
considered a bit more
conservative than Lagos.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.759
So what did I do?

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:46.800
One of the books that was
quite influential to me

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.304
was "How I Lost My Virginity."

00:06:48.304 --> 00:06:49.970
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Richard Branson.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:50.470
AUDU MAIKORI: Richard Branson.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:51.532
It's a great book.

00:06:51.532 --> 00:06:52.990
I recommend it to
anybody out there

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.057
who wants to try
something a bit different.

00:06:57.057 --> 00:06:58.390
I think it was the daring of it.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.765
It was the fact
that somebody who

00:06:59.765 --> 00:07:01.750
seemed to have all
the disadvantages

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.420
turned them around,
which kind of

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.930
speaks to the power of the
mind, that if you can think it

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.604
and you can believe it
and keep believing it,

00:07:09.604 --> 00:07:10.520
it's a matter of time.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.110
It will happen.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.030
So that was my mentor.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.265
And in 2011, I actually
got to meet him.

00:07:16.265 --> 00:07:16.950
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Oh fantastic.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:17.741
AUDU MAIKORI: Yeah.

00:07:17.741 --> 00:07:18.719
So it was like, wow.

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:20.260
I mean, I was reading
about this guy,

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.620
and then, hey, I'm
shaking hands with him.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.510
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR: And
you were inspired by him.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.301
AUDU MAIKORI: Yeah.

00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:25.010
And then we got a
chance to speak.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.080
And I asked him a few questions
about his business and et

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.580
cetera.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:32.080
And it's just a testament that
if you think about it long

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.340
enough and you work hard
towards it, it's possible.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.048
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
That's fantastic.

00:07:36.048 --> 00:07:37.480
Do you have other mentors?

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.230
AUDU MAIKORI: Yes.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.220
I have two other mentors.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.480
One of them is Mr.
Hakeem Belo Osagie,

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.530
who happens to be the
chairman of my company.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.340
And the reason why--
it's not because he's

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.310
the chairman of the
company, actually.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.260
It's not that.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.600
It's the fact that you rarely
find people who are as educated

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:57.879
but as humble as,
easy to relate with.

00:07:57.879 --> 00:07:59.670
And he likes young
people, for some reason.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:03.425
So he's always trying to
encourage and help that.

00:08:03.425 --> 00:08:05.970
But it's even the
most strategic lessons

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.960
in terms of how to
deal with business

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.900
and how to think on a global
scale that is inspiring.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.930
But my number mentor, my
father, [INAUDIBLE] Maikori.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.760
He's a lawyer, as well.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:23.700
And he literally taught
us everything we knew.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.140
So go and read.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.580
What's your focus?

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.820
What's your plan?

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:29.650
Oh, you like music.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.870
Here's a keyboard and
a teacher you wanted.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.612
So anything that he
thought we were--

00:08:33.612 --> 00:08:35.070
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Capable of.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:36.528
AUDU MAIKORI:
Capable or interested

00:08:36.528 --> 00:08:41.179
in, he would invest in
it and say, go ahead.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:42.071
So I paint.

00:08:42.071 --> 00:08:43.529
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Oh, do you?

00:08:43.529 --> 00:08:43.789
Wow.

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:44.620
AUDU MAIKORI: Was, I am.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.010
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: OK.

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.051
I'm not sure a lot of
people know that about you.

00:08:47.051 --> 00:08:48.460
AUDU MAIKORI: Many people don't.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:50.940
But I paint.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.160
I write poetry.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.170
I'm a bit of a
creative person myself.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.116
But that's also
because my family.

00:08:56.116 --> 00:08:57.240
My father was in the choir.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.970
My mother was in the choir.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.897
And so what I know about
music was taught primarily

00:09:01.897 --> 00:09:03.230
between my father and my mother.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.646
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: Fantastic.

00:09:04.646 --> 00:09:06.915
AUDU MAIKORI: So they're
the reason I'm here.

00:09:06.915 --> 00:09:07.640
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
That's great.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.370
Do you sing?

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.684
AUDU MAIKORI: Nope.

00:09:09.684 --> 00:09:10.914
No.

00:09:10.914 --> 00:09:12.330
And that's why I
had to-- you see,

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.100
that's the overall
reason why I had

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.974
to do the label because
I knew I had no hope.

00:09:15.974 --> 00:09:17.150
So I just had to invest--

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.941
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Support the other--

00:09:18.941 --> 00:09:21.270
AUDU MAIKORI: Exactly,
the real talent, yeah.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.480
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
In addition to the book

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.262
you talked about,
"Losing My Virginity,"

00:09:24.262 --> 00:09:26.900
are there other books
that have really

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:28.650
had a profound impact on you?

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.910
AUDU MAIKORI: Yeah.

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:33.152
One other book is "The
48 Laws of Power."

00:09:33.152 --> 00:09:33.950
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: Ah, yes.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:35.110
AUDU MAIKORI: Now, when
people hear that, they always

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.800
say, oh, politics, it's
evil, and things like that.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.550
But really, what
it teaches you is

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.942
about human psychology,
understanding people,

00:09:41.942 --> 00:09:43.317
understanding how
to do business.

00:09:43.317 --> 00:09:46.380
So one of the most
important lessons

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.540
I learned from that book
was that always appeal

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.240
to people's self-interest.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.740
So people are not
interested in you.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:52.940
So don't fool yourself.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:53.960
Don't think that it's about you.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.230
It's about them.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.060
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: You're
only under the illusion.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:57.380
AUDU MAIKORI: So once
you know what they want,

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.890
then you're in business, and
you can offer that to them.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.460
Then you have the
common ground to speak.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:07.060
Another book is "The Tipping
Point" by Malcolm Gladwell.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.780
Another book is "Blink" by
Malcolm Gladwell, as well.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:16.147
And then there's the "Outliers,"
by Malcolm Gladwell again.

00:10:16.147 --> 00:10:18.480
And what I like about his
books is that he's analytical.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.840
He looks at a pure
set of ordinary facts.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.134
Then he's able to now dig
deep and try to draw some--

00:10:27.134 --> 00:10:28.550
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: Parallels.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:33.870
AUDU MAIKORI: Exactly, from
them and just kind of expand it.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.057
Another book is called--
do I need to go on?

00:10:36.057 --> 00:10:37.390
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: No, yes.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.360
Yes, sure.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.200
Maybe one more.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.325
AUDU MAIKORI: OK, one more.

00:10:40.325 --> 00:10:44.100
So my favorite
fiction book is a book

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.640
called "Keep the Aspidistra
Flying" by George Orwell,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.780
the guy that wrote
"Animal Farm."

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:56.135
And it's a story about a guy
whose mental state made him

00:10:56.135 --> 00:10:57.455
a poor person.

00:10:57.455 --> 00:11:00.060
So it's a guy who had all
the opportunity in the world

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.080
to become a success.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.720
But he was shying
away from success

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.610
because he wasn't sure
he could handle it.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.280
And it's that progression
between making up

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.120
your mind that look,
I'm ready, and how

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.910
he progressed to success.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.280
So it's an amazing book.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.154
Many people do not know
about it because it's

00:11:16.154 --> 00:11:17.920
one of those not very
well-known books.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.420
But it's a great book to read.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:20.670
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: Great.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.820
Now, talking a bit more
about Chocolate City,

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.790
you've been great at
identifying talent.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.200
What would you say are the
two to three essential things

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.105
in identifying talent
within the music industry?

00:11:33.105 --> 00:11:35.230
AUDU MAIKORI: Well, I must
say that the industry is

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.180
changing quite rapidly, just
like any other industry.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:42.480
And the ways by which
you identify talent now

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.690
have kind of greatly
changed and expanded.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:50.287
But I think that the first thing
is the raw, natural talent.

00:11:50.287 --> 00:11:52.370
But the second thing, which
is even more important

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.930
than talent, is the mindset.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:59.303
It's the readiness to go
out of your comfort zone

00:11:59.303 --> 00:12:04.740
and to be critiqued, to
be in a difficult place,

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:09.600
to go out and just
risk being embarrassed

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.420
and come back with
either a yea or a nay,

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.040
but being able to go
back and keep going on.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:20.850
So a resilient,
perserverant spirit.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:31.880
The third thing would be just
the distinctness of the talent

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:34.430
because I think that
people, we want different.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:35.050
We want fresh.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:35.945
We want new.

00:12:35.945 --> 00:12:38.110
You can't sound
like Michael Jackson

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.580
and then hope to be the
next Michael Jackson.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.400
You're just gonna be a
Michael Jackson wannabe.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.460
So originality, distinctness,
and your uniqueness, for me,

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.540
is very, very important.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.790
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: Great.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.300
And when you identify
those things,

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.990
how do you then
take the raw talent

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.910
and transform that into
a successful artist?

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:59.000
Because Chocolate
City has been quite

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.980
successful at actually
developing talent

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.910
in a really big way.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:04.730
And if we think about
any organization,

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.750
really, for you to
be able to produce

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:10.370
positive results on
an ongoing basis,

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.815
that doesn't happen by accident.

00:13:12.815 --> 00:13:13.721
It's about culture.

00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:14.970
It's about a number of things.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.760
So what are the
dynamics that have

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:22.634
been built into the organization
to make that possible?

00:13:22.634 --> 00:13:24.300
AUDU MAIKORI: Well,
I always tell people

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.374
that most people think
Chocolate City is a label.

00:13:27.374 --> 00:13:29.040
And I told them right
from the beginning

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.370
that it's not a label.

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.350
It's an idea company, simple.

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:35.760
So we're very creative, and
we understand creatives,

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.130
and we want to be able to
allow them to be themselves.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.520
So an artist doesn't
become more talented

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.370
because he signed on a label.

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.040
He just simply has
more opportunities

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.490
to exploit and explore
that talent beyond what he

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:51.610
had before.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.980
So what we try to
do is keep a balance

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.270
between what the label wants
and the creative expression

00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.360
of the artists.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.730
Very important.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.990
The second thing is that
we've actually built

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.990
a very detailed structure.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:10.630
And I don't know that many that
have the structure we've built.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.600
So we have a proper board.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.470
We have a proper team.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:15.770
We have an A&amp;R department.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.860
We have the studios.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.562
We have the guys who
do the licensing.

00:14:20.562 --> 00:14:22.020
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: Governance.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:22.811
AUDU MAIKORI: Yeah.

00:14:22.811 --> 00:14:25.660
We've tried to develop
an ecosystem such

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:28.490
that we can take care of most of
the things of a budding artist.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:30.280
But of course,
the other thing is

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.510
being able to build those
relationships, as well,

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.730
valuable relationship, like
with Google and YouTube

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.910
and being able to kind
of have this conversation

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:41.089
to help us scale and
to improve what we've

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:42.380
been doing over the past years.

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.840
So I'll say it's that.

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.330
But over and above
all that is that

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.750
the artist-label relationship
is a very interesting

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:52.960
relationship.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.900
It's a marriage that almost from
this point where you say, I do,

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.420
you don't.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.640
You know?

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.560
And that's simply because
the objectives are the same,

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.845
but the perspectives
are different.

00:15:05.845 --> 00:15:07.220
Now, unless you
have an alignment

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.820
of those perspectives,
you may think that you're

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.040
going different ways.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.540
So, for example,
the artist may feel

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:17.370
that he looks really beautiful
as a man in a yellow skirt.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:19.090
That's his creative expression.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:23.470
We think not because we
look at the cultural context

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.320
and know that it
wouldn't fly here.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.100
So it's that
discussion and agreeing

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.250
on the fact that, look, you
need to make money, man.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:34.010
And it's that communication and
putting those things together

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:36.160
that make the difference
in the success

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.940
or failure of an artist.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.390
And you can't
over-emphasize the need

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:45.040
for a real team around
talent because, like I said,

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.120
the talent didn't become more
talented when he got signed.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.524
He had more talent to
help his talent seem more

00:15:51.524 --> 00:15:52.690
talented that he was before.

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.150
So that's the only difference.

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:55.580
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: Fantastic.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.150
And I think those can be applied
to really any organization.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.550
AUDU MAIKORI: Anything, yeah.

00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:59.925
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
The power

00:15:59.925 --> 00:16:03.110
of having the right team,
strategy, understanding

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.790
the market and what would
work in a market, those kinds

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:06.420
of things.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.570
AUDU MAIKORI: Yeah.

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.160
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: So
it's been a success story.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.940
But I'm sure you've had a number
of challenges along the way.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:13.940
AUDU MAIKORI: Of course.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.010
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
What's been your toughest

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:18.690
day on the job, so to speak?

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.472
AUDU MAIKORI: Toughest day
of the job is every week.

00:16:22.472 --> 00:16:25.250
It's every week.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:29.820
I think with every
business, you do

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:35.280
have your peculiar
challenges that reoccur.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.940
I think the biggest
challenge that we

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:41.460
face most times is an
alignment of perspective.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.015
I think it's the
biggest challenge.

00:16:43.015 --> 00:16:45.430
And if you look
at all businesses,

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:46.390
it's really about that.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:50.400
It's that there's a
communication dissonance.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.850
So it's the case
of the elephant.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:53.725
You're looking at the
behind of the elephant.

00:16:53.725 --> 00:16:55.340
You're like, wow,
round and bumpy.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.590
Somebody's looking at the
front, and they say, oh, big

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:58.790
ears and a long tail.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:01.060
So it depends on what
you're looking at.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:05.810
But when we're able to all go
around the elephant and see it,

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:09.349
then we have a better chance
at resolving the issue.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:12.260
And it's always going to
be part of that process

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.050
because when you
think about strategy--

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.650
and I'll give you a
couple of instances.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:19.560
So there've been
singles that we've

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:21.900
released that I
personally-- I'll

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:26.099
call three or the artists, so
with MI, Ice Prince, and Brymo.

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:29.360
So after we released
Brymo's first single,

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.040
we had a choice between
releasing the second single,

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.645
whether it was going
to be "Ara" or it

00:17:33.645 --> 00:17:35.320
was going to be "Good Morning."

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.570
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: Right.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:38.660
AUDU MAIKORI: So I
thought "Good Morning"

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.700
was a more phenomenal song.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:47.800
And the other guys thought
"Ara" was bumpy and everything.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.930
And I didn't disagree.

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:50.630
I just simply said,
I thought it would

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:53.690
be great to put
out "Good Morning."

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:57.630
And then when they're like,
what is this [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:58.630
So what did we do?

00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:59.520
We have our team.

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.512
So we sat on a team, 13 or
14 of us, and we said, OK.

00:18:02.512 --> 00:18:03.720
Let's do a listening session.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.010
So we listened to the song.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:07.450
And for the artist,
he didn't mind.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:10.190
But he liked "Ara."

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.666
So we sat down,
everybody said "Ara."

00:18:12.666 --> 00:18:14.040
So we said, let's go with "Ara."

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.360
And it was the right call.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.892
But we also had some of those
sections that we all said, no.

00:18:18.892 --> 00:18:19.600
This is the song.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.700
So "Oleku," for example,
which is probably

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.586
one of Ice's biggest
songs to date, which

00:18:26.586 --> 00:18:28.690
was a phenomenal song
because it was probably

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:33.530
one of most remixed songs,
as well, across the continent

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:39.000
was that the original
version was ready early 2010.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.420
When it was sent
to me, I liked it,

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.240
but I thought that there was
some production errors in it.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:49.820
So there are places where the
kicks weren't loud enough.

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:52.749
And there were places where
there was no-- now, with music,

00:18:52.749 --> 00:18:54.790
I don't know how to use
the words to describe it.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:56.290
But I just know
what it sounds like.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:19:00.370
So there are parts where
the music needed to stop.

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:03.700
So if I played both the
original and the final one,

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.640
you'd understand what
I'm talking about this.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.672
But the artist didn't get it.

00:19:07.672 --> 00:19:09.130
He's just gonna
put out his single.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:10.060
I said, no.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:10.760
It's not ready.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.850
And so we couldn't
find [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:14.400
who produced that
song in maybe 30,

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:19.250
20-something minutes to do
the song because he was away

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.630
recording somewhere else.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:25.990
So I called MI and a guy called
[INAUDIBLE] who is his manager,

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.680
and said, you guys
need to do this, that,

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:29.740
and described the parts.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:30.520
And they said, OK.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.020
Fine.

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.930
And they went in, and
they worked on it.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.684
Now to show you the difference
between those two songs,

00:19:35.684 --> 00:19:38.100
I took the song originally to
a radio station, a top radio

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.210
station here.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:42.150
And I played it for
one of the A&amp;Rs there.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:47.850
She's a radio host, but
she's also great A&amp;R.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:51.370
And she listened to it and
said, this song's just OK,

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.750
but that she didn't
really feel it.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.830
So when we did the
remix, the other version,

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.440
she said-- so after
playing it, she said,

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.744
oh, this song is fantastic!

00:20:01.744 --> 00:20:03.160
So I said, but
can't you remember,

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.680
I brought this same song
to you a few months ago?

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:05.735
I was like, wow.

00:20:05.735 --> 00:20:07.480
Now, was that the same song?

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.610
But it wasn't that the
beat had changed that much.

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:14.050
It was some small elements
that enhanced the production.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:16.960
And so while we're delaying
for the song to come out,

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.020
it did work out
for good, as well.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.690
Now, the last example
is a song called "Safe."

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:23.760
And when MI recorded
"Safe," "Safe"

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.305
was like a wordplay
on different songs.

00:20:27.305 --> 00:20:30.810
So he Stole a bit from the most
popular songs around that time

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:35.010
and made a whole five
minute, 42 second song.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.850
And so when you he playing it
for me, it wasn't danceable.

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:42.530
And it didn't sound like
people would bump to it.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.390
But the flow was ridiculous.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:45.710
It was immaculate.

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.710
So I said, you know,
it's a bit too long.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:48.260
Why don't you cut it?

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:48.880
And he said, no.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.890
Just leave it like that.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.160
So we argued back and forth.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.320
And he said, Audu,
how just trust me.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.020
Just trust me.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:54.865
So I said, OK.

00:20:54.865 --> 00:20:56.055
Go ahead.

00:20:56.055 --> 00:20:58.180
And that song actually
changed his career, as well.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.350
So like I said,
it's those things.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:04.510
It's actually the fights,
the disagreements,

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:06.380
and the alignments
that make a product.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.714
And without that, you cannot
have a well-rounded product.

00:21:09.714 --> 00:21:11.130
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: Fantastic.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:12.213
That makes a lot of sense.

00:21:12.213 --> 00:21:13.400
AUDU MAIKORI: Yeah.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:16.500
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: You
talked about the technology

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.430
platforms like YouTube.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:23.130
What role do you see technology
platforms, social media,

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:27.339
YouTube playing in the growth
of music industry and your work.

00:21:27.339 --> 00:21:28.880
AUDU MAIKORI: No,
I mean, it is clear

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.220
that the music renaissance
that we're experiencing--

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:35.995
or, I think we're way
past a renaissance now.

00:21:35.995 --> 00:21:36.970
We're in it now.

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:40.870
But what actually
catalyzed that was clearly

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:44.250
the internet and platforms
like YouTube, Google,

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:46.030
Facebook, and the rest.

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:51.047
And the reason was that we had
an equal, level playing field.

00:21:51.047 --> 00:21:52.880
Whatever was happening
outside in the world,

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.940
we could also have
real-time access to that.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.150
So we were not behind.

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:00.385
And I remember when I
was much younger, one,

00:22:00.385 --> 00:22:01.940
you watched "Top of the Pops."

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.690
You're probably watching
"Top of the Pops"

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:04.669
that was two years old.

00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:06.960
And you're excited about the
music you're listening to.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.540
So you're behind stuff.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:12.470
But now, as it's being released,
you can watch it in real time.

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:13.430
You can go and Google.

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.900
And one of the things I
love about Google-- and this

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.610
is not a Google
advert, by the way.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:20.970
But one of the things I love
to on Saturdays, actually

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:23.990
listen to popular music
and then find the samples,

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:27.140
then go back and find the
original versions of the songs,

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.860
and then read up
on those artists

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:33.854
and find out what
inspired the song, what

00:22:33.854 --> 00:22:35.770
parts were extrapolated,
and all those things.

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.490
And they help also
because most of them

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.281
were in the publishing
part of the company.

00:22:39.281 --> 00:22:42.260
So it's important to know
where you can find a sample

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.850
or where you can clear a
sample, if the sample has

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:46.860
no copyright attached to it.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.320
And so I'm saying that
because of that convergence,

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:55.160
people are now talking
more, sharing ideas faster.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.130
And people are now
making covers of music.

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:59.713
So you go on Google, find a song
and all that-- or on YouTube,

00:22:59.713 --> 00:23:00.650
sorry.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.860
And you can search up
anything, and it pops up.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.870
So you have immediate
information.

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:07.880
Now, there's no doubt that
the next phase for the music

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.690
industry is purely
going to be tech.

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:13.180
But now you're not going
to call it music and tech.

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.110
It's going to be a merger.

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:18.430
There'll be no difference
between those two.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.100
I find that if
you look at what's

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.950
happening with the
trends in music,

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:27.120
people want a wider bouquet,
a repertoire of music

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.140
that they can access.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.790
And they also want
to listen to what

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.830
they want to listen to when
they want to listen to it.

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:33.850
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
And on any device.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:35.030
AUDU MAIKORI: On any device.

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:38.310
So you sort off with your
table and go to your phone,

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.030
go to the car and all that.

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:43.086
So it's more about
the experience now.

00:23:43.086 --> 00:23:49.344
And I think that technology is
indistinguishable from music

00:23:49.344 --> 00:23:50.260
or from entertainment.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:55.780
There's this whole
conversions of ICT, music,

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:58.930
and even the whole
experiential thing,

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:02.770
just knowing that you can
watch a concert live or stream

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:05.240
it or watch behind the
scenes [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:08.250
So I think that it's
now more about people

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:11.050
being immersed in the
experience and not just about,

00:24:11.050 --> 00:24:12.520
oh, I'm listening to music.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.120
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: Yeah.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.890
Certainly, I think
a lot of us are

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:20.420
very proud with the
explosion and the growth

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.350
within the music industry.

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:24.900
It's been a great way
to showcase Nigerian

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:29.939
and African culture and also to
export that through technology.

00:24:29.939 --> 00:24:32.480
What factors would you say--
you mentioned technology as one.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.200
But what other
factors would you say

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.440
have led to the
rapid growth we've

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.460
seen in the music industry
in terms of impact,

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:40.880
in terms of quality, as well?

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.660
AUDU MAIKORI: Yeah.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.480
The other day, somebody
sent me an article

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:51.780
that South Africa was asking
for 70% local content, sort

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:55.951
of a directive to all radio
stations in South Africa.

00:24:55.951 --> 00:24:58.492
And the South African artists
were really excited about that.

00:24:58.492 --> 00:24:59.860
And someone was
asking, you know,

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.100
it would be great if you
do something like that.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:01.790
And I said, no.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:03.910
Then many people forget
that Nigeria actually

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:08.030
had a local content policy
dating back over 10 years ago.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:11.330
So without knowing it, that was
part of the reason why radio

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:14.440
stations now have to meet
that, comply with what

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.560
the [INAUDIBLE] class
incorporation had said,

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.506
which was that you need
to have at least 70%--

00:25:18.506 --> 00:25:21.570
I think it was 80%,
actually-- local content.

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:24.405
So now you have to actually
look for that content to put.

00:25:24.405 --> 00:25:25.970
And the more you
heard the music,

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:28.680
the more-- because remember that
radio's a very powerful thing.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.596
The more you hear it,
the more you believe in.

00:25:30.596 --> 00:25:34.380
The more you believe it, the
more you hear it and want more.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:36.910
So that is a major part of that.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:40.050
The second thing, also,
was that as access

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:44.700
to travel and the
economy also set in,

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.260
we began to look inwards.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.410
So I'm thinking made in Nigeria.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:53.660
But then again, the
internet and technology

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:59.386
helped to catalyze
or level the--

00:25:59.386 --> 00:26:02.850
should I say the professional--
the quality of the sound.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:07.640
So now we can learn how
to produce on YouTube.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.730
There's a kid, I was
telling you earlier,

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.800
that you guys need to interview.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.600
His name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.730
And I met him.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.400
He's 16 and 1/2.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.710
I met him two years ago,
when he was 16 and 1/2.

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:21.901
And his father took
me to his home studio.

00:26:21.901 --> 00:26:23.650
So the guy said, oh,
he wanted to meet me.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:24.524
He wanted to meet me.

00:26:24.524 --> 00:26:27.040
So his father hounded me,
Audu, you need to hear my son.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.082
And I just thought these parents
who-- everybody's son can sing.

00:26:30.082 --> 00:26:31.540
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: Has talent,

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:33.800
AUDU MAIKORI: Everybody's
daughter and grandfather

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.300
can sing.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:34.720
So--

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.590
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Just like all fathers

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.960
made first class in school.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.250
AUDU MAIKORI: Exactly.

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.690
Everybody can sing.

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:41.410
But he sounded serious.

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:44.520
And he knew so much about the
music industry that I said, OK.

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.020
Let me go.

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:46.500
So I was on the
way to the airport.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.790
And stopped by in this house.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:49.210
It was in Abuja.

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:52.560
And the guy was
playing-- I was blown.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.862
I've never heard
anything like that.

00:26:54.862 --> 00:26:56.160
So I said, how old are you?

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.120
He said, 16 and 1/2.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.290
I swore, there's no
way you can be 16.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:00.832
He said, yes.

00:27:00.832 --> 00:27:02.581
I said, so how do you
know how to produce?

00:27:02.581 --> 00:27:03.454
He said, on YouTube.

00:27:03.454 --> 00:27:05.120
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
Fantastic, yeah.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.744
AUDU MAIKORI: Do I
get a clap for that?

00:27:06.744 --> 00:27:08.910
That was a nice slide in there.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.810
But seriously, I was amazed.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:16.670
And this is the point I'm
making, that the boy that's 16

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:19.930
is producing better than most
of the guys you hear now.

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:23.820
Now, imagine how many
other 16-year-olds.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.440
And that is how the
quality of Nigerian music

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:28.270
also improved,
because people could

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:32.100
learn the tricks immediately
and begin to try them out.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.530
The costs-- technology,
again, like I said,

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:36.300
is a big driver
because before, think

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.010
about the traditional
record labels.

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:41.890
You have to rent a big studio
like this, get live equipment,

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:44.830
get session men, book
the time that you

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:50.580
know that everybody's free, and
then they two, four, 10 takes.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:51.890
And then you couldn't wipe it.

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:53.920
So you needed to
take the take again.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.480
But now you can just
basically alter it with that

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.640
so the cost of production became
lower and more people could

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.770
come into the system and then
try out and be free with it.

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:05.130
So I think that's another one.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.910
Then, of course, again,
technology, really,

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:12.190
because when you think
about DStv, Channel O, MTV

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:15.610
or any of these stations,
they are aided and abetted

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:17.460
by the fact that
there was access now

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.510
to that content that
wasn't there 30 years ago.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:20.360
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Yes, yes.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.900
Absolutely, and
that's why we are

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.360
very passionate about
technology and the power

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.930
of digital platforms.

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:29.760
We know Nigerians are
very entrepreneurial.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.370
They just need to have the
tools and the platforms.

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:35.740
So that's a great story
that you've shared.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:39.260
We've seen other cases, as well,
of people learning a completely

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.990
new trade by watching
how-to videos on YouTube

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:44.150
or by consuming
information online.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:47.770
And so we believe very
strongly in the power of that,

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:49.966
and it's exciting to see
some of the results that

00:28:49.966 --> 00:28:50.840
are starting to show.

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:51.673
AUDU MAIKORI: It is.

00:28:51.673 --> 00:28:53.890
And also, just know
that there was a time

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:55.580
I needed to try buying a car.

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.542
And you go to the
reviews and all that.

00:28:58.542 --> 00:29:00.500
And then, I was like,
well, let's check Google.

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.707
So I googled the car.

00:29:01.707 --> 00:29:04.040
And then I was able to-- there
was a video compared both

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.331
of the cars, the specs of them.

00:29:05.331 --> 00:29:06.465
And it just showed me.

00:29:06.465 --> 00:29:08.590
And I was able to make a
decision based on the fact

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:11.430
that I was practically
there, which is

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:12.850
what many people are not using.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:14.410
They don't understand
there are other how-tos.

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:15.800
It's most about
music and lifestyle.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.400
But over time.

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:24.580
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: And do
you have any interest in movies

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.150
because there are
many similarities.

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:28.609
They're both audiovisual.

00:29:28.609 --> 00:29:29.400
AUDU MAIKORI: Yeah.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.250
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
So has that

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:31.749
ever-- is that
something that you're

00:29:31.749 --> 00:29:33.317
likely to go into at some point?

00:29:33.317 --> 00:29:34.900
Participate in the
Nollywood industry?

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.000
AUDU MAIKORI: Nollywood.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.840
No, we're actually
working at that.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.250
So just to kind of clarify,
we have a group of companies.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:42.330
We have four companies.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.890
One of them is a media
company, Chocolate City Media.

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:48.980
And we're really focused on
that over the past year or so.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:53.530
And we've been working on
several interesting projects,

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:57.132
one of which is the
film [INAUDIBLE] which

00:29:57.132 --> 00:29:57.840
we're working on.

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.540
And we're trying to build a
world-class film studio where

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:04.240
people can come in and
do some real film stuff

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:09.850
but also build a post-production
facility that is world class as

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.129
well as a training academy.

00:30:12.129 --> 00:30:13.920
Because we think that
there's a skills gap.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:16.300
I we think that you cannot
teach skills without

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.670
the infrastructure to
teach the skills in.

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:22.580
So people go for a
film course in Nigeria,

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.000
and there's no studio.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.350
So how are you going to
learn how to do that?

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:26.060
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
And practice?

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:26.270
AUDU MAIKORI: Yeah.

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:26.770
So we are.

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:29.820
But apart from that,
we also have a movie.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.856
We're done with the script now.

00:30:32.856 --> 00:30:36.120
And it's going to be funny.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.480
It's a music-- it's a comedy
based on the music industry.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.980
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: Interesting.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.606
AUDU MAIKORI: So you haven't
seen anything like it,

00:30:42.606 --> 00:30:43.470
rest assured.

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:45.595
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
When should we expect that?

00:30:45.595 --> 00:30:46.915
Is that this year?

00:30:46.915 --> 00:30:48.040
AUDU MAIKORI: I don't know.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.890
I can't say that for sure.

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:52.745
But it's most likely that--
yeah, we're shooting this year.

00:30:52.745 --> 00:30:54.880
But I'm not sure if we're
releasing it this year.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.612
So watch this space.

00:30:56.612 --> 00:30:59.574
I'll upload it on YouTube.

00:30:59.574 --> 00:31:00.990
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: Fantastic.

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:02.570
How do you see
the music industry

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:05.439
evolving in the next decade?

00:31:05.439 --> 00:31:06.730
AUDU MAIKORI: Here or globally?

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:08.922
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
In Nigeria.

00:31:08.922 --> 00:31:11.130
AUDU MAIKORI: I think we're
just coming into our own.

00:31:11.130 --> 00:31:13.296
I think that there's a lot
of infrastructural things

00:31:13.296 --> 00:31:14.690
have not been there.

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:16.410
And when I say that,
I'm talking more

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:20.150
about the intellectual
property part of it,

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:22.890
which is being able
to exploit the content

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:25.400
and really make money from it.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:29.700
So yeah, we've seen a slew
of young people making

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.070
a lot of money off
music, but I still

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:34.390
think that it is
not an ecosystem.

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.230
I still think that the money
is stopping in some places

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:38.704
and is not being spread around.

00:31:38.704 --> 00:31:40.120
The only way the
industry works is

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.460
if it services-- it has to
be a well-oiled machine.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:46.380
So I see that there'll
be better enforcement

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:50.900
of intellectual property
rights, stronger copyright laws,

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.281
as well.

00:31:52.281 --> 00:31:56.400
There are quite a few
reviews going on as we speak.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.710
More skills
development-- more people

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:00.970
who are working on
sound engineering

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:04.090
as their only core
competence and not

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:06.880
just doing a bit of everything,
lighting and all those things.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:09.300
So I think that with
those improvements,

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:15.300
you will see a lot more revenue
coming into the industry.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:19.490
Price Waterhouse report
says that Nigeria

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:22.160
should be making
close to $100 million

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:29.990
annually just from
digital music by 2018.

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:32.380
But I think it's a very
conservative figure, very, very

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:33.520
conservative.

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.380
So

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.070
the potentials are enormous.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:38.885
What we need to do,
however, is to be

00:32:38.885 --> 00:32:40.260
able to ensure
there are people's

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.332
rights because intellectual
property is really everything.

00:32:43.332 --> 00:32:45.290
And I'm not just speaking
because I'm a lawyer.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:48.060
I'm saying, so you
invest in a product.

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:51.900
How do you ensure that
you're able to make money out

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:54.880
of that if your rights
can't be enforced.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.030
So once we get that
done-- and there's

00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:01.039
a lot we're doing, either
from the COSON, the Copyright

00:33:01.039 --> 00:33:02.330
Society of Nigeria [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:05.410
We're talking with
the Senate, as well,

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:08.240
for regular legislative reviews.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.150
We're also having industry
coalitions and saying,

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:16.050
we need to get better funding
for the corporate agencies.

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:18.420
Because once they have that
and they can crack down,

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.570
then you'll find there will
be a commensurate improvement

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:24.330
not just in the industry, but
even for the GDP of Nigeria.

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:26.370
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: Right.

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:31.380
Because piracy is a huge
challenge at the moment.

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:33.150
What's been your
proudest moment?

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:34.950
You talked about
challenges earlier.

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:37.562
What are some of the things that
you've been really proud of,

00:33:37.562 --> 00:33:38.645
operating in the industry?

00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:45.140
AUDU MAIKORI: Wow.

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:49.850
I think my the first
moment I was excited about

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:54.620
was when I heard the very
first artist we signed,

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.320
and I saw his video on the TV.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.320
That was exciting.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:01.770
The second, I
think, was probably

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:04.866
when I won the Global Award
for the British Council.

00:34:04.866 --> 00:34:06.980
2011, we won something
called the African Awards

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.400
for Entrepreneurship.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:13.679
And that was huge
because we applied

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:17.350
with 3,300 other applications
from around 48 countries

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:18.520
in Africa.

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:23.350
And we got shortlisted from
3,000 to 300 to 30 to 15,

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:27.689
then to top 10, and we
won the second prize.

00:34:27.689 --> 00:34:28.340
That was huge.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:29.310
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
That's remarkable, yeah.

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:30.310
AUDU MAIKORI: Yeah,
that was huge for us.

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:31.070
And we're [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:32.550
We got nice check
with it, as well.

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:32.830
So--

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:33.960
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
That helped.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.043
AUDU MAIKORI: That helped.

00:34:35.043 --> 00:34:37.110
That really helped.

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:41.400
The third was when we also
opened our Kenyan office,

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.252
our inroad to East Africa.

00:34:44.252 --> 00:34:45.710
And then, of course--
I mean, there

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:46.960
are many of those high points.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:49.760
But for me, I would say that
the ultimate high point is

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.489
when I see these
artists that we found,

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:54.280
and we knew that they
didn't have anything.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:58.469
And today, they come in and
say, oh, let me buy you this.

00:34:58.469 --> 00:34:59.260
Come, let's go out.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:02.530
And we enter their fancy
cars, and they're living well.

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:06.626
And for me, it's like,
wow, this transformation.

00:35:06.626 --> 00:35:09.960
And it's good that they're also
carrying other people along.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.550
For me, it's always
about each one build one,

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:14.720
and then we keep
making that happen.

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.890
And that's how growth happens.

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:18.432
So for me, that's
my proudest moment.

00:35:18.432 --> 00:35:19.973
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
That's great.

00:35:19.973 --> 00:35:22.390
So I'm going to take some
questions from the audience

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.890
now.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.550
AUDU MAIKORI: Yeah, so
remember that I'm a lawyer.

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:35.800
People seem to forget that.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:39.510
But I spent quite a bit
of time in litigation.

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:42.000
And one of the things that
you find is-- and like I said,

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.940
the whole creative
sector is really

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:47.720
about intellectual property
rights, enforcement,

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.100
and exploitation.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:53.510
And the question
really is that when

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:55.980
somebody breaches his
contract-- and the truth of that

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:59.850
is [INAUDIBLE] in time
or the other either party

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:02.100
or other artists
have not breached.

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:06.880
It's the readiness
to remedy the breach.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:10.190
And in that situation,
what was happening

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:14.390
was that we had an
image crisis and a lack

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:19.320
of-- what's the word?

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.940
So we build a brand, and
we have an artist who

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:25.530
is promoting things that we're
against that and actually

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.150
were illegal under Nigerian
law, which is marijuana.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:30.730
And we're saying, you can't
put these pictures out.

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:34.320
We can't promote this because
if affects not just your band

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.400
but ours by extension.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.730
And then it makes us
lose business, as well.

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:41.940
So you can't do this.

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.540
And the artist says, no, we can.

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:45.520
I will.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:46.460
So we say, fine.

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.855
We suspend your contract
because under the contract,

00:36:48.855 --> 00:36:50.660
we can suspend you when
we find that you're

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:54.760
doing things that are
inimical to what will

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:56.220
help to push your business.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:58.860
Remember, we've invested
millions of naira

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:01.825
in this brand, in
building this brand.

00:37:01.825 --> 00:37:03.760
And I always like
to use the analogy

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:07.090
that if you took a
loan from a bank,

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:09.930
and you took 20 million
naira, and you're

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:14.700
going to build a
restaurant, and then

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:18.010
halfway, one of the guys
that you've invested,

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:21.410
that is the builder itself,
wakes up, and you have a tiff.

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:23.074
And he leaves.

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:24.990
Do you think that the
bank will say, oh, well,

00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:28.245
you had a fight with the
guy, so 20 million gone.

00:37:28.245 --> 00:37:29.500
No.

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:30.700
It's a financial discussion.

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:35.770
So two reasons-- one is
that once you prosecute one,

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:39.360
then the others will be careful
about adhering to the terms.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.124
But bigger than
that was the fact

00:37:41.124 --> 00:37:42.540
that at that time
in the industry,

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.710
many people were jumping
up and down, misbehaving.

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:47.140
And we wanted to set an
example because that's

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:51.400
what we were set up to
do, to set an example.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.330
And I'll do it again
because what it means

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:56.930
is that when people see
that these copyrights are

00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:00.100
enforceable, then they can
put the money they want to.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:03.676
Very few companies-- my
company never accessed a loan.

00:38:03.676 --> 00:38:06.050
Everything we've achieved has
been within-- all the debts

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:10.310
that we may owe is within
our directors, no more.

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:12.660
And many people-- and
in Nigerian patents,

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.582
11 years, that's
almost impossible.

00:38:14.582 --> 00:38:15.540
You never hear of that.

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.850
But that's simply because
even if we went to the bank,

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:21.570
the bank would say, well,
what if your artist goes?

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.200
So it's more about
preserving the integrity

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.680
of the industry as a whole.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:28.890
It's not about a personal
thing because when

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:31.359
he had his-- I mean, he
called me a couple of times.

00:38:31.359 --> 00:38:32.650
Oh, let's sit down, resolve it.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:34.825
And we had-- one day, I
actually came to the lawyer,

00:38:34.825 --> 00:38:35.900
and we sat down.

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.560
Well, he didn't understand.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.620
He just didn't understand, and
he still doesn't understand.

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:43.210
So for him, he feels-- I'm
sure that that many people,

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:44.880
there's a lot of
miseducation in Nigeria

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.640
about what intellectual
property is.

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.540
So I'll give an example.

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:54.190
We got an email from a
publishing company who

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:56.900
wants to use Femi Kuti's song.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:00.680
The publishing rights
are signed with BMG.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.680
The master rights are
signed with another label

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.960
that he signed on.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.467
They're two distinct rights.

00:39:05.467 --> 00:39:08.450
Though Femi Kuti
singed on it, Femi

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:10.800
doesn't have those
master rights.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:14.599
So Femi will never say to his
label, oh, I'm angry with you.

00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:15.640
Give me my master rights.

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.550
No.

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:17.770
They're clear.

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:21.530
So if the artist feels that
I can break this contract,

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:24.820
do what I want to do, and
yet be able to come back

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.690
and ask for things that
I clearly benefited

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:29.960
from and signed off before,
then it's not possible.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.430
So all it was was just
saying, industry, we

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:36.720
need to be careful because
each time somebody breaks

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.850
his contract and
nothing happens,

00:39:38.850 --> 00:39:40.830
less people will
invest in the industry.

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:42.950
And that's why you find
that in movies-- movies

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:44.930
have had more money
pumped into it

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:48.560
than music because
music is so volatile.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:49.490
But it's changing.

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:50.989
I mean, the great
thing about that--

00:39:50.989 --> 00:39:52.980
there's a lot of things
that are changing.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.630
And I'm hoping that
over time, people will

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:57.082
begin to learn those lessons.

00:39:57.082 --> 00:39:59.040
And that's the only way
the industry will grow.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.850
And that's why we found out
the music industry's not

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:02.340
as big as it should really be.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:03.770
It's simply because
the investors

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:06.230
are afraid of putting
their money in something

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:08.030
that is that volatile.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:11.170
So it's not personal.

00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:13.470
When he had his
baby, I hit him up.

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:15.020
But it's business.

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.710
It's business.

00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:18.960
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: Are
there any other questions?

00:40:27.246 --> 00:40:29.287
AUDU MAIKORI: Wow, that's
a really hard question.

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:41.120
So the other day, we
had this CNN, Twitter--

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:42.439
so we had an interview.

00:40:42.439 --> 00:40:43.980
And they're asking--
so what happened

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:44.910
was that they were
asking questions

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:46.285
about the African
music industry.

00:40:46.285 --> 00:40:48.310
And my partner and I
were kind of responding.

00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:50.310
And then people
who were following

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:52.280
could also just send a question.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:53.800
And one question
that they said was,

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:57.070
what do we do about the rapidly
declining standards of Nigerian

00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:01.330
music and the rubbish
that they're seeing?

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:05.180
And I said to the person that
the music that we're listening

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:07.100
is a reflection of our society.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.790
We are responsible for that.

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:12.950
The artist panders to
what the audience wants.

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:15.810
So if the audience says, we
don't want to hear this crap,

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:18.540
give us real music,
you will see a change.

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:23.450
If society says, we don't want
to see all this flash and all

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:24.480
this noise.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:29.090
We want something that sends a
message, you will see a shift.

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:31.747
Because remember that
[INAUDIBLE] are providing

00:41:31.747 --> 00:41:34.080
a "service," in quotes, not
a service in the traditional

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:34.800
sense.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.920
So somebody must be buying it.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:37.920
So people are buying it.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.580
People are buying it
from how they respond.

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:45.310
But I think that in terms
of curbing excesses,

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:48.160
it's a function of the
leadership, a function

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.760
of the culture and saying--
so, for example, maybe four,

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.877
five years ago, I remember that
I really told the artist, look,

00:41:54.877 --> 00:41:57.085
you get [INAUDIBLE], but
you will not be hot forever.

00:41:57.085 --> 00:41:58.876
So you should start
thinking about building

00:41:58.876 --> 00:42:00.220
your own companies.

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:01.760
So for many of them,
their companies

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.637
were registered by
my law firm to help

00:42:03.637 --> 00:42:05.220
them start doing
some sort of business

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:07.190
or leading their own
labels because it's clear

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:10.530
that you will not be successful
for more than 10 years.

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:13.460
You could be, but
why take the risk?

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:14.900
So that comes in.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.345
Guys, you need to buy land.

00:42:16.345 --> 00:42:18.580
Don't buy a Land
Rover, buy land.

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.435
Don't buy the Rover
because you need something

00:42:21.435 --> 00:42:24.495
to-- so sometimes they listen.

00:42:24.495 --> 00:42:25.370
Sometimes they don't.

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:28.564
But when you have a figure
that they kind of listen to--

00:42:28.564 --> 00:42:29.980
and that's why the
relationship is

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.580
important-- they may
think that, maybe he's

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.990
not just trying to be silly.

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:35.579
Maybe he does have my interests.

00:42:35.579 --> 00:42:37.370
But many of these guys,
they get to a level

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:39.567
whereby they don't have
any advisors anymore.

00:42:39.567 --> 00:42:40.900
And that happens with everybody.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.350
So there's nobody that's exempt.

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:45.767
You get to a level
whereby you think, hmm.

00:42:45.767 --> 00:42:47.600
Let's pop champagne
from morning till night.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.130
They'll sell the record.

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:52.810
Popping champagne
from 12:00 to 6 AM.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:55.650
When you've finished, you've
popped up your whole savings.

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:57.910
And there's nobody to say,
no, you cannot do that.

00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:59.511
No, you cannot do that.

00:42:59.511 --> 00:43:00.760
So I think that that is there.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.510
And then the professionalism
level is very low, as well.

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:07.527
So you find that managers
are more like PAs.

00:43:07.527 --> 00:43:08.610
So they don't give advice.

00:43:08.610 --> 00:43:10.440
They just take instructions.

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.370
So we need to.

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:14.592
And over time, I
think it will change.

00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:16.300
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Great, thank you.

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:24.140
AUDU MAIKORI: Oh, OK.

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:30.300
So I think that
again, like I said,

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.030
I'm in business for a reason.

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:35.139
I didn't really think
that Chocolate City--

00:43:35.139 --> 00:43:36.430
I hoped it would be successful.

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:38.900
But I didn't know it
would get to this.

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:43.050
But the whole aim of setting
it up was to make a difference

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.140
and try to empower people.

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:48.940
But I find that in Africa,
we have a leadership problem.

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:51.520
Leaders hold onto power forever.

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:55.720
So I was just thinking that
I've worked in probably five

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.730
companies, both local
and international.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:02.220
And I found that being able to
grow-- so I'll give an example.

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.090
10 years ago, I was
company secretary

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:07.250
of a company called
Abuja Markets Management.

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:09.580
And in six months, I
had two promotions.

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:12.402
I was already GM,
I was acting GM,

00:44:12.402 --> 00:44:14.860
and I was basically running--
so when the MD wasn't around,

00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:16.560
I was basically
running the office,

00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.620
I was running the staff,
maybe 50-something

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:21.170
or 60-something staff.

00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:23.017
And at that time,
I'd have people

00:44:23.017 --> 00:44:24.600
waiting at the
reception for two hours

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:27.610
to see me because we
were running property

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:30.390
stuff for the Abuja government.

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:34.260
And one day, I woke up, and I
said-- I think about 29 or 30

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:34.760
then.

00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.460
And I said, I've become
an old man already

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:42.340
because I'm sitting
[INAUDIBLE] some guy at 31.

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:45.130
So I was like, so
where do I go next?

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:46.920
Where's the progression?

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:50.380
And so my next job, I moved
six months later to a company

00:44:50.380 --> 00:44:51.345
called CPCS Transcom.

00:44:51.345 --> 00:44:52.970
It was a Canadian firm.

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:56.020
And that's where I worked
in infrastructure and power

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:57.300
and all that stuff.

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:00.026
But when I was leaving, my
MD didn't want me to go.

00:45:00.026 --> 00:45:01.650
But he said he
understood that I needed

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:08.600
to go because he saw
that I was too restless.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:12.930
So I was thinking that
when I get to 40 years

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:16.792
old or before I get to 40, I
can't be doing the same thing I

00:45:16.792 --> 00:45:17.750
was doing 10 years ago.

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:19.330
Where's the progression?

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:23.760
So five years before that, we
decided-- MI became director

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:26.160
in 2010 in Chocolate City.

00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:28.610
And we gave him shares
as early as 2010.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:31.772
And we're looking
at grooming somebody

00:45:31.772 --> 00:45:33.480
who would-- so there
were three people we

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.570
were grooming, actually.

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:36.885
OK, who could come in
and take over this?

00:45:36.885 --> 00:45:39.510
And I remember that when I made
the decision, people would say,

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:41.030
Audu, if you leave
Chocolate City,

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:42.170
there's going to be a problem.

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:44.140
Then I thought that there
is going to be a problem.

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:45.848
That means I've not
built Chocolate City.

00:45:45.848 --> 00:45:47.320
I've built Audu city.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.530
So it needed to
survive on its own.

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:53.000
And I needed to
take those risks.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.480
So when I made the decision,
I was like, before I turn 40,

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.720
I'm going to hand
over this company.

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.580
And I need to build
others because there's

00:45:58.580 --> 00:45:59.538
much more I want to do.

00:45:59.538 --> 00:46:01.700
And that was the decision.

00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:04.440
And I thought, they've
been there for a while.

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.770
They wanted to learn.

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:08.110
They'd become men.

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:12.540
And they were a bit older than I
was when I started the company.

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:14.740
So I'm sure they can handle it.

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:16.310
And that was it.

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:19.400
And I feel that
leaders in Africa

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.650
always have that
problem, it's that they

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:24.440
want to be chairman,
CEO forever and ever.

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.600
At 79, you're chairman and CEO.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.300
And you were same
when you were 29.

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:32.429
So how are we growing
the younger generation?

00:46:32.429 --> 00:46:34.220
How are they learning
anything if we're not

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:36.330
giving them responsibility?

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:37.840
So that was really it.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:38.940
It was that decision.

00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:42.072
It wasn't cause I'd
gotten bored with it.

00:46:42.072 --> 00:46:44.030
It's nice to walk around
red carpets and people

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:45.260
taking pictures.

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:48.460
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
I'm sure they still do.

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:50.320
AUDU MAIKORI: Sometimes,
but not as much.

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:53.960
But the idea was just let's
hand over to younger people.

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.680
They have better
ideas than we do.

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.840
They're smarter than we are,
and they have more potential.

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:01.566
So let's not get it twisted that
we think we're the only ones.

00:47:01.566 --> 00:47:02.340
No.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.690
And if African leaders
behave like that,

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:06.682
we'll have a better continent.

00:47:06.682 --> 00:47:08.140
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
I think you

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:11.230
raise a very important point
for organizations to be

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:13.870
sustainable, built to last.

00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:16.240
Succession planning is
very, very important.

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.050
So it's actually great to
see that that was actually

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:23.420
a conscious process, grooming
people that could actually take

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:26.485
over at the appointed time.

00:47:26.485 --> 00:47:27.735
Are there any other questions?

00:47:33.162 --> 00:47:34.120
AUDU MAIKORI: OK, yeah.

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:43.530
So what happened was this-- in
2011, we had a conversation.

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:46.380
I said, are you thinking
about-- so there's

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.982
this guys called GRIP Boiz.

00:47:48.982 --> 00:47:50.580
You guys know them.

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.760
So we're talking,
and I said, Ice,

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.712
what is happening with
these GRIP Boiz guys.

00:47:54.712 --> 00:47:55.920
What are you doing with them?

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:56.270
He said, no.

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:58.186
They're just these guys
following up and down.

00:47:58.186 --> 00:48:01.815
And I said, I think you should
sign them onto your label.

00:48:01.815 --> 00:48:03.940
I think you need to create
your own label and sign.

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:08.170
'Cause at that time,
MI had LOOPY MUSIC.

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:11.970
Yeah, MI had LOOPY
MUSIC, as well.

00:48:11.970 --> 00:48:13.500
And he missed that window.

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:14.820
So GRIP Boiz.

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:17.550
Got other management
and all that stuff.

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:20.540
So in 2013 or '14,
the conversation

00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:24.706
started about him
starting his own label.

00:48:24.706 --> 00:48:25.310
OK.

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:26.430
There's some things
I can't say here

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:28.263
because I have a press
conference on Monday.

00:48:28.263 --> 00:48:30.040
So I can't reveal
some things about it.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:34.430
But rest assured that
in that same vein,

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:36.990
having served one
year, it's time for him

00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:38.210
to do his own thing.

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:40.170
Having been faithful and
worked all that time,

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:41.970
it's time for me to support him.

00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:44.186
So he's not starting
something that's foreign.

00:48:44.186 --> 00:48:46.370
It's that we're also
supporting and making

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:48.090
him independent to do that.

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:49.421
The same thing with Jesse Jagz.

00:48:49.421 --> 00:48:51.170
And I think that that
is the model where--

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:53.711
that's how the music industry
is actually going to go anyway.

00:48:53.711 --> 00:48:55.450
So we're just being
clairvoyant about it.

00:48:55.450 --> 00:49:00.314
We just think that artists want
better control of what they do.

00:49:00.314 --> 00:49:02.730
But what they need is they
need a label and structure that

00:49:02.730 --> 00:49:04.310
helps them be better.

00:49:04.310 --> 00:49:06.049
Remember what I said
about you're not

00:49:06.049 --> 00:49:08.340
becoming more talented because
you signed on our label.

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:09.715
You have more of
a structure that

00:49:09.715 --> 00:49:12.760
helps you to be able to
explore your talent even more.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.820
So it's all part
of the progression

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:18.320
plan, which is
that everybody must

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:21.080
begin to grow their own bodies.

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:25.510
Now, in 2005, I tell
people the story

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:27.855
that the first
artist we signed was

00:49:27.855 --> 00:49:29.360
a guy called Jeremiah Gyang.

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.955
And I was looking
for [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:30.955 --> 00:49:34.090
to sign him off on to.

00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:37.780
I would call, they would
give me the runaround.

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:38.660
So I got tired.

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:40.650
And I was like, screw it.

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:43.480
I'll just do it myself.

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:46.860
And if they had
signed him, there

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:49.910
would be no Chocolate
City today, probably.

00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:52.710
So it's important that
we begin to enable people

00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:57.230
to do their own things and build
their own visions because we

00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:59.050
need more of those things.

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:02.380
Not everybody can be
signed on Chocolate City.

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:02.950
Not many.

00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:07.345
So that's the same principle.

00:50:07.345 --> 00:50:08.470
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: OK.

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:09.594
Was there another question?

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:52.650
AUDU MAIKORI: Lyrical content?

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:09.790
You know, again, these are
the issues of regulation

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:13.650
and the market that determines
some of these things.

00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:14.380
I'll be honest.

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:16.130
I've seen some of the videos.

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:21.750
And I get worried when the kids
are around because I'm like,

00:51:21.750 --> 00:51:24.320
they shouldn't be twerking.

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:28.890
They shouldn't be saying,
you chop my money.

00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:31.829
I don't mean that in reference--
I'm just saying, those things,

00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:33.370
they shouldn't be
saying those things

00:51:33.370 --> 00:51:34.912
because there's
something about music

00:51:34.912 --> 00:51:36.120
that people don't understand.

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:38.630
Music is a spiritual experience
beyond any other experience

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:41.435
in the world.

00:51:41.435 --> 00:51:43.200
I believe this happened
to you-- you've

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.800
heard some songs that you know
you've never heard before.

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:45.870
But when you hear
them, you thought

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:46.911
you've heard them before.

00:51:46.911 --> 00:51:48.560
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: Yes.

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.625
AUDU MAIKORI: And I came up
with a theory, the Audu theory.

00:51:51.625 --> 00:51:52.475
You can google it.

00:51:52.475 --> 00:51:52.900
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
The Audu theory.

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:54.820
AUDU MAIKORI: You can google it.

00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:58.090
But my theory is that
children in the womb

00:51:58.090 --> 00:52:00.810
listen to what their
parents are listening.

00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:01.500
Right?

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:03.250
So as they're playing
the music, the child

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:07.550
is subconsciously hearing
it, and in some way,

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:09.091
hitting your brain
cells somewhere.

00:52:09.091 --> 00:52:10.840
So when you hear the
music, it's something

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:12.742
that your mother heard before.

00:52:12.742 --> 00:52:14.450
The point I'm trying
to make is that when

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:18.170
a child is hearing those
things over and over again,

00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:19.460
it's ingrained in their mind.

00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:21.440
And one day, it will come up.

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:24.330
And when it comes up,
it comes up negatively.

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:26.210
So I am worried about that.

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:29.060
And what we try do in Chocolate
City is be careful about that.

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:31.780
We always try to
be very-- in fact,

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:33.030
I know that there was a fight.

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:36.560
We had one artist where
they had a album cover,

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:37.920
and it was something.

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:38.986
And I said, no.

00:52:38.986 --> 00:52:40.221
We had a big fight over it.

00:52:40.221 --> 00:52:40.720
I said, no.

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:41.761
I'm not gonna allow that.

00:52:41.761 --> 00:52:43.510
You can go do it
on your own thing,

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:45.210
but don't do it
on my thing simply

00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:49.110
because I think that the
music needs to be sellable.

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:49.970
And guess what?

00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:52.620
The best, most popular
songs are the songs

00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:55.120
that everybody can
listen to and can enjoy.

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.160
So you're right, but
how do you do that?

00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:01.700
The NBC has a explicit
content regulation.

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:04.890
So if a song is too lewd or
it has too many whatever,

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:08.380
they'll ban the
video and all that.

00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:11.240
But the problem with that is
that MTV will still play it,

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:13.850
and children are on DStv.

00:53:13.850 --> 00:53:17.300
So don't let them watch DStv.

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:20.870
But, I mean, over time,
hopefully that will change.

00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:22.691
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Any other question?

00:53:22.691 --> 00:53:23.190
OK.

00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:27.390
So bringing it back to
your-- looking at what

00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:29.120
really drives you.

00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:34.260
I read one of your
articles tied to-- well,

00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:35.897
it started with, I'm angry.

00:53:35.897 --> 00:53:37.480
AUDU MAIKORI: It's
title "I Am Angry."

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:38.400
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Titled "I Am Angry," as well.

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:39.890
OK.

00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:44.600
And it was very passionate,
very heartfelt, right?

00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:48.030
And it was a challenge
to young people in terms

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:51.950
of their roles in
society and how

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:56.490
they use technology platforms
like social media, et cetera.

00:53:56.490 --> 00:54:00.520
And also, you were a key member
of the Enough Is Enough rally

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:04.240
just addressing governance
issues in Nigeria.

00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:06.050
What's your motivation?

00:54:06.050 --> 00:54:08.695
And what's your dream
as a young Nigerian?

00:54:08.695 --> 00:54:10.540
AUDU MAIKORI: Not so young.

00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:11.480
Not so young Nigerian.

00:54:11.480 --> 00:54:12.938
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: Well, well.

00:54:12.938 --> 00:54:19.540
AUDU MAIKORI: But I
just think that when

00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:22.995
you look at what Nigeria could
have been and what we are,

00:54:22.995 --> 00:54:26.630
we know that we're a far
cry from the promised land.

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:32.740
And we have not
learned that it is not

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:37.090
by doing the same thing by
the same people over and over

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:39.134
that we get different results.

00:54:39.134 --> 00:54:40.550
There's a whole
theory about that.

00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:41.383
It's called madness.

00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:48.420
And I really understand
why the older generation

00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:50.730
behaved the way they behave.

00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:53.390
These are guys that
came from the villages.

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:56.394
They didn't know
what electricity was.

00:54:56.394 --> 00:54:58.310
They woke up, and the
white man was somewhere,

00:54:58.310 --> 00:55:00.989
and they started going
to missionary schools.

00:55:00.989 --> 00:55:03.030
Then they graduated and
went aboard and schooled.

00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:04.623
Then they came back and
started running their country.

00:55:04.623 --> 00:55:05.450
You understand.

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:09.400
So they struggled
for all those things.

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:12.060
And because of that, they've
clutched onto those things

00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:14.527
because that is what
they think they have.

00:55:14.527 --> 00:55:16.110
And then we have a
couple young people

00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:17.820
who are brilliant, intelligent.

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:19.340
They're doing fantastic things.

00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:20.965
The best stories you
hear about Nigeria

00:55:20.965 --> 00:55:23.970
are about the younger generation
now, not the older generation.

00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:24.845
It is the innovation.

00:55:24.845 --> 00:55:25.670
It is the creativity.

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:27.230
JULIET EHIMUAN CHIAZOR:
Entrepreneurship.

00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:29.021
AUDU MAIKORI: The
entrepreneurs, the people

00:55:29.021 --> 00:55:32.020
that are innovating and
changing the landscape.

00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:35.550
But they do not understand
that whatever they do

00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:41.020
is actually limited by what the
powers that be say they can do.

00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:44.150
So you remember the
social media bill which

00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:46.050
just rested in peace recently.

00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:49.240
But there was a hole
uproar about that.

00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:53.665
And because there was nobody
influential right there,

00:55:53.665 --> 00:55:56.090
it even had its day in the sun.

00:55:56.090 --> 00:55:56.880
It shouldn't have.

00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:58.750
But it's because
the people who have

00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:01.190
the brains, the
intelligence, the passion

00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:03.230
are not interested in that.

00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:05.780
They'd rather do nine-to-fives
and start businesses.

00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:07.130
That is not bad.

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:09.939
But we can't all
do the same thing.

00:56:09.939 --> 00:56:11.480
And I also felt that
for a long time,

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:13.030
politics has been demonized.

00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:15.170
So people just say,
oh, he's a politician.

00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:16.100
It's a dirty game.

00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:16.915
You know?

00:56:16.915 --> 00:56:18.230
And holier than thou.

00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:21.290
But even if you're not
playing the dirty game,

00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:23.530
the dirt is being
poured upon you.

00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:25.860
So what are you
going to do about it?

00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:28.280
And I just thought that
instead of blaming, oh,

00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:30.230
why do we not have this?

00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:34.930
It's because the young
people are not interested.

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:36.460
They've lost hope.

00:56:36.460 --> 00:56:41.400
So mine was a call to action and
saying, we must change things.

00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:45.000
We must take responsibility
for the future of this country.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.729
We can't keep blaming our
fathers for what they did.

00:56:47.729 --> 00:56:49.520
Our fathers have done
their own-- my father

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:52.430
is 74 years old.

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:54.600
He's not the man he used to be.

00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:55.720
But he's great.

00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:57.664
He's lived a great life.

00:56:57.664 --> 00:56:59.830
Now, whatever happens in
Nigeria is not his business

00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:01.600
because he can die anytime.

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:03.650
But he's lived his life.

00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:05.420
So it's now about the
future generation.

00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:07.639
So it's not really
a call about us.

00:57:07.639 --> 00:57:08.930
It's a call about our children.

00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:11.960
It's that we need to
leave this country better

00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:14.030
than we lived through.

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:16.940
But in our case, our
parents lived a better life

00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:18.911
than we are.

00:57:18.911 --> 00:57:19.410
Right?

00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:20.990
Our parents lived
in a better Nigeria

00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:22.198
than we are living currently.

00:57:22.198 --> 00:57:26.200
So it'll only be wicked for us
to leave a worse-off Nigeria

00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:27.489
for our kids.

00:57:27.489 --> 00:57:29.780
So it only makes sense for
us to do something about it.

00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:31.196
And the only way
we can do that is

00:57:31.196 --> 00:57:34.280
get involved in making those
political decisions that

00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:36.194
affect our economy,
our livelihood,

00:57:36.194 --> 00:57:37.110
our social well-being.

00:57:37.110 --> 00:57:39.787
So that's where that came from.

00:57:39.787 --> 00:57:41.870
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
And you announced recently

00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:45.000
that you are looking to
get involved in politics.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.500
AUDU MAIKORI: Yeah.

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:47.340
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
I was going to ask you

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:48.300
the question, why now?

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:51.290
But I think you've sort
of answer it already,

00:57:51.290 --> 00:57:53.200
the motivation behind that.

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.680
But what I'll say
is you mentioned

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:58.120
that there are a number
of people that stay away.

00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:01.880
I think part of the
motivation behind that

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:05.040
might just be just
a sense of it's

00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:07.900
very hard to break through.

00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:12.360
I may have to compromise
in certain ways for me

00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:15.100
to be able to sit at the
table, that sort of thing.

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:17.900
What's your view, and
how does that play out

00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:19.526
in terms of your own ambition?

00:58:19.526 --> 00:58:21.400
AUDU MAIKORI: I feel
that we make compromises

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:22.990
every single day.

00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:25.180
We make compromises on
different levels every day.

00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:32.680
So I think that someone will
call it cafeteria Christianity.

00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:35.196
So you go in and say, oh, I
want to have some of this.

00:58:35.196 --> 00:58:36.820
No, I'm not going to
have some of this.

00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:40.092
You pick what you
think is compromise.

00:58:40.092 --> 00:58:42.210
We all compromise everyday.

00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:43.920
I'm not saying be unethical.

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:46.580
I'm saying that every
game has its rules.

00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:50.000
So if you're playing handball
and you kick the ball in,

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.510
it is not a goal.

00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:53.100
Right?

00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:54.520
Unless it is football.

00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:56.250
So politics has its own rules.

00:58:56.250 --> 00:59:00.430
We can either rewrite the
rules or we can play the rules

00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:03.100
until we get to a position
where we can change those rules.

00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:05.930
And what I'm saying is that
for a long time, the people who

00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:07.980
have controlled the
conversation are

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:11.990
people who are A, not
particularly educated, B, not

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:13.934
particularly patriotic.

00:59:13.934 --> 00:59:15.600
But one thing they
understood is that we

00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.054
keep close to the people.

00:59:17.054 --> 00:59:18.970
So they're having
conversation with the people

00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:22.510
over a period of time, and
they make them promises.

00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:23.905
They have no vision.

00:59:23.905 --> 00:59:25.770
They have only a mission,
and their mission

00:59:25.770 --> 00:59:29.940
is to plunder and to
reward one or two people.

00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:31.690
So the visionaries are
there sitting down,

00:59:31.690 --> 00:59:34.170
complaining every day
about the problem.

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:37.120
So I'm saying that that
conversation has to change.

00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:40.760
Now, how does affect the people
that have been away from it

00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:41.260
for a while?

00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:42.830
And how do you get immersed?

00:59:42.830 --> 00:59:46.250
I think that politics is not
a function of just running

00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:47.680
for election.

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:50.480
It's about how economic
and social decisions

00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:51.710
are being made every day.

00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:54.884
So there's politics
even in Google, right?

00:59:54.884 --> 00:59:56.300
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
In homes--

00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:57.615
AUDU MAIKORI: Is that
politically correct?

00:59:57.615 --> 00:59:58.530
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Well, yes.

00:59:58.530 --> 00:59:59.030
AUDU MAIKORI: But no, no.

00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.580
But there's politics--

00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:00.720
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: In
homes, even, in families.

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.480
AUDU MAIKORI: No, there's
politics in everything.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:03.970
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
An integral part of life.

01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:05.020
AUDU MAIKORI: Politics
is the discussion

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:07.100
of how power is shared,
our resources are shared.

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:08.070
That's all.

01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:10.390
So it may not be
that your running.

01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:14.979
And I'm saying that it starts
from one action to the other

01:00:14.979 --> 01:00:15.520
to the other.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:19.020
You need to start taking
small actions in our society

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.801
and hope-- not even hope.

01:00:20.801 --> 01:00:23.300
When the government sees that
this whole thing is happening,

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:24.440
they'll come and say, OK.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.380
So how can we work with you?

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.920
How can we make this happen?

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:30.690
And that is what
I'm talking about.

01:00:30.690 --> 01:00:33.280
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: I think
certainly, a lot of Nigerians

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:36.735
have a very big vision
for the country.

01:00:36.735 --> 01:00:39.800
I think we're all united
in the understanding

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.670
and the perception
that where we are

01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:46.420
is far from the promise
that really exists

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:49.780
because we know Nigerians are
talented, resilient, and so on.

01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:54.040
And I think we're all united
in our optimism for a greater

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:54.570
future.

01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:55.529
AUDU MAIKORI: Yeah.

01:00:55.529 --> 01:00:57.570
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Talking about the future,

01:00:57.570 --> 01:01:00.490
the next 10 years for Chocolate
Group, what does that look

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:01.280
like?

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:04.940
For you and for
Chocolate City Group.

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.160
AUDU MAIKORI: There's
a lot we're doing.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.810
But we're focused on
building infrastructure now.

01:01:09.810 --> 01:01:12.470
We think that there needs to
be some more expansion in terms

01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:15.430
of the infrastructure that
helps the entertainment

01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:17.230
industry grow.

01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:19.324
So we're running a few projects.

01:01:19.324 --> 01:01:21.260
Because of the nature
of the projects,

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:22.870
I can't talk to you about that.

01:01:22.870 --> 01:01:24.536
But one of the projects
we're working on

01:01:24.536 --> 01:01:28.256
is a media city, which
is going to be in Kaduna.

01:01:28.256 --> 01:01:30.130
We're wrapping up that
conversation, as well.

01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:32.870
We're working on some
property development,

01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:36.230
as well, in Abuja,
which will have

01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:40.240
performance venues and
production and things

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.310
like that.

01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:46.360
In Lagos, we are also ruling
out a distribution platform,

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.570
as well.

01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:50.087
We are part of--
so two years ago,

01:01:50.087 --> 01:01:52.045
we launched something
called [INAUDIBLE] Music.

01:01:52.045 --> 01:01:54.089
It basically aggregates content.

01:01:54.089 --> 01:01:55.380
But it's beyond Chocolate City.

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.630
It's SPV.

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:58.630
Because we also believe
strongly in partnership.

01:01:58.630 --> 01:02:00.735
So the rule I really play
in Chocolate City now

01:02:00.735 --> 01:02:04.180
is more of the partnership guy.

01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:07.430
My job is to look for those
strategic partnerships

01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:10.790
because I know that together,
we can do it much better.

01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:12.220
And that's what you'll see.

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:15.710
You'll see the film part
of Chocolate City, as well.

01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:19.750
By 2017 for sure, our
first movie will be out.

01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:22.560
But beyond that, we are
thinking about churning

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:24.580
a whole slew of contents.

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:26.264
So that's what it looks like.

01:02:26.264 --> 01:02:27.680
JULIET EHIMUAN
CHIAZOR: Fantastic.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:32.960
AUDU MAIKORI: And more
people, stronger team,

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.950
get more people employed.

01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:39.280
In East Africa, we're just kind
of reconstituting the board

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:42.360
because we're trying to
be a bit more effective.

01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.570
East Africa is
actually now picking up

01:02:44.570 --> 01:02:46.770
at a very interesting rate.

01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:49.640
And so we've been there
for three years now.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.980
We're trying to reposition
to make sure that we're

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:53.105
carried along on that wave.

01:02:53.105 --> 01:02:54.660
So that's what it looks like.

01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:56.326
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
We'll definitely

01:02:56.326 --> 01:02:58.820
be watching this space,
looking out for the movie

01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:01.830
when it comes out next
year and watching out

01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:03.620
to see all the other
projects unfold.

01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:05.730
AUDU MAIKORI: And literally, it
will be exclusively on YouTube.

01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:06.188
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR: Wooho!

01:03:06.188 --> 01:03:08.020
AUDU MAIKORI: Just the trailer.

01:03:08.020 --> 01:03:09.500
Just the trailer.

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:11.500
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Thank you so much, Audu,

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.050
for spending this time with us.

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:16.020
It's been great having
you at the office

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:17.906
and having this
conversation with you.

01:03:17.906 --> 01:03:19.030
Thanks for making the time.

01:03:19.030 --> 01:03:21.810
AUDU MAIKORI: It's--
before you clap,

01:03:21.810 --> 01:03:24.660
it's been very enriching
talking to you guys.

01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:26.930
And I want to say
thank you to Google.

01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:28.606
You guys are great.

01:03:28.606 --> 01:03:31.170
Very beautiful office.

01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:34.150
But more importantly, you have
beautiful officers and people

01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:39.065
who are helping to train and
to pass skills to many people.

01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:40.940
My company has benefited
immensely from that.

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:42.242
Many other companies have.

01:03:42.242 --> 01:03:44.060
And I want to commend
the job you're doing.

01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:51.140
And I wish you guys more
success, more blessing,

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:52.830
more bandwidth, literally.

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:53.210
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Thank you.

01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:55.126
AUDU MAIKORI: To keep
doing what you're doing.

01:03:55.126 --> 01:03:56.430
So thank you very much.

01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:57.560
JULIET EHIMUAN-CHIAZOR:
Thank you very much, Audu.

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:57.860
Great.

01:03:57.860 --> 01:03:58.360
Thank you.

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.210
[APPLAUSE]
