00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.030
On May 8, 1828, the man who founded The International
Committee of the Red Cross, Henry Dunant,

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.100
was born.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.080
In 1922, almost a century after his birth,
the eighth of May was declared a day dedicated

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.050
to the International Red Cross, in this way
honoring its founder.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.850
Dunant’s dream was to prevent and alleviate
human suffering, without discrimination.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.540
Despite being born to wealth, he died in poverty
partially due to his dedication to charitable

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.540
work.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.360
He remains one of the greatest humanitarians
in history, but few today know much about

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.360
him.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.430
So who was Henry Dunant really?

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.079
Henry Dunant was born in Geneva, Switzerland
to wealthy parents.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.969
His father was a successful – and generous
– businessman who early on instilled in

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.530
Dunant’s young mind the value of helping
others.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.170
His father and grandfather were men of power
and prestige in Geneva, and had held various

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.270
positions such as membership in Geneva’s
governing council, director of a Geneva hospital,

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.540
and mayor of a small city near Geneva called
Avully.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.420
As a young man, Dunant was fascinated by the
works of three writers, all of them women:

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.060
Harriet Beecher Stowe, Florence Nightingale,
and Elizabeth Fry.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.570
He later stated,

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.670
The influence of women is an essential factor
in the welfare of humanity, and it will become

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.170
more valuable as time proceeds.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.530
Henry busied himself with a number of charitable
activities.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.950
Anti-Semitism was pretty intense at that time
in Europe, and Dunant worked against this,

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.619
particularly encouraging Christians and Jews
to band together.

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.159
He also became a member of the Geneva organization
known as the “League of Alms,” whose main

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.619
purpose was to provide spiritual and material
assistance to the poor and sick.

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.720
He frequently visited Geneva’s jails, where
he tried to rehabilitate and reintegrate prisoners.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.600
Dunant was religious from his earliest youth,
and had felt that religion could be the answer

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.329
to many moral issues in society.

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.579
Partially motivated by this, he became an
active member of the Young Men’s Christian

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:08.149
Association (YMCA) and co-founded a YMCA in
Geneva in 1852.

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.510
He went on to help found the World Alliance
of YMCAs which was first developed in 1855.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.129
Along with his colorful social life and all
his humanitarian efforts, he was prospering

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.900
on a professional level too.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.940
In 1849, he was appointed to the Bank of Geneva.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.069
His work there was so impressive that in 1853
he was appointed interim general manager of

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.680
the subsidiary company in Algeria, where he
also started his own business.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.870
In 1859, he had to consult with Napoleon III
concerning his business, so he traveled to

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.150
northern Italy where Napoleon III was conducting
a military campaign.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.879
This trip changed his life.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.879
On the June 25, 1859, Henry Dunant witnessed
firsthand the tragedy and horrors of war when

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.989
he toured the area the day after the Battle
of Solferino, a particularly bloody mutual

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.920
slaughter, with tens of thousands of soldiers
left on the battlefield dead or dying.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.970
This traumatic experience had such an impact
that when he returned to Geneva, he wrote

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.099
a book about what he had seen, A Memory of
Solferino, which he published at his own expense.

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.099
The book was translated into many languages,
and was circulated to most of the influential

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.440
leaders and politicians throughout Europe.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.970
A Memory of Solferino made this proposition:

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.989
“If the new and frightful weapons of destruction,
which are now at the disposal of the nations,

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.810
seem destined to abridge the duration of future
wars, it appears likely, on the other hand,

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.549
that future battles will only become more
and more murderous.

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.410
Would it not be possible, in time of peace
and quiet, to form relief societies for the

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.690
purpose of having care given to the wounded
in wartime by zealous, devoted and thoroughly

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.270
qualified volunteers?”

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.270
He also stated:

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.330
Adoption by all civilized nations of an international
and sacred principle which would be assured

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.519
and placed on record by a convention to be
concluded between governments.

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.670
This would serve as a safeguard for all official
and unofficial persons engaged in nursing

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.010
war victims.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.319
The idea for the foundation of the Red Cross
had been planted in his mind and heart.

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.530
After witnessing the direct aftermath of the
battle of Solferino, Dunant dedicated his

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.530
time, and much of his money, to the relief
of mankind from the pain incurred in war.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.820
He traveled to every major city in Europe
to spread the message of the destructive and

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.800
inhuman nature of war, and to promote the
importance of peace.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.850
In 1862, he sent Gustave Moynier, president
of the Geneva Society for Public Welfare,

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.100
a copy of his book A Memory of Solferino.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.220
Moynier was touched by the book’s essence
and decided to invite Dunant to a special

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.300
meeting on February 9, 1863 of the Geneva
Society for Public Welfare.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.370
Following this meeting, it was decided to
establish an International Committee for Relief

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.990
to the Wounded of War.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.590
This organization became the International
Committee of the Red Cross.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.790
Dunant served as a member of this committee
and worked as its Secretary for some years.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.460
Another key facet of his work was the suggestion
that there was a need for, “a government

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.979
treaty recognizing the neutrality of the agency
and allowing it to provide aid in a war zone.”

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:09.230
This idea ultimately led to the first Geneva
Convention treaty.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.110
While Dunant’s humanitarian work was producing
amazing fruits, his business and financial

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.800
affairs weren’t doing as well owing to nearly
complete neglect by Dunant.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.180
By 1867, he was forced to declare bankruptcy.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.110
Financially ruined and with debts exceeding
one million Swiss francs, he resigned from

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.229
his position as Secretary of the International
Committee.

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:35.220
On September 8, 1867 the Commission decided
to accept his resignation not only as Secretary,

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.660
but as a member as well.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.470
In disgrace, Dunant went to Paris, where he
ended up sleeping on benches in the parks

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.419
and eating scraps of food where he could find
it.

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.520
But poverty did not stop his humanitarian
work.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.350
During the Franco-Prussian war, he visited
and comforted the wounded who had been moved

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.060
to Paris, and introduced the use of armbands
to identify the dead.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.211
At the end of the war, Dunant traveled to
London, where he sought to organize an international

00:05:58.211 --> 00:06:02.600
conference concerning the problem of prisoners
of war, and even though the Tsar of Russia

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.950
encouraged him, England was against such a
project.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.940
An international conference on the “total
and final abolition of the slave trade”

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:15.220
was launched in London on February 1, 1875,
also instigated by Dunant.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.430
Of course, humanitarian work usually doesn’t
pay well, or at all in many cases, and years

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.210
of wandering and extreme poverty followed
for Dunant.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.930
Through the years, he traveled on foot in
Germany, Italy and Alsace, living on donations

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.250
and the hospitality of friends and new acquaintances.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.330
Finally, in 1887, Dunant found himself in
the Swiss village of Heiden, where he fell

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.700
seriously ill.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.320
He found refuge in the local nursing home,
and it was here that he was discovered in

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.830
1895 by a journalist who wrote an article
about him.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.870
A few days later, the article, and the fact
that Dunant was still alive which was news

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.460
to many, was republished throughout Europe.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.550
Messages of sympathy and acclaim reached Dunant
from all over the world; Dunant was again

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:59.139
celebrated and honored, and in 1901, he received
the very first Nobel Peace Prize for his integral

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:04.669
role in the establishment of the Red Cross
as well as the first treat in what would become

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:06.550
known as the Geneva Conventions.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:10.750
Now with the Nobel Peace Prize money in hand,
you might wonder if Dunant perhaps started

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.210
a new business with it to take himself out
of poverty and debt, or at the least move

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:18.699
out of the small nursing home room he’d
occupied for several years.

00:07:18.699 --> 00:07:19.699
In fact, he did not.

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:22.540
He continued to live there for the rest of
his life.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:27.349
As for the prize money, some 75,000 Swiss
Francs (about $375,000 today), he didn’t

00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:31.350
spend any of it himself, leaving it untouched
in the account setup for him.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.570
Upon his death nine years after winning the
prize, he left much of the money to various

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.680
charitable organizations, as well as to the
nursing home where he had been living with

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.240
the stipulation that they leave one free bed
open for the poorest of the community to use

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.530
in times of need.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:49.450
He also left a certain amount to pay back
some of the debts he still had from back in

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:50.450
his business days.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.819
Henry Dunant died in relative obscurity on
October 20, 1910.

00:07:54.819 --> 00:07:59.060
As per his wishes, no funeral was held, nor
any other type of gathering celebrating his

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.060
life.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.050
He simply requested that he be “carried
to his grave like a dog.”
