00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:08.850
JONATHAN: Good afternoon.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.440
And welcome to Talks at Google
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.260
Today it is my
truly great pleasure

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.938
to introduce Dr.
Barry M. Prizant.

00:00:19.938 --> 00:00:23.810
I've been looking forward
to this talk for months.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.900
Barry's CV is really too
extensive to list here.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.760
Short form, since 1998
he's been director

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.170
of childhood communication
services, CCS,

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.890
a private practice, and
serves as adjunct professor

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.130
in the Center for the Study
of Human Development at Brown

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.305
University.

00:00:43.305 --> 00:00:47.380
He has published more than
120 articles and chapters

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.230
on autism, childhood
communication disorders,

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.780
and child development.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.960
He's given more
than 700 seminars

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.060
and workshops, national and
international conferences.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.710
He served on the editorial
board of six scholarly journals,

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.670
and writes a regular column for
"Autism Spectrum Quarterly."

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.070
In our book today, "Uniquely
Human," Dr. Prizant

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.050
offers a compelling
new approach.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.330
The most successful
approaches to autism

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.560
don't aim to fix a person
by eliminating symptoms,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.410
but instead seek to understand
the individual's experience

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.800
and what underlies behavior.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.980
I picked this book up
expecting to skim it,

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.140
and wound up reading every word.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.110
I believe it's one of
the most remarkable books

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.360
about the human condition
that I've ever read.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.076
Please join me in
welcoming Barry Prizant.

00:01:42.076 --> 00:01:44.441
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:46.242 --> 00:01:47.700
BARRY PRIZANT:
Thank you, Jonathan.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.570
And it's really a
pleasure to be here.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.280
And good afternoon to you all.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.830
Thanks for coming.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.630
What I'm going to be
talking about in essence

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.800
is my life's work, going back
to when I was a teenager.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.140
And I'll talk a little bit
about the path that I took.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.940
But the path that
I've taken in a way

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.607
mirrors-- and I
hope we could say

00:02:08.607 --> 00:02:10.440
that maybe the work
that I've done with some

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.790
of my colleagues-- it is
also very close to the path

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.390
that our understanding
of autism has taken.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.960
And that's what my
relatively short talk will

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.140
do for you today
as we move ahead,

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.280
and that is talk about this
concept of looking at people

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.360
with autism as uniquely
human, and trying

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.260
to move away from the more
traditional views, especially

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.110
over the last 50, 60, 70 years.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.450
70 years ago when autism
was first diagnosed--

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.380
or if you will,
described-- by Leo Kanner,

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.820
there's been a very
interesting path.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.630
In my career I've
been a part of that

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.880
because it's my 46th year
in the field, if you will,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.610
if you count the start
that I had at summer camps.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.560
And I'll be talking
about that a little bit.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.670
So there I am, just to prove
that I do go back this far.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.320
This was a camp
for kids who were

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.700
labeled with emotional
behavioral disorders in 1971.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.260
It was two years
after Woodstock.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.480
And yes, I really was there.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.650
And many of these boys
had other diagnoses,

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.400
primarily in terms of emotional
or behavioral problems.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.820
And many of you are
aware of-- we now

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.330
talk about the autism
spectrum and how much

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.400
that category has expanded.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.060
Today, when I look
at these boys--

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.740
and it seems like yesterday-- I
would think that at least half

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.260
of these boys today would
get a diagnosis on the autism

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.760
spectrum.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.430
Whereas back then I
think one of these boys

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.570
had a diagnosis with autism.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.690
I want to focus on three issues
for the time that we have.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.180
The first issue
is the importance

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.910
of understanding the behavior
of people with autism--

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.150
and ASD, if you don't know,
is autism spectrum disorder.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.650
What are some of
their challenges

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.920
and their experiences?

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.700
And in particular,
we're going to talk

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.130
about how people have
described and have

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.550
looked at behavioral patterns.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.250
And I will add to that,
have probably misunderstood

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.050
a lot of the
patterns of behavior

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.000
that have been documented
over the years,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.670
and that are even still
used in diagnosing autism.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.490
I want to talk also
about the belief

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.560
that autism is simply nothing
but a tragedy for the child

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.790
and a tragedy for the family.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.520
It still lingers out
there, especially

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.790
in mainstream settings,
mainstream public.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.460
And a lot of advocacy
organizations

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.650
continue to promote this
notion of autism, this tragedy,

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.290
because it's a way
that you raise money.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.740
If you say, wait a second.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.430
Maybe that is a
wrong descriptor.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.770
Maybe there are people
with autism and families,

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.050
despite the challenges, who
are doing very well, thank you.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.460
But I'm going to be talking
about how many kids I've

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.990
followed over the years.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.670
I'll be talking about the
fact that for 20 years

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.130
we've been doing
a weekend parent

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.830
retreat for parents of children
and adults with autism.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.170
And it's really hard
to find families

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.780
who just say, you
know, this has been

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.010
just nothing but a tragedy.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.647
As a matter of fact, very
often we hear the reverse.

00:05:16.647 --> 00:05:17.480
I'm not saying many.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.530
But some parents actually say,
if we could turn back time

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.590
and I could make it so that
my child did not have autism,

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.610
would I do it?

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.590
And some parents
actually say no.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.100
That they feel they've
lived like more deeply

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.280
because of the experience of
raising a person with autism

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.650
and of connecting
with other people

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.940
in the community of
families that have a family

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.930
member with autism.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.550
And we're going to finish
up a little bit talking

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.040
about the belief--
again, I think

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.200
it's a false belief in a
sense-- that autism is only

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.940
within a child or a person.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.250
If any of you have a family
member or a neighbor who

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.696
has a diagnosis of
autism, you no it

00:05:56.696 --> 00:05:59.140
has probably
influenced your life.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.740
And sometimes in
challenging ways.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.120
But sometimes in very
positive ways as well.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.930
So this notion of autism just
being within a person, we're

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.040
going to talk about
that a little bit more

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.850
as we move ahead.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.290
I think of it this way.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.930
There's a quiet
revolution going on.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.370
And not too much
of that revolution

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.970
has really hit the
mainstream yet.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.620
And what is that revolution?

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.540
The revolution is that we're
beginning to look at autism,

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.570
and people with
autism, as uniquely

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.420
human as opposed to
a bunch of symptoms,

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.720
or a pathological condition, or
that autism is the only thing

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.950
that we see when we see a
persona who has that diagnosis.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.410
That many of you know,
it's kind of an old adage

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.910
now, that once you've met
one person with autism,

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.601
you've met one
person with autism.

00:06:48.601 --> 00:06:51.100
And that people with autism are
as different from each other

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.980
as I am from every
person in this room.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.650
And that's important, because
different people with autism

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.030
have different talents,
different passions,

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.090
different types of
relationships with people.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.190
But what's happened with kind
of this stereotypic notion

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.170
of the person or the child
with autism-- quote/unquote--

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.460
in his own little world, or
not being interested in people

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.400
is that stereotype has really
taken hold, unfortunately,

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.690
in the mainstream public.

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.470
And a point I want
to make right now

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:26.240
is, it really has
inhibited possibilities

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.330
for people with autism.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.430
So let me just give
you a quick example.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.540
There's a young man.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.550
And just for
confidentiality reasons,

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.489
I'm not gonna mention
specific names.

00:07:37.489 --> 00:07:39.530
But he's a young man who
went to school in Boston

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.390
at the Berklee School of Music.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.160
World famous now.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.700
World famous jazz pianist.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:46.270
OK.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.230
And I know the family.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.590
And I've known this
young man for many years.

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:54.780
And just graduated from another
renowned school of music in New

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.600
York City.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.900
Has 10 CDs.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.390
Travels the world
playing jazz piano.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:04.999
And yet, in speaking with
his mom, his mom said to me,

00:08:04.999 --> 00:08:07.540
you know, he's having trouble
getting a job-- the type of job

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.120
he would really love
to have-- cause as soon

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.820
as people hear
the word "autism,"

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.750
they run the other way.

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.660
And here's a person who
is incredibly successful,

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:21.580
and is probably one of the
most engaging, polite, just

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.620
wonderful people you
ever want to meet.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.120
So we still have that
stigma out there.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.610
And this is what we're trying
to kind of work against.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.870
So that quiet revolution
that's going on

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:33.780
is being led by parents.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:38.260
And it's being led by
people who have autism.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.940
There's a group now
out of Washington

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.260
that's known as the Autistic
Self-Advocacy Network.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.820
And they are lobbying
constantly for legislation.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.160
They are lobbying for public
policy that recognizes people

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.750
with autism as whole people.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.280
Yes, challenges go with autism.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.054
And they're very
open about that.

00:09:00.054 --> 00:09:02.220
But they're trying to change
the perception as well.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.553
I've been fortunate enough
to know some of these people.

00:09:04.553 --> 00:09:06.460
Actually last
month out in Denver

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.090
I shared an hour with one of the
officers of this organization.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.560
And she did a
beautiful job talking

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.420
about how when you see us
more as whole people, how that

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.590
opens up possibilities for us.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.070
But as long as we go
with the old stereotypes,

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.290
doors are literally
slammed in our face.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.370
And we can't move on from there.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.870
So let me just give
you a little bit

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:33.370
of some of this change that's
happening in this revolution.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.150
Some of you may have heard
the term "autistic behavior."

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.660
Raise your hand if you have.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.130
Have you heard that term before?

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:39.320
OK.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.111
That person has a lot
of autistic behavior.

00:09:41.111 --> 00:09:42.446
Look at that autistic behavior.

00:09:42.446 --> 00:09:44.070
And it's such a wide
range of patterns.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.350
Everything from rocking
to flapping when excited,

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:52.491
to jumping up and down, to in
some cases doing the same thing

00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:54.490
over and over again the
same way, which is known

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.810
as perseverative behavior.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.150
And one of the points that
I make in "Uniquely Human"

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.335
by looking at different
patterns of behavior

00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:03.210
is now wait a second.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.760
This is all human
behavior that we

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.290
engage in very similar
patterns, sometimes

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:11.050
for very similar reasons.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.680
However, very often
we know not to do it

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.430
in front of other people.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:16.120
OK.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.812
Or we may not do
it as persistently.

00:10:18.812 --> 00:10:20.270
But we'll be talking
about the fact

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.460
that such patterns
of behavior often

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.830
serve an emotional regulatory
function, that it helps us

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.840
when we're feeling a
little bit stressed.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.950
Or such patterns of
behavior may help us

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.220
when we feel we
need to concentrate.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:37.530
So I see a young person right
here kind of stroking her hair.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.670
You know, when a child
does it who has autism,

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.050
oh, we gotta stop that
autistic behavior.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:45.490
But how many of you stroke
your hair or kind of scratch

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:49.250
your beard, or engage in those
kinds of patterns of behavior,

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.650
which sometimes helps us to stay
regulated emotionally, or helps

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:55.290
us focus our energy
a little bit more.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:58.540
And if we had time, I could
give you more than a dozen

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.890
or two examples of
patterns of behavior

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.730
that when a person
with autism does it,

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.960
it's considered a
sign of pathology.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.950
But when we do it, well,
it's just what we do.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.200
We spoke briefly about
the notion of tragedy.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.570
And the depathologizing
of autism

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.770
is now looking at
people being different.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.410
We do know-- and there's
almost four decades

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.780
of research on this--
that people with autism

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:26.930
have different patterns
of learning strengths.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:29.380
And there are extreme
learning differences.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.540
Most people-- I don't
want to stereotype again--

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.250
but most people with autism are
much stronger visual processors

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:38.570
than they are processors
of auditory language.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.100
So that's one example.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.100
And if you're familiar with
educational programs, at least

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.350
well-designed educational
programs for people

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:49.790
with autism, we use visual
supports persistently

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.300
in all settings, rather
than conveying information

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.950
primarily by talking.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:57.740
And that has to do with the
visual strengths, processing,

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:01.440
the strong visual
memory as well.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.680
What for years has
been called obsessions,

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.140
or obsessive behavior, now
as part of this revolution,

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:12.110
we're talking about this
as enthusiasms or passions.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:15.360
People now with autism say,
don't talk about my obsessions.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.440
Talk about my deep interests.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.900
And again, we could
look at ourselves.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.520
And probably many
of you have hobbies

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.250
that you can describe
as your deep interests.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.740
And some of what
you do may appear

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:29.630
very strange to other people.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.240
OK?

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.670
So personally, many
years ago, I started

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.730
doing a lot of
workshops up in Canada.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.870
And I became fascinated
with Inuit carvings.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.340
So I have a whole
China cabinet at home

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.670
with more than 100
pieces of walrus ivory

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.640
carved into various figures,
and just some rough cut,

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:49.510
not carved into anything at all.

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.910
And you could look at that
and say, that's strange.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.743
This guy just has all
these pieces of ivory.

00:12:52.743 --> 00:12:56.510
And by the way, it's all legally
obtained ivory, by Inuit folks.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:59.470
It's part of what they do to
make a living in their art.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.455
But that could be
considered pretty strange.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.230
My family has a
place, luckily, down

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:07.760
by the coast of Rhode Island.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.060
And I like to take a
bike ride every day.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.730
It's my exercise.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.120
And I've gotten
into this pattern

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.320
this summer that every
time I take a bike ride

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.150
and I stop at Moon
Stone beach, I

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.190
have to find a nice
smooth white rock.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.715
And I line them up on the
banister in front of my house.

00:13:22.715 --> 00:13:24.590
And when I look at it,
it makes me feel good.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:25.610
It looks nice.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.460
And it tells me I've done a lot
about bike riding this summer.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.710
So we see such patterns
in people with autism.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:36.366
But in many cases, if
they're not understood,

00:13:36.366 --> 00:13:38.240
they're considered to
be a sign of pathology.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:41.420
And in some cases, people
say we have to stop that.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:45.120
We have to break that
particular pattern.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.700
People with autism
for so many years

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.720
were thought of as insensitive,
oblivious to the environment,

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.510
oblivious to the world,
oblivious to other people.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.500
And now we're
seeing-- especially

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.580
as people with autism could
talk about their experiences--

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.320
that they're highly sensitive.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.200
Not all, but many
people with autism

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.760
are highly sensitive
on a sensory level.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.190
In terms of auditory
sensitivity,

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:13.100
sensitivity to touch, which is
known as tactile defensiveness.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.840
In many of our sensory
modalities, people with autism

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.850
are hypersensitive
and hyper-reactive.

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.220
But it's not just in the
sensory modalities, which

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.630
I think we hear a
lot about, especially

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.690
with Temple Grandin
talking about that,

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.390
and other famous
people with autism.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.450
Now we're finding that
people with autism

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.860
are very sensitive
to other people.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.640
That when other
people talk about them

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.010
in disparaging or negative
ways, it's hurtful to them.

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:43.420
They may not be able
to express that.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.210
And so that's a huge
turnaround compared

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:51.725
to our original descriptions of
autism in the 1940s and 1950s,

00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:53.600
where people with autism
and kids with autism

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.750
were thought of in a
world of their own,

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:58.610
unaware of what's
going on around them.

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:01.110
Now on the surface
it may look that way,

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:04.510
if a child is averting gave,
or is engaged in an activity

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.540
that he or she wants to
do over and over again.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.850
But good teachers
of kids with autism

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.885
know that very often,
even though a child

00:15:11.885 --> 00:15:14.240
is sitting in the classroom,
and doesn't appear

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.810
to be watching or processing,
there's a good chance

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.930
that that student is.

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:24.080
So when we have these
pathological descriptions which

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.380
still linger, even though
we're moving away from it,

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:32.090
what is the ultimate goal
of treatment or education?

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.310
You need to change
people with autism.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.160
Now the shift that
we're beginning to see--

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.010
and I'm going to quote a very
dear friend of mine who has

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.990
Asperger's, he has a
son with Asperger's.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.540
His name is Michael John Carley.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.090
He wrote a wonderful book.
"Asperger's from the Inside

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:46.910
Out."

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.680
And what I've learned
from Michael-- cause

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.230
so much of what I've learned
come from people with autism

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:54.690
and from parents-- what I've
learned from Michael is,

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.910
if you want to help
a person with autism,

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:59.340
don't try to change
them directly.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.010
The best way to help
a person with autism

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.610
is to change what
we do, and to change

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:07.260
our behavior and our attitudes.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:10.040
Now that could happen
on an individual level.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.600
But now we're saying that needs
to happen on a societal level,

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.680
that if we create the
possibilities, if we understand

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.970
why people with autism do
certain things that might

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:24.290
appear unconventional, or
maybe we don't understand,

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:27.970
that leads to us being
more compassionate.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:29.914
The word we use to
use is tolerant.

00:16:29.914 --> 00:16:31.330
And I like to use
the word, now we

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.974
can appreciate why they do
that, and understand well,

00:16:33.974 --> 00:16:34.890
it may look different.

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.030
But it's not so different
than the types of things

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.720
that we all do as
human beings to stay

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.170
well-regulated
emotionally, and to try

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:43.840
to navigate through
this craziness

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.480
that we call our lives.

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.790
So, another thing I
want to bash right away,

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:52.190
which I just alluded
to a few moments ago,

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.480
is that people with autism
don't have caring relationships

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.240
and don't care about people.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.390
This is my buddy Justin.

00:16:58.390 --> 00:16:59.681
This was a number of years ago.

00:16:59.681 --> 00:17:01.910
You can see I'm a little
bit more gray now.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:03.080
But I hadn't seen Justin.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.719
I diagnosed Justin
when he was 3.

00:17:04.719 --> 00:17:06.260
And I knew his family
for many years.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.676
They lived in the
Providence area.

00:17:07.676 --> 00:17:09.160
And then they moved
to New Jersey.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.790
So I was only seeing
Justin about, oh,

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.690
once a year, maybe twice a year
when his family would come up,

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:16.970
or I would just see
him in another place.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.329
I hadn't seen Justin
for over a year.

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:22.000
And Justin is an artist.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.450
And he was showing
some of his art

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.210
in a gallery in New York City.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.060
And when he saw me,
this is what he did.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.724
He ran over to me and just
gave me the probably the best

00:17:29.724 --> 00:17:31.280
hug I ever had in my life.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.939
OK?

00:17:32.939 --> 00:17:34.230
Barry, it's so good to see you!

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:36.090
You are my best
friend in the world!

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:37.670
And he's saying it with passion.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:39.600
And he's saying
it with sincerity.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.650
So we're really getting
away from this notion

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:45.250
which so many parents have
known for so many years.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.250
But unfortunately, it's
one of those stereotypes

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:50.800
that people with autism don't
have caring relationships

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.790
with others.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:58.510
So why are we talking
about people with autism

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.840
being uniquely human?

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.560
First of all-- and I'm going
to reiterate a little bit what

00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:06.205
I've been talking about--
that behavior and autism has

00:18:06.205 --> 00:18:09.710
been misunderstood and
sometimes dehumanized.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.520
Even deep interests
and strengths

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.425
have been pathologized
in some cases.

00:18:14.425 --> 00:18:15.550
And what do you have to do?

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:17.430
You have to reduce
them or eliminate them.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.570
And we judge behavior
as inappropriate

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:25.760
according to these strict norms
of what appropriate behavior is

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.802
in a social context.

00:18:27.802 --> 00:18:29.510
One of the things I
love to do, because I

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.420
do a lot of school
consulting, is

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.350
when I'm asked to observe
a child with autism.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:36.490
And that child is with a lot
of so-called typical kids.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.610
And we might see the
child with autism

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:40.510
rocking or tapping their chin.

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:43.690
I always like to
broaden my lens,

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.240
and let's say it's
a third grade class.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.030
I see half the kids
in the class engaging

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.580
in repetitive behaviors
and doing things as well.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:51.760
And it's no different.

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.120
OK?

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.770
But again, when we know a person
has that label of autism, then

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:01.201
all of a sudden we have all this
baggage that we attach to it.

00:19:01.201 --> 00:19:03.200
So I just going to go
through this very quickly.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.737
Some common descriptions.

00:19:04.737 --> 00:19:06.820
All of these descriptions
are from the literature.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.710
The educational literature,
as well as the research

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:11.460
literature over the years.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.480
Noncompliant.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:13.270
Stubborn.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:14.070
Manipulative.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.570
Rude.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:15.070
Bizarre.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.870
Avoidant.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:17.310
Deviant challenging.

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:19.500
Obsessive/Self-stimulatory.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.280
Nonfunctional.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:20.900
Meaningless.

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:21.500
Irrelevant.

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.300
And that speech in particular.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.100
Perseverative and
non-communicative.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.130
And by the way, by training
I'm a psycholinguist

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.630
before I went on to speech
and language pathology.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.790
And so the way I
looked at language

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.510
and actually studied
echolalia-- the tendency

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.960
to repeat speech for my
doctoral dissertation--

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.260
was not just to stay
at that level of form,

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:46.570
but to dig very deeply into the
semantics and pragmatics of how

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:47.884
language was used.

00:19:47.884 --> 00:19:49.300
And I was able to
demonstrate that

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.424
what was considered to be
meaningless an irrelevant

00:19:51.424 --> 00:19:53.850
language in my
dissertation research

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:55.880
and subsequent
research, was language

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.665
that was very meaningful.

00:19:57.665 --> 00:20:01.751
And in many cases
unconventional, but still very

00:20:01.751 --> 00:20:02.250
meaningful.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:03.420
And guess what?

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.290
When you speak to
parents, they very often

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:07.660
have deciphered the meanings.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.870
It's almost like
a private dialect

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.060
that families often have.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.170
And it's not just
about spoken language.

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:16.020
Even non-verbal
behavior, even subtleties

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.687
of non-verbal behavior
parents pick up as meaningful,

00:20:19.687 --> 00:20:21.520
because they see their
child or their family

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.730
member in so many contexts.

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.020
And they see what it means.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.265
So, this notion of
autism as a tragedy.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:37.950
Certainly from very early on,
right after Leo Kanner first

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.850
described the notion
of autism, that it

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:43.720
was described that way in
the psychiatric literature.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:47.520
10 years ago, there was
a book-- well-known book

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.680
in the history of autism--
called "Evidence of Harm,"

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.560
in which the author
David Kirby was

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.700
trying to make links between
autism and vaccinations.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.590
And many of you know--
you all know-- how

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:01.000
controversial that issue is.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.590
But in his description
of what autism

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:07.220
is in the introduction to
his book, this is a quote.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.780
He said "Autism is a
lost, hellish world."

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:11.954
OK.

00:21:11.954 --> 00:21:13.620
And you say, well
what was 10 years ago.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.410
Things have changed,
haven't they, Barry?

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:21.510
Robert Kennedy, Jr.
a few months ago

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.760
initially referred to
autism as a holocaust.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.250
And when people
really protested,

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:29.760
especially people from
the Jewish community,

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.330
really protested that he
used the word holocaust,

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:35.260
this was his apology.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.220
"I employed the term
"holocaust" as I

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.500
struggled to find an
expression to convey

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:43.380
the catastrophic tragedy of
autism which has now destroyed

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.660
the lives of over
20 million children

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.240
and shattered their families."

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:54.780
And when I first heard that, I'm
thinking about, oh my goodness.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.387
I don't think you know
the families that I know.

00:21:57.387 --> 00:21:59.470
I don't think you know the
people and the children

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:03.270
with autism that I know
if this is what you think.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:06.560
But obviously a person
like Robert Kennedy, Jr.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.720
has a bully pulpit.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.450
And this is what's
emanating out to the public.

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:13.700
This is what the
public is hearing.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.250
Whereas so many parents
I know-- and these

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:21.540
are quotes from my book-- my
28-year-old son with autism

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:24.660
is the best human being I know.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:28.820
Another dad said, I've
learned to live every day

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.720
from my son who has autism.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:36.250
And so what we're hearing
very, very different versions

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.070
of the experience of autism.

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.030
And let me give
you some examples.

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:44.610
A mom who has a blog and
who has a nine-year-old son.

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:46.450
"Welcome to our little
corner of the world.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:47.540
Some call it autism.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.060
Others call it
despair and sorrow.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:53.920
I happen to call it hope,
beauty, and fascination."

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.360
John Elder Robinson, who's
a Massachusetts native,

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.950
very well-known for his
book "Look Me in the Eye."

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:01.260
"Asperger's is not a disease.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.480
It's a way of being.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.270
There is no cure.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:04.480
Nor is there a need for one.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.070
There is however, a
need for knowledge."

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:11.500
And what he means by that is
a need for understanding us.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:15.197
And this was a father
speaking at our retreat.

00:23:15.197 --> 00:23:17.030
"The people who have
been most helpful to us

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.370
are those who do not
take away our hope.

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:22.590
We have learned to keep away
from the doom and gloom crowd."

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.910
And that's another-- I'm
kind of simplifying it--

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:27.720
but that's another
dichotomy that we see now.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:32.040
The doom and gloom crowd about
autism still is a tragedy,

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.330
and we have to do everything to
find the cure, as opposed to,

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:39.430
autism is a different way
of being in this world.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.900
And yes, there are
considerable challenges

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.680
that vary from mild to extreme.

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.690
But we feel it's much
more productive to look

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:49.700
at it that way.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.070
So what have we learned from
experience and from research?

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:55.370
Once again, there's no such
thing as autistic behavior.

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:58.920
It is all human behavior.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.450
And that a lot of patterns
that are considered

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:04.100
to be autistic behavior
are best understood

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.320
as reactions to this crazy
world; reactions to confusion,

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:11.130
and stress, and anxiety;
and are often attempts

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:13.680
to communicate and cope.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.560
So for example, we do know
that people with autism

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.570
often protest in
unconventional ways.

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:24.120
So if a child is asked
to go into a very

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:28.020
busy, noisy cafeteria, he or
she may drop to the floor right

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:30.000
on the threshold of
going through the door.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.750
Now you could say
that's autistic behavior

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:33.000
or bad behavior.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.110
Or you could say that that's
the way she protests because she

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:39.370
doesn't have the
language, or maybe she's

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:43.540
not using a speech generating
device yet to be able to say,

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:44.400
no thank you.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.990
It's crazy in there.

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.750
OK?

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:52.110
So what we're learning is that
all behavior is communication.

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:54.740
And a lot of behavior we see
in people with autism that

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.430
was pathologized now serves a
lot of different communicative

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.100
purposes and functions.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:04.710
And it's our job as parents, as
therapists, as teachers, even

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:08.300
as neighbors, to be
able to connect and help

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.120
people with autism to
communicate more successfully,

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.990
and to be more in the
flow of life with us.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.890
So we need to ask why.

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:22.020
And another thing that's
been that big turnaround

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.280
is that we now have so
many people with autism

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.410
telling us that
when you allow me

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:30.320
to focus on my deep
interests, that's

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.780
a wellspring of
opportunity for me.

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.640
It may end up being a vocation.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.554
It may end up being a hobby.

00:25:36.554 --> 00:25:37.970
It might be the
way that I connect

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.580
with other kids in
an after-school club

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.110
in high school.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:46.740
But please, don't put
down my deep interests.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.460
And we have a chapter
called "Enthusiasms"

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:50.980
in the book "Uniquely Human."

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:52.540
And I'll just tell
you about a couple

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.300
of them right now, amazing
they are in some kids.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.810
I met a family that had a
nine-year-old son with autism.

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:02.200
And this was in Virginia about
a year, year and a half ago.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.780
And after I gave a little talk,
the mom came up to me and said,

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.570
I love how you use
the word enthusiasms.

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:09.240
And I didn't invent
it by the way.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.030
A mother-- a very
well-known mother--

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:13.130
Clara Claiborne Park,
who was at Williams

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:14.830
College for many years.

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:17.720
And she has a daughter with
autism who is an artist.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.790
She came up with
the word enthusiasms

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:21.280
to replace obsessions.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:23.054
But this mom said
to me, you know

00:26:23.054 --> 00:26:24.840
what my son's enthusiasm is?

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.530
I said, what?

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.242
And she said, spices.

00:26:29.242 --> 00:26:30.780
I said, spices?

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.960
Well, he loves to line up all
the spices in my spice cabinet

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.870
in alphabetical order.

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:41.680
And not only that, but he's an
expert on regional barbecues

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:45.285
in the United States, from North
Carolina, to Texas barbecue,

00:26:45.285 --> 00:26:46.500
to on and on.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.860
And he could tell you
what the differences are

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:51.290
in the spices in ten
different barbecue

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:52.900
varieties around the country.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:54.340
Nine years of age.

00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.220
And then she said very
proudly, you know,

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.720
and he loves to
watch cooking shows.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.780
And I think he's
going to be a chef.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.070
OK.

00:27:01.070 --> 00:27:05.040
So that's a good example of
a passion or an enthusiasm

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.850
that we would say is
interesting and maybe society

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:10.930
would value that.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:12.700
But there are also
very different passions

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.980
and enthusiasms that we have
to kind of shape and help

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:18.660
people with autism
to, if you will,

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.740
use in their lives in
ways that they are valued.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:24.960
OK.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.620
Just what might be considered
some autistic behavior.

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:28.820
Some quick slides.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:29.983
Here's a little guy.

00:27:29.983 --> 00:27:30.983
He wasn't yet diagnosed.

00:27:30.983 --> 00:27:33.360
He was diagnosed at six
years of age with Asperger's.

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.900
He's three here.

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.630
And his mom gave me this photo.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:38.590
Hypersensitive to sound.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:41.030
Didn't help very often if
he didn't have pot lids.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:43.180
I don't know how
effective those are.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.950
He would cover his ears.

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:48.690
Here's a young man,
eight years of age,

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:50.917
who when he got tired at
the end of the day-- see

00:27:50.917 --> 00:27:55.190
he's in his pajamas-- he would
but his body in this position.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:58.510
And the technical term is he's
increasing vestibular input

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.510
and proprioceptive
input, which is

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:03.420
very alerting to your
neurological system.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.724
And he would do things
like this whenever he was

00:28:05.724 --> 00:28:06.890
tired at the end of the day.

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:09.690
Almost like a toddler
running in circles when

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.570
they don't want to go to sleep.

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.940
And this is not a
young man with autism.

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.660
This is my son 10
years ago, who's

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:18.391
a so-called neurotypical child.

00:28:18.391 --> 00:28:18.890
OK?

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:23.950
We're about to send him
off to Wazzou next week.

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:25.840
My only son's going
off to college.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.950
But yeah.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:28.860
Typical kids engage
in autistic behaviors.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.400
What do you think about that?

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.400
And persistently, in some cases.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.844
When he was tired as a
baby-- well as a toddler--

00:28:34.844 --> 00:28:36.260
he would sit at
the table and go--

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.770
[THROAT NOISE]

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:41.540
I have all these videos
I could show, literally,

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.515
edited segments of
videos of my son.

00:28:43.515 --> 00:28:44.890
And people in the
field of autism

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:49.490
would say, how old is
that child with autism?

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:50.990
This is very interesting.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.646
A few years ago, when I
did office assessments,

00:28:53.646 --> 00:28:54.520
which I don't do now.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:57.350
I mostly consult out.

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:58.990
We had just done
a team assessment

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:01.280
on a second grader with autism.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.510
Had a little bit of
speech, not much.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:04.380
And echoed a lot.

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:07.910
Repeated a lot of what
he heard to communicate.

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:10.970
And we were sitting
with his parents.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:13.580
And we were giving his
parents some feedback.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.060
You know, we're talking about
what Eric's strengths were,

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.410
and the areas we really
want to work on with Eric.

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:24.890
And we gave him a little tin
of markers and some paper.

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.532
And we saw he was kind of
persistently taking one marker,

00:29:27.532 --> 00:29:28.490
writing something down.

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:29.250
Putting it back in.

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.208
Taking another colored
marker, writing it down.

00:29:31.208 --> 00:29:33.030
But we weren't watching
what he was doing.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.080
He ended up filling up
three sheets of paper

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.620
with these sequences
and patterns of numbers.

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.715
And his mother said, oh yeah.

00:29:42.715 --> 00:29:45.340
When he does it in school, they
say it's perseverative behavior

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.200
and he has to stop it.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:52.210
When we saw him do it, there
was absolutely no doubt.

00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.950
He was doing it to stay
grounded, to say emotionally

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:56.140
well-regulated.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.970
Because he wanted to be with
us and with his parents,

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:01.880
but he needed to tolerate all
these adults talking quickly

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.490
back and forth to
each other, which

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:07.120
was probably difficult for
him on an auditory stimulation

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.530
level to deal with.

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.364
But this is
absolutely brilliant.

00:30:10.364 --> 00:30:12.030
There are all kinds
of patterns in there

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:15.780
that he just came up
with spontaneously.

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:19.830
So, how can we refute this
autism is a tragedy belief?

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:22.650
First of all, build
understanding.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:24.640
And this is so
important for parents.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.850
Parents crave hearing
the positives,

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:28.750
as do persons with autism.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:32.380
And a piece of if is
depathologizing these types

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.380
of patterns of behavior.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:38.890
In my book I tell
a story of a child

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:45.160
whose father, for Christmas,
had bought her a bumble ball.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.870
You know what a bumble ball is?

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:50.010
It's a rubber ball that has
little spiky things on it.

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:51.460
And it has a motor
on the inside.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.140
When you turn it
on, it vibrates.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.190
And this dad was so happy
that he had bought this

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:56.740
for his four-year-old daughter.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:31:00.400
But when I visited the home for
the first time, he said to me,

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.760
was this the wrong thing to do?

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.870
Buying this ball for my
daughter for Christmas?

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.780
And I said, I can't see
how that would be wrong.

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.900
And he said to me,
well, his therapist

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:16.050
said it's just going to
increase her autistic behavior.

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:18.570
And you really shouldn't
buy things like that.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:20.550
And it devastated the dad.

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:23.050
And if you think about it, it's
basically saying to the day,

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:26.110
your intuitions about
your daughter are wrong.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:27.990
We discus this a
lot in the book,

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:30.960
how often parents' intuitions
about their child-- which

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:36.350
are very often reasonable and
right on-- parents are told,

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:37.831
no you shouldn't be doing that.

00:31:37.831 --> 00:31:39.330
You should extinguish
that behavior.

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:42.130
You have to discourage
that interest.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:45.310
And it still happens,
unfortunately.

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:46.900
We want to respond
with compassion.

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:51.860
Too often, people with
autism and parents

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.270
are feeling that they're blamed.

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:56.080
One of the biggest challenges
right now in autism

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.100
is mental health issues
as people move on

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.990
past the elementary
school years.

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:02.870
A lot of depression.

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:04.870
A lot of feeling, I'm stupid.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:06.556
Feeling I'm lousy.

00:32:06.556 --> 00:32:08.430
Because they're getting
that kind of feedback

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:10.580
from other people,
when in many cases

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:13.540
these are very, very bright,
engaging individuals.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.880
But they're misunderstood.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.620
Expressing appreciation.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.680
We want to create positive
images of people with autism,

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.610
and celebrate successes.

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:24.720
And then of course,
providing support.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.200
Highlighting the strength
that people show,

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.170
because one of the
characteristics of autism

00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:30.600
is peaks and valleys.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.360
I'm not saying every
person with autism

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.420
has great talents or
great savant skills.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.970
But certainly we see
the peaks and valleys,

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:40.820
which creates some of
that mysteriousness

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.860
when somebody sees a child.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:47.370
So we want to provide a more
realistic balance perspective.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:48.960
So when we think
about autism only

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.670
being within the child-- which
I refer to as the disease

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:54.260
model of autism--
then progress is about

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.980
recovering the
child from autism,

00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:00.190
changing the behavior so we
no longer see, if you will,

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:03.710
those symptoms that are
listed as diagnostic criteria.

00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:07.020
And some people still say,
we recover kids from autism.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.630
We make them normal.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.500
But as a dad once said
to me, isn't normal

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.470
just a setting on a dryer?

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:15.230
OK.

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:17.250
So what we've learned
is that autism

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:19.150
is a shared human experience.

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:23.060
It becomes part of the fabric
of life for all involved.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.370
And I know for me I
could speak personally.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:29.550
I mean, it's so integrated in
my whole world view and my life,

00:33:29.550 --> 00:33:31.990
so integrated in
how I raise my son.

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:35.570
It's so much a part of
who I am that I feel

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:39.146
we must express appreciation.

00:33:39.146 --> 00:33:42.880
It helps us become
better people.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.930
Another very important point
is development is lifespan.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:49.570
There's this notion of window
of opportunity closing shut

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:52.789
that parents of kids with
autism hear all the time.

00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:54.580
If your child doesn't
make so much progress

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:58.470
by five years of age, basically
you've doomed your child.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:00.450
Well, guess what?

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:02.340
It's a total misapplication
of the notion

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:04.500
of neural plasticity.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.160
And we really, really
argue against that.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:12.239
Yes, research indicates that
one of about five factors that

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:15.320
leads to better outcomes
is getting started earlier.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.120
OK.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:20.489
But we also know that
development is lifespan.

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:22.650
I've known so many
people with autism

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:26.320
who just made leaps and bounds
of growth in the teen years,

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.260
even as adults.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.190
And we have to hold
on to this now,

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:33.672
because so many parents are
terrified when they hear that,

00:34:33.672 --> 00:34:35.380
that you must do so
many hours of therapy

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:39.230
by the time your child
is five years of age.

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:40.910
And my friend
Michael John Carley--

00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:42.560
the man with
Asperger's who I spoke

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.570
about earlier-- one of his
quotes-- "A person with autism

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:48.010
is more a product of
their life's experiences

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:49.530
then their autism."

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:51.830
And I think that's very,
very important to hold onto,

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:53.420
because that's the same with us.

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:54.550
Same with us.

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:59.200
So, autism is a shared human
experience for educators,

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.920
families, and those with autism.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.427
It's all a part of our lives.

00:35:03.427 --> 00:35:05.010
A couple of other
points, and then I'm

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:07.100
going to open up for questions.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:11.010
One very nice story-- this
actually goes back 15 years.

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:12.280
"Chicago Tribune" magazine.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:16.500
A young man named
Stanford James who

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.162
was passionate about trains.

00:35:19.162 --> 00:35:20.120
Thomas the Tank Engine.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.000
Somebody once said,
interest in trains

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.140
should be a diagnostic
criterion for autism.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:29.870
And Stanford was fascinated,
passionate about trains.

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:34.750
Raised by a single mom in city
projects in South Chicago.

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:36.990
A family living in poverty.

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:40.820
And this article spoke
about over many years

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.469
what, his mother was told.

00:35:42.469 --> 00:35:44.260
And his mother was
told, yeah, they told me

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:45.620
I got to put those trains away.

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:47.680
Or I should throw them out,
because Stanford will never

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:48.180
develop.

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:48.960
He'll never learn.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.390
She goes, he loved them.

00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:52.440
And I always went along
with what he loved.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.960
And I used it.

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:58.360
Well, this is a picture of
Stanford in his twenties.

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:02.020
An employee of the Chicago
Regional Transit Authority.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:04.590
He won employee of
the year that year,

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:10.620
because he was the most reliable
employee in that organization.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:14.370
And it was a quote from
his immediate boss,

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:15.554
"I love Stanford.

00:36:15.554 --> 00:36:16.470
He's just so reliable.

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:19.490
He never has to check the
train schedule on the computer,

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:21.650
because he's memorized
the train schedule.

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:23.630
And he doesn't spend a
lot of time schmoozing

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:25.010
over the water cooler.

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:28.020
He needs to come in and work,
and get his full day of work

00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:28.590
in.

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:31.130
And he always is willing
to work a little bit more

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:32.280
if I need him.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.990
And the most important
piece here is the pride.

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:38.990
Here is a person with a
strong sense of identity,

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:40.300
who knows who he is.

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.040
He knows he has autism.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.040
And he says actually
in this article,

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:46.310
"I tell myself in
my mind, Stanford,

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:48.420
you are the best
person you can be."

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:51.120
And unfortunately, that's not
happening enough for people

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.122
with autism.

00:36:52.122 --> 00:36:54.080
So I want to show you a
quick video-- it's just

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.560
two minutes-- of the
young man I showed earlier

00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.330
who was hugging me-- Justin.

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:02.110
And it's a video about
Justin talking about his art.

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:05.891
Now Justin was diagnosed with
moderate to severe autism

00:37:05.891 --> 00:37:06.640
when he was young.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.800
That wasn't my diagnosis.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:09.590
I kind of confirmed
his diagnosis

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:11.090
after other people saw him.

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:13.540
And his parents really
worked on his passion.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.460
Initially it was
cartoon characters.

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.820
Then they had artists
work with him.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.300
And now he is an artist.

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.390
And he teaches art
to kids with autism.

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:24.200
And he teaches art to
so-called neurotypical kids.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.796
Here's Justin.

00:37:25.796 --> 00:37:28.261
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.020
I love to do
animating and ills--

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:41.145
animating and illustrating.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:49.022
I started drawing
in my composite book

00:37:49.022 --> 00:37:52.400
since in the fall of 2003.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:55.650
It's the reason I love to draw
"Sesame Street" is because it

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:56.775
returns to my childhood.

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:06.550
"Sesame Street," "Looney
Toons," Disney and animals.

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:09.150
When I move to the
apartment, I'll

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:11.740
deal with my responsibilities.

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:16.710
For example, laundry,
the dishwasher,

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:20.490
take care of my cat.

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:25.760
I'm gonna miss my fam--
I'm gonna miss my family.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.700
I was in a tie, happy and sad.

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.702
That was a tie.

00:38:29.702 --> 00:38:30.660
Remember "Toy Story 3".

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:33.240
Andy goes to college.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.540
The reason in "Toy
Story 3" is a sad movie

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:39.905
is because Andy's
going to college.

00:38:39.905 --> 00:38:44.790
And it makes audiences
sad because of separation

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:45.365
and missing.

00:38:49.174 --> 00:38:51.030
One of the best
things about Disney

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:55.130
is, Disney is for all ages.

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:59.460
If I draw Disney, that
makes everybody very happy.

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:04.225
My drawings can be
everybody's gifts.

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:12.160
My drawings can be
everybody's miracles.

00:39:26.048 --> 00:39:29.540
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.080
OK.

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.460
So, why a uniquely
human perspective?

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.230
Because a deeper understanding
builds trust with people

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:38.780
with autism and their
families, makes our communities

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.690
more humane and caring, and
makes us all better people.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:44.670
And Justin's boss at the
time that this video was

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:48.060
made actually said,
you know, the fact

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:51.500
that Justin is a great
artist is a "so what" to me.

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.880
The fact that he's an
inspiration to every employee

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:57.631
of mine is what really counts.

00:39:57.631 --> 00:39:58.130
OK.

00:39:58.130 --> 00:40:01.590
So I think we're OK for some
questions now if you have.

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:02.090
Yes.

00:40:02.090 --> 00:40:05.024
AUDIENCE: I had a question
about schools and teachers,

00:40:05.024 --> 00:40:07.690
because one of the things that I
see, I'm an education advocate,

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:11.650
is that the IAPs, they're
almost cookie cutter IAPs

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:12.980
for each child with autism.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.370
And it makes me
crazy that they don't

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:18.070
understand the differences
between the children.

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:20.020
Can you recommend some
particular websites

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.460
that I can give to
teachers to understand

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:25.270
that not all people
with autism are alike,

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.280
and they don't need the
same accommodations?

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.490
And I'm having a
hard time getting

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:31.490
them to understand that.

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:33.021
BARRY PRIZANT: Yes.

00:40:33.021 --> 00:40:33.520
Yes.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.800
The issue-- and that
is an important issue.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:38.180
There are some approaches--
educational approaches

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:41.150
in autism-- which
are kind of one size

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:44.177
fits all for all children.

00:40:44.177 --> 00:40:46.010
We actually have an
educational model that's

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.301
being used in 12 countries now.

00:40:47.301 --> 00:40:48.620
It's highly individualized.

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.560
It's a developmentally
based model.

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.920
So actually a
colleague of mine who's

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:58.101
from this area-- Dr. Karen
Levine, who's a psychologist--

00:40:58.101 --> 00:40:58.600
yeah.

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.670
Karen just came out
with a book called

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:05.310
"Individualized Interventions
for Children with Autism."

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:07.500
I believe it came out last year.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.570
But people are finally
moving away from that.

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:15.800
Because more traditional
behavioral approaches

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.790
dominated for so many years
based upon operant conditioning

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:19.910
approaches.

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:23.690
And if you don't look at
a person-- any person--

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:27.020
developmentally, you can't
appreciate the learning

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:27.710
differences.

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:29.180
And you can't
appreciate that you

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:31.680
have to use different strategies
and very different teaching

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.110
modalities to really
reach this person.

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:37.720
I would say that's probably
in my mind, one of the top two

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:43.200
or three really bad things that
happen to people with autism,

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.890
getting snapped into a
program that is supposed

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:48.740
to work because you
reinforce the right behaviors

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:50.255
and you use the
right reinforcers.

00:41:50.255 --> 00:41:51.630
But it has nothing
to do with who

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:55.300
that person is in terms of their
strengths and their interests.

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.020
AUDIENCE: Or the social
pragmatics piece.

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:59.603
I'll find that like, well, we're
giving him social pragmatics.

00:41:59.603 --> 00:42:01.580
And it's just a
matter of the child--

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:02.830
it's a script for the child.

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:05.760
They can do it during lunch
bunch or what have you.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.260
But they're not
having opportunities

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:09.749
to practice it in the real
world, or an assumption

00:42:09.749 --> 00:42:11.790
like, oh well, just because
they have pragmatics,

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:13.097
they're going to learn how to--

00:42:13.097 --> 00:42:14.680
BARRY PRIZANT: For
decades and decades

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:18.380
we've learned that if you
teach a child or a person

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:21.260
with autism something
in one situation,

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:24.230
and you only measure progress in
that situation, that's not what

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.070
we call meaningful progress.

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:28.590
So I could speak about my
model with my colleagues,

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:33.300
called ASSERTs model, which we
talk about natural environments

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:35.010
with the right supports.

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:38.940
And whenever we talk about
important goals and objectives

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.890
to help a child to be a
more competent communicator,

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:44.680
it's always
simultaneously approached

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.010
across homeschooling
community settings.

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:48.161
It has to work that way.

00:42:48.161 --> 00:42:49.535
Unfortunately,
the learning style

00:42:49.535 --> 00:42:53.610
of some people with autism
is situation-specific.

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:56.800
So yes, I could learn
to say this or do this

00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:00.210
Monday, Wednesday, Friday
with the speech pathologist

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:01.630
in this room.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:03.860
But we have to
build in the ability

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.780
to generalize across
many different settings.

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.554
Yes.

00:43:07.554 --> 00:43:08.095
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:08.095 --> 00:43:10.220
So it was actually nice
to see Justin up there.

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:10.930
I know him.

00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:11.860
I'm from New Jersey.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:13.210
I lived right outside Montclair.

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:14.260
BARRY PRIZANT: Oh my goodness.

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:14.885
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:14.885 --> 00:43:17.989
So, my younger
brother has PDNOS.

00:43:17.989 --> 00:43:20.030
BARRY PRIZANT: Which is
no longer a category now.

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:21.040
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.870
So, that's been a
whole other thing.

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:25.200
I'm trying to work
with that into his IP

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.280
and scholastic things,
changes from that.

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.080
But my brother has autism.

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.120
Two of my cousins.

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.640
My grandfather, my
uncle, and my aunt.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:41.150
And just seeing the way that my
immediate family has approached

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:45.460
it as opposed to the
family of my cousins

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:47.380
is completely polar
opposite situations.

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:51.310
Whereas my cousins' family has
bought more into the Autism

00:43:51.310 --> 00:43:54.570
Speaks dialogue, as
opposed to my family, which

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:58.420
is trying to-- I do a
lot of advocacy work

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.880
with my brother, who knows
he has autism, and does

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.360
a lot of outreach stuff too.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:07.330
Trying to institute person-first
language into schools

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:08.640
and things like that.

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:13.440
So what would you say is the
best approach, besides reading

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.290
your book and attending
talks like this, to try

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:18.850
to make people
understand the importance

00:44:18.850 --> 00:44:22.350
of linguistic markers
and things when speaking

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:23.665
about people with autism.

00:44:23.665 --> 00:44:25.040
BARRY PRIZANT:
Well, let me first

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.210
address that point right away.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:29.700
And I actually do begin
the book with this,

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:32.140
that I use person-first
language, child with autism,

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:33.550
person with autism.

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:35.790
I'm not militant about it.

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:39.500
There are some very
prominent important voices

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:43.080
in the field of autism-- people
with autism now-- who say, no.

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.310
I'm autistic.

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:47.080
I'd rather you call me
autistic or an autist,

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:49.370
than call me person with
autism, because it's

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:52.100
such an inherent part
of who I am as a person.

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:54.340
Temple Grandin says that.

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:56.730
Temple Grandin refers to people
with autism as autistics.

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:58.070
OK?

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:00.830
And she says, it's an
inherent part of who I am.

00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:03.960
So I think it really is the
preference of the individual,

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.550
as far as that goes.

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:09.030
But when you talk about the
Autism Speaks perspective,

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:11.930
I can imagine most of you are
familiar with Autism Speaks.

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:14.500
Started by grandparents
of a son with autism.

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:19.727
He also happened to be at the
time, the CEO of NBC Universal.

00:45:19.727 --> 00:45:22.060
It's the largest advocacy--
quote/unquote-- organization

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:23.070
in the world.

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:25.840
And they've been
drifting back towards,

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:28.900
a little bit towards, let's
really help people with autism

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:29.430
every day.

00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:31.220
Initially it was all about cure.

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.900
And the $60, $80 million they
raised a year in research,

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:36.770
the great majority
of it was going

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:40.020
towards biomedical
research about a cure.

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:42.020
And at the same time
this was all happening,

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:43.790
they had about
80, 100 employees.

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:45.510
Not one had autism.

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:49.250
And actually, John Elder
Robertson, whom I quoted,

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:50.959
was invited to be an employee.

00:45:50.959 --> 00:45:52.500
And he lasted three
months because he

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.350
said he couldn't
tolerate the way they

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:56.540
looked at autism there.

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.860
But it's the most
powerful organization--

00:45:58.860 --> 00:45:59.609
visibly powerful.

00:45:59.609 --> 00:46:01.900
You know the lighted up blue,
where all these buildings

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:04.920
all over the world are
lit up blue from Dubai

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.560
to the Empire State Building--
they're responsible for that.

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.620
They're changing as
the grandson grows,

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:13.350
and they see he's not
going to be cured,

00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:16.290
and as things begin to
shift a little bit more

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:17.980
towards quality of life.

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:18.840
But yeah.

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.920
When you have very
loud voices kind

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.950
of dominating the
discussion about autism,

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:27.360
it gets away from there
are other points of view.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:29.327
Like in your family,
and how do we

00:46:29.327 --> 00:46:31.160
teach people about that
other point of view.

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:34.430
One of the best ways I say
right now is what I've done.

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:36.090
Listen to people with autism.

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:40.100
There are so many voices,
so many people right now,

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:45.080
so many blogs of extremely
thoughtful, articulate people

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.070
with autism, many
married, have kids.

00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:51.100
But they're very upfront
about their challenges.

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:53.380
Some who don't wish
ever to be married.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:55.660
And they could talk
about that as well.

00:46:55.660 --> 00:47:00.280
But for me, luckily I met
Temple Grandin in the '80s.

00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:03.150
And I've hosted her many times
to speak at our conferences.

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:05.980
So I was exposed to people
with autism early on.

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:09.430
And now I regularly do workshops
with people with autism.

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:10.140
I'm a sponge.

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:12.720
I just soak up every
bit of understanding

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:14.930
that I can come
from folks who can

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:17.270
talk about their
first-hand experience.

00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:19.020
AUDIENCE: Just a quick
follow-up question.

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:22.210
Why do you think that research
organizations and people

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:24.210
as a whole have
been so-- initially

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:27.050
at least-- adverse to listening
to people who have autism?

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:29.407
Why has it taken us so
long to get to that point?

00:47:29.407 --> 00:47:30.240
BARRY PRIZANT: Yeah.

00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.240
That's a great question.

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:33.970
Why has it taken so long to
listen to people with autism?

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:37.730
For many years I actually
said, when Temple Grandin

00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:39.477
was pretty much the
only voice out there,

00:47:39.477 --> 00:47:42.060
I said, well it's wonderful that
she's sharing her experience.

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:45.790
But when I see people listen
to her at a conference,

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:49.810
they're more there because
she's a curiosity then

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:54.320
are they there to really take
to heart what she's saying.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:57.460
And I think it's still happens
when professionals are not

00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:59.630
exposed to a lot of
people with autism,

00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:01.297
I think it's like,
oh my goodness.

00:48:01.297 --> 00:48:02.880
This person with
autism could actually

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.740
tell me what their
emotions are like,

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:07.230
and their inner world is like.

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:09.860
And we have to get
beyond that curiosity

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:14.010
and say, these are such
important, critical voices

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:16.210
to help us all understand.

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:19.210
Another reason is that
a lot of what they say

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:23.080
goes against common
practices in the field.

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:27.540
Like for years, decades, you
had to do eye contact training

00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:28.797
for people with autism.

00:48:28.797 --> 00:48:30.630
And now you have dozens
of articulate people

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:33.204
with autism saying, you
know, it's really hard for me

00:48:33.204 --> 00:48:35.120
to process what you're
saying when you make me

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.020
look at you at the same time.

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:41.050
And so they're actually
shaming, in some ways,

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:43.881
a lot of very well-known people
in the field in education

00:48:43.881 --> 00:48:45.630
and treatment, because
what they're saying

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:48.050
is the opposite of
what these people have

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:49.860
prescribed for so many years.

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.290
So I think there's a little
bit of that element as well.

00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:54.123
As a matter of fact, a
number of years ago--

00:48:54.123 --> 00:48:57.040
and this happened in Boston
at one of the schools for kids

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.749
with autism-- there was
a very well-known woman

00:48:59.749 --> 00:49:01.040
who has now written five books.

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:01.770
Donna Williams.

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:02.790
She's from Australia.

00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:04.180
She has autism.

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:06.540
And she was coming to
speak in New England.

00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:09.240
And she speaks very much
against the type of approach

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:11.760
that was used in this
school in the Boston area.

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.229
And people sent out all these
faxes saying, she's a phony.

00:49:14.229 --> 00:49:15.520
She really doesn't have autism.

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.090
Don't listen to her.

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:18.650
And it's kind of
like, people just

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:21.170
couldn't tolerate
that she was a voice

00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:26.900
speaking against the approach
that was used at this school.

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:30.469
Heavy duty politics
in the field.

00:49:30.469 --> 00:49:31.010
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.759
BARRY PRIZANT: Hi.

00:49:31.759 --> 00:49:33.460
AUDIENCE: I'm a
speech therapist.

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:35.910
And what I've noticed
is that the schools

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:39.260
are very eager to give out
behavioral supports-- 20

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:42.060
hours of ABA for
our little kids--

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:45.720
and not so eager to
give out speech therapy.

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:52.820
How does that-- all the
enthusiasm towards ABA,

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:54.900
shape, you know,
what you're talking

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:58.450
about in terms of behavior
and how we look at it.

00:49:58.450 --> 00:50:03.160
And what should we do
to use them, and use

00:50:03.160 --> 00:50:05.426
that support to our benefit?

00:50:05.426 --> 00:50:08.660
BARRY PRIZANT: Do we have
time for a full day workshop?

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.730
First of all, let me just
say, when we talk about ABA

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:13.800
applied behavior
analysis, there are

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.420
about eight different versions.

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:16.080
OK?

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.790
There's very traditional ABA,
which we speak up against.

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:20.810
And that's set the
child down and drill

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:22.410
and drill over and over again.

00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:24.750
Train eye contact, and so forth.

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:28.460
There are many very
fine behavior analysts

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.720
who have taken in some of
the developmental literature,

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:35.200
and the individual
learning style literature.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:38.244
And actually, I like to say
there are some folks in ABA who

00:50:38.244 --> 00:50:39.660
are closer to what
we do than they

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:41.660
are to other people within ABA.

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:42.220
OK?

00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:43.530
So there's been a shift.

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:47.340
This area, in particular,
Massachusetts.

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:51.150
New Jersey is another state
very heavily influenced by ABA.

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:53.220
Other places in the
country, not so much.

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:56.050
There definitely is a shift
and an change that's happening.

00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:58.150
And I could talk to you
about this afterwards.

00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:00.850
But actually our organization--
the American Speech Language

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:05.660
Hearing Association--
just successfully filed

00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:08.860
a formal complaint to the
Federal Department of Education

00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:11.680
about ABA having
too much influence,

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:14.660
especially in teaching
language and communication.

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:16.160
And the Department
of Education just

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.500
released a letter
last month saying,

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:21.220
we need to have all
disciplines involved.

00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:24.890
And that basically applied
behavior analysts are not

00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:27.530
the specialists in
all areas in autism.

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:30.010
So people are now
saying, wait a second.

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:32.750
That is, I believe
this down to my core.

00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:34.630
A team approach is best.

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:37.690
When you have OT speech
and language pathologists,

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:42.460
educators, parents, behavior
analysts all working together,

00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:44.960
and you don't have a
hierarchy of one person who's

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.210
calling all the shots.

00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:48.860
And unfortunately,
that creates all kinds

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.470
of problems when I
go to schools and I

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:52.170
see that hierarchy in place.

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:55.400
It really needs to
be a team approach.

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:57.150
And I want to emphasize
the parents having

00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:58.100
a very strong voice.

00:52:01.004 --> 00:52:03.860
AUDIENCE: I just wanted
to ask about linking

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:07.490
to humor, sort of making a
cognitive basis for humor.

00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:11.140
And how if you've
worked with that

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:13.250
in your particular practice.

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:16.730
It seems like five years
ago, very few people

00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:18.040
were talking about it.

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:20.850
If I Google it now, I
get lots of results.

00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:23.070
And I wondered if you
could address that.

00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:25.850
BARRY PRIZANT: Well, in
a way, the whole issue

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:29.030
of humor and autism
makes as discard one

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:32.670
of the kind of a
longstanding false beliefs,

00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:35.070
that people with autism
don't have a sense of humor.

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:38.090
They have a different
sense of humor, OK?

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:40.720
So people with autism
might find humor

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:45.630
in word meanings or wordplay,
but not necessarily humor

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:49.070
that's deeply embedded in
social nuance, if you will,

00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:50.250
in some cases.

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:54.040
But there's actually a project
down at the Groden Center

00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:59.440
in Providence that's led
by-- oh my goodness-- Cooper

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:01.360
Woodard, who's a psychologist.

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:03.260
And it's a positive
psychology approach

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:05.890
to autism, where they teach
the students with autism

00:53:05.890 --> 00:53:10.826
to tell jokes, and to engage
in activities that-- and I'm

00:53:10.826 --> 00:53:12.700
going to move a little
bit off of humor now--

00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:15.230
but that create
positive emotion, shared

00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:17.447
positive emotional experiences.

00:53:17.447 --> 00:53:19.030
But once you get
into humor, if you're

00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:21.540
talking about humor
through language,

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:23.649
then that could be
challenging for some people

00:53:23.649 --> 00:53:24.315
on the spectrum.

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:27.390
One of the things that's
really fascinating

00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:31.080
is people with autism
often find humor

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:34.930
through nonverbal
behavior really engaging.

00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:38.380
So for example, looking
at old silent movies,

00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:40.800
or I'm going to
blank on this now,

00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:46.990
but there's a comedian, English
comedian, and some of his work

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:48.840
has been on PBS over the years.

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.240
And it's almost mime-like.

00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:51.780
It's purely nonverbal.

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:53.610
And a lot of people
with autism just

00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:56.900
find his humor to be the
funniest humor in the world,

00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:00.519
because in a sense, it dances
the linguistic aspect of it.

00:54:00.519 --> 00:54:01.060
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:05.130
Our son has been
diagnosed on the spectrum.

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:08.360
Very low, when he was
treated when he was six.

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:09.500
He's now 11.

00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:13.730
And we have chosen not
to have an IAP for him.

00:54:13.730 --> 00:54:17.170
And usually we end up
working with the teachers

00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:18.500
and meeting with them.

00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:20.830
Invariably they contact us.

00:54:20.830 --> 00:54:23.110
And it's like, we
need to have sit down.

00:54:23.110 --> 00:54:26.960
Well, next year he's going to
have more than two teachers.

00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:29.180
And there's gonna be
about seven of them.

00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:33.530
And I don't think this approach
is going to work anymore.

00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:35.930
Is there something
you can suggest?

00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:40.730
I mean, I agree with the IAP
not being the best route.

00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:43.966
But next year we won't
be able to sit down

00:54:43.966 --> 00:54:45.260
with seven teachers.

00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:46.190
BARRY PRIZANT: Right.

00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:47.350
Yeah.

00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:50.625
And you know, unfortunately
for the challenge

00:54:50.625 --> 00:54:52.640
you're facing, if
you would ask me

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:56.090
what is one of the best
situations for a student

00:54:56.090 --> 00:54:58.510
or a child with autism,
educational situations,

00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:01.050
it's when everybody's
on the same page.

00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:04.410
And it's less confusing, be
less confusing to your child,

00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:05.896
and less confusing to you.

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:10.570
Without knowing specifics,
it's hard for me

00:55:10.570 --> 00:55:12.910
to make any specific
suggestions.

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:16.257
I will tell you this, that
one of my earliest experiences

00:55:16.257 --> 00:55:17.840
that was such a
wonderful experience--

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:22.180
and I'm not saying you need
to do this-- was a family who

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:24.580
had many different people
both in and out of school

00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:26.020
working with their son.

00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:28.760
And he was 10 or 11 at the time.

00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:33.080
And what they did
was once a month,

00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.810
they would have a potluck
dinner over at their house

00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:38.640
and invite everybody over
as a way for everybody

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:40.804
to relate to each
other, and truly feel

00:55:40.804 --> 00:55:41.970
that they're part of a team.

00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:44.090
That's going to be
your major challenge,

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:46.310
that people feel
connected to each other

00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:48.290
to share information.

00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:52.721
And so we can all be on
the same page for your son.

00:55:52.721 --> 00:55:54.970
But if you have people coming
from different practices

00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:57.178
and some from private practice
and so forth, again, I

00:55:57.178 --> 00:56:00.710
don't know the specifics
of your situation, what's

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:02.770
going to be so important
for you to reinforce

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:05.440
is that we are part of the team.

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.240
And certainly
using-- whether it's

00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:11.395
bulletin boards, message
boards on the internet--

00:56:11.395 --> 00:56:13.640
and they do have ones
that can be secure now,

00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:16.310
where everybody could
communicate with each other,

00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:19.370
and talk about, well, what
just worked in this activity,

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:21.940
or what we're shifting
out some other goals

00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:24.050
that we're adopting,
and so forth.

00:56:24.050 --> 00:56:26.980
AUDIENCE: Do you find it
useful to proactively speak

00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:29.530
to the teachers,
speak to them prior

00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:33.670
to the school year starting?

00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:35.470
You know, in that respect?

00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:36.830
BARRY PRIZANT: Absolutely.

00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:40.470
And you know, that's
referred to by some people

00:56:40.470 --> 00:56:42.210
as transition planning.

00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:44.794
And it's actually some of what
I do when I consult to schools.

00:56:44.794 --> 00:56:47.251
When I consult to schools on
a regular basis, and I go back

00:56:47.251 --> 00:56:48.300
and I know the people.

00:56:48.300 --> 00:56:50.840
We start transition
planning for some kids

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:53.470
as early as April
of the school year

00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:55.890
before, planning for September.

00:56:55.890 --> 00:56:57.390
Who's going to be the teacher.

00:56:57.390 --> 00:57:00.800
What visual supports do we want
to have to go with the child.

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:05.550
And in best-case
scenario, we have

00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:10.040
staff from the coming year come
to observe the student now,

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:12.230
before the transition happens.

00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:14.830
The more we can make
things predictable--

00:57:14.830 --> 00:57:17.140
not only for a
child with autism--

00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:20.800
but for all of the
staff, the better

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:23.710
it will be come September
or August, whenever

00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:25.560
the school year starts for you.

00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:26.790
So that's important.

00:57:26.790 --> 00:57:29.950
It's also important
to build trust.

00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:32.600
We speak a lot about
professionals and parents

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:34.650
building trust
together in my book.

00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:38.200
And that is so important,
because as you probably know,

00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:39.850
sometimes it goes the other way.

00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:41.880
And you begin to have
adversarial relationships

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:43.080
and mistrust.

00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:45.071
And unfortunately,
in many cases,

00:57:45.071 --> 00:57:46.445
it's the family
and the child who

00:57:46.445 --> 00:57:48.290
are the victims of
that when it happens.

00:57:48.290 --> 00:57:50.810
There are some very, very
fine professionals also

00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:53.560
who will bend over
backwards for you.

00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:56.216
And those are the people
to-- they're golden.

00:57:56.216 --> 00:57:57.840
AUDIENCE: Just two
suggestions for you.

00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:00.650
One of the things you can do
is like, think outside the box.

00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:02.680
You can contact the
school and ask them

00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:05.679
if they can provide a buddy from
the middle school for someone

00:58:05.679 --> 00:58:06.720
to walk around with them.

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.290
The other thing
you can do is ask

00:58:08.290 --> 00:58:10.980
if your child can visit the
school beforehand, and see

00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:15.479
who the teachers are, just to
help with the comfort level.

00:58:15.479 --> 00:58:17.520
BARRY PRIZANT: Good parts
of transition planning.

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:18.650
So thank you very much.

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:19.510
We are out of time.

00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:21.790
And I hope this was interesting
and helpful for you.

00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:22.390
Thanks.

00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:25.140
[APPLAUSE]
