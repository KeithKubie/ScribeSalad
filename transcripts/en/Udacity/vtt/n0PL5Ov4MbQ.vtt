00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.846
Thats okay if you had to think about this. Let's say we haev two samples, here

00:00:04.846 --> 00:00:09.855
are the distributions. If one of them increases in variability, then its more

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:15.490
likely that there sample means are not significantly different. This leans more

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.090
in favor of the

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.540
[UNKNOWN]

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.132
hypothesis. And therefore our test statistic will be smaller, because there's a

00:00:21.132 --> 00:00:23.570
larger within group variability.
