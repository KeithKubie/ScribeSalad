00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.170
This is an area that hasn’t been treated
yet.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:15.389
So you’ll notice that the restoration appears
a bit lighter than the surrounding original

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.389
paint

00:00:16.389 --> 00:00:20.780
and it’s sort of filling in the original
paint-roller texture.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:27.580
You’ll notice that the paint-roller creates
this very sharp impasto texture and the restoration

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.290
is a bit chalky and fills in that texture.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:38.909
Even though this restoration is ultramarine
blue in polyvinyl acecetate resin just like

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:40.809
Klein’s original

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:47.089
because the texture is incorrect we are perceiving
the color differently than the surrounding

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:48.359
area.

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:55.220
So my task is to first correct that texture
and then correct the color.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:02.219
The tools that I’m using come to us from
the surgical field.

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.430
There are very few tools that are made just
for conservation because conservation is a

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.540
sort of small field

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.810
so we borrow from other fields—often surgery
or dentistry.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:24.270
These tools are very, very small spoons with
sharp edges that are used for corneal surgery.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:32.390
These, unfortunately, I have to sharpen by
hand as they dull because Klein’s paint

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.800
is much harder than a cornea, and so it doesn’t
last quite as long as it would in a surgical environment.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:21.120
Klein, to create his perfect matte blue surfaces,
worked with a scientist in Paris to come up

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.760
with a mixture of ultramarine blue and polyvinyl
acetate resin.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.400
What I’m doing to do the color restoration
portion of the treatment is actually sampling

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.340
original material from the back of the painting
where the paint has sort of spilled over the

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.360
edge and onto the back to get the closest
possible color for restoring the color on the front.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.480
It’s sort of like a skin graft in a way—taking
material from another place and using it on the front.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.400
But it is the only way we’ve found to get
exactly the color that we need.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:07.060
Even using exactly the correct pigment in
exactly the correct resin, it’s very difficult

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.730
to get the color match, so using the original
material is the closest that we can get.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:24.160
I’m sampling the paint dry and then using
ethyl acetate to redissolve the paint.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:40.800
When the paint goes onto the surface it has
to dry at exactly the correct rate to get

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.140
the right color.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.310
And then after the paint has been applied,
you’ll notice that there’s an overall

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:53.650
sort of burnished look in some areas of the
painting, so there’s actually a fine refining

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.200
of the texture after the paint goes on to
get that sort of burnished look which gets…

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.579
you’ll notice that when the paint goes on
it’s a little bit darker and then when I

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.600
go in and refine the texture even further,
then the color corrects.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.640
So the burnished surface allows the light
to reflect off of these restored areas in

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.861
the same way that it reflects off the surrounding
areas so that it blends more completely

00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:36.940
no matter what angle the viewer is approaching
the painting from.
