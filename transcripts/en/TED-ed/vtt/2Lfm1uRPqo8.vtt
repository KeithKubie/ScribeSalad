00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:15.410
Have you ever wondered

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.453
how things are built within our bodies?

00:00:17.453 --> 00:00:19.624
Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves,

00:00:19.624 --> 00:00:20.916
and how we can pass on genes

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:22.791
from one generation to the next?

00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:25.251
Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits;

00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:26.803
they're simply thrown away when they break

00:00:26.803 --> 00:00:28.887
and they definitely can't reproduce.

00:00:28.887 --> 00:00:31.591
The answer lies in something called self assembly.

00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:34.100
Self assembly is a system where unordered parts

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.182
come together in an organized structure,

00:00:36.182 --> 00:00:37.570
completely on their own.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.784
This means that a pile of parts on your desk should,

00:00:39.784 --> 00:00:42.271
in theory, be able to move around on their own,

00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:43.239
find one another,

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:44.983
and build something useful.

00:00:44.983 --> 00:00:46.149
This seems impossible,

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:46.976
like Transformers

00:00:46.976 --> 00:00:48.400
or the Sandman,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.444
but it's exactly how our bodies are built,

00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:51.530
how our immune system works,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.317
and why we can reproduce.

00:00:53.317 --> 00:00:56.731
Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies

00:00:56.731 --> 00:00:59.705
that make proteins fold and DNA replicate.

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:01.504
It's a process that not only happens

00:01:01.504 --> 00:01:03.008
in the biological and chemical world,

00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:05.460
but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.336
to snowflakes,

00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:07.133
robotics,

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.135
social networks,

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:10.238
the formations of cities and galaxies,

00:01:10.238 --> 00:01:11.932
to name just a few.

00:01:11.932 --> 00:01:13.176
In biology and chemistry,

00:01:13.176 --> 00:01:14.759
self assembly is everywhere,

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:15.756
from atomic interactions,

00:01:15.756 --> 00:01:17.015
cellular replication

00:01:17.015 --> 00:01:19.821
to DNA, RNA, and protein folding.

00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:21.762
Proteins are like bicycle chains

00:01:21.762 --> 00:01:24.438
with sequences of amino acid links.

00:01:24.438 --> 00:01:26.154
They self assemble into 3-D structures

00:01:26.154 --> 00:01:27.146
because of the interaction

00:01:27.146 --> 00:01:29.649
between the amino acids along the chain,

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:30.694
as well as the relationship

00:01:30.694 --> 00:01:32.613
between the chain and the environment.

00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:34.322
These forces make the flexible chain

00:01:34.322 --> 00:01:35.574
fold into a 3-D shape

00:01:35.574 --> 00:01:38.542
that governs the function in the protein.

00:01:38.542 --> 00:01:41.078
Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls.

00:01:41.078 --> 00:01:44.123
They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes.

00:01:44.123 --> 00:01:46.125
Those shapes have attraction to one another,

00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:48.346
so they fit together in precise ways.

00:01:48.346 --> 00:01:50.803
Image you want to build a perfect sphere.

00:01:50.803 --> 00:01:53.342
It turns out that making a precise sphere

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:56.259
through traditional means is actually quite difficult.

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.395
Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere.

00:01:59.395 --> 00:02:01.057
One way would be to inflate the sphere

00:02:01.057 --> 00:02:02.518
like a bubble or a balloon.

00:02:02.518 --> 00:02:05.601
Another option would be to create many identical pieces

00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:08.148
that would come together to make a perfect sphere.

00:02:08.148 --> 00:02:10.274
You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one,

00:02:10.274 --> 00:02:11.642
but it might take a long time

00:02:11.642 --> 00:02:13.715
and you would still have human errors.

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:15.332
Instead you could design a connection

00:02:15.332 --> 00:02:17.323
between the components like magnets

00:02:17.323 --> 00:02:19.219
and dump them into a container.

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:20.423
When you shook the container,

00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:21.965
all the parts would find one another

00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:23.635
and build the sphere for you.

00:02:23.635 --> 00:02:26.428
Self assembly is being used as a new design,

00:02:26.428 --> 00:02:26.930
science,

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.220
and engineering tool

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.347
for making the next generation of technologies

00:02:30.347 --> 00:02:31.489
easier to build,

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:32.571
more adaptive,

00:02:32.571 --> 00:02:34.895
and less reliant on fossil fuels.

00:02:34.895 --> 00:02:38.273
Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers

00:02:38.273 --> 00:02:40.078
where small, molecular elements are given

00:02:40.078 --> 00:02:43.992
the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways.

00:02:43.992 --> 00:02:45.989
Similarly, we can now use self assembly

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.492
as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA,

00:02:48.492 --> 00:02:51.453
like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body,

00:02:51.453 --> 00:02:54.246
releasing them only if certain conditions are met.

00:02:54.246 --> 00:02:57.824
Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications,

00:02:57.824 --> 00:02:59.804
where materials can repair themselves,

00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:02.484
water pipes can reconfigure on demand,

00:03:02.484 --> 00:03:04.492
buildings can adapt on their own

00:03:04.492 --> 00:03:06.848
to environment or dynamic loading,

00:03:06.848 --> 00:03:10.250
and space structures can self assemble without humans.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.185
Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains

00:03:14.185 --> 00:03:16.093
and our construction sites were like gardens

00:03:16.093 --> 00:03:18.274
that grow and adapt independently.

00:03:18.274 --> 00:03:19.729
The possibilities are endless

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:20.853
and it's now up to us

00:03:20.853 --> 00:03:23.778
to design a better world through self assembly.
