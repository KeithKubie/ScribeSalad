00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.080
 Humans can distinguish between 2.3 million colors - but try to stare at this picture 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.110
 Which we show through the periodic table and focused on the green dot while we reflect the colors 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.230
 Do not stop staring until you say so. The light travels like a wave through our eyes, 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.119
 The frequency of those wavelengths determines the apparent color of anything in this image 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.460
 And around you. Humans have a tri-color vision, which means that we have three color sensors 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.640
 In the retina, which receives the different wavelengths of light: blue, green, or red 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.370
 Continue watching the green dot and your mind will do something funny 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.570
 Has the image returned to its original colors? Although you stare at the picture in black and white 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.890
 But your mind understands them as colorful. 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.820
 This phenomenon is known as "the effect of the stray image". After staring for a long enough time in a differentiated color 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.050
 The receptors become slowly exhausted and supply optical pigments in the sensors 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.980
 The receptor begins to run out, and in the end it stops sending signals to the brain 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.470
 In the case of this camouflage, the part of the image you are viewing is in heavenly color, blue and green sensors 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:06.030
 Has become stressful and as a result there is an increase in the activity of red sensors that have not been strained yet 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.270
 In the picture that turned black and white we see the celestial colors in the red 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.640
 As you grow older, you are likely to have learned the basic red, yellow, and blue colors and their secondary colors 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.990
 But things get harder when you see the basic colors in your printer 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.810
 Are purple, yellow, and cyan and that screen you are watching now 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.630
 Use the red, green and blue colors! These are different models of colors, since the "red blue green" model is "collective" 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.530
 That is, blending different colors of light produces a new color, while the other triangular model is a terrestrial system 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.200
 And absorbs different lengths of light 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.670
 For example, when you carry a yellow thing of life actually 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.380
 In fact it absorbs all wavelengths except yellow, and the color is reflected 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.950
 On your eyes. But when you see something yellow across the screen in fact it is not yellow at all 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.840
 Because your screen uses only red, green and blue colors 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.439
 When you actually contemplate anything yellow, it will actually be a combination of 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.420
 Red and green - this is because the wavelength of yellow is between red and green, our brain 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.119
 Explains this combination with yellow (yellow screen) if, what you actually see is not actually 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.580
 Yellow at all, but it stimulates a combination of red and green sensors, 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.170
 Which your brain interprets as yellow 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.989
 While the colors of plants come in a range of colors, the predominant color is green as a result of chlorophyll 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.189
 The energy-absorbing pigment in the plants is necessary for photosynthesis. 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:30.180
 So to be able to attract insects such as bees, insects and birds, flowers appeared 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.489
 For excellence on green. That's why we do not see green flowers! And flowering plants 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.370
 A variety of different colors have been developed to attract certain types of patches, known as 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.650
 Infectious syndrome. Birds pollen red flowers, to evaporate 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.970
 Visit bees, where the system of vision is different from birds 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.239
 Making it difficult for them to distinguish between red and green 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.720
 Similarly, each of us has a favorite color, but why? One theory suggests that preference for both colors 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.610
 Based on sex, where the choice is made between the heavenly and the red, the men choose the heavenly 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.900
 Women prefer reddish colors. Scientists assumed that this preference stems from 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.430
 Primitive communities where the vision system in women is dedicated to the collection of red berries 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.110
 Against green leaves. Another hypothesis says we love the associated grades 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:21.579
 With fun things, all the fun and fun things have the same color 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.700
 But we do not like blue mold. 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.420
 Our search for colors led us to think about the connection between science and art 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.870
 So in our last section we asked scientists and artists about their vision of the world 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.530
 Tell us in comments about your favorite colors, and participate in more weekly science sections!
