00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.270
What's really going on inside of a proton
collision?

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.609
Is there a Higgs boson secretly hidden inside
a proton?

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.019
Or maybe there's some dark matter and therefore
if we hit it hard enough,

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:09.630
it'll knock the dark matter off.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.650
That's not what's happening.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.960
What happens with a proton collision is actually
the two protons get close enough

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.650
so that they can feel each other.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.869
With a certain force.

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.769
because that question that we asked earlier,

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.670
when you're asking, "How small can I cut anything?"

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.249
you're secretly asking, "What was holding
anything together to begin with?"

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.810
And the thing that holds things together at
the particle level are forces.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.079
But the particle level, forces are mediated
by other types of particles.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.190
It's like a force exchange.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.059
So it's a little bit strange for us, you know,
humans, we're big, bulky humans

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.640
that are, that evolved in this, you know,
on the surface of the Earth,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.860
and in this certain energy range,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.170
and we can't really intuitively understand
the quantum world.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.179
But the quantum world is a bit odd.

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:57.340
So one way you can, as an analogy, you can
do it, you can get a sense of it,

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.610
is you imagine you and your friend were on
an ice skating rink.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.390
And you're both standing right in front of
each other.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.729
One of you has a gigantic ball, like a big
rock or something like that.

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.000
And you throw the rock to your friend.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.710
As you throw the rock, it's really heavy,
so you're going to slide backwards, right?

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.240
And as your friend catches it, she's going
to slide backwards as well.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.770
So in a sense, we have just exchanged a force
carrying particle.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.860
That's the way particles interact.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.420
But particle collisions are weird compared
to what we think of

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.020
as collisions in our everyday life,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.899
because if were actually particles in the
quantum world,

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.890
you are your friend actually have another
option for when you throw the rock.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.590
You can not just throw the rock to each other.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.380
The two of you could actually smack together
and become the rock.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.060
Perhaps let's use a different analogy.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.170
Particle collisions are not like car collisions.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.450
We like them to think so. We like to think
of that in a way.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.490
But they're not like car collisions. They
have different rules.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.870
When two particles collide at almost the speed
of light the quantum world takes over.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.680
And in the quantum world, two particles can
actually cease to exist

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.939
and a new particle can be created in their
place

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.920
that lives for a tiny fraction of a second

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.220
before then splitting into other particles
that hit our detector.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.420
Imagine a car collision where the two cars
vanish upon impact.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.090
A bicycle appears in their place,

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.140
and then the bicycle explodes into two skateboards,
that hit our detector.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.110
Hopefully not literally, but you know.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.680
This is the sort of thing, a bit of a weirdness,
that happens at the quantum level.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.030
The way that's possible for that to happen
is that go back to your high school physics.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.920
I hope I'm not going to scare anybody off
by saying:

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.220
"Go back to your high school physics."

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.300
Go back to your high schools physics.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.430
What does physics really care about?

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.050
Physics doesn't care about the names of things.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.790
Doesn't care that this is called an electron
and this is called a positron.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.450
We care about that for car collisions.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.850
Is Mary OK? Is Jack OK?

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.970
Particle collisions, they don't care about
that.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.870
Physics cares about conserved quantities.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.090
I hope I haven't made anybody fall asleep,
just by saying those words.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.150
Physics cares about conserved quantities.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.230
Because think about what it is that... conservation
of energy,

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.209
conservation of momentum, conservation of
charge.

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.709
And some more arcane ones, conservation of
spin.

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.400
These are the things that particle physics
cares about.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.489
So, as long as I conserve these things before
and after a collision,

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.299
I'm all good.

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.379
Here for example. This is a diagram, I hope
I haven't scared anybody off with the diagram.

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.680
This is a Feynman diagram, maybe you know
Richard Feynman.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.290
On the left hand side you have two quarks
coming out of the proton

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.360
in one of our collisions.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.940
Two quarks, at some point they are far apart
in space.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.260
They get closer and closer together.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.239
At some point they annihilate, they cease
to exist,

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.370
and then a Z boson appears in their place.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.010
Then the Z boson lives for something like
1e-12 seconds. Basically nothing.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.099
And then it splits into two muons.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.970
That's crazy! You started with two quarks
and ended up with two muons.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.379
How is that even possible?

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.599
And so this is what we do to look for new
particles.

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.760
Because the thing we care about is that middle
part, the Z thing.
