- How's it going, everybody?

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.460
Let's go check out my forge.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.210
I'm Michael Caron
and we are in Tucson, Arizona.

Got my single burner venturi
forge here.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.790
It's little,
but it does the trick.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.620
I've got this anvil,
which--

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.500
if anybody has tried
to find an anvil knows

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.460
that getting an anvil
in decent shape these days

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.880
is a royal pain.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.290
This little lady:
antique post vise

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.120
that my buddy picked up.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.540
I feel like tools that you love
are always ladies.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.710
Boats are ladies.
Airplanes are ladies.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.170

right and respect: Ladies.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.880
Gonna show you a tour
of my shop

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.960

First thing here
is my forge.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.080
I built this forge when I was
about 14, if I remember right.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.580
It's double burner.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.960
I built the box,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.330
insulted, put mortar
and everything on it.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.420
This is something
kinda special to me.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.120
It's whole shavings,
submarine hole.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.250
And I've been making knives
out of it.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.290
Right here is my 25-pound
Mayer trip hammer.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.210
It's been modified to run off
a motor with the side

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.830

there.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.380
Made a little table for it.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.380
The grinder, the 2x72.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.620
It's the knife-maker's
best friend, for sure.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.040
These are decent belts still.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.210
These are all other belts.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.710
There's some decent ones
in there,

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.830
but I have a hard time
throwing belts away.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.460
Yeah, so, ready to get to work.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.250
Thanks for coming
on a shop tour.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.080
- So in addition
to bladesmithing,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.250
I also love smoking meat
on this smoker I built.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.040
And when I'm forging,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.330
at the end of the day,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.670
if everything goes
horribly wrong,

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.330
I want something
to look forward to.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.000
And today I'm gonna be
looking forward to some ribs.
