00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.037
There's this rapper,
young jeezy.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.739
He has a song where he says,
"how stupid? Dumb big.

00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:08.975
My rooms got rooms."

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.911
All right.

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:17.450
Nah, jeezy,
those are closets.

00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:19.719
Those aren't extra rooms
in your rooms.

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:23.856
Jeezy. He'd be the worst
real estate agent ever.

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:25.525
"right here, we have
a 34-bedroom house.

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:28.528
"let me show you
around the property.

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:30.063
"great feature of this place--
some of the rooms

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:32.398
"have extra smaller rooms
in them.

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:33.833
"you have to sleep
in these rooms like this.

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.301
"very unique
sleeping situation

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:38.504
"inspired by the japanese.

00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:40.039
"now let me show you
to the bathroom.

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:42.708
"the bathroom is great.
You have a regular size tub.

00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:43.876
"then you have
a miniature tub: the sink.

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:45.912
It's actually--"

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:55.288
I do--i feel like
rap affects

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.856
how I talk with people
too much.

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:57.990
It's not good.

00:00:58.023 --> 00:00:59.292
I was talking with my mom
on the phone,

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.027
and she was telling me,
she went,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.363
"hannibal, so I'm watching
your niece and nephew

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:06.232
for a week while
your sister is gone."

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:09.402
And I was like,
"for a week, ma?

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:10.770
"they watchin' you
for a whole--

00:01:10.803 --> 00:01:12.171
"you watchin'
for a whole week?

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:14.474
"are they payin' you
to watch 'em for a week?

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.576
That's a long time.
You gettin' paid?"

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.277
She said,
"no, hannibal.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.512
"a grandmother doesn't
have to get paid

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:22.448
to watch her grandkids."

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.917
And I said,
"yo, ma...

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.187
Money over everything."

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.126
[laughter and applause]

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.597
just not healthy.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.098
Sometimes I get drunk
and I get into arguments

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:41.667
with taxi drivers,
and I get out the cab

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.537
and I slam the door.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.972
That's not the way to win
an argument with a taxi driver.

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:47.640
The way to win is
you get out the cab

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:50.910
and you leave the door open.

00:01:50.943 --> 00:01:53.179
Then he has to step out, come
around, and close that door.

00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:54.714
While he's doing that,
I'm on the other side,

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:57.116
opening the other doors.

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.252
And we just keep going
around and around

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.487
and around and around.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.823
And I got my own benny hill
 situation going on in life.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.840
It's great.
[humming yakety sax]

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.460
[laughter]
