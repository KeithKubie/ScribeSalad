00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.640
What I hope to do in
this video is derive

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.850
a formula for the sum of
a finite geometric series.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.720
And right here is a
finite geometric series.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.600
I start with some first term a.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.820
Notice, I wrote it as
a times r to the 0.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.100
But r to the 0-- for any r.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.980
We're assuming r is non-zero.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.170
This is going to be
1 right over here.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.240
So our first term
is going to be a.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.660
And then each successive
term is a previous term

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.060
times our common ratio, times r.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.810
So a times r is a
times r to the first.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.820
That times r is ar squared.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.540
On and on, all the way until
we go a times r to the n.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.950
This is a finite
series right over here.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.960
So let's just
define this series.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.050
I'll use the letter
S sub n as being

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.480
equal to all of this
business right over here.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.020
Now, let me multiply S sub
n times our common ratio.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.710
So let me write this
right over here.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.707
So let's say we
have r-- I'm going

00:00:59.707 --> 00:01:07.810
to do the same color as our
previous r-- r times S sub n.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.290
And what is that
going to be equal to?

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.580
Well, we're just going to
multiply each term here by r.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.790
And we could even multiply this
thing by r if we want as well.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:28.939
This would now be the sum from
k equals 0 to n of a times r.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.480
But now, instead of
r to the k, we're

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.940
now multiplying each of
these terms times r again.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.990
So it's going to be
the k plus 1 power.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.800
Or-- and it's a little easier to
conceptualize right over here--

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.030
let's just multiply each
of these terms times r.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.130
So a times r to the
0 times r is going

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.440
to be ar to the first power.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.746
So that's going to be a
times r to the first power.

00:01:55.746 --> 00:01:58.185
Let me write that down. a
times r to the first power.

00:01:58.185 --> 00:02:00.650
Or just a times r because,
obviously, r to the first

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.890
is just r.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.290
And then, plus-- let's
multiply this term times r.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.514
So plus a times r squared.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.130
And we'll just keep on going.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.100
We're going to get all the way
to a times r to the n plus 1.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.460
So let me write it like this.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.510
So we're going to go to
plus-- and typically, you'd

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.646
only write three dots.

00:02:28.646 --> 00:02:29.895
I went overboard with my dots.

00:02:29.895 --> 00:02:32.126
So let me do it-- dot, dot, dot.

00:02:32.126 --> 00:02:44.430
So plus a times r to the n
plus a times r to the n plus 1.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.660
So notice, I just took
each of these terms

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.955
and multiplied them by r.

00:02:52.955 --> 00:02:54.260
You see that right over here.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.690
Multiply by r, get that term.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.500
Multiply by r, get that term.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.750
And then, I don't show the
other ones multiplied by r,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.290
but all the way to
multiply this one by r.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.130
And you get this
term right over here.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.130
Now, what I want to do
is something really neat.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.460
And this is one of my
favorite derivations

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.960
in all of mathematics
because you're

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.430
able to do something
pretty neat at this stage.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.680
What happens if I were to
subtract r times S sub n

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.087
from S sub n?

00:03:20.087 --> 00:03:21.170
So let's think about that.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.210
Well, over here, we would just
get S sub n minus r times S sub

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.710
n.

00:03:31.237 --> 00:03:33.320
So notice, all I'm doing
is I'm starting with this

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.807
and I'm subtracting
the same thing

00:03:35.807 --> 00:03:37.140
from both sides of the equation.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.680
On the left-hand side, I'm
subtracting r times S sub n.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.770
And on the right-hand
side, from this

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.810
I'm going to
subtract all of this.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.680
So what do we get on
the right-hand side?

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.710
So this is going
to be equal to--

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.209
and I'm going to
ignore this for now

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.610
because what we really care
about is this business.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.734
So a times r.

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.900
What I'm going to do is I'm
just going to cancel out

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.200
all of the terms that
have the same degree.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.870
So for example, a
times r to the 0.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.780
There's no other r
to the 0 term here.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.400
So we're just going to have
that a times r to the 0.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.080
Or I could just write that
as a, obviously. r to the 0

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.360
is going to be 1.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.982
So I'll just write that as a.

00:04:12.982 --> 00:04:15.170
That's that right over there.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.380
And then, we have a times
r to the first power

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.370
minus r to the first power.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.470
Well, that's just
going to cancel out.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.990
These are going to cancel out.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.490
They're going to
keep canceling out.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.820
They're going to keep
canceling out all the way

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.570
until all we have
left over is this.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.540
And there's nothing
to subtract this from.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.890
We have no a times r to
the n plus 1 power up here.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.760
So we're just going
to subtract it.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:45.510
So minus a times r to
the n plus 1 power.

00:04:49.217 --> 00:04:50.800
And now we can just
solve for our sum.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.716
Remember, that's the
whole point of this video

00:04:52.716 --> 00:04:56.640
to begin with-- to try to
derive a formula for this sum.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.850
So let's factor
out S sub n here.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:08.770
So this is S sub
n times 1 minus r

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.530
is equal to this
right over here.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.560
It's equal to the first term
minus the first term times r

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.880
to the n plus 1.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.610
So one more power
times the number

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.470
of terms in our original sum.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.580
So let's do that-- times
r to the n plus 1 power.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.730
And so to solve for
S sub n, we just

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.990
have to divide both
sides by 1 minus r.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.610
And so we are left with-- if
we assume r is not equal to 1

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:57.670
in this case-- we are left with
S sub n is equal to a minus

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:02.330
a times r-- I'm just rewriting
what I have up here-- r

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:09.994
to the n plus 1 over 1 minus r.

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:10.910
And you say, hey, Sal.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.060
Well, why is this
at all interesting?

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.480
Why is this useful?

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.780
Well, let's actually
apply this formula

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.210
that we just finished deriving.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.950
Let's say that we have
a geometric series.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.180
So let's say our first
term is-- oh, I don't know.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.990
Let's say our first term is 3.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.510
I'll do the same colors
as I was doing before.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:44.760
It is 3 times 1/2
to the k-th power.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.420
And we're going to start at
k equals 0 all the way to-- I

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.360
don't know-- k equals 100.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.410
And just to visualize
what this looks like,

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.630
the first term is just
going to be 3 times

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.000
one half to the 0 power.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.610
It's just 3.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.670
So our first term is
3, as was intended.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.430
So our first term is 3.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.400
Plus 3 times 1/2 to
the first power now.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.890
This is 3 times 1/2
to the 0-th power.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.650
Now, 3 times 1/2
to the first power.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.520
3 times 1/2.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.670
I could write a first
power there if I'd like.

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.400
And then, plus 3 times
1/2 half squared.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:30.200
And we'll just keep on going
all the way-- I'll do it

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.170
right over here--
plus, we're going

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:36.400
to keep on going all the way
until we get to 3 times 1/2

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.420
to the 100th power.

00:07:40.662 --> 00:07:42.370
Now, you could imagine
you could probably

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.310
calculate this
with a calculator,

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.260
but it would get
very, very hard.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.250
And it would be very,
very time-consuming

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.600
to add up these 101
terms right over here.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.860
Instead, we can
apply this formula.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.690
So this sum right
over here is going

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.990
to be equal to-- if
we were to add it up--

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:03.470
it's going to be equal to
our first term, which is 3.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:11.020
It's going to be equal to
3 minus 3 times 1/2-- 1/2

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.590
is our common ratio here--
times 1/2 to the n plus 1.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:15.570
Well, n is 100.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.105
So it's to the 101 power.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:26.740
All of that over 1 minus 1/2.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.150
And now this is much easier.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.330
It would be hard to
do it in your head,

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.340
but this is much easier
to type into a calculator

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.450
and actually get a
reasonable answer.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:37.940
So let's actually do that.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.890
It'll feel satisfying.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.070
So let's clear this.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:46.660
So it's going to be 3 minus
3 times-- I could write 1/2

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:52.420
as 0.5-- 0.5 to the 101 power.

00:08:55.925 --> 00:08:57.300
Did I get that
[INAUDIBLE] right?

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:03.640
3 minus 3 times 0.5 to the
101 power divided by-- well,

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.150
1 minus 1/2 is just
1/2-- so it's just

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:10.240
going to be divided by
1/2 or divided by 0.5.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.960
And we get 6.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.100
We get 6.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.515
And it's not going
to be exactly 6.

00:09:16.515 --> 00:09:17.890
And we're going
to see that, when

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.770
we take the infinite sum,
that's going to be exactly 6.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.400
But it's going to be
pretty darn close.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.830
We're actually, we're hitting
up against the precision

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:27.637
of the calculator.

00:09:27.637 --> 00:09:29.470
So based on the precision
of the calculator,

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:34.840
we get, it's going to
be pretty close to 6.
