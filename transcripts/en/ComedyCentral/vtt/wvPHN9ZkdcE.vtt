00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:04.604
I wrote it, I sent it, I'm ****d

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:12.578 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I think it's important
to first address

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:14.614
that I'm sort of a piece
of (bleep) on Twitter.

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:15.848 align:start size:81% position:19%
Because mostly
what I do on there

00:00:15.848 --> 00:00:17.116
is just pick out
people I don't like

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:19.018
and then just badger
them and harass them

00:00:19.018 --> 00:00:20.887
until they're either
forced to respond to me

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:22.856 align:start size:94% position:6%
or do the smart thing
and completely ignore me.

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:24.857
Like in the past, I got in
an argument with Tom Hanks's

00:00:24.857 --> 00:00:27.693 align:start size:94% position:6%
rapping son Chet Hayes and
also the food franchise

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:31.130 align:start size:97% position:3%
Soup Plantation because
that name is racist, period.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.899
But the one that's
most important to me

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.567
is garbage person Chris Brown.

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:37.303 align:start size:84% position:16%
On May 5th, I tweeted,
it's Cinqo de Mayo,

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:39.138 align:start size:84% position:16%
so when you're
beating up a pinata,

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:41.140
keep in mind it's also
Chris Brown's birthday.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.242
Chris Brown once tweeted,
do you know Chris Brown?

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:44.710
Which is a question I
still don't understand

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.979
but I retweeted it and put,

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.314
is what detectives ask
all your girlfriends.

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:49.882 align:start size:94% position:6%
And sometimes I get
political, like I tweeted,

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:51.383
Mike Pence running
with Donald Trump

00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:53.786 align:start size:97% position:3%
is like the time Chris Brown
did a song with Pitbull.

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:56.488
So again, I just send these
out mindlessly, I'm an idiot,

00:00:56.488 --> 00:00:58.090
and then I looked
down at my phone,

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.727 align:start size:88% position:13%
and it said, Chris Brown
is now following you.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:01.994 align:start size:94% position:6%
Which is normally
something that would make

00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:03.563
a woman run to a police station,

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:04.998
and then a minute later, I
got another email that said,

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:07.133 align:start size:94% position:6%
you have a direct
message from Chris Brown.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:10.336
So I open it up, and it just
says plainly in two words,

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:11.804
(bleep) you.

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:13.606 align:start size:97% position:3%
Makes sense, but Chris Brown
was smarter than I was.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:16.509 align:start size:94% position:6%
He went back into my
Twitter and liked over 200

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.645
of my tweets, which I kinda
thought was nice or cute

00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:22.748
but then I realized, Chris
Brown fans are so maniacal

00:01:22.748 --> 00:01:25.919 align:start size:94% position:6%
and fanatic that they look
at everything he likes.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.753
So immediately, they were
like, why would Chris Brown

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:29.355
like 200 tweets from
a guy who looks like

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:30.856
the Verizon spokesperson?

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:33.593
And the answer was, because
then they can harass me back.

00:01:33.593 --> 00:01:35.494 align:start size:88% position:13%
So for almost two years,
I would get tweets

00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:38.531
that say, (bleep) you, team
breezy, over and over again.

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.800 align:start size:81% position:19%
And you know what,
I deserved it.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.336 line:0%
Pro-tip, Chris Brown doesn't
only fight with his fists,

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:45.371
he also uses his
Twitter fingers.
