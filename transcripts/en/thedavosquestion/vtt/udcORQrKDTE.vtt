00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640
&gt;&gt; My name is Bob Edwards.
I'm with the NGP Energy Capital Management,

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.290
a large global private
equity fund.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.809
My realization here at Davos on the environment
is that it will be a

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.500
long time before a tangible, concrete climate
treaty or even a global

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.680
agreement is reached.
In the meantime, it's becoming apparent, and

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.300
I think you see it in the
agenda of the conference and certainly in

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.219
the buzz of the halls, that
adaptation is going to be critical.

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:46.359
And the debate about food and water is surpassing
the debate now about

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:51.309
wind and solar.
It's a matter now of figuring out what we're

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.260
going to do in the next 20
or 30 years as the impact of climate change,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.629
population growth,
urbanization becomes apparent and so that's

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.910
the interesting sessions.
How do we get -- how do we feed 9.2 billion

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:14.580
people?
And how do we release the water that's necessary

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.730
to irrigate the crops
in order to feed 9.2 billion people?

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:19.159
Thank you.
