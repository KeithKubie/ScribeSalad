00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.210
- Good morning I hope you're
having an awesome day.

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.160
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Koh
Chang Island which is in Trat,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.420
in the eastern part of Thailand.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.420
This is day seven of our Eastern
Thai food and travel tour.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.320
But it's a jungle cover rustic island

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.740
with beautiful beaches.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.720
We're gonna drive around the
eastern side of the island

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.350
and explore some of the fishing villages.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.990
We're gonna get some amazing scenery,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.240
we're gonna go see some beaches

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.880
and of course we are gonna search out some

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.390
incredibly delicious food.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.990
And especially some seafood.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.410
And I'm gonna share all
the food and everything

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.700
that we do with you today
in this video right now

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.163
so, we're getting ready
to leave it's about 7 a.m.

00:00:39.163 --> 00:00:41.830
(uptempo music)

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.030
so it is really cool that we're able to

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.410
have our car here in Koh Chang

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.780
so that we can drive around.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.230
This gonna be an awesome day.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.710
Just quickly to tell you,
we are staying on a beach

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.810
in an area called, Kai Bae.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.110
And this is one of the most,

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.440
this entire western
side of Koh Chang Island

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.330
is the main side where
you'll find most hotels,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.260
most guest houses, most life.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.150
But the eastern side is
known to be more quiet,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.340
more peaceful, a little more rustic.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.740
So that's the side we're
especially gonna focus on.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.913
But really we're gonna
focus on the food today

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:23.580
(uptempo music)

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.580
We just drove down the
road a few kilometers.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.450
We're just before Klong Prao,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.160
which is the next kinda beach area.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.500
But there's a restaurant and
this is where we need to stop

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.985
to eat breakfast before we move on.

00:01:38.985 --> 00:01:42.902
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:46.456 --> 00:01:47.289
This is one of those spots

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.730
where you can go down the line
of pots and open the cover

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.250
and see what they have for the day.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.830
I'll let you in on a little secret.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.310
Yesterday, we took the
day off from filming

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.630
and actually we ate at this same place.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.200
We were just driving pass,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.050
I saw that lots of van
drivers and tok-tok drivers

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.480
were stopping here to eat.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.470
And I knew it was a place

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.640
we needed to stop to eat for lunch too.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.550
So I'm glad they're open this morning.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.190
This, they actually
serve Southern Thai food.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.020
Like not this region,

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.640
but from the southern
peninsula of Thailand

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.040
and their food is awesome.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.828
It's also halal food.

00:02:19.828 --> 00:02:23.745
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:45.526 --> 00:02:49.320
Oh, this place is absolutely fantastic.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.030
Yeah, and I ordered actually
the same exact dishes

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.720
that I ordered yesterday
because they're so good.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.690
This is the dish.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.330
Almost everybody eating here orders this.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.700
It's just a beautiful beef soup.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.730
The chunks of beef, the
fresh chilies in there,

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.220
look at that, just
entire chilies in there.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.740
The fresh onions.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.380
Ah, okay let me just take a bit.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.123
Oh, and the crispy fried shallots.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.677
Oh, that is melt in your mouth beef.

00:03:19.677 --> 00:03:24.530
And the stock is so beefy and
so rich and beautifully salty.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.060
And then you can taste the herbs

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.330
that have been boiled down in the soup,

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.160
the Kaffir lime leaves,
cilantro roots in there as well.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.930
The part that I love the most

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.880
is that they combine fresh

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.820
uncooked onions and
chilies and lime juice,

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.480
as well as some tomatoes in there.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.180
And then they pour the boiling
soup over those vegetables.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.050
So you've got both cooked ingredients

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.290
as well as raw ingredients,

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.513
which gives it that punch of flavor.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.170
And those crispy shallots as well.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.030
Man that's good.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.867
Next dish I got is

00:03:57.867 --> 00:03:58.780
(speaks in foreign language)

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.970
this is beef in a dry curry.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.120
So you can see that curry paste

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.770
which is just kinda caked
up on the meat there

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:05.970
with Kaffir lime leaves.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.420
It's absolutely stunning.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.600
You've got that cake,

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.200
that crust of chili curry paste on there.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.033
I love it.

00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:18.510
Another thing that's great
about Southern Thai food

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.410
is you've always got a plate of

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:20.570
(speaks in foreign language)

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.290
which is a plate of raw
vegetables and some shrimp paste.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.170
And I'm going right in.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.870
This is white turmeric, I believe.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.670
Yeah, that's your wake
up call in the morning.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.884
Finally thing I got her is some

00:04:32.884 --> 00:04:33.717
(speaks in foreign language)

00:04:33.717 --> 00:04:36.300
which is dried, sun dried fish,

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.460
and then deep fried.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.370
And she said she makes this all herself.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.803
Oh, look at that fish.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.040
That's seriously good stuff.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.160
You can taste that it's sort
of been dehydrated in the sun.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.541
But the dehydrating the

00:04:51.541 --> 00:04:52.870
(speaks in foreign language)

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.880
meaning one sun, one day of sunshine,

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.520
it gives it a more unique texture.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.010
Like a little bit, slightly
turning to jerky but not quite.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.593
(bright music)

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.140
There's nothing like a
7:30 a.m, morning meal

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.580
that breaks your sweat of the day

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.320
and just leaves you like,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.770
shirt slightly dripping, but
feeling outrageously satisfied.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.020
And now that we've finished with breakfast

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.033
we can continue driving.

00:05:23.033 --> 00:05:25.700
(uptempo music)

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.490
oh man, this side of the island
is so incredibly relaxing.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.060
We are stopping at a coffee shop.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.760
It is called, The Coffee Home.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.130
It's right along the ocean.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.790
You can sit, you can relax.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.250
They have a garden.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.053
Oh, this is gorgeous.

00:06:02.998 --> 00:06:04.165
This is great.

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:10.060
Coffee is okay.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.233
Now we can officially
start the day though.

00:06:12.233 --> 00:06:14.900
(uptempo music)

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.560
The coffee here is okay, not amazing.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.420
But the scenery, the
atmosphere is spectacular.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.940
That is one relaxing cup of coffee.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.350
We're on our way, next,

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.943
I hope we're gonna go
check out a coconut farm.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.370
The place is called, The
Organic Coconut Farm.

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.590
It's right on the side of the road.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.870
It's just a beautiful little,
kinda shack type of place.

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.470
So next up let's have a coconut.

00:06:53.737 --> 00:06:57.487
(speaks in foreign language)

00:07:03.516 --> 00:07:04.933
Yes, really nice.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:09.193
And then, you'll find everything there.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.380
Or I can write it down for you.

00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:17.270
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.310
Straight up blended coconut

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.363
and coconut meat and the coconut water.

00:07:25.626 --> 00:07:26.459
Oh.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.327
Oh, that's awesome.

00:07:29.327 --> 00:07:31.950
Oh, and the foam, the coconut foam on top.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:33.343
Oh, that's superb.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.410
I like that he just doesn't add anything,

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:39.880
he just relies on the coconut.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.774
It froths up, it's absolutely sensational.

00:07:42.774 --> 00:07:45.930
(guitar music)

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.490
Oh, that's outstanding.

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.730
I mean, it's perfectly sweet

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.257
and a little bit sour and pure coconut.

00:07:52.257 --> 00:07:55.249
(guitar music)

00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:56.880
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.510
Ying said I have to come
check out the toilet.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.510
Which is back here in the coconut field.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.403
Oh, here it is in the palm branches.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.280
Oh, and of course a banana tree

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.534
in the toilet that's awesome.

00:08:11.534 --> 00:08:12.620
(Mark laughs)

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.280
This is the type of bathroom
I've always dreamed about.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.980
The banana trees,
surrounded by palm branches.

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.880
And just check out this thrown.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:20.793
The podium.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.903
You can do your morning
exercise at the same time.

00:08:30.311 --> 00:08:33.400
Man, he's just an amazing friendly man.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.630
Just passionate about the
fruit that he's serving.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.310
He will talk to you,

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:39.590
he will take care of you
when you're sitting here,

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.160
and I fully support what he's doing.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:42.993
I love it.

00:08:42.993 --> 00:08:44.353
This is great.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.380
Look at that, it's just like jelly.

00:08:49.508 --> 00:08:51.048
Mm.

00:08:51.048 --> 00:08:53.930
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:54.763
- Delicious

00:08:54.763 --> 00:08:55.596
- Really good.

00:08:55.596 --> 00:08:56.548
It just melts in your mouth.

00:08:56.548 --> 00:08:57.540
- Yeah.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.410
- It's perfect.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.430
Got some bananas.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.407
And in Thai this is called a

00:09:00.407 --> 00:09:01.540
(speaks in foreign language)

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:06.540
Which is just like a wild
egg banana, or apple banana.

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:10.849
Mm.

00:09:12.274 --> 00:09:13.220
(woman speaking foreign language)

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.360
It's so good.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.670
Yeah, it's like orange on the inside.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.963
Wow, that is a superb banana.

00:09:21.503 --> 00:09:24.510
(speaking in foreign language)

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.070
He gave us some bananas on the way out.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.670
His name is Khon Drani.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:28.670
Pay him a visit.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.770
He has amazing coconuts and fruit.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.660
And what stands out
even more than his fruit

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.450
is how nice and how friendly he is.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.090
Next up, we are going to
Salak Khok, which is a,

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.420
it's a fishing village
in a bay with mangroves

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.610
it looks amazing.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:46.100
We're gonna eat some seafood there.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.767
(uptempo music)

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.240
This is an old fishing community.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.430
It's gorgeous here.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.263
We're at the pier.

00:10:03.263 --> 00:10:04.777
We're gonna walk around.

00:10:04.777 --> 00:10:06.670
Oh man, the peace and quiet,

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:10.603
the fishing boats, the bay, it's gorgeous.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.793
Can you see that dog taking
a nap on the sunken boat?

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:21.990
And the water is really peaceful

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.990
because it's an inlet,
it's a bay that comes in.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:27.330
If you go further that way,
you'll get to the open sea.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.700
But that's why this
water remains so quiet.

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.100
It's covered in mangroves.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:32.620
The mangroves are gorgeous as well.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:34.180
And one of the main attractions here

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.530
is to kayak through the mangroves,

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.010
but then also just to come here

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:43.010
and just observe the traditional
Koh Chang fishing village.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.070
One of the ways to support this community

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:56.490
is to go to the seafood restaurant.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.730
They have a seafood restaurant,

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.600
one main seafood restaurant here,

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.570
where the fishermen bring their catch.

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.160
And so you can go there to eat seafood.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.160
It's very much community run and driven,

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.590
which is what I like about it.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.906
So we're gonna go see what
seafood they have for the day.

00:11:10.906 --> 00:11:13.573
(uptempo music)

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.210
This place is relaxation on another level.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:31.260
It's so relaxed in fact, that we came here

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.990
and the chef is actually,

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.020
the chef has gone somewhere,

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.500
so they had to call up the chef

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.203
to tell the chef to
come back here to cook.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.180
One of their specialties here is kang.

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.250
Which in English is mantis shrimp.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.900
The giant alien looking mantis shrimp,

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.070
which I've already had a
number of times in Trat.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.880
It's very common, it's very popular.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.470
And so they have a fresh tank of them.

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.790
Those are giant.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.610
But something else I have
to show you over here is,

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:10.090
giant arapaima, but you look over this,

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:12.543
look at how big that fish is.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.483
That's like the size of a full grown man.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.800
The food has all arrived.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.970
It looks spectacular.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.750
But, by all means the center piece,

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.903
the trophy of the meal
are these mantis shrimp.

00:12:26.903 --> 00:12:28.880
They're just, they're huge.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.340
They're like a foot long.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.337
They kept the whole
heads and the tentacles

00:12:32.337 --> 00:12:33.850
and the pinchers on them.

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:35.080
They're kinda scary looking.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.060
And these are deep fried with garlic

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:39.560
and maybe some oyster sauce on top.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.720
You can see those
crunchy pieces of garlic.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:43.530
Oh, it looks awesome.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.883
It's definitely the length of your face.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.470
Oh hello, nice to meet you.

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.180
And you can see that shell,

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.000
but then on the inside
there that's the meat.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.500
That's what you're going for.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.413
It's kinda like lobster
and shrimp mixed together.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.100
Oh wow.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.620
Oh, the freshness.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:13.453
Oh, the garlic.

00:13:13.453 --> 00:13:17.270
The taste is in between
crab and shrimp and lobster

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.280
kinda all mixed together.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.210
The texture is a little
bit stringy but silky.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.043
It's sweet.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:25.933
They're superb.

00:13:25.933 --> 00:13:27.460
Yeah this is the meat
right out of the tall.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.023
Look at how succulent, how
moist and how juicy that is.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:36.930
It's unbelievably delicious.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:38.224
Another dish we got is called

00:13:38.224 --> 00:13:39.057
(speaks in foreign language)

00:13:39.057 --> 00:13:39.890
Normally in Thailand it's called

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:40.890
(speaks in foreign language)

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:41.723
but here they call it

00:13:41.723 --> 00:13:43.370
(speaks in foreign language)

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.560
This is raw shrimp.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.670
It's kinda like ceviche.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.730
Raw shrimp in here, lots
of lemon grass, chilies.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:50.210
They put some carrots and cashews in here

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:53.010
and then it should be
like a lime dressing.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.070
And you can see the shrimp are just,

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.693
they're raw, but they're just
cooked by the lime juice.

00:14:02.027 --> 00:14:02.860
Mm.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.750
Oh.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.130
Oh, that's one of those dishes that like,

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:08.643
kinda punches you in the face.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.390
Mm, it's sour, really nice and sour.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.366
All that finely shaved
lemon grass in there,

00:14:14.366 --> 00:14:16.500
what gives it such a freshness.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.090
There are chilies in there.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.920
You've got the crunch of the
cabbage and those carrots

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:22.023
and then the cashews.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:26.308
Final dish we got here is

00:14:26.308 --> 00:14:27.580
(speaks in foreign language)

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.640
And (speaks in foreign language)

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.790
is a common form of preserving.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:34.440
It literally translate to one sun.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.750
Meaning one day of sun.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.850
So they hang out the seafood in the sun,

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:40.310
let it dry in the sun for one day.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.980
And then it's normally deep fried.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:46.980
So this area is known
for their squid, one sun.

00:14:47.418 --> 00:14:49.160
And so you can see it's
sort of crinkled up,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.360
it looks a little dry
and then it's deep fried.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.080
On second thought, after looking at it

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.373
I think it's cuttlefish.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.873
Mm.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.943
Mm.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:02.710
Yeah, wow.

00:15:05.174 --> 00:15:07.140
That is absolutely fantastic.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:08.700
It has a little chewy factor to it.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.810
But you taste the saltiness
as it's slightly preserved.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.600
It's like rubbery but
not at the same time.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.170
And just packed full of flavor.

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:17.540
Oh, this makes for the perfect,

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.520
like, chili, garlic platform.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.201
What a perfect little ledge.

00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:23.784
(guitar music)

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.803
Or with that sauce.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.510
I'm going in for the tentacles.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:35.485
In Thai they call it the

00:15:35.485 --> 00:15:36.318
(speaks in foreign language)

00:15:36.318 --> 00:15:37.570
like the mustache.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:42.320
And I'm gonna use that
mustache to kinda scrap up

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.871
as much chilies and garlic as possible.

00:15:44.871 --> 00:15:47.454
(guitar music)

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.244
That's a bit to remember.

00:15:53.244 --> 00:15:55.827
(guitar music)

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.560
That was a stunner of a seafood meal.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.830
Do not let the emptiness,

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.330
and if there are no people
here, just come here.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:06.430
It's great.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:08.850
The seafood is delicious and fresh.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.680
Our bill was pretty expensive.

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:11.890
I mean it is pretty expensive.

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:13.210
But over half our bill was

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.300
because we had those mantis shrimp.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.850
So if you don't have the mantis shrimp

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:17.970
you can really reduce your price.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:20.020
And you can get some of the other dishes.

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:23.850
Alright and that,

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:24.683
hold on.

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.960
And that completes our
visit to Salak Khok.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.820
It's really a beautiful fishing village.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.560
The seafood is great.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.320
It's well worth your effort to come here.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.548
From here we're driving down
the coast and we're going to

00:16:40.548 --> 00:16:41.620
(speaks in foreign language)

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.595
Which is, in English, it's Long Beach.

00:16:44.595 --> 00:16:47.178
(Bright music)

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.440
See, at some parts the
road was covered in jungle

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:54.800
and kinda overgrown.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.730
Mika is taking a nap right now.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:57.920
So they're waiting in the car.

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.530
We were planning to swim here

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.080
and play in the sand for a little while.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.380
We'll see if Mika wakes up.

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.150
But for the time being
let's go take a look

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.300
at the beach right now.

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:10.580
Yeah it is pretty spectacularly
quiet and peaceful.

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:14.740
The water it's pretty nice.

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.270
There's kind of a lot of garbage though.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.130
Too bad it's not a bit cleaner.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:21.330
There are a couple of restaurants,

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:24.820
or maybe just one
restaurant, kinda bar area.

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:27.790
People are chilling it's
very peaceful though.

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.266
Very, a very relaxing place.

00:17:30.266 --> 00:17:32.933
(uptempo music)

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.500
Mika's still sleeping so I
think we're gonna continue on.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.710
But I'm not all that
impressed with Long Beach.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.320
It's a nice beach, it's nice and quiet,

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.940
but looks like it's seen better days.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.670
It's kinda run down, it's kinda dirty.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.760
Lot's of garbage has washed up.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.610
I was much more impressed with Salak Khok.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:02.650
From here we're driving on to Salak Phet.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.160
Which is the next bay.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.050
And we made it to Salak Phet.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:07.270
That was just a short drive.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.650
But another beautiful drive.

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:10.890
The first place that
we're stopping off here is

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.510
a mangrove plank walkway.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:17.427
(speaking in foreign language)

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.710
This is already gorgeous.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:21.630
But, part of the reason
it's really cool is because

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.040
maybe it is abandoned, it is really quiet.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.700
You do have to be a little careful

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.704
of the missing planks
and the loose planks.

00:18:28.704 --> 00:18:29.667
Wow, watch out, your head.

00:18:29.667 --> 00:18:31.017
- Wow.

00:18:31.017 --> 00:18:31.850
- Wow

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.650
You get to this certain point

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:43.120
and the mangroves really open
up to an expansive greenery

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.973
with the mountains in the background.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.010
It's really kinda a shame though

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.810
that they haven't maintained
the walkway, the boardwalk,

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:52.550
because it's in pretty bad shape.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:56.460
My tip is that you really
stand in the center

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.660
where the concrete beams are.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.962
But it's gorgeous and peaceful and quiet.

00:19:01.962 --> 00:19:04.629
(uptempo music)

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:21.360
Made it to the very end of the platform.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.950
Actually I thought it was
supposed to go a loop trip.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:25.040
Maybe, I don't know.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.370
But this is definitely the end.

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:29.100
Heading back to the car and from here

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.360
we're gonna go check out
one more seafood restaurant

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.860
within Salak Phet.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.077
And I think that might conclude the day.

00:19:36.077 --> 00:19:38.799
But, what a fantastic
day it's already been.

00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:41.466
(uptempo music)

00:19:49.468 --> 00:19:51.600
There are two main seafood
restaurants to choose from.

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.560
One is called Salak
Phet Seafood and Resort.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.260
And the other is called

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.250
(speaking in foreign Language)

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:00.646
Saeng Arun

00:20:00.646 --> 00:20:02.510
So we're gonna try to go to Saeng Arun

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.980
it looks a little more low-key.

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.977
And we gotta walk down the
little lane to get there.

00:20:07.977 --> 00:20:09.900
You would sort of walk
through their house,

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.800
which is like a full dock in of itself.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.440
And then you get to the
restaurant in the back here,

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.670
with the view of the sea.

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:17.653
Ah, yes.

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:21.802
(uptempo music)

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.940
Didn't order very much,
just a couple of dishes.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:29.440
I just wanted to try this place

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.730
and just to enjoy the
view of Salak Phet bay.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:36.980
And the, yeah, just the
late afternoon scenery.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.160
And it is spectacular.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.300
We have the sea breeze.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.213
This is called

00:20:40.213 --> 00:20:41.500
(speaks in foreign language)

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.970
These are little carb
cakes and then deep fried.

00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:47.060
I'm not sure if they're
encased in tofu skin.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:47.910
I think they are.

00:20:51.316 --> 00:20:52.430
Mm.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:53.492
Mm.

00:20:53.492 --> 00:20:54.325
Hmm-mm.

00:20:55.618 --> 00:20:57.650
Maybe it's mixed with egg, but it's crab.

00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:59.740
You can taste the onions
and garlic in there

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.010
and then kinda crunchy skin.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:02.040
And really what you're supposed to do

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.933
is dip it in this sweet plum sauce.

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.420
The sauce is very sweet.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.976
But that does accompany well

00:21:12.976 --> 00:21:17.120
the salty, pepperiness of the sausage.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.015
The next dish we got is

00:21:18.015 --> 00:21:18.848
(speaks in foreign language)

00:21:18.848 --> 00:21:20.290
which is this type of
stir-fry with hoi-shell,

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:22.100
which are the scallops.

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.180
And you can see it's full of,

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:26.840
ooh, there's some random leaves in there.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.150
It's full of krachai, which is fingerroot.

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:31.550
These are little small, hopefully,

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:35.340
I think they're local scallops.

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.173
Onto the rice.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.380
I love that fingerroot in there.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.220
And then you've got the scallops

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.620
which have a bit of a bounce to them.

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.513
Oh yeah, we've got a hanger.

00:21:50.513 --> 00:21:52.064
Oh, it just slide off.

00:21:52.064 --> 00:21:54.814
(chuckles) Okay.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.510
Okay, I'm moving on to one more dish.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.790
This one is (speaks in foreign language)

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:01.230
and it looks to be like
(speaks in foreign language)

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:03.450
which is mullet fish.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:04.643
And it's a sour soup.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.290
Wow, we got a bunch of heads down there.

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:09.530
Oh, there's a bunch of fish.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:10.777
Oh okay, they're just small fish

00:22:10.777 --> 00:22:12.227
but there's a lot of 'em.

00:22:13.705 --> 00:22:16.030
And immediately you can
smell that kinda sour

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.160
I think tamarind in there.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.310
And there's ginger too.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:23.944
Mm.

00:22:23.944 --> 00:22:24.880
Mm.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.260
Ooh, this soup is nice with the ginger.

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.810
Mm.

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:30.010
It could be a little more sour.

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:30.843
It's not that sour.

00:22:30.843 --> 00:22:33.590
Mm, but the fish broth and the ginger.

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:35.290
The ginger actually, there's
so much ginger in there

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:36.460
it sort of burns going down you throat.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.393
That's delicious.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:43.000
Yep, that's mullet.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.055
Very firm.

00:22:44.055 --> 00:22:46.638
(guitar music)

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.890
So that brings us to the end of this.

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:54.100
What a fantastic day it
has been in Koh Chang,

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.980
along the east coast of the island.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.540
The ending seafood meal it was okay,

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.420
but it wasn't spectacular to me.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:04.870
For me the first seafood
restaurant at Salak Khok

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:08.850
that was really the more,
the awesome experience,

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:10.900
it just had more character to it too.

00:23:10.900 --> 00:23:12.130
Another thing I wanted to tell you

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:16.970
before ending this Kho Chang
travel, food, video guide.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:19.090
Yesterday, I didn't film on video,

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:20.380
but I took a few clips.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:24.840
We drove to end of the west side.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.770
You can continue along,

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:27.730
it's a really windy, amazing road,

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.550
but then you get to a
place called Bang Bao.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:31.853
Which is a pier.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.930
There's a lot of souvenir shops.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:37.530
I didn't try any of the restaurants,

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:39.520
but it's a nice place to see as well.

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.620
And then if you continue on,

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.300
there's another beach called Khlong Kloi,

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.330
which is also a really

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:47.210
chilled out, really relaxing place

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:50.408
if you're looking for a place
to stay for a few nights

00:23:50.408 --> 00:23:52.710
that's gonna be peaceful and quiet,

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:54.130
that's also an amazing place.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:57.420
So that's gonna do it for this
one day tour of Koh Chang.

00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:01.270
Visiting some of the sites and
especially enjoying the food.

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:03.860
I will have the information
of the things we did and ate

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:04.980

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.320
as well as some links
that you can check out.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.440

And we're just gonna drive back

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:15.890
to the other side of the island now.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.480
