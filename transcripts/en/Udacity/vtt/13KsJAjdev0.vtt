00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All right, so both of these forces are going to perfectly balance each other out.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We know that the electric force is going to exactly equal to gravitational force,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and we know the formulas for both of these forces, so we can put those in,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and you'll see that the distance between the two particles immediately cancels out,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and the charges for both of our particles are both 1 coulomb,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
so we know that this product of charges is just going to be equal to one,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so I'm just going to cross that out, and since both of these two particles have the same mass,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we know that the product m₁m₂ here is just equal to m².

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This gives us the equation K=Gm², and solving for m here, we find that the mass

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
has to be equal to the √K/G which plugging our known values for these two constants,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
we get that the mass has to be 1.16*10¹⁰ kg and that is a really large mass.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
To give you something to compare this to, this is about twice the mass

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
of one of the Egyptian pyramids and that's just if our particles have a charge of 1 Coulomb.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
To balance out the electric force between two particles with a relatively small charge,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we need a giant mass, and this tells us one of two things,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
either that the gravitational force is really, really, really weak in comparison to the electric force

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
or most of the masses we deal with in everyday life are really, really, really small.

00:01:15.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Either way, it helps us put these two forces in perspective.
