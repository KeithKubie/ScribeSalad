(mouse clicking)
(computer chiming)

00:00:05.411 --> 00:00:09.578
(pensive synthesizer and percussion music)

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:25.641
- Welcome, we are very
glad to see you here today.

00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:29.110
I'm Nick Spitzer, Co-Director
of the Kavli Institute

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.193
for Brain and Mind, here in La Jolla,

00:00:33.663 --> 00:00:36.734
and we have a wonderful
program this afternoon.

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:40.901
We're very happy that you're
here to take it all in.

00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:43.526
I want to say a few words

00:00:43.526 --> 00:00:47.886
about the Kavli Institute for
Brain and Mind as we start.

00:00:47.886 --> 00:00:51.476
In the little over a decade
that we've been in business,

00:00:51.476 --> 00:00:55.778
we have been trying to bridge
across different disciplines

00:00:55.778 --> 00:00:58.178
associated with understanding the brain.

00:00:58.178 --> 00:01:01.675
And so, as you can see,
here, we are trying

00:01:01.675 --> 00:01:05.842
to bring together people
interested in cognitive science,

00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:09.265
psychology, on the one hand,

00:01:09.265 --> 00:01:13.637
with neuroscientists and
neurologists, on the other hand,

00:01:13.637 --> 00:01:17.157
to bridge what has often
been a set of silos

00:01:17.157 --> 00:01:18.787
separating the people,

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:22.817
of course all concerned
with the same subject

00:01:22.817 --> 00:01:26.547
and Rusty Gage, Fred Gage, here, joins me

00:01:26.547 --> 00:01:28.797
as Co-Director of the KIBM;

00:01:30.094 --> 00:01:33.904
Ralph Greenspan is our Associate Director.

00:01:33.904 --> 00:01:36.595
Since the announcement
of the BRAIN Initiative

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:40.856
in April 2013, the KIBM
has launched a series

00:01:40.856 --> 00:01:44.634
of further initiatives,
which are illustrated here,

00:01:44.634 --> 00:01:48.095
beginning with the Center
for Brain Activity Mapping.

00:01:48.095 --> 00:01:51.653
One of the big threads of
the BRAIN Initiative is

00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:53.450
to develop new technologies

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.884
with which to map the
connections within the brain

00:01:56.884 --> 00:01:58.254
and this has been the focus

00:01:58.254 --> 00:02:01.842
of the Center for Brain Activity Mapping.

00:02:01.842 --> 00:02:05.925
In addition, Ralph Greenspan
has reached North to Sacramento

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:10.133
to the Legislature there
and achieved funding

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:13.793
in the State Budget of
the State of California

00:02:13.793 --> 00:02:17.710
for Cal-BRAIN, again, a
neurotechnology program

00:02:18.823 --> 00:02:22.240
for the, now, entire state of California.

00:02:23.513 --> 00:02:26.295
Most recently, the San
Diego Brain Consortium,

00:02:26.295 --> 00:02:29.603
here in San Diego, has worked
to bring together people

00:02:29.603 --> 00:02:32.256
from across the San Diego region

00:02:32.256 --> 00:02:36.423
to work on understanding the
brain with new technology.

00:02:38.232 --> 00:02:41.300
In each of these cases,
the goals are achieved

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.119
by providing grants to
bring together people

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:48.820
and motivate them to
work on these projects.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.400
The whole process is made
possible by The Kavli Foundation

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.220
to which we are very grateful.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.921
They, as many of you will
know, have been instrumental

00:02:58.921 --> 00:03:03.088
in pushing forward scientific
research in a number of fields

00:03:04.328 --> 00:03:07.578
noted here in addition to neuroscience.

00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:12.998
I should add that they also
fund some very exciting prizes

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.652
every other year and we're very pleased

00:03:16.652 --> 00:03:20.319
that one of the Co-Chairs
of the Symposium today

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.322
is Carla Shatz who was a winner

00:03:23.322 --> 00:03:27.489
of the Kavli Prize in
Neuroscience earlier this year.

00:03:28.413 --> 00:03:32.854
Bob Conn, Robert Conn, formerly
a Professor and Dean here

00:03:32.854 --> 00:03:35.035
at the University of
California San Diego, is now

00:03:35.035 --> 00:03:38.112
President of the Kavli Foundation,

00:03:38.112 --> 00:03:40.950
Miyoung Chun is the
Executive Vice President

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.773
for Scientific Programs and,
together, the two of them

00:03:43.773 --> 00:03:48.546
have done a great deal to push
forward scientific research

00:03:48.546 --> 00:03:51.463
across a wide range of disciplines.

00:03:52.575 --> 00:03:55.744
I want to add that the
structure of this symposium is

00:03:55.744 --> 00:03:58.115
based on a series of symposia

00:03:58.115 --> 00:04:01.253
that have been going on for a long time.

00:04:01.253 --> 00:04:03.392
This afternoon, we are here together

00:04:03.392 --> 00:04:07.559
for the inaugural Kavli
Symposium presented by the KIBM,

00:04:08.523 --> 00:04:10.213
but the CARTA Symposia,

00:04:10.213 --> 00:04:13.205
which I know are familiar
to a number of you,

00:04:13.205 --> 00:04:15.275
have really been a wonderful model

00:04:15.275 --> 00:04:19.044
for what we are doing here together today

00:04:19.044 --> 00:04:21.794
and they are focused on answering

00:04:23.573 --> 00:04:26.452
some of the big questions
about human beings:

00:04:26.452 --> 00:04:28.071
Where did we come from?

00:04:28.071 --> 00:04:30.132
How did we get here?

00:04:30.132 --> 00:04:33.202
Ajit Varki, Fred Gage,
Margaret Schoeninger

00:04:33.202 --> 00:04:36.285
and Pascal Gagneux run these symposia

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:38.974
and we're very happy to acknowledge

00:04:38.974 --> 00:04:43.141
their participation in helping
us with our inaugural event.

00:04:44.372 --> 00:04:48.212
This brings us, then, to
the program for today,

00:04:48.212 --> 00:04:50.745
the influence of early experience

00:04:50.745 --> 00:04:54.586
on the organization and
function of the adult brain.

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:57.034
This is a subject that's of great interest

00:04:57.034 --> 00:04:59.923
to everyone in the audience
and maybe there'll be

00:04:59.923 --> 00:05:04.090
some reflection back on our
origins at earlier times.

00:05:06.143 --> 00:05:09.233
There was a point early in my career

00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:13.365
in which we thought that the
brain could be understood

00:05:13.365 --> 00:05:15.748
either as some aspects

00:05:15.748 --> 00:05:19.081
regulated by genes and genetic programs,

00:05:20.595 --> 00:05:25.495
whereas other aspects of
the brain's operation were

00:05:25.495 --> 00:05:29.740
regulated by activity,
electrical activity,

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.821
and, now, we appreciate and I think

00:05:32.821 --> 00:05:35.030
this will be richly illustrated today,

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.988
that genes and activity
are very much partners

00:05:38.988 --> 00:05:40.405
with one another.

00:05:41.271 --> 00:05:45.438
Nature and nurture are, in
fact, combined in these studies.

00:05:46.387 --> 00:05:48.767
So, here will be some of the questions

00:05:48.767 --> 00:05:50.278
that we will be addressing

00:05:50.278 --> 00:05:52.668
during the course of the afternoon.

00:05:52.668 --> 00:05:55.547
How do the events of
early development show up?

00:05:55.547 --> 00:05:58.827
What are the risks and
opportunities of early development

00:05:58.827 --> 00:06:01.557
and their consequences for adult behavior?

00:06:01.557 --> 00:06:05.746
And, finally, does identification
of some critical windows

00:06:05.746 --> 00:06:09.067
at early stages of development
provide opportunities

00:06:09.067 --> 00:06:13.234
for us to reopen those windows
at a later stage in life?

00:06:14.807 --> 00:06:16.468
So, with that, I'll
turn the microphone over

00:06:16.468 --> 00:06:19.736
to Terry Sejnowski who will
give us a brief introduction

00:06:19.736 --> 00:06:22.625
for the opening of the afternoon.

00:06:22.625 --> 00:06:25.837
- We have a great group
here, today, of speakers

00:06:25.837 --> 00:06:28.704
and a wonderful audience, so
I'm really looking forward

00:06:28.704 --> 00:06:30.365
to all the talks.

00:06:30.365 --> 00:06:31.836
I want to, first of all, welcome you

00:06:31.836 --> 00:06:33.760
on behalf of the Salk Institute,

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.609
Rusty Gage, my colleague who
is a Co-Director of KIBM,

00:06:37.609 --> 00:06:41.359
and I'm also on the
faculty here and at UCSD.

00:06:42.907 --> 00:06:46.865
So, one of the great privileges
of being here at the Salk

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:50.115
was the beginning to know Francis Crick

00:06:51.583 --> 00:06:54.084
and Francis told me this story, once,

00:06:54.084 --> 00:06:58.106
and I think it might be a
good way to get the Symposium

00:06:58.106 --> 00:07:00.495
off to, on the right foot.

00:07:00.495 --> 00:07:02.945
He was giving a talk to a lay audience

00:07:02.945 --> 00:07:05.435
and the question period came up

00:07:05.435 --> 00:07:08.605
and one of the ladies in the
front row put her hand up

00:07:08.605 --> 00:07:11.376
and said, "Professor
Crick, could you tell me,

00:07:11.376 --> 00:07:12.664
"what's the most exciting thing,

00:07:12.664 --> 00:07:14.526
"discovery that's been
made in neuroscience?"

00:07:14.526 --> 00:07:16.517
And, Francis thought
for a moment and said,

00:07:16.517 --> 00:07:19.164
"Well, I think the most exciting
thing that I can think of

00:07:19.164 --> 00:07:22.609
"is that neuroscience has discovered

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:26.776
"that the brain is plastic,"
and she fainted straight away

00:07:27.756 --> 00:07:31.386
(audience laughing)

00:07:31.386 --> 00:07:36.356
and that's really a, that's
really the crucial mechanism

00:07:36.356 --> 00:07:40.457
for learning and memory is the
fact that the brain really is

00:07:40.457 --> 00:07:44.488
responsive to things, experiences you have

00:07:44.488 --> 00:07:47.127
and, as you'll see, not
just during the day,

00:07:47.127 --> 00:07:48.627
but also at night.

00:07:51.527 --> 00:07:53.694
Now, we've picked speakers

00:07:54.576 --> 00:07:56.993
to give you a broad spectrum,

00:07:58.378 --> 00:08:01.848
all the way from the
molecules up to, you know,

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:05.697
the whole coordinated
central nervous system

00:08:05.697 --> 00:08:09.209
that is responsible for
all the behaviors you have,

00:08:09.209 --> 00:08:11.748
all the thoughts that you have

00:08:11.748 --> 00:08:16.016
and the, you know, your
hopes and aspirations

00:08:16.016 --> 00:08:19.449
and that's really,
again, what Francis was,

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:23.616
tried to get across in his book,
The Astonishing Hypothesis.

00:08:24.996 --> 00:08:26.413
Another incident,

00:08:28.028 --> 00:08:32.195
this is Ramachandran, who is
a colleague at, now, at UCSD

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:38.213
and is also a very, very
prominent neuroscientist,

00:08:38.213 --> 00:08:40.665
once got a call from Francis.

00:08:40.665 --> 00:08:43.498
Francis was writing his
book and Francis says this,

00:08:43.498 --> 00:08:47.331
"Rama, I have just gotten
back from my editor,

00:08:49.038 --> 00:08:50.556
"you know, marked up first chapters

00:08:50.556 --> 00:08:54.515
"and she said that I ought to
give it to a layman to read

00:08:54.515 --> 00:08:57.005
"and get a feedback from a layman.

00:08:57.005 --> 00:08:58.683
"Do you know any laymen?"

00:08:58.683 --> 00:09:01.373
(audience laughing)

00:09:01.373 --> 00:09:03.152
So, we're going to make an effort to try

00:09:03.152 --> 00:09:07.674
to make our, the science
as accessible as possible.

00:09:07.674 --> 00:09:11.841
