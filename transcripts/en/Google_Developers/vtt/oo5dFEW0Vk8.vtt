OWEN LIN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.950
Welcome to "Ten Best Practices
for High-Quality Actions."

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.460
I'm Owen.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.695
I'm a product manager
for Actions on Google.

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:12.570
ERICA CEI: I'm Erica.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.530
I'm a linguist.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.620
And I help developers learn how
to design great conversations

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.767
between people and machines.

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:20.850
SHIKHA SEHGAL: I'm Shikha.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.940
I'm a partner
technology manager.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.130
My team works with
developers and partners

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.440
to help them build
high-quality Actions.

00:00:30.753 --> 00:00:32.670
OWEN LIN: And we're
really excited to have you

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.320
with us today.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.790
Actions on Google
is the platform

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.160
for developing conversational
experiences for the Google

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.030
Assistant.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.710
By building and
deploying an Action,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.450
you can make your
product or service

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.045
available to all the
users of the Assistant.

00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:46.920
Today, we're going to
share some tips for how

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.858
to build high-quality Actions.

00:00:48.858 --> 00:00:50.400
Between the three
of us, we've worked

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.275
with hundreds of developers.

00:00:51.275 --> 00:00:53.850
So we're really excited to
share our experience of what's

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.010
worked best.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.490
Now, before we jump in to how
to build high-quality Actions,

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.650
let's spend a moment and
talk about why we should

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.450
build high-quality Actions.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.790
Why does quality matter?

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.210
Well, one very important
reason for building

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.180
high-quality Actions is that
it leads to happy users.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.950
But another really
important reason

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.630
is that high-quality
Actions increases

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.747
the chances of your Action
being promoted by Google.

00:01:19.747 --> 00:01:21.330
The higher the quality
of your Action,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.990
the more likely Google is to
drive traffic to your Action--

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.210
for example, through
the Assistant Directory,

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.170
through implicit
invocation, even

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.900
through Google
Marketing newsletters.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.320
We've observed that, on
average, high-quality Actions

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.640
receive about two to 10 times
the traffic as other Actions.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.490
So we know that quality is
very important for traffic.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.110
The next question
you might be asking

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.750
is, how does Google
measure quality?

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.600
Well, the answer
to that is twofold.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.520
The first component is, how do
users respond to your Action?

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.490
Do users like your Action?

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.430
And to measure
that, we would look

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.210
at a number of usage metrics--

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.390
for example, engagement
rate, cancellation rate,

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.490
user ratings, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.250
The second component
to this is, is this

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.420
statistically significant?

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.900
OK, great, so the metrics
say that your users

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.260
love your Action.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.930
Do we have enough
traffic to your Action

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.110
so that we can trust what
the numbers are saying?

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.722
And this talk will go through
both of these components.

00:02:24.722 --> 00:02:26.430
Number one, we'll talk
about how to build

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.500
an Action that users love.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.000
And number two,
we'll talk about how

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.820
to drive some initial
traffic to your Action.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.370
Our goal is that by the end
of our 40 minutes together,

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.810
you'll be able to build a
high-quality Action that boosts

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.312
your chances of being promoted.

00:02:41.312 --> 00:02:43.770
Our talk will take us through
the entire development cycle,

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.927
from planning to
implementation to launch.

00:02:45.927 --> 00:02:47.260
Let's get started with planning.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.900
ERICA CEI: So the first
and most important step

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.580
is to pick the right
conversational use

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.890
case, because the use
case is the foundation

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.410
that everything else on
your Action is built on.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.690
Now, the keyword here
is "conversational."

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.030
You want to make sure that
your Action is really leaning

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.870
into the power of voice.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.940
So how do we do that?

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.510
One thing you can ask
yourself is, would this

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.530
save the user time and
effort as a conversation?

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.590
Let's take, for example,
adding an event to my calendar.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.250
I could do that with more
than 10 taps on my phone,

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.260
or I could just do
it with one utterance

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.460
and already have the event
title, date, and time saved.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.980
So that seems like a clear win.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.560
Another thing you can
do is look to real life

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.910
as your inspiration.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.340
If something is already
getting done in the real world

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.890
through conversation, it's
probably a natural fit

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.980
for an Action, as well.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.610
That also means
that your users can

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.340
apply their real-world
knowledge to the Action, which

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.250
really lowers the learning curve
and makes it easier for them.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.990
One example of that is, we
order coffee from baristas

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.040
with our voice all the time.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.810
And so it should be pretty easy
to adapt that to Action form.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.610
Once you have some
use cases in mind,

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.650
you can gut check them
by asking yourself,

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.102
how do people usually do
this, and kind of compare

00:04:13.102 --> 00:04:14.810
the distance between
that and how they're

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.287
doing it in your Action.

00:04:16.287 --> 00:04:18.079
So again, when it comes
to ordering coffee,

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.839
we said people do that with
baristas through their voice

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:21.480
all the time.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.050
So it's not too big of a
jump to do it with an Action.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.440
On the other hand, what
about something like,

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.830
you're browsing through
local coffee shops,

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.580
looking for the perfect
coffee experience,

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.680
you want to read all
those reviews and ratings.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.080
At that point, you might be
more interested in something

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.370
browsing a map or seeing
a bar graph of the rating

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.800
distributions, scrolling
through pages of reviews.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.930
And so that would
be a bit harder

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.450
to translate into Action
form and maybe wouldn't

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.780
lend itself as easily.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.150
This tip alone could
be its own talk.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.920
There's so much more
to say about it.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.480
And it actually was in 2017 here
at I/O. So I really recommend

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.030
that you go on YouTube and
look up this talk by Daniel

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.890
Padgett from 2017--

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.250
"Finding the Right Voice
Interactions for Your App."

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.170
OK.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.800
So you have your use case.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.730
You've started figuring
out what the flows are

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.870
going to look like.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.540
Now you want to think about
the details of how exactly

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.340
your Action is going to speak.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.020
And I really recommend that you
incorporate the user's history

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.030
with the Action so
that that's reflected

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.790
in what it says to them.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.390
When you go to a coffee
shop for the first time--

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.150
just to give a concrete,
real life example--

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.880
the barista might
welcome you, ask you

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.710
if you need any
recommendations, tell you

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.360
what the featured drinks are,
ask what you'd like to order.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.460
But after you keep coming
there day after day

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.380
and you always order
the same exact drink,

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.850
it gets to the
point where you walk

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.070
in, the barista
makes eye contact

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.970
and recognizes you, and
just says, "The usual?"

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.610
And that sort of
efficiency can only

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.270
happen because of
the shared history.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.395
We want to go for something
similar in our Actions.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.740
This is a strategy
that we call tapering.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.050
And it's all about optimizing
the prompt for the user.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.410
This can make it
much more efficient.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.080
And it also feels
more personalized

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.490
and more intelligent.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.500
And the fact that it's
speaking naturally,

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.510
the way that a
person might, also

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.630
means that the user feels more
comfortable speaking naturally

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.890
back to it, which makes
it, again, easier for them.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.420
To see this applied
to an Action,

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.740
let's say that we are building
a coffee-ordering Action,

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.470
and the user is choosing
where to pick up that coffee.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.530
Maybe the first time, it's
suggesting a specific store

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.330
and asking if they
want to get it there.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.730
But after they keep
picking up from there,

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.830
we can just use this
shortened prompt.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.740
And you can see how
much faster that is,

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.518
as well as being personalized.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.060
So now that you've thought
about how your Action is going

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.070
to talk, you should think
about the other half

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.940
of the conversation.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.680
How is the user going to talk?

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.470
You want to make sure that
they can speak naturally.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.170
And what do we mean
by "naturally"?

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.950
Well, when people
talk to each other,

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.250
they express themselves
in a wide variety of ways.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.320
And so we want our
Action to also understand

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.600
a wide variety of utterances.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.400
That way, the user
doesn't have to worry

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.680
about things like
memorizing commands

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.360
to interact with your Action.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.000
They can just talk
spontaneously, and it'll work.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.830
That makes it more
comfortable for them.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.600
Your Action will
also come across

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.430
as smarter and friendlier.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.797
Again, to see this in
the context of what

00:07:39.797 --> 00:07:41.380
it would look like
in an Action, let's

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.940
say that I've made an ice
cream-ordering app for my ice

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:45.850
cream shop.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.220
And towards the end
of the user's order,

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.590
the Action asks if they
want sprinkles on that.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.990
I want everyone to take a
moment to think of a few ways

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.302
that they would say yes--

00:07:54.302 --> 00:07:55.260
yes, we want sprinkles.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.530
How are we going to say that?

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.810
Well, here's a few ways.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.490
Here's a few more,
and still more.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.320
And I'm sure there's
tons of other ones

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.900
that are not even on this slide.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.130
So how can we solve
for this easily?

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.990
Well, let's go over the basics.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:20.635
First, this is done by building
out the recognition grammars.

00:08:20.635 --> 00:08:22.760
For those of you who aren't
familiar with the term,

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.950
a recognition grammar is the
set of phrases and utterances

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:30.120
that your Action can
recognize and understand.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.090
And the basic way
to build this out

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.390
is, you kind of come up
with a list of responses

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.830
that a user might come up with.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.480
And then you want
to go beyond what

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.789
your own brain can
come up with and tap

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:43.080
into other people's brains.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.180
Ideally, you'll test
with your users.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.310
But if they're
not available, you

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.890
can ask your friends
or co-workers.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:52.860
Then start coming up with
variations on everything that's

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:53.790
in the list.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.680
And then once you have
maybe beta testers,

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.040
you can start checking the logs
to see if anything you missed

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.040
slipped through the cracks and
use that to plug those holes.

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.210
But how can we
make it super easy?

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:08.782
That's with Dialogflow.

00:09:08.782 --> 00:09:10.240
Dialogflow is our
tool that you can

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.352
use for building Actions
and doing a lot more.

00:09:12.352 --> 00:09:13.810
I really recommend
that you use it,

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.460
because it can do
a lot of cool stuff

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.010
that we'll go through right now.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:19.980
It is particularly strong
in building grammars.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.060
I actually call that
Dialogflow's superpower.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.880
So one really great feature is
pre-built follow-up intents--

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.020
that is, grammars that are made
for you for some really common

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.110
user intents, like the
"yes" that we were talking

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.850
about for the sprinkles before.

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.882
And then there's also "no,"
"cancel," and a few other ones.

00:09:40.882 --> 00:09:42.590
And you can actually
edit these grammars,

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.890
so you can customize
them to be a perfect fit

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.950
to your specific prompt, which
I really recommend that you do.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.550
But this is a huge
time-saver, a great shortcut.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:56.810
You can also use
system entities which

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.410
let your Action understand some
common categories of words,

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.740
like colors, numbers,
or one of my favorites

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.490
is the example that
we see on the screen--

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.540
date-time.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.380
It can understand anything from
3:15 to two weeks from Friday

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.450
and put that into a standardized
form, which is pretty cool.

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.880
It's really powerful.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.130
And for everything else,
there's machine learning.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:23.770
You can fill in a few sample
phrases in the Training Phrases

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:24.490
section.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.170
And Dialogflow will
generalize from there.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.250
So see here for the
ice cream-ordering app,

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.380
I have one utterance that
says, "a scoop of this,

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.540
a scoop of that," and
then another utterance

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:38.320
at the bottom that's saying
a flavor and then a topping.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.490
And then when this user
utterance comes along,

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.700
which is not in the grammar
and it's not even a form

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.310
that's in the grammar,
because we have a combo--

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.977
we have a scoop of this, a scoop
of that, and also the topping--

00:10:46.977 --> 00:10:48.700
my Action is going
to understand this

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:51.737
no problem, because it was able
to generalize from those seeds

00:10:51.737 --> 00:10:52.570
that I put in there.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.360
If you want a deep
dive on Dialogflow,

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.850
I suggest you come back
to this same exact stage

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.820
tomorrow at 2:30 for the
session called "Let's Talk."

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:05.020
It'll be really helpful.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.010
But even if you build the
best grammar in the world,

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.427
there's still going to be times
when your users get stuck.

00:11:15.427 --> 00:11:16.968
And you want to make
sure that you're

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:18.170
able to get them unstuck.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:21.470
And the key to that
is using the context.

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:24.350
By "context," I mean the stuff
that was already established

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:28.260
earlier on in the conversation.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:30.480
So why do we need
to worry about this?

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.743
Even when people talk to each
other, we mess up all the time.

00:11:33.743 --> 00:11:35.660
Think back to maybe the
last time you stumbled

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:37.430
over your words or
someone said something

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.320
and you didn't quite understand.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.840
But we recover so flawlessly
that we don't really

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.337
even notice this.

00:11:43.337 --> 00:11:44.420
So what does this tell us?

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.550
One thing is that
if we mess up when

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.830
we're talking to
each other, we're

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.890
definitely going to mess up
when we talk to machines, too.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:55.460
The other thing is, if we are
able to recover and still move

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.820
on, maybe we can do something
similar in our Action.

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.770
Let's see an example
of how Starbucks

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:05.030
did this in their Action.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:09.030
And you're also welcome to try
this Action yourself later on.

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.330
So it's towards the
end of the order.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:16.110
Starbucks is asking the user
what size drink they want.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.260
It doesn't understand
what the user says.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.980
And so it re-prompts by
saying, "Sorry, what size?"

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.220
And the user is able to
get right back on track.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.940
Research shows that when errors
are handled smoothly like this,

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.710
users don't even
remember that they

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:34.250
happened, which is good in
terms of user happiness.

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.820
And it also means that users
are staying in your Action

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.890
longer, because they're
not error-ing out.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.040
So this is super important.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:45.830
Let's break down why
this specific prompt

00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:48.900
was so effective.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.990
The number one key is that it
mentions the context again.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.933
In this case, that was the size.

00:12:53.933 --> 00:12:55.350
By mentioning the
size again, it's

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:58.350
kind of reiterating what
the key piece of info

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:01.380
is that it needs and
kind of focuses on that.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.230
It also sounds like it's
making the conversation

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:05.460
with the user on the spot.

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.990
So for example, you could also
try this with a generic prompt,

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.430
like, "What was that?"

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.820
But then you risk things
like the user maybe

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.100
repeating something that
they had said already.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.020
Here, by emphasizing
the size, we're

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:23.510
making sure they stick to
providing that piece of info.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.040
It's also really quick.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.410
So again, you might think,
well, couldn't I just repeat

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.950
the same question and that
would also repeat the context?

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.590
Yes, but that would
be really unnatural.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.780
People would not do
that in conversation.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.670
And so it makes it harder for
the user to interact naturally.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.820
And also, if they
tried to respond,

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.710
that means that they
just heard the question.

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:46.450
So they don't need to sit
through the whole thing again.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:50.240
You can just shorten it
and make it more efficient.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.550
That "sorry" at the
beginning is also a clue

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:55.760
that maybe things didn't go
quite as well as anticipated.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.560
So that's a good
clue to the user.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.110
And again, this
sounds very natural,

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.930
so it's easy to interact with.

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:10.320
This style of error reprompt
is called a rapid reprompt.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:13.650
And our data shows that this
style is effective with users,

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:14.880
and they like it.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.620
One note is, because
it's contextual,

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.770
that does mean you'll need one
of these prompts for everything

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:21.330
that your Action says.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:24.390
But the win in quality
is well worth that.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.730
And also, it's much
easier to write these

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.500
than you might first think.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.950
You can learn more about how to
do that in depth on our design

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:33.420
guidelines here.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.420
And those also go into
depth into other scenarios

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.880
that I didn't get into here,
like what if you reprompt

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.890
and then the Action
still doesn't understand?

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:44.230
Or what if the user doesn't
say anything at all?

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:47.790
So you can definitely check
out the guidelines, learn that.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:50.490
It also covers all kinds
of other scenarios related

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:54.580
to the plan and
design of an Action.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:55.860
So that's it for planning.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:15:00.510
Let's dive into implementation.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:01.832
OWEN LIN: All right.

00:15:01.832 --> 00:15:04.080
So now we're getting
into implementation.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.940
And our first tip
for implementation

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.710
is around devices.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.540
In particular,
our recommendation

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:15.042
is to build for speakers
first, then build for screens.

00:15:15.042 --> 00:15:17.250
One of the great things
about building for the Google

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.440
Assistant is that it's available
on over 1 billion devices,

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.880
ranging from smartphones to
speakers to smart displays,

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.160
watches, even cars.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.805
I really love that you
can build your Action once

00:15:29.805 --> 00:15:31.180
and potentially
have it available

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.040
on so many different devices.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.650
Now, building for
all these devices

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.227
doesn't need to be difficult.

00:15:37.227 --> 00:15:39.310
And our tip for making it
a little bit more simple

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:44.110
is to start with speakers first
and then extend your Action

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.960
to the screen.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.570
We found that doing it this
way is a lot easier than going

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:49.680
the other way around.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:53.190
And because all of the
Google Assistant devices

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.020
respond to voice,
you get the most bang

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.660
for your buck in this way.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.720
So once you've
taken Erica's tips

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.800
and you come up with a
great conversational design,

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.840
then it's time to start
thinking about extending

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.400
your Action to the screens.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:09.900
And we'll go over
some ways that you

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.280
can do that through this step.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.838
So let's take a scenario.

00:16:13.838 --> 00:16:15.380
Let's say you decided
that you wanted

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.540
to build an air quality Action.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:21.410
And this Action, if your
user is on a speaker,

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:24.200
then you want your Action to
say what the air quality is.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.540
And if they're on a
device with a screen,

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:30.530
then you want your Action to
expand the Action a little bit

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:33.200
more with visuals.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.470
Here's how we might
actually be able to do this.

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:39.593
So now we're going to
your fulfillment code.

00:16:39.593 --> 00:16:41.260
Here we're in the
Intent, where the user

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.500
has asked for the air quality.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.550
And what we're going
to do is, first, we're

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.110
going to check to
see if the user is

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.530
on a device with a screen.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:52.160
So that's what we're
doing in line 1.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.160
In step 2, if the user has
a device with a screen,

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.780
then we can create a basic
card, put an image on it,

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:01.430
and then show it in
the conversation.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.250
If the user doesn't
have a screen,

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:07.310
then we can just speak what
the air quality is-- so very

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:08.543
simple.

00:17:08.543 --> 00:17:10.460
And this is what the
experience would actually

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.150
look like for the user.

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.349
So here, the user asks for the
air quality on their phone.

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:18.140
And they got a basic
card with an image

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:26.609
that helps them to
extend the air quality.

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:27.920
So this is fairly basic.

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:32.113
For your Action, feel free to
extend the card a little bit

00:17:32.113 --> 00:17:33.530
more and make it
a little bit more

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:35.210
engaging for folks
on the screen.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.430
Now let's talk about a
more advanced technique.

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:43.370
So let's say, in addition to
telling your users the air

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.860
quality in their
location, you also

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:49.047
want to show them a map of the
air quality around their area.

00:17:49.047 --> 00:17:50.630
So this is probably
going to be pretty

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:54.290
hard to do for a speaker.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.510
But fortunately,
Actions on Google

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.370
has a really nifty
feature that actually

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:03.180
lets you transfer your user from
one device to another device.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.480
And so in this
particular example,

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.180
if your user is
on a speaker, you

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:10.460
can actually request for
them to go from the speaker

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.830
to a device with a screen.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.295
And this is how you
would actually do it.

00:18:15.295 --> 00:18:16.920
So we're back in your
fulfillment code.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.753
We're back in the Intent,
where the user has

00:18:18.753 --> 00:18:20.325
asked for an air quality map.

00:18:20.325 --> 00:18:22.590
And what we're going
to do is, in step 1,

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.965
we're going to create a variable
called Screen Available.

00:18:24.965 --> 00:18:27.340
And here we're going to store
the results of the function

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.860
that checks to see
if the user has

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.860
a screen available for
any one of their devices.

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:35.450
In step 2, if the
user is already

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:39.540
on a device with a screen,
then we'll show the map.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.080
But if the user isn't on
a device with a screen,

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.450
then we'll create a
new surface object.

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.340
And what this new
surface object does

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.990
is it requests that
the user transfers

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:50.960
from their current
device to another device.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.370
In this particular
example, we're

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:55.240
asking the user to transfer
to a device with a screen.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.010
And then we're going to
show this new surface

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:01.950
object in the conversation.

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:05.010
Lastly, we'll check to make
sure that the user has actually

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.430
accepted the transfer or not.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.110
And this is what the experience
would look like for the users.

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.610
All right.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.193
So say they're on
the screen, and they

00:19:13.193 --> 00:19:14.730
ask for an air quality map.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:18.160
We request that they transfer
to a device with a screen.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:19.550
They say yes.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.300
On their phone, they'll
get a notification

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.130
from your air quality
Action asking them

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.440
to continue the conversation.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.650
If they click into
this notification,

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:31.440
they'll bring up the Action
with the air quality map loaded.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.897
So they can pick up right
where they left off.

00:19:34.897 --> 00:19:36.480
I think this is a
really nifty feature

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.440
to really help you be with
your users wherever they are.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.930
Now, we've only scratched
the tip of the iceberg

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:47.050
when it comes to developing
for multiple surfaces.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:49.180
If you guys are interested
in learning more,

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:50.980
we have another talk
right after this one

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.537
around this exact topic.

00:19:53.537 --> 00:19:55.120
So feel free to stick
around if you're

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.980
interested in learning more.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:58.480
OK.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:58.980
Great.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.230
So we've talked about how
to simplify development

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:03.880
for different devices.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.490
Our next tip is around
simplifying your code.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.980
And the recommendation here
is to make your life easier

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.130
with Helpers.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:14.760
Helpers are pre-built components
that Google has already created

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.695
for very common use cases.

00:20:16.695 --> 00:20:20.730
And let's take an example to
see how Helpers might work.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.520
Let's say you want to
build a taxi Action.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.690
As part of this Action, you want
to ask the user for an address

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:30.310
to send a taxi to.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:33.690
Well, what's the
best way to do this?

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:38.440
You can actually use a Helper
to make your life a lot easier.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.980
And the way we're going to
do that is, here in step 1,

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.110
we're going to create
a place object.

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:44.490
And then within
the conversation,

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:47.520
we're going to invoke
the place object.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.370
Now, after the user has
given their address,

00:20:50.370 --> 00:20:52.905
you can check the place object
for the user's response.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.820
Now, you'll notice a
couple things here.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.970
So first of all, you didn't
have to write any code

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.350
to parse the user's
address from their voice.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.960
Google's done that
already for you.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.160
Number two, you didn't have
to worry about error handling.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.296
Google has also
done that for you.

00:21:10.296 --> 00:21:13.350
And number three,
your user's response

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.750
is in a very easily
accessible format

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.030
through the place object.

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.630
So overall, instead of
writing many lines of code,

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.780
you just had to write
a few lines of code,

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.970
using the address Helper.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:31.663
It makes your code a lot
simpler and a lot easier.

00:21:31.663 --> 00:21:33.830
This is what the experience
looks like for the user.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:35.968
So the Action will ask
the user for the address.

00:21:35.968 --> 00:21:37.260
The user will give the address.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.940
And very quickly, you'll be able
to use the address directly.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:43.420
In addition to
simplifying your code,

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.550
these Helpers also simplify
the user experience,

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:50.164
because it standardizes it
across many different Actions.

00:21:50.164 --> 00:21:54.742
So we highly recommend
that you use them.

00:21:54.742 --> 00:21:56.200
In addition to the
place Helper, we

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.700
have a number of other Helpers
that you might find useful.

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.340
For example, we
have Helpers that

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:04.390
allow you to get the user's
name, their location, the date

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.670
and time, et cetera, et cetera.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:11.390
One Helper that
we think deserves

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:15.170
its own tip, in particular,
is around account linking.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:16.640
Use account linking
to personalize

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.568
the user's experience.

00:22:20.568 --> 00:22:22.610
Account linking allows
you to connect your Action

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.930
to your own
authentication system.

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:27.330
So let's take a scenario.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.360
Let's say that you're the
owner of a pizza shop,

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.943
and you have your
own web app, and you

00:22:30.943 --> 00:22:33.890
have your own app that
allows users to order pizzas

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:38.110
from you directly.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.590
Let's say you also have an
Assistant Action that lets you

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:43.140
check the status of your order.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.030
Now, in order for users
to actually do this,

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.920
they'll have to sign
in to your system.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:50.330
And the way they do this
is through account linking.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.343
And to do this is
actually super simple.

00:22:55.343 --> 00:22:57.760
So in your Actions Console,
the first thing you need to do

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:59.980
is to enable account linking.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:01.600
Then back in your
fulfillment code,

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.670
you can create a
sign-in object and then

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.608
invoke it in the conversation.

00:23:06.608 --> 00:23:09.150
Lastly, you need to check to
see if the user has successfully

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:11.080
signed in or not.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:16.427
But the entire flow takes just a
few lines of code to build out.

00:23:16.427 --> 00:23:18.510
And this is what it will
look like for your users.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:25.863
Here, your users ask you for
the status of their pizza.

00:23:25.863 --> 00:23:27.780
Google will allow them
to check to see if they

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.830
have an account with you.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:32.850
If they do, then they can grant
permission to your pizza data

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:33.940
through your Action.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.673
And if they grant
permission, then they'll

00:23:36.673 --> 00:23:38.340
be able to get the
status of their pizza

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.300
directly from your Action.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.110
So super simple, from a user
perspective-- two clicks,

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:44.610
they're signed in
to your system.

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:50.350
We've seen that when
users successfully sign in

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:52.540
to their Actions,
their engagement rate

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.698
with your Action
grows significantly.

00:23:55.698 --> 00:23:57.490
Here's some recommendations
for making sure

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:00.320
that your sign-in
rate stays high.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.330
First, ask in the right context.

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:07.100
So in the previous example,
we asked for sign-in

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:11.190
after the user has asked to
check their pizza status.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:14.000
Here, the user knows why they
need to sign in to the Action.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.910
They know what value they're
going to get by signing in.

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:19.030
We've worked with
a few other Actions

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:21.680
in the past that ask for sign-in
as soon as the user opens

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.490
the Action.

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:25.550
And what we observed is that
users tend not to sign in,

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:29.940
and they also tend not to
return to the Action afterwards.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.100
So the lesson here is,
ask in the right context

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:37.120
so the user knows what the
value of signing in is.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.090
The second recommendation
here is to use Google Sign-In.

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:42.820
So we offer several options
for account linking,

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:43.590
including OAuth.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:46.080
But Google Sign-In is
the preferred method.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:48.110
And the reason for
that is threefold.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:50.740
So number one, a lot
of Assistant users

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.170
have already signed in
to their Google accounts.

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:55.645
So using Google
Sign-In is really easy.

00:24:55.645 --> 00:24:58.270
We saw in the previous example,
it only took the users two taps

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:00.960
to successfully sign in.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.318
The second reason is, if you
use Google Sign-In and the user

00:25:04.318 --> 00:25:06.360
doesn't have an account
with your system already,

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.860
they can create a
new account, which

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.500
is good for the growth
of your product.

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.590
And then number
three, Google Sign-In

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:15.180
is already built for
both voice and visual,

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:19.120
so you get the most bang
for your buck by using it.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:23.280
And that's it for
account linking.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.950
Next, we'll go into
launch and growth.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.960
SHIKHA SEHGAL: Now that you
have implemented your Action,

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.640
are you ready to launch it?

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.550
Not quite yet.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:38.020
This brings us to our
next best practice.

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:41.410
A common theme that
we have seen with most

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:46.060
of our high-quality Actions
is they do extensive testing

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:49.060
with selected early adopters.

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:53.530
It's like doing a soft
opening for a restaurant.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:55.630
Have you been to one?

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:59.290
A new restaurant owner, before
they open their restaurant

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:03.400
to the public, they
do a series of nights.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.380
They call it soft opening.

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:08.170
They invite a few
family and friends

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:12.280
who enjoy a good dining
experience and some critics,

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:16.150
who can give them true,
honest, real feedback

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:19.960
on the food, the restaurant,
the service, et cetera.

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:24.300
We want you to do something
very similar with your Actions.

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:30.270
And to help you, we have created
two release channels for you.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:33.150
First is an alpha release.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:36.690
Alpha is an awesome way
to do quick iterations

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:38.070
for your Action.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:41.190
When you are in the
early stages, when you've

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:44.880
done your manual testing,
open up your Action

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.620
to your immediate team members.

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:51.690
You can select up to 20
testers at this point.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:56.140
Your Action does not
undergo a Google review.

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:59.250
So whatever changes
you make will go live

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.350
in just a couple of hours.

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:05.850
So this will really allow
you to do early iterations.

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:09.060
We recommend that you
select your testers

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:13.590
from your employees within your
team and some extended team.

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:16.560
At Google, we call
this team folding.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.910
And we do this pretty
much for all our products.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:24.120
Once you do alpha and
you feel comfortable,

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:28.500
expand your testers to what
we call a beta release.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:32.730
You can select up to
200 testers for this.

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:36.660
Before your Action
goes live to beta,

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.600
it goes through a
full Google review.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.900
We check for policy compliance.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:47.730
And you decide when you want
it to go live in production.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:51.480
We recommend that you
select your beta users

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.460
from mostly folks outside of
your org and include a variety.

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:02.950
When you do alpha and beta
release, make it count.

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:07.480
My team incubates new features
for Actions in Google.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:12.760
We do alpha and beta extensively
with our early access partners

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.200
and developers.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.140
And here's how we
make the most of it.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:21.580
We want you to do same
with your Actions.

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:25.950
First, give basic
instructions to your testers.

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:29.230
Give them some basic
expressions that they should use

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:31.560
and tell them the
goal of your Action.

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:34.410
But don't tell them too much.

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:38.340
You want your testers
to struggle a bit.

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:42.468
This helps you capture
their edge cases.

00:28:42.468 --> 00:28:46.180
Next, be there in person.

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:48.800
Sit and watch them, if possible.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.790
We understand it might
be impossible to do

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:53.800
this with all your testers.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.950
But even if you can
with a selected few,

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:59.110
it would really
make the difference.

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:01.390
It will help you
capture their body

00:29:01.390 --> 00:29:04.000
language, their
expressions, the way

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.160
they interact with your Action.

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:10.850
And you don't want to
miss this deep feedback.

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:14.290
Finally, use a diverse
set of testers--

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:17.950
ideally, a sample that
represents your actual user

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:18.760
base--

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.080
people from
different age groups,

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.250
different genders,
backgrounds, some tech savvy,

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:26.240
some non-tech savvy.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.680
This helps you capture
a broad perspective

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:34.100
and helps you cover a
good range of use cases.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:37.600
And when ready, go live.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.470
But once you go live,
how do your users

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:44.240
know that your Action exists?

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.000
Let's say you created a game--

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.070
a very cool game.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:51.360
But your users don't know.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:57.420
Let me show you two simple steps
in which some of our developers

00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:01.410
have been able to boost the
discovery of their Actions

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:07.080
and increase their daily active
users by up to five-fold.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.710
Do you know how most
of the Assistant users

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.990
use when they want
to play a game?

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:15.180
They simply say, "play a game."

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:20.810
And when they do
that, Assistant shows

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:23.810
them a list of five top games.

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:26.030
You can further
filter down using

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:28.350
a category of your choice.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:30.410
It will give you
a filtered list.

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:31.280
I like math.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:34.100
Say, "Go to Math Showdown."

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.950
And then you can start
playing that game.

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:39.950
You did not know what game
you wanted to play with.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:43.370
Assistant helped you
narrow down the choice.

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:47.485
But how do we make your
game appear in this list?

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:55.650
"Play game" was one way
to express what we call,

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:58.890
in an Assistant
world, your intent.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:00.840
There could be hundreds more.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.640
You can see a sample
on the screen.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.600
Now you can go ahead
and add all of these

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.990
to your Action as
custom variables.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:13.140
But it might be
impossible to capture

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:15.090
all possible variations.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:17.730
We have done this work
for you by something

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:20.070
called built-in intent.

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:24.210
A built-in intent maps
hundreds or thousands of these

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:28.980
variations into one common
variable that you can simply

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:31.020
add to your Action--

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.140
in this particular
case, "play game."

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:37.350
and when added,
your Action becomes

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:40.770
eligible to appear in that list.

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:45.210
It's very simple to add this
built-in intent to your Action.

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:48.060
You simply go to
Dialogflow, select

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.810
an intent of your choice.

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:52.440
You can further
specify the category

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:56.670
that your game fits in, like
music, education, et cetera.

00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:00.600
And that enhances your
chances of appearing

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:01.980
in that filtered list.

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:09.790
Besides "play game," we have
14 other built-in intents

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:11.710
that are available today.

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:16.270
They are in developer preview,
so you can apply to use them.

00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:20.740
We created these based on
the most popular use cases

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:24.670
that we see on Assistant and
what our developers, like you,

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:26.320
love to build.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.900
If you see a built-in
intent that's not here,

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:32.080
you can always apply for
it through our website.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.990
We plan to continue
to add to this list.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.350
Remember, it's important to
select the right built-in

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:46.150
intent, but also very important
to ensure that your Action is

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:47.750
high quality.

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:50.470
Owen earlier mentioned
certain metrics

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:53.980
that we use to measure the
quality of your Action--

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:58.420
how a user responds to it, the
success rate, the error rate,

00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.590
et cetera.

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:04.540
A combination of right built-in
intent and high quality

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:08.050
really boosts the
chances of your Action

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:10.970
to appear in this list.

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:14.530
But what if you're
not a game or you

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:18.280
don't fit into any of the
other 14 built-in intents

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.450
that I showed?

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:22.690
We have other option for you.

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:25.000
It's called action links.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.540
These are simple hyperlinks
that take a user from the link

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:33.660
directly to your Action.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:38.400
When used right, these can be
a great discovery mechanism

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.780
for your Action.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.330
And it's very simple
to generate them.

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:46.620
Simply go to your Actions
Console, give a title,

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:47.890
and get the URL.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:49.260
We publish it for you.

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:52.690
Just copy it and use
it on your website,

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:57.750
on your blog, social media,
or wherever a link works.

00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:01.110
Let me show you a
very cool way in which

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:05.700
one of our Italian
developers, Giallo Zafferano,

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.350
used action links.

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:11.190
Now, they have some
amazing Italian recipes.

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:13.290
And when you go
to their website--

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:16.800
and say you're visiting this
pasta recipe, which I really

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:21.239
like, you see this
cool, floating Assistant

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:23.850
badge on their site.

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:26.940
And when you click
this Assistant badge,

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:33.100
it takes you to the exact Action
and pasta recipe in Assistant.

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:36.090
And it takes you
through the actual steps

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:37.860
to make that pasta.

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:41.070
You can start cooking
hands-free right away.

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:43.360
How cool is that?

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:47.199
Giallo Zafferano, when they
launched this experience,

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:51.679
they saw a significant spike
in their daily active users.

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:54.699
And at the same time,
they were able to give

00:34:54.699 --> 00:34:58.420
this innovative and
cool cooking experience

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:00.580
for their food-loving users.

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:04.840
This is one way you can get
creative in your own way

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:08.690
when you use action links.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:13.710
Now that you got that spike
in daily active users,

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:15.650
how do you sustain it?

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:19.280
How do you keep your users
engaged and reengaged?

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:25.670
We want you to become a part
of your users' daily routine.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:28.760
Users like you and I
have some daily habits.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:33.650
For example, in my morning,
I like to check the weather,

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:37.350
listen to the news, see my
calendar, and plan my day.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:41.800
In the evening, I like to wind
down, listen to some music.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:46.040
Assistant today has some
pre-built-in Routines for you.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:49.490
And users can add
multiple Actions

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:51.560
to each of these Routines.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:55.160
And they can invoke them
using a single command.

00:35:55.160 --> 00:36:00.080
You can make your Action
eligible for these Routines.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:00.950
Let me show you how.

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:07.560
I like to use Headspace
for my meditation.

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.660
Say I'm talking to Headspace.

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:13.250
I select today's
meditation of my choice.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:20.640
And when I'm listening to
this meditation, I like it.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.020
I see this option to
add it to a Routine.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:30.894
When I select it, it
would ask me to confirm.

00:36:30.894 --> 00:36:32.280
I say yes.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:39.490
Then it gives me
the option to add it

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:42.850
to one of my existing Routines.

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:43.915
I select Bedtime.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.630
And that's it.

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:52.110
I was able to add Headspace
and that meditation

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.010
to my Bedtime Routine.

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:59.100
And let's see what happens
when I invoke Bedtime.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.340
Assistant remembers
that I added Headspace

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:14.660
and that exact meditation,
and it will play it for me.

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:18.320
How simple is this experience
from the previous one?

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.720
I didn't need to remember
Headspace or need

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.550
to select a meditation.

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:24.380
Assistant did it for me.

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:27.340
You can do this with
your own Actions.

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:30.050
And if, say, you think
your Action is not

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:35.590
good fit for Routines, we
have other options for you.

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:37.990
Daily Updates--
these are updates

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:41.980
which Google pulls from your
Action at a time specified

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:43.670
by the user.

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:47.530
So for example, I like to get
a yoga routine in my morning

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:50.750
or want to check
my stock portfolio.

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:53.360
Other option is
Notifications when

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:56.030
your Action decides
when it wants

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:57.890
to send an update to the user.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:02.880
For example, say,
hey, your pizza

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.270
will arrive in 10 minutes, or
your movie tickets are ready.

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:09.620
Enjoy your show tomorrow.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:14.090
It's very easy to include any
of these user engagement tools

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:15.320
to your Action.

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:18.110
Simply go to your
Actions Console

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:20.750
and enable the ones
that you see fit.

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:26.550
So those were our
ten best practices

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:30.660
to plan, implement, launch,
and grow your Action.

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:34.290
My team has been working
with Actions in Google

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:35.880
since we launched it.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.030
Over the years, we have
seen the challenges

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:41.610
that our developers and
partners have faced.

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:44.320
We know what works
and what doesn't.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.370
And what we shared
with you today

00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:50.820
are our learnings from closely
working with those developers.

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.100
We hope you're able to use them.

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:57.000
And mind that you can use all
of these best practices today.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.430
They work for you.

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:01.600
Let's do a quick recap.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:06.110
When you plan, make sure
you pick the right use case.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:09.740
Let your users speak
naturally and help them

00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:13.680
when they get into an error
or when they get stuck.

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:17.780
When you implement, build for
speakers first, then screen.

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:21.630
Leverage Helpers when
possible, and give your users

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:27.010
a personalized experience using
Action, using account linking.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:30.070
Finally, before you
launch your Action,

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:34.870
early test with early
adopters using alpha and beta,

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:39.070
boost discovery using action
links and built-in intent,

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:42.220
and meet your users where
they are by becoming

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:43.680
a part of their daily routines.

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:51.190
Remember, high-quality Action
makes your users happy.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:54.340
And in turn, it makes
your Action eligible

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:57.340
to be promoted by Google,
which, in turn, drives

00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:00.740
more users to your Action.

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:04.010
There are several more
resources available at I/O

00:40:04.010 --> 00:40:05.720
to help you learn more.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.240
I'm highlighting
a couple of talks.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:12.530
We are also available to talk
to you in person at the Sandbox,

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:14.360
Office Hours, and Codelab.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.120
We would love to talk to
you, answer your questions,

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:21.030
and help you get
started, so do visit us.

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:22.560
Thank you.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:28.310
