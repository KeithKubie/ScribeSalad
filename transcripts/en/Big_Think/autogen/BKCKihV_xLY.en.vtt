is out working on these real-world
 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.230
is out working on these real-world
projects around the globe so about half

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240
projects around the globe so about half
 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.850

and our thinking on that has been that

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180
and our thinking on that has been that
 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.300

clearly business schools have to be
 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.910
clearly business schools have to be
close to the world of practice and you

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920
close to the world of practice and you
 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.310
close to the world of practice and you
can get there a couple ways one is one

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320
can get there a couple ways one is one

case studies are as we have done

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119
case studies are as we have done
 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.359
case studies are as we have done
recreating a trading floor that you'd

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369
recreating a trading floor that you'd
 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.229
recreating a trading floor that you'd
find here in New York or another finance

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239
find here in New York or another finance
 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:09.580

center in the world and bringing that

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590
center in the world and bringing that
 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.770
center in the world and bringing that
into the school the other way is you can

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780
into the school the other way is you can
 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.449
into the school the other way is you can
take your students and your faculty and

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459
take your students and your faculty and
 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.130
take your students and your faculty and
put them out in the world of practice

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140
put them out in the world of practice
 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.100
put them out in the world of practice
and so that's what we've done it really

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110
and so that's what we've done it really
 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.530
and so that's what we've done it really
should try to distinguish our program

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540
should try to distinguish our program
 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.330
should try to distinguish our program
and it it's it's a

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340
and it it's it's a
 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.820
and it it's it's a
a really great way of educating students

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830
a really great way of educating students
 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.530
a really great way of educating students
and also a great way for us as the

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540
and also a great way for us as the
 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.270
and also a great way for us as the
school to see what the interesting

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280
school to see what the interesting
 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.190
school to see what the interesting
problems are out there in the world

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200
problems are out there in the world
 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.979
problems are out there in the world
because in the course of having these

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989
because in the course of having these
 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.199
because in the course of having these
students do these projects we probably

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209
students do these projects we probably
 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.809
students do these projects we probably
visit about 150 companies a year to ask

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819
visit about 150 companies a year to ask
 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.729
visit about 150 companies a year to ask
them if we could do a project with them

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739
them if we could do a project with them
 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.740
them if we could do a project with them
of something that's really salient for

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750
of something that's really salient for
 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.229
of something that's really salient for
them today so we get a pretty good sense

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239
them today so we get a pretty good sense
 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.449
them today so we get a pretty good sense
of sort of what's on people's minds by

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459
of sort of what's on people's minds by
 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.009
of sort of what's on people's minds by
the kinds of things they would like our

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019
the kinds of things they would like our
 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.380
the kinds of things they would like our
students to work on so i think that

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390
students to work on so i think that
 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.660
students to work on so i think that
injection of our students and our

the first year and we're doing this over
 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.630
the first year and we're doing this over
and over and over and so we're able to

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640
and over and over and so we're able to
 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.449
and over and over and so we're able to
actually get a look at some some

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459
actually get a look at some some
 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.970
actually get a look at some some
problems in detail so for example a few

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980
problems in detail so for example a few
 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.360

years back CK Prahalad who's on our

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370
years back CK Prahalad who's on our
 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.819
years back CK Prahalad who's on our
faculty decided he really wanted to take

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829
faculty decided he really wanted to take
 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.970
faculty decided he really wanted to take
a look at the issue of canned businesses

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980
a look at the issue of canned businesses
 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.710
a look at the issue of canned businesses
profitably served the poor of the world

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720
profitably served the poor of the world
 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.819
profitably served the poor of the world
and so the basis for his getting look at

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829
and so the basis for his getting look at
 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.520
and so the basis for his getting look at
that question was to do 10 map projects

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530
that question was to do 10 map projects
 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.550
that question was to do 10 map projects

organizations around the world and that

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139
organizations around the world and that
 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.160

really was the raw data which became his

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170
really was the raw data which became his
 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.720
really was the raw data which became his
book the fortune at the bottom of the

book the fortune at the bottom of the
 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.349
book the fortune at the bottom of the
pyramid so I think in the way that some

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:41.359
pyramid so I think in the way that some
 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.410
pyramid so I think in the way that some
other schools would try to have their

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420
other schools would try to have their
 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.120
other schools would try to have their
connection with the world to practice be

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130

by bringing in outside speakers and
 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.770
by bringing in outside speakers and
making sure the faculty will bring

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780
making sure the faculty will bring
 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.140
making sure the faculty will bring

all that the same as any of the leading
 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.250

business schools would but I think this

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260
business schools would but I think this
 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.839
business schools would but I think this
is what's really kind of been

00:07:58.439 --> 00:07:58.449
through the three different things we
 

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:00.809
through the three different things we
could do so trying to think about well

00:08:00.809 --> 00:08:00.819
could do so trying to think about well
 

00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:02.700
could do so trying to think about well
what do you how could you develop the

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:02.710
what do you how could you develop the
 

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.249
what do you how could you develop the
skills that go on the front end of a

00:08:05.249 --> 00:08:05.259
skills that go on the front end of a
 

00:08:05.259 --> 00:08:08.399
skills that go on the front end of a
case study that you develop students

00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:08.409
case study that you develop students
 

00:08:08.409 --> 00:08:10.740
case study that you develop students
sentient ability to make sense of the

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:10.750
sentient ability to make sense of the
 

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.409
sentient ability to make sense of the
situation and then really frame the

00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:13.419
situation and then really frame the
 

00:08:13.419 --> 00:08:15.689
situation and then really frame the
problem and so that's what we've tried

00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:15.699
problem and so that's what we've tried
 

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:17.249
problem and so that's what we've tried
to do with our action based learning

00:08:17.249 --> 00:08:17.259
to do with our action based learning
 

00:08:17.259 --> 00:08:20.100
to do with our action based learning
projects where as we send students out

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:20.110
projects where as we send students out
 

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.200
projects where as we send students out
for a two-month project there is no case

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:22.210
for a two-month project there is no case
 

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.269
for a two-month project there is no case
we give a one page description of the

00:08:24.269 --> 00:08:24.279
we give a one page description of the
 

00:08:24.279 --> 00:08:26.909
we give a one page description of the
problem and many times the problem is

00:08:26.909 --> 00:08:26.919
problem and many times the problem is
 

00:08:26.919 --> 00:08:28.709
problem and many times the problem is
when you really look at it at saying

00:08:28.709 --> 00:08:28.719
when you really look at it at saying
 

00:08:28.719 --> 00:08:30.809
when you really look at it at saying
well go help this company figure out how

00:08:30.809 --> 00:08:30.819
well go help this company figure out how
 

00:08:30.819 --> 00:08:33.000
well go help this company figure out how
they could do better so we deliberately

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.010
they could do better so we deliberately
 

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.699
they could do better so we deliberately
leave the job of defining what the

00:08:35.699 --> 00:08:35.709
leave the job of defining what the
 

00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:38.370
leave the job of defining what the
issues are in providing the students the

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:38.380
issues are in providing the students the
 

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.159
issues are in providing the students the
space to really find the opportunity in

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:41.169
space to really find the opportunity in
 

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:44.639
space to really find the opportunity in
the situation so I believer that the

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:44.649
the situation so I believer that the
 

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:46.800
the situation so I believer that the
three fundamental ways that you can

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:46.810
three fundamental ways that you can
 

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.900
three fundamental ways that you can
think about education there being a

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:48.910
think about education there being a
 

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.939
think about education there being a
professor or upfront lecturing telling

00:08:50.939 --> 00:08:50.949
professor or upfront lecturing telling
 

00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:53.519
professor or upfront lecturing telling
you what he or she has inside their head

00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:53.529
you what he or she has inside their head
 

00:08:53.529 --> 00:08:56.340
you what he or she has inside their head
secondly some case studies in which you

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:56.350
secondly some case studies in which you
 

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.470
secondly some case studies in which you
are in discussion for them and also an

00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480
are in discussion for them and also an
 

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.990
are in discussion for them and also an
action based learning combining

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:01.000
action based learning combining
 

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.970
action based learning combining
those three in the right way is what I

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:02.980
those three in the right way is what I
 

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.880
those three in the right way is what I
think is the right way to do both mba

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:05.890
think is the right way to do both mba
 

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.369
think is the right way to do both mba
and BBA education

00:09:09.369 --> 00:09:09.379
and BBA education
 

00:09:09.379 --> 00:09:12.849
and BBA education
well that's I guess that's my what I

00:09:12.849 --> 00:09:12.859
well that's I guess that's my what I
 

00:09:12.859 --> 00:09:16.900
well that's I guess that's my what I
think of as my primary job and I guess

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:16.910
think of as my primary job and I guess
 

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:21.729
think of as my primary job and I guess
the a couple well a few a few kind of

00:09:21.729 --> 00:09:21.739
the a couple well a few a few kind of
 

00:09:21.739 --> 00:09:25.089
the a couple well a few a few kind of
everyday ways and a few maybe a little

00:09:25.089 --> 00:09:25.099
everyday ways and a few maybe a little
 

00:09:25.099 --> 00:09:29.159
everyday ways and a few maybe a little
bit kind of more abstract I guess

00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:29.169
bit kind of more abstract I guess
 

00:09:29.169 --> 00:09:32.019
bit kind of more abstract I guess
abstract ways that that I that I try to

00:09:32.019 --> 00:09:32.029
abstract ways that that I that I try to
 

00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:34.269
abstract ways that that I that I try to
do it but I mean in terms of trying to

00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:34.279
do it but I mean in terms of trying to
 

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:37.299
do it but I mean in terms of trying to
create a learning community one one of

00:09:37.299 --> 00:09:37.309
create a learning community one one of
 

00:09:37.309 --> 00:09:40.479
create a learning community one one of
the things we try to do is create a

00:09:40.479 --> 00:09:40.489
the things we try to do is create a
 

00:09:40.489 --> 00:09:44.799
the things we try to do is create a
physical space to to accommodate a

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:44.809
physical space to to accommodate a
 

00:09:44.809 --> 00:09:47.829
physical space to to accommodate a
learning community and so it our new

00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839
learning community and so it our new
 

00:09:47.839 --> 00:09:50.079
learning community and so it our new
building what we have is it's all built

00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:50.089
building what we have is it's all built
 

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:51.869
building what we have is it's all built
around what we call the winter garden

00:09:51.869 --> 00:09:51.879
around what we call the winter garden
 

00:09:51.879 --> 00:09:56.589
around what we call the winter garden
which is where about 450 people will be

00:09:56.589 --> 00:09:56.599
which is where about 450 people will be

00:09:59.079 --> 00:09:59.089
sit seated from about gets going about
 

00:09:59.089 --> 00:10:00.999
sit seated from about gets going about
ten o'clock in the morning and it goes

00:10:00.999 --> 00:10:01.009
ten o'clock in the morning and it goes
 

00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:03.009
ten o'clock in the morning and it goes
till about one o'clock at night and so

00:10:03.009 --> 00:10:03.019
till about one o'clock at night and so
 

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:05.499
till about one o'clock at night and so
that's sort of the heart and soul of our

00:10:05.499 --> 00:10:05.509
that's sort of the heart and soul of our
 

00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:09.189
that's sort of the heart and soul of our
of our community and I think the so

00:10:09.189 --> 00:10:09.199
of our community and I think the so
 

00:10:09.199 --> 00:10:10.689
of our community and I think the so
that's one is to have the physical

00:10:10.689 --> 00:10:10.699
that's one is to have the physical
 

00:10:10.699 --> 00:10:13.239
that's one is to have the physical
infrastructure there the second thing is

00:10:13.239 --> 00:10:13.249
infrastructure there the second thing is

from the beginning to be telling
students about what their job is at the

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:18.350
students about what their job is at the

students about what their job is at the
school that you know our first test when

00:10:21.429 --> 00:10:21.439
school that you know our first test when
 

00:10:21.439 --> 00:10:23.229

we're deciding whether to admit you to
the school or not is can you learn in

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:27.470
the school or not is can you learn in
 

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.469
the school or not is can you learn in
this environment so we don't do you any

00:10:29.469 --> 00:10:29.479
this environment so we don't do you any
 

00:10:29.479 --> 00:10:31.840

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:36.350
courses or the business economics
 

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.289
courses or the business economics
courses and so forth but we're fortunate

00:10:38.289 --> 00:10:38.299
courses and so forth but we're fortunate
 

00:10:38.299 --> 00:10:40.029
courses and so forth but we're fortunate
enough that we can fill the school up

00:10:40.029 --> 00:10:40.039
enough that we can fill the school up
 

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:42.189
enough that we can fill the school up
ten times over with people who can learn

00:10:42.189 --> 00:10:42.199
ten times over with people who can learn
 

00:10:42.199 --> 00:10:44.919
ten times over with people who can learn
effectively in our environment so we get

00:10:44.919 --> 00:10:44.929
effectively in our environment so we get
 

00:10:44.929 --> 00:10:48.460
effectively in our environment so we get
to create a situation where we're really

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:48.470
to create a situation where we're really
 

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.559
to create a situation where we're really
choosing the students to join our

choosing the students to join our
 

00:10:50.569 --> 00:10:53.109
choosing the students to join our
environment based upon what we think

00:10:53.109 --> 00:10:53.119
environment based upon what we think
 

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:55.329
environment based upon what we think
they can teach the rest of us so the

00:10:55.329 --> 00:10:55.339
they can teach the rest of us so the
 

00:10:55.339 --> 00:10:58.019
they can teach the rest of us so the
idea of having a diverse student body in

00:10:58.019 --> 00:10:58.029
idea of having a diverse student body in
 

00:10:58.029 --> 00:11:01.329
idea of having a diverse student body in
you know gender race national origin

00:11:01.329 --> 00:11:01.339
you know gender race national origin
 

00:11:01.339 --> 00:11:03.939
you know gender race national origin
what kind of activities they've been

00:11:03.939 --> 00:11:03.949
what kind of activities they've been
 

00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:06.399
what kind of activities they've been
involved in in the past it really gives

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:06.409
involved in in the past it really gives
 

00:11:06.409 --> 00:11:08.979
involved in in the past it really gives
us the opportunity to think not of

00:11:08.979 --> 00:11:08.989
us the opportunity to think not of
 

00:11:08.989 --> 00:11:12.159
us the opportunity to think not of
having 180 teachers which is how many

00:11:12.159 --> 00:11:12.169
having 180 teachers which is how many
 

00:11:12.169 --> 00:11:14.069
having 180 teachers which is how many
ten your tenure track faculty we have

00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079
ten your tenure track faculty we have
 

00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:17.079
ten your tenure track faculty we have
but if we think of ourselves as having

00:11:17.079 --> 00:11:17.089
but if we think of ourselves as having
 

00:11:17.089 --> 00:11:19.779
but if we think of ourselves as having
three thousand teachers because that's

00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:19.789
three thousand teachers because that's
 

00:11:19.789 --> 00:11:21.969
three thousand teachers because that's
what our student body plus our faculty

00:11:21.969 --> 00:11:21.979
what our student body plus our faculty
 

00:11:21.979 --> 00:11:23.290
what our student body plus our faculty
together so I'm always try

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:23.300
together so I'm always try
 

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.079
together so I'm always try
to stress that we are a learning

00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:26.089
to stress that we are a learning
 

00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:29.110
to stress that we are a learning
community when we talked about building

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120
community when we talked about building
 

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.940
community when we talked about building
our new facility it was never about

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:30.950
our new facility it was never about
 

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.320
our new facility it was never about
we're trying to build a great teaching

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:32.330
we're trying to build a great teaching
 

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.329
we're trying to build a great teaching
facility it was we're trying to create a

00:11:34.329 --> 00:11:34.339
facility it was we're trying to create a
 

00:11:34.339 --> 00:11:37.570
facility it was we're trying to create a
great learning facility by having 3,000

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:37.580
great learning facility by having 3,000
 

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.889
great learning facility by having 3,000
people who really have a teaching burden

00:11:40.889 --> 00:11:40.899
people who really have a teaching burden
 

00:11:40.899 --> 00:11:43.840
people who really have a teaching burden
for the rest of us so those would be too

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:43.850
for the rest of us so those would be too
 

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.759
for the rest of us so those would be too
I guess the third one is you're always

00:11:45.759 --> 00:11:45.769
I guess the third one is you're always
 

00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:48.730
I guess the third one is you're always
trying to attract people who are going

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:48.740
trying to attract people who are going
 

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.889
trying to attract people who are going
to bring ´excitement´ and intellectual

00:11:50.889 --> 00:11:50.899
to bring ´excitement´ and intellectual
 

00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:53.769
to bring ´excitement´ and intellectual
curiosity into our classrooms in our

00:11:53.769 --> 00:11:53.779
curiosity into our classrooms in our
 

00:11:53.779 --> 00:11:56.380

going to marry all of these concepts of

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:55.730
going to marry all of these concepts of
 

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.699
going to marry all of these concepts of
sustainability with the world of finance

00:13:57.699 --> 00:13:57.709
sustainability with the world of finance
 

00:13:57.709 --> 00:14:01.780

and so we said yeah we'll go we'll go

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:01.790
and so we said yeah we'll go we'll go
 

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:03.790
and so we said yeah we'll go we'll go
make that bed and so I think it's the

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:03.800
make that bed and so I think it's the
 

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.369
make that bed and so I think it's the
idea of being willing to do some

00:14:06.369 --> 00:14:06.379
idea of being willing to do some
 

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:08.740

experiments being smart enough to come

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:08.750
experiments being smart enough to come
 

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:10.629
experiments being smart enough to come
back around a couple of years later and

00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639
back around a couple of years later and
 

00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:12.460
back around a couple of years later and
look at the flowers you planted and see

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:12.470
look at the flowers you planted and see
 

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:14.350
look at the flowers you planted and see
whether they're blooming or not but I

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:14.360
whether they're blooming or not but I
 

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:18.780
whether they're blooming or not but I
think to try to create a place that it's

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:18.790

the academic world is great in the sense

00:14:21.999 --> 00:14:22.009
the academic world is great in the sense
 

00:14:22.009 --> 00:14:24.759
the academic world is great in the sense
that you know the the cost of an

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:24.769
that you know the the cost of an
 

00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:27.519
that you know the the cost of an
experiment is fairly low and so we have

00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:27.529
experiment is fairly low and so we have
 

00:14:27.529 --> 00:14:30.100
experiment is fairly low and so we have
to be creating a situation where we're

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:30.110
to be creating a situation where we're
 

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.439
to be creating a situation where we're
going to go try things that you wouldn't

00:14:32.439 --> 00:14:32.449
going to go try things that you wouldn't
 

00:14:32.449 --> 00:14:34.780
going to go try things that you wouldn't
be able to try other places so so I

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:34.790
be able to try other places so so I
 

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.519
be able to try other places so so I
think it's always trying to inject that

00:14:36.519 --> 00:14:36.529
think it's always trying to inject that
 

00:14:36.529 --> 00:14:38.439
think it's always trying to inject that
sense of excitement into the day-to-day

00:14:38.439 --> 00:14:38.449
