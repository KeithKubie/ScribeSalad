00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.440
When you're sitting in Boston with the

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.180
average temperature is 48 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.340
three or four degrees of warming

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.050
in terms of average temperatures, that

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.120
actually sounds nice. But if I told you

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.730
that that corresponds to maybe 10, 20, 30

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.379
more days a year where it gets too hot

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.150
to work outside, then it's suddenly a

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.609
different story. As a student of

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.539
economics, I see climate change as the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.640
ultimate market failure, it's the ultimate

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.160
global public goods problem, so that's

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.240
interesting from the intellectual

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.949
standpoint but probably more importantly

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.130
from a public welfare standpoint, I see

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.860
climate change as probably one of the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.309
defining challenges of my generation.

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.110
We're only beginning to understand the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.379
extent to which changes in climate,

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.640
particularly as they manifest in

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.700
increased extreme events, may affect

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.149
economic welfare, economic productivity.

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.039
Looking at U.S. automobile manufacturing

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.829
plants, a week with six or more days

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.350
above 90 degrees Fahrenheit results in

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.750
roughly eight percent reduction in

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.450
output and, more importantly, that output

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.030
is not made up in later weeks, right, it's not

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.670
like they just work overtime on a

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.100
cooler week to make up for that. There's

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.840
just so much uncertainty involved and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.020
we're trying to make policy on fifty to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.640
a hundred year timescale, something that

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.530
we really haven't done before as a

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.140
civilization. And so being able to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.549
clarify even small catches, right, of the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.409
shroud of uncertainty that surrounds

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.470
this issue is a hugely valuable task

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.540
that places like Harvard are uniquely

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.560
well positioned to tackle.
