00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.250
You may have formed an impression of how animals
think and feel from Disney Movies or documentaries,

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.870
but the reality is startlingly different.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.769
A new study has shown that sheep can recognize
human faces in photos, and can even recognize

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.990
their owner -- because that’s who the sheep
are personally familiar with on a day-to-day

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.990
basis.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.430
And, despite having watched ‘Babe’ many
times as a child, I never thought sheep were

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.650
that smart, so this study made me feel pretty
sheepish!

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.640
In all seriousness, the internal lives of
animals are relatively shrouded in mystery.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.800
The fields of animal behavior and animal cognition
have animals perform certain tests to quantify

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.230
levels of animal logic, reason, and emotion.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.489
For example, in corvids, the bird family that
includes ravens and crows... they’ve found

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.750
some use tools in nature and can improvise
tools in urban environments... some have complex

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.760
problem-solving at at least the level of a
five-year old.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.039
And some play.

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.360
Just for the sheer pleasure of it.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.250
All kinds of animals are now being subjected
to intelligence tests of different kinds--racoons,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.649
bats, bears, bees...you name it.

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.570
But, can we even classify all the different
pathways of communication in our fellow earthlings,

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.630
or do some of them exist outside our realm
of comprehension?

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.690
Do they have individual consciousness, or
even a collective hive mind?

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.690
We don’t know!

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.479
We don’t even know if insects can feel pain!

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.450
We really don’t know a lot.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.460
Take communication for example.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.979
Researchers hypothesize that cetaceans--dolphins
and whales--are capable of communicating and

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.280
receiving 20 times the amount of information
that we can with our hearing.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.750
That also surpasses the amount of information
we can perceive based on vision, which is

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.560
our primary sense.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.060
Not only that, but some scholars think that
because cetaceans can create and process such

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.630
complex sound, they could be capable of sending
auditory images to one another using their

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.180
vocalizations.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.159
A dolphin wants to tell another dolphin about
a fish?

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.110
They might be able to send the image of a
fish to the other animal--through sound.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.750
This is like if I wanted to tell you about
a tree and instead of describing it with my

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.060
words, I was able to use sound to project
a 3D hologram of that tree in front of you

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.380
for you to look at.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.540
It’s NUTS.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.130
They perceive sound as a complex, whole scene,
kind of like us when looking at a painting.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.780
So them trying to understand our language,
which progresses word by word, would be like

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.290
us trying to watch a movie single frame by
single frame.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.400
They even have distinct sounds that act as
names for individuals!!

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.950
Ok, I’m getting too excited.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.130
Am I crazy or does this sound like the plot
of ‘Arrival’ to anyone else?

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.980
Of course, this doesn’t mean they’re sentient,
but if it’s this hard to understand communication

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.230
-- how can we assess the hidden beauty of
their cognition?!

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.700
We, as humans, are arguably the smartest species
out there...but that’s by our own measure,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.820
limited by our ability to only frame the questions
we know how to ask.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.099
I mean we don’t even fully understand our
own brains, much less the way a whale’s

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.099
works.

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.400
We’re limited by our own senses, by the
tools that we create to measure and explore

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.250
the world, and by our inevitably human-centric
version of the universe...because, well, we’re

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.360
the ones looking at it.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.360
So.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.650
Will we ever understand what it’s like to
live life as another species?

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.030
Mayyyybeee?

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.920
The next time you see a sheep staring, seemingly
vacantly, in your direction...maybe wave.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.920
Say hi.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.920
Make a friend.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.409
And don’t assume you know what’s going
on in it’s head.

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:18.430
Hi fellow animals!

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.390
If you want more awesome animal knowledge,
bees just might be on the up and up!

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.310
Trace has got the knowledge for you right
here.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.170
One last thing, if you’re ever swimming
near a dolphin, they can use their sonar to

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.860
communicate with each other, but also to ‘see’
inside your body because the noises they make

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.709
are a basically the same thing as an ultrasound.

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:36.709
Creepy?

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:37.709
Or insanely cool?

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:38.330
Thanks for watching Seeker.
