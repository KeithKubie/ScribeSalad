00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.550
 

00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.400
Hey, everyone.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.730
Welcome back.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.970
Today, we're going to do another
fun problem that has

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.830
to do with a random number
of coin flips.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.340
So the experiment we're going
to run is as follows.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.300
We're given a fair six-sided
die, and we roll it.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.240
And then we take a fair coin,
and we flip it the number of

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.640
times indicated by the die.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.520
That is to say, if I roll a four
on my die, then I flip

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.700
the coin four times.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.160
And then we're interested in
some statistics regarding the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.820
number of heads that show
up in our sequence.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.730
In particular, we want to
compute the expectation and

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.460
the variance of the number
of heads that we see.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.310
So the first step of this
problem is to translate the

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.660
English to the math.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.540
So we have to define
some notation.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.250
I went ahead and did
that for us.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.170
I defined n to be the outcome
of the die role.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.830
Now, since we flip the coin the
number of times shown by

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.830
the die roll, n is equivalently
the number of

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.840
flips that we perform.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.990
And n, of course, is a random
variable, and I've written its

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.599
PMF up here.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.100
So Pn of n is just a discrete
uniform random variable

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.610
between 1 and 6, because we're
told that the die has six

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.790
sides and that it's fair.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.990
Now, I also defined h
to be the number of

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.440
heads that we see.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.000
So that's the quantity
of interest.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.600
And it turns out that Bernoulli
random variables

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.260
will be very helpful to
us in this problem.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.820
So I defined x sub i as
1 if the ith flip is

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.010
heads, and 0 otherwise.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.440
And what we're going to do now
is, we're going to use these x

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.920
sub i's to come up with
an expression for h.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.010
So if you want to count the
number of heads, one possible

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.990
thing you could do is start with
0 and then look at the

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.470
first coin flip.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.990
If it's heads, you add 1 to 0,
which I'm going to call your

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.270
running sum.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.020
If the first flip is
tails, you add 0.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.230
And similarly, after that, after
every trial, if you see

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.270
heads, you add 1 to
your running sum.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.590
If you see a tails, you add 0.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.440
And in that way, we can
precisely compute h.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.090
So the mathematical statement of
what I just said is that h

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.650
is equal to x1 plus x2
plus x3, all the way

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.280
through x sub n.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.170
So now, we are interested
in computing e of h, the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.150
expectation of h.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.280
So your knee jerk reaction might
be to say, oh, well, by

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.760
linearity of expectation,
we know that this is an

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.710
expectation of x1, et cetera
through the expectation of xn.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.000
But in this case, you would
actually be wrong.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.710
Don't do that.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.110
And the reason that this is not
going to work for us is

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.250
because we're dealing
with a random

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.600
number of random variables.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.050
So each xi is a random
variable.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.600
And we have capital n of them.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.240
But capital n is a
random variable.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.720
It denotes the outcome
of our die roll.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.100
So we actually cannot just
take the sum of these

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.420
expectations.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.790
Instead, we're going to have
to condition on n and use

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.080
iterated expectation.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.630
So this is the mathematical
statement of what I just said.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.390
And the reason why this works
is because conditioning on n

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.970
will take us to the case that
we already know how to deal

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.540
with, where we have a known
number of random variables.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.460
And of course, iterated
expectations holds, as you saw

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.360
in lecture.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.310
I will briefly mention here that
the formula we're going

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.620
to derive is derived
in the book.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.270
And it was probably derived
in lecture.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.850
So if you want, you can just
go to that formula

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:55.790
immediately.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.730
But I think the derivation of
the formula that we need is

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.760
quick and is helpful.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.010
So I'm going to go through
it quickly.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.060
 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.440
Let's do it over here.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.650
Plugging in our running
sum for h, we get this

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.670
expression--

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:20.010
x1 plus x2 et cetera plus
xn, conditioned on n.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.940
And this, of course,
is n times the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.830
expectation of x sub i.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.890
So again, I'm going through
this quickly,

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.420
because it's in the book.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.560
But this step holds, because
each of these xi's have the

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.410
same statistics.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.900
They're all Bernoulli with
parameter of 1/2, because our

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.840
coin is fair.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.660
And so I used x sub i to say it
doesn't really matter which

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.317
integer you pick for i, because
the expectation of xi

00:04:52.317 --> 00:04:55.470
is the same for all i.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.360
So this now, the expectation
of x sub i, this is just a

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.020
number, it's just some constant,
so you can pull it

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.860
out of the expectation.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.310
So you get the expectation
of x sub i times the

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.970
expectation of n.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.540
So I gave away the answer
to this a second ago.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.360
But x sub i is just a Bernoulli
random variable with

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.400
parameter of success of 1/2.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.130
And we know already that the
expectation of such a random

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.680
variable is just p, or 1/2.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.860
So this is 1/2 times
expectation of n.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.720
And now n we know is a discrete

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.900
uniform random variable.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.510
And there's a formula that I'm
going to use, which hopefully

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.270
some of you may remember.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.930
If you have a discrete uniform
random variable that takes on

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.605
values between a and b--

00:05:49.605 --> 00:05:53.350
 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.640
let's use w--

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.960
if you call this random variable
w, then we have that

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.890
the variance of w is equal to b
minus a times b minus a plus

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.310
2 divided by 12.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.620
So that's the variance.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.630
We don't actually need the
variance, but we will need

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.570
this later.

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.470
And the expectation of w--

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.520
actually, let's just
do it up here right

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.000
ahead for this problem.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.930
Because we have a discrete
uniform random variable, the

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.980
expectation is just
the middle.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.780
So you agree hopefully that the
middle is right at 3.5,

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.020
which is also 7/2.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:34.330
So this is times 7/2, which
is equal to 7/4.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.140
 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.550
So we are done with
part of part a.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.915
I'm going to write this answer
over here, so I can erase.

00:06:42.915 --> 00:06:47.260
 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.810
And we're going to do something
very similar to

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:51.930
compute the variance.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.810
To compute the variance,
we are going to also

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:55.840
condition on n.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.320
So we get rid of this source
of randomness.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.830
And then we're going to use law
of total variance, which

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.050
you've also seen in lecture.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.800
And again, the formula
for this variance is

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.030
derived in the book.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.770
So I'm going to go through
it quickly.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.690
But make sure you understand
this derivation, because it

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.350
exercises a lot of stuff
we taught you.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.840
So this, just using law of
total variance, is the

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.880
variance of expectation of h
given n, plus the expectation

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.540
of the variance of h given n.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.470
And now, plugging in
this running sum

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:42.520
for h, you get this.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.490
It's a mouthful to write.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.860
Bear with me.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.780
x1 through xn given n--

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.020
so I didn't do anything fancy.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.040
I just plugged this into here.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.680
So this term is similar
to what we saw

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.230
in a previous problem.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.490
By linearity of expectation and
due to the fact that all

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.190
of the x i's are distributed in
the same way, they have the

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.130
same expectation, this
becomes n times the

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:14.940
expectation of x sub i.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.800
And let's do this
term over here.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.680
This term--

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.860
well, conditioned on
n, this n is known.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.650
So we essentially have
a finite known sum of

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.830
independent random variables.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.490
We know that the variance of
a sum of independent random

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.409
variables is the sum
of the variances.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:38.909
So this is the variance of x1
plus the variance of x2 et

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:42.620
cetera, plus the
variance of xn.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.980
And furthermore, again, because
all of these xi's have

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.780
the same distribution, the
variance is the same.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:52.710
So we can actually write this
as n times the variance of x

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.120
sub i, where x sub i
just corresponds

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.250
to one of the trials.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.290
It doesn't matter which one,
because they all have the same

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.430
variance and expectation.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.720
So now, we're almost
home free.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.000
This is just some scaler.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.300
So we can take it out of
the variance, but we

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.840
have to square it.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.100
So this becomes expectation
of xi squared times

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.260
the variance of n.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.480
And then this variance is also
just a scalar, so we can take

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.440
it outside.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.940
So then we get variance of x sub
i times expectation of n.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.920
Now, we know that the
expectation of x sub i is just

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.810
the probability of success,
which is 1/2.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:37.430
So we have 1/2 squared, or 1/4,
times the variance of n.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.950
So that's where this formula
comes in handy.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:45.170
b is equal to 6, a
is equal to 1.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:50.210
So we get that the variance
of n is equal to 5 times--

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:52.360
and then 5 plus 2 is 7--

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.160
divided by 12.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.540
So this is just a formula from
the book that you guys

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.400
hopefully remember.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.510
So we get 35/12.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.370
 

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:05.940
And then the variance of xi,
we know the variance of a

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.370
Bernoulli random variable is
just p times 1 minus p.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:14.270
So in our case, that's 1/2
times 1/2, which is 1/4.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.400
So we get 1/4.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.280
And then the expectation of n,
we remember from our previous

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.070
computation, is just 7/2.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:25.990
So I will let you guys do this
arithmetic on your own time.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.900
But the answer comes
out to be 77/48.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.760
 

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.020
So I will go ahead and put
our answer over here--

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.880
77/48--

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.130
so that I can erase.

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.490
 

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.050
So I want you guys to
start thinking about

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.520
part b while I erase.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.330
Essentially, you do the same
experiment that we did in part

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:54.840
a, except now we use two
dice instead of one.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.690
So in part b, just to repeat,
you now have two dice.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.510
You roll them.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.600
You look at the outcome.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.220
If you have an outcome of four
on one die and six on another

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.040
die, then you flip the
coin 10 times.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.880
So it's the same exact
experiment.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.920
We're interested in the number
of heads we want the

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.400
expectation and the variance.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.040
But this step is now a
little bit different.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.380
 

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:24.560
Again, let's approach this by
defining some notation first.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:30.780
Now, I want to let n1 be the
outcome of the first die.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.200
 

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.450
And then you can let n2 be the
outcome of the second die.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:45.010
 

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:46.900
And we'll start with
just that.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:51.240
So one way you could approach
this problem is say, OK, if n1

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:54.690
is the outcome of my first die
and n2 is the outcome of my

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.720
second die, then the number of
coin flips that I'm going to

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.250
make is n1 plus n2.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:03.460
 

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.650
This is the total coin flips.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.570
 

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:12.830
So you could just repeat the
same exact math that we did in

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:17.610
part a, except everywhere that
you see an n, you replace that

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:20.850
n with n1 plus n2.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.730
So that will get you to your
answer, but it will require

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.400
slightly more work.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.590
We're going to think about
this problem slightly

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.510
differently.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:33.430
So the way we are thinking about
it just now, we roll two

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:35.040
dice at the same time.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.630
We add the results
of the die rolls.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:43.560
And then we flip the coin
that number of times.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:48.540
But another way you can think
about this is, you roll one

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.380
die, and then you flip the coin
the number of times shown

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.990
by that die and count
the number of heads.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:57.410
And then you take the second
die and you roll it.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:02.960
And then you flip the coin that
many more times and count

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.600
the number of heads
after that.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:16.140
So you could define h1 to be
number of heads in the first

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.035
n1 coin flips.

00:13:18.035 --> 00:13:21.670
 

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:29.940
And you could just let h2 be
the number of heads in the

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:34.620
last n2 coin flips.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:38.320
So hopefully that terminology
is not confusing you.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.990
Essentially, what I'm saying
is, n1 plus n2 means you'll

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:51.082
have n1 flips, followed by
n2 flips, for a total

00:13:51.082 --> 00:13:53.330
of n1 plus n2 flips.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.300
And then within the first n1
flips, you can get some number

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.390
of heads, which we're
calling h1.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:02.200
And in the last n2 flips, you
can get some number of heads,

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.340
which is h2.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.400
So the total number of heads
that we get at the end--

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.351
I'm going to call it h star--

00:14:10.351 --> 00:14:14.590
is equal to h1 plus h2.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:17.370
And what part b is really
asking us for is the

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:22.200
expectation of h star and
the variance of h star.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.406
But here's where something
really beautiful happens.

00:14:26.406 --> 00:14:31.220
h1 and h2 are independent,
and they are

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.000
statistically the same.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.760
So the reason why they're
independent is because--

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.200
well, first of all, all of our
coin flips are independent.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.560
And they're statistically the
same, because the experiment

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.650
is exactly the same.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.110
And everything's independent.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:52.940
So instead of imagining one
person rolling two die and

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.390
then summing the outcomes and
flipping a coin that many

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:58.670
times and counting heads, you
can imagine one person takes

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.720
one die and goes
into one room.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.710
A second person takes a
second die and goes

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.500
into another room.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.100
They run their experiments.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.520
Then they report back
to a third person

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.930
the number of heads.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:13.460
And that person adds them
together to get h star.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.660
And in that scenario, everything
is very clearly

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.560
independent.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.330
So the expectation of h star--

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.560
you actually don't need
independence for this part,

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.580
because linearly of expectation
always holds.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:31.450
But you get the expectation of
h1 plus the expectation of h2.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:35.200
And because these guys are
statistically equivalent, this

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.700
is just two times the
expectation of h.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.840
And the expectation of h we
calculated in part a.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:47.760
So this is 2 times 7 over 4.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.670
Now, for the variance,
here's where the

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:50.930
independence comes in.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:54.238
I'm actually going to write this
somewhere where I don't

00:15:54.238 --> 00:15:55.200
have to bend over.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:00.690
So the variance of h star is
equal to the variance of h1

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.820
plus the variance of
h2 by independence.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.020
And that's equal to 2 times
the variance of h, because

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.740
they are statistically
the same.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.810
And the variance of h
we computed already.

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:18.650
So this is just 2 times
77 over 48.

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:23.390
So the succient answer to part
b is that both the mean and

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:28.830
the variance double from part
A. So hopefully you guys

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:30.060
enjoyed this problem.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.510
We covered a bunch of things.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:37.870
So we saw how to deal with
having a random number of

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:38.830
random variables.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.840
Usually we have a fixed number
of random variables.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.670
In this problem, the number of
random variables we were

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.350
adding together was
itself random.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.410
So to handle that, we
conditioned on n.

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:53.110
And to compute expectation, we
use iterated expectation.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:57.450
To compute variance, we used
law of total variance.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:03.020
And then in part b, we were
just a little bit clever.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:07.270
We thought about how can we
reinterpret this experiment to

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:08.859
reduce computation.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:12.869
And we realized that part b is
essentially two independent

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:14.150
trials of part a.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.900
So both the mean and the
variance should double.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.567
