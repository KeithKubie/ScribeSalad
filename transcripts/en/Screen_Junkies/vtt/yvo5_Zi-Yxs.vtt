00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.449
Prepare for the final installment of the Twilight
franchise

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.039
that tweens and lonely moms have been waiting
for,

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.000
and that dads could not care less about

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.810
Twilight: Breaking Dawn (Parts 1 &amp; 2)

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.739
The tedious book that was turned into two
bloated movies just to squeeze more money

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.230
from gullible women.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.090
Featuring the wedding that attempts to justify
the franchise's creepy

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.690
pedophilia.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.129
Because remember, he's like a hundred years
old and she's still a

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:43.199
teenager.

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:49.600
And the honeymoon where Mouth Breather and
Shovel Face finally have sex...

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.569
only to immediately get pregnant.

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:53.249
"I'm late."

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:57.600
Prompting the pro-life message that abortion
is never okay...

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.739
"The fetus isn't good for Bella."

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.809
"Say the word, Alice: 'baby'."

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:08.150
even when a monster vampire baby tries to
eat itself out of its mother's womb.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.570
"Ahhhhhh!"

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.479
And creating an awful new baby name for an
entire generation of Teen

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:14.240
Moms.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.010
"Renesmee."

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.770
"Renesmee."

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.070
"Is he weird?"

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.070
Witness, Teen Wolf finally getting over Dead
Eyes by instead falling in love with her creepy

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.600
CGI baby.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.180
"So should I start calling you dad?"

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.770
"No."

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.360
Gross.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.600
But when Mouthbreather nearly dies during
childbirth, Shovel Face

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.750
must transform her from a human who can't
act...

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.320
"Why can't you see how perfectly happy I am?"

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.170
to a vampire who can't act.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.450
"You nicknamed my daughter after the Lochness
monster!?"

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.980
Honestly, even the movie had to teach her
how to act human.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.030
"Blink at least three times a minute."

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.900
"Good."

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.440
Brace yourself, for two movies so unnecessarily
long, that they include

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.270
five Volvo commercials

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.770
two montages of the previous Twilight movies

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.820
four games of chess

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.450
and the most

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.940
stares

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.940
ever.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.750
Like seriously, ever... we counted.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.390
Suffer through four hours of painfully stupid
characters,

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.760
like this pack of dogs who bark English

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.520
The Cullens, who spend every movie standing
around watching people

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.400
A grandfather who doesn't notice that his
own grandaughter has aged

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.319
eight years over the course of a few months.

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:08.020
And Kristen Stewart, and her inability to
use toothpaste.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.680
Filmmaking so lazy that vampires no longer
sparkle even in direct sunlight

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.540
Sex ed is done through Yahoo searches

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.220
And the ultimate climax of all five movies...

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.000
...was all a dream.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.340
"That's your future."

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.330
...what a ripoff.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.010
Starring...

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.230
Shovel Face

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.530
Skeletor

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.870
Taylor Swift

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.200
Ron Burgundy

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.510
North Dakota

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.360
and Snow Dogs.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.080
Twilight: Breaking Dawn

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.470
So he's gonna have to live with Kristen
Stewart forever? I'd rather get my head

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.150
ripped off.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.790
Hey, why not do us a solid and revisit all
4 Twilight trailers.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.790
I'll be your best friend!
