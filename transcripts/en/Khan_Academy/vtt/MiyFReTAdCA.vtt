00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.840
A pool table is 1
meter by 2 meters.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.920
So this is 1 meter-- let me
label that-- so this distance

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.870
right over here is 1 meter.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.076
This distance right
over here is 2 meters.

00:00:12.076 --> 00:00:13.450
That's 2 meters
right over there.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.630
There are 6 pockets total, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4 in the corners

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.330
and 2 at the midpoints of
each of the 2-meter sides,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.860
or the midpoints of
each 2-meter side.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.470
A cue ball is placed
0.25, or a quarter meter,

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.490
from the north wall and
a quarter meter away

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.290
from the west wall, so
this right over here,

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.920
this distance right over here.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.390
So it's a quarter meter
away from the north wall.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.820
So this is 1/4 meter.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.750
And this distance right over
here is also 1/4 of a meter.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.690
So that's that distance,
that's that distance.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.060
From the west wall.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.220
The angles formed as the
ball approaches and deflects

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.930
form a mirror image
of each other.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.185
So this is as we approach,
and then we deflect.

00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:06.030
And they're mirror images.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.470
So if we were to draw-- if
we could imagine a mirror

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.520
right over there--
we see that they

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.200
are mirror images of each other.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.100
At what distance
x-- so then they

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.330
labeled x right over here--
from the southeast corner

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.770
should the cue ball hit
the east wall-- so this

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.160
is the distance from
the southeast corner--

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.120
so the cue ball
sinks into the pocket

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.700
at the midpoint
of the south wall?

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.650
And I encourage you
to pause the video.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.010
And I'll give you one hint.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.060
It might involve
similar triangles.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.570
So let's try to work it through.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.960
So a big clue is that the
approach and the deflection,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.540
that they're going to be
mirror images of each other.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.800
So if they're mirror
images, this angle

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.900
is going to be
congruent to that angle.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.000
If those two angles
are congruent,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.590
then this angle,
which is complementary

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.750
to that black angle, must
be equal to this angle.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.680
Each of these are going to be 90
degrees minus that black angle

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.830
right over there.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.890
So you have this angle is
congruent to that angle.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.290
And now we can construct
two right triangles.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.100
So you can imagine one up
here, this is the larger one.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:28.730
So imagine this is our approach
right triangle right over here.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.110
So the top of it is parallel
to the side of the pool table.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.080
And then this is our deflection
right triangle right over here.

00:02:39.216 --> 00:02:41.840
And the whole reason why I show
that these two green angles are

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.520
going to be congruent is to show
that these two triangles are

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.440
similar to each other.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.280
How do we know they're similar?

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.904
Well, if you have
two angles, they both

00:02:49.904 --> 00:02:52.650
have a 90 degree angle, and
they both have this green angle,

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.620
so that means that the third
angle must also be the same.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.090
If you know two angles, you know
what the third angle has to be.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.340
If two corresponding angles
of two different triangles

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.730
are congruent,
then the triangles

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.250
are going to be similar.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.360
So this top triangle is similar
to this bottom triangle.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.860
And what that helps
us is that means

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.340
that the ratio of the lengths
of corresponding parts

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.660
of those triangles are
going to be the same.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.460
So for example, we've already
said that this distance-- let's

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.470
figure out what we know
about these triangles--

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.670
so that distance is x.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.610
Now, what is this
distance right over here?

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.640
What is this distance right
over here going to be?

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.330
Well, let's think
about it a little bit.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.000
We know that this distance
is 1/4 of a meter.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.230
We know that this entire
distance is 1 meter.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.430
So this distance
right-- let me do

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.950
this in a color you can see--
this distance right over here

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.770
is going to be 3/4 of a meter.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.620
And so if this distance
is 3/4 of a meter,

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.280
then this part
right over here is

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.877
going to be 3/4 minus x meters.

00:04:05.877 --> 00:04:06.960
So let me write that down.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.590
3/4 minus x is this
magenta length.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.420
And what else do we know?

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.380
Well, we definitely
know the length

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.350
of this segment right over here.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.329
We know that the pockets
are 1 meter apart,

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.570
so that is 1 meter.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.150
And we also know the length of
this segment right over here.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.560
We know that this is 1 meter
and that this is another 3/4

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.246
of a meter.

00:04:34.246 --> 00:04:37.185
This whole distance right
over here is 1 and 3/4 meters.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.992
Or we could write
that as 7/4 meters.

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:45.200
So let me write it like this.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.267
This is 7/4.

00:04:46.267 --> 00:04:48.350
I like to write everything
as an improper fraction

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.725
because I have a
feeling that I'm

00:04:49.725 --> 00:04:52.240
going to have to do
some ratios in a second.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.060
So corresponding parts of these
triangles-- these two triangles

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.596
are similar, so
corresponding parts

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:57.970
are going to have
the same ratio.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.650
So for example, this green
segment right over here,

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.970
this is the longer
side that's not

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.840
the hypotenuse of this
top right triangle.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.480
That's going to correspond
to the longer side that's

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.980
not the hypotenuse
of this triangle.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.490
The sides that are
opposite this green angle,

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.190
they correspond to each other.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.730
So we could say that
the ratio of 7/4 to 1,

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:20.350
the ratio of 7/4
meters to 1 meter,

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.210
is going to be equal to
the ratio of the sides that

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.330
are opposite the magenta angles.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:35.250
So it's going to be equal
to 3/4 minus x to x.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.830
I'm just showing that the
ratio of corresponding parts

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.940
are the same.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.880
So let's now just solve for x.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.970
So let's see, if we
multiply both sides of this

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:58.930
by x, on the left hand
side, we end up with 7/4 x.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:05.810
And on the right hand side,
we're left with 3/4 minus x.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.090
Well, now we can add
an x to both sides.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.600
And we're going to get
7/4 x plus another 4/4 x

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:20.192
is going to give us
11/4 x is equal to 3/4.

00:06:20.192 --> 00:06:21.650
And now to solve
for x, we can just

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.590
multiply both sides times the
reciprocal of its coefficient,

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.510
so times 4/11.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:36.070
This is going to give us that
x is equal to 3/11 of a meter.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:41.980
So if we hit 3/11 of a meter
above the southeast corner

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:47.659
of this wall, then we should
hit this pocket right over here.
