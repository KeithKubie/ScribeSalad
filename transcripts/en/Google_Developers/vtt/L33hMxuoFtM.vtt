00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:02.740
Are you a developer
who also gets

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:04.790
asked to create
Google Forms regularly

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.650
or who has a coworker who does?

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.031
Wish you could use your coding
skills to automate this?

00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:11.030
Well, you're in the right
place, as this DevByte

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:12.330
was made just for you.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.000
Welcome to the Launchpad Online.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.764
I'm your host, Wesley Chun.

00:00:15.764 --> 00:00:17.180
If you've ever
created a form, you

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.770
know it's a great
tool for conducting

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.380
a survey at the
office or building

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.670
a quiz for your students.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.160
Within its editor,
you can choose

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.720
from a variety of
question options

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.090
like multiple choice, text
field, or a linear scale.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.510
But while you can create
one, five, or even

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.560
10 forms this way,
editing each one by hand

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.630
doesn't scale if you need to
create hundreds or thousands.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.640
So there must be a better way.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.010
That way is a developer tool
called Google Apps Script,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.900
which lets you build JavaScript
apps hosted in the cloud that

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.129
interact with Google Apps data
and other Google services.

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.670
Check out the link
to the intro video

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.879
if you're new to Apps Script.

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.169
In a moment, we're going to
look at how Apps Script can

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:54.560
be used to create forms
in bulk programmatically

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.990
to save you the time of
building them manually.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.470
The source is available from
the post at the link you see.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.390
So if you want to code with
me, copy it to your clipboard.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.424
The most interesting
thing about the code

00:01:05.424 --> 00:01:07.090
is that it's the first
one we're looking

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.740
at that's not bound to a Google
Sheet or any other document.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.280
Let's go to the
computer now and see

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.280
how to create these
standalone scripts.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.660
There are two ways of
creating standalone scripts.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.710
The first is by going
to your Google Drive

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.020
and then selecting
New, More, and then

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.940
Google Apps Script, if
it's in your pull-down.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.430
If not, then click
on Connect More Apps.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.100
Once the search
bar comes up, you

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.760
can type Google Apps
Script, select Connect,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.690
and once it's at it,
you'll see this dialog box,

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.880
and then the connect
button turns green.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.840
So you can close it.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.660
Now you can do it again:
New, More, and then

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.700
Google Apps Script.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.520
So that's one way of doing it.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.730
Another way of doing
it is to just go up

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.550
to the address bar in
your browser and type

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.300
script.google.com.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.990
And this just creates
a blank project

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.020
and drops you straight
into the editor.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.770
So all we have to do
here is take the code

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.120
that you copied earlier and
just paste it directly in here.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.980
So walking through
the source, we

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.720
can see that we're creating a
form for conference speakers

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.060
to fill out their
talk information, bio,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.590
and preferences.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.100
The first step is
to create the form.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.240
And the way to do this
is with FormApp.create.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.560
Provide the required name, which
we call Speaker Information

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.740
Form here, and
optionally setting it

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.810
as a title, which we do here.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.630
Once you have a form,
all you need to do

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.920
is add fields the
user should fill out.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.920
So the first field is a
single-line text item,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.740
which you can add to the
form with Add Text Item.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.310
Set Title will add
the name of that item,

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.120
so you can see it on
the form, and then

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.140
we're going to require our
users to enter this field.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.100
So that's why we call
Set Required with True.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.350
If you want to give
users multiple lines,

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.750
instead of Add Text Item, you
would use Add Paragraph Text

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.560
Item.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.710
If you want users to choose
from one out of multiple items,

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.200
AKA radio buttons,
create a JavaScript array

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.520
with all the choices, then
call Add Multiple Choice item,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.410
then call Set Choice
Values with your array

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.800
so that users actually get
presented with those choices.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.820
Finally, if instead
you want check boxes

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.610
where users can select
one or more options,

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.020
you still create an
array with their choices.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.620
But you would call
Add Checkbox Item.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.340
And in this last
case, we are not

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.540
going to require the
users enter this,

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.600
so we leave the
Set Required off.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.750
Or you could also call
Set Required with False,

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.640
but that's not necessary.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.340
Once you're done, save
it, call it something

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.980
like Conference Speaker Info.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:40.480
All right.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.190
So that's done.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.850
So let's run it.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:43.350
All right.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.280
Now that's running.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.520
The first thing you see is the
OAuth 2 dialog, as you expect.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.560
So the dialog just
requests permission

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.890
to access our Google Drive.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.060
In other words, it needs to
create this form in your Google

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.320
Drive account.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.870
And so we want to allow that.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.880
So once you click
Allow, OAuth succeeds.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.120
Once the execution
bar disappears,

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.530
go to your Google Drive, and
there's our speaker information

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.030
form.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.730
Let's click on it.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.030
And here's our form, which you
can continue editing from here.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.990
Or you can click View
Live Form to actually see

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.510
the form that users
will get presented with.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.890
So you've created a form
with four user input fields,

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.430
all in just 13 lines of
code, which of course we

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.360
broke out into many more lines
to make it more readable.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.610
And then one last thing
that you need to do

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.530
is actually assign
a spreadsheet that

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.390
will take all the data for users
when they fill out the form.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.300
And you can do that
directly from the form

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.205
by clicking on View
Responses, or you

00:04:39.205 --> 00:04:41.330
can either choose to create
a brand-new spreadsheet

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.530
or create a new sheet in
an existing spreadsheet.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.990
So this is how you
would do it in the UI.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.940
But if you wanted to
do everything in code,

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.400
at the very bottom after you've
created your form and all

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.390
the fields, you would just
make another calltoform.set

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.750
destination and
point to the sheet

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.600
where the responses
should be held.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.650
Once you do that, all
the form responses

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.590
will go into that
sheet, and you're done.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.415
Looking for even
more of a challenge?

00:05:05.415 --> 00:05:06.790
Well, your next
mission is to put

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.590
the data for
multiple Google Forms

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.110
in a Google Sheet, a Doc, or
even an external database,

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.420
then enhance our code
snippet to read in that data

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.250
and auto-generate those forms.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.670
Let me know how you do
in the comments below.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.700
The link on screen shows one
example of what you can do.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.050
Where do you go from here?

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.220
The first link takes you
to the Apps Script docs

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.730
where you can see an easier
example of creating a Google

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.250
form programmatically.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.140
If you took my
challenge a moment ago

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.050
and want to create an even more
advanced forms example that

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.270
uses Sheets, Docs, Calendar,
and Gmail, go to the next link.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.910
Finally, the resources
at the bottom

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.650
will point you to more episodes
in this and other developer

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.940
series.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.770
So we know Google Forms is a
great tool for building surveys

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.550
and quizzes, but
it's not scalable

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.790
if you have to
create lots of forms.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.104
By letting Google Apps Script
do all the heavy lifting,

00:05:53.104 --> 00:05:55.520
you're no longer constrained,
because you can write an app

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.555
to auto-generate them.

00:05:57.555 --> 00:05:58.930
Hope you learned
something today,

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.860
and don't forget to
subscribe to our channel.

see you the next time
on the Launchpad Online.
