00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.278
Since we factored the numerator, we can see that we have a common factor of x

00:00:03.278 --> 00:00:07.742
plus 5 in both the top and the bottom here. So, if we cancelled that out, the

00:00:07.742 --> 00:00:12.234
only factor that's left is x minus 2 in the numerator. That means f of x

00:00:12.234 --> 00:00:17.050
reduces to just x minus 2. Of course keeping in mind that x is not allowed to

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.038
equal negative 5. Now on our graph when x equals negative 5, we're just going

00:00:21.038 --> 00:00:25.705
to see a tiny little point size brick, that's all this domain restriction does.

00:00:25.705 --> 00:00:29.173
It's pretty amazing considering what a complicated function we started out with

00:00:29.173 --> 00:00:33.911
to see that it reduces to just x minus 2, something linear. Rational functions

00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:35.390
are very fascinating.
