00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:05.940
So health care, in the U.S. anyway, is clearly
more of a sick care system then a health care

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.469
system. We wait until people get quite ill
then we try to pull them back.. And we need

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.860
to change our focus towards prevention. Some
og the underprivileged are leading the human

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.680
genome project. I think we have something
to offer here because the study of genetic

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.489
variations that play a role in disease risk
is happening all around us. It's a day luge

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:34.640
of information. And that should provide the
opportunity to practice prevention much more

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.930
effectively because it should be done as an
individual activity instead of a generic one

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.720
size fits all. So my hope would be, in this
health care reform that we're getting in to,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.020
we will focus more on prevention to try and
reduce health care cost, and we will empower

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.530
people to have information about themselves
that is actionable, that they can use in a

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.720
fashion that's not so generic but specific
with them to focus on staying healthy. And

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.750
that might be by knowing what your risks were,
and then adjusting, diet, exercise, medical

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.180
surveillance, all of those things. To do what's
right for you, might not be right for the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.320
next guy, but it's right for you and have
a chance at living a long life without chronic

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.860
illnesses or premature terrible things like
cancer or heart disease or stroke. And that's

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.010
a big picture but I think if we invests ourselves
in research and policy decisions we ought

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.360
to be able to get there.
