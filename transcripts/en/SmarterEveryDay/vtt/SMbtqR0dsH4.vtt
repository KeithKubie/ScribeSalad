(Destin) That's crazy. Man ants do some of the craziest stuff.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.140
It's like a Ouija board that's a worm.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.230
You gonna get a shot of it?

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.430
How you gonna get this worm down the hole?
(Man) Easy.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.570
hole, if you're an ant.
