00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.777
So now that we've talked about what
polynomials are, and seen a few examples

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:07.633
of them, which of these expressions are
not polynomials? Notice I want you to

00:00:07.645 --> 00:00:11.331
check the ones that are not polynomials,
not the ones that are polynomials.

00:00:11.422 --> 00:00:15.457
Remember the three requirements that an
expression must fit in order to count as a

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.604
polynomial. I have listed them right here
in case you need to check. And if you have

00:00:19.616 --> 00:00:23.676
trouble with this just go back and watch
the last video to refresh yourself on what

00:00:23.688 --> 00:00:23.693
apolynomial is. Goodluck.
