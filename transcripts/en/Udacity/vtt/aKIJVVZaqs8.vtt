00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.400
So, Joanna, I notice here that besides the

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.100
actual allelic composition, I, I see learn more about

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.270
sort of lactace persistence. And it says marker

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.020
r s and it has some, some number here.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.390
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.650
&gt;&gt; now if I click on that number it

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.540
takes me, it, it tells me that it's a snip,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.790
which we all know is in our course an snv

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.420
and it gives me this number. What is this number?

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.350
&gt;&gt; So that's the snv id.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.482
It's also called an rs id and it's a

00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:30.420
a way for everyone to have a shared understanding of

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.490
how to name a particular SNV. They're each of, each

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.830
SNV is given a name that starts with RS, and

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.870
then has a long string of numbers. So, why don't

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.170
you click on that. And what we find, if we

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.280
click on the, the RSID, is we find that it's

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.250
on chromosome two, and it's in or near a gene

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.250
called MCM6. and that the versions, the two alleles that

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.870
one can have are A and G, which we've discussed previously. And here, again,

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.209
we see that Matt's genotype for this SNP is AA.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.520
I think. let's know that you don't get anything more if you click further.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.738
&gt;&gt; So can there be SNP's that have more than two possible options

00:01:15.738 --> 00:01:18.020
at that position. Here, I, I, I see that most of the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.610
SNP's we look at have sort of two letters, two possible or reals.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.850
Are there SNP's where there are more. There are cases where there

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.215
are three different versions or alleles, but most of them just have two

00:01:29.215 --> 00:01:30.706
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:30.706 --> 00:01:33.830
&gt;&gt; If I wanted to find out more information about this particular.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.190
&gt;&gt; SNP with this sort of RSID.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.430
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.010
&gt;&gt; Right here, where could I go?

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.960
&gt;&gt; There are a couple of databases that have more information And one is

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:49.060
called dbSNP. And dbSNP is really a list of all known SNPs or

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.400
SNVs and and it's a place where people share information about SNVs.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.540
the other resource. If you want to learn more about a particular SMV is to go to

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.360
SNPedia. So, SNPedia is a wiki where lots of scientists,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.210
put information regarding particular SMVs. you know, what

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.760
is known about. how they shape human variation.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.550
&gt;&gt; This means that I could actually type in the allele.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.120
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.080
&gt;&gt; For lactate persistence.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.410
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.860
&gt;&gt; Here that we just learned about.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.510
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.440
&gt;&gt; And it pulls up this page and it gives me

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.760
tons of information about it here. Sort of in a Wikipedia format.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.580
&gt;&gt; Right.
