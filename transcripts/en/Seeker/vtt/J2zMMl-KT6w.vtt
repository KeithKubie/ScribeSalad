00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:12.150
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Dollar Shave Club

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.150
Hair is weird.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.150
We have it all over our bodies and we just...

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.150
SHORE IT OFF.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.150
What if we could USE it for something OTHER
than... wait...

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.150
Hey hairy peeps, Trace here for DNews -- hair
is everywhere.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.270
Heads, legs, arms, backs, butts, feet, faces....
and in the West we really like to shave it

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.380
off, which is fine.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.130
It's a personal choice, grooming is important
in ANY society, even insects!

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.689
My question is, once you've liberated your
luscious locks from your skin, where does

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.749
it go then?

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:33.410
Human hair is mostly made of keratin.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.770
Nature loves this fibrous stuff.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.801
It cover antlers, makes up claws, and protects
shells and hydes -- but in humans we use it

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:45.200
for making hair and the outermost layer of
skin.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.170
The BBC reported in 2010 that 100 grams of
blonde, European human hair was worth as much

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.410
as 1,000 pounds sterling!

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.770
According to the Hair Price calculator at
HairSellOn.com: 10 inches of regular brown

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.950
hair could be worth 80 bucks US!

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.470
We use this natural, renewable resource for
a bunch of things already.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.619
It's used for food, construction, vanity,
fashion and art.

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.450
Yes, I said food.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.229
Other than keratin, human hair contains L-cysteine
-- a flavor enhancing amino acid.

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.840
You might see it on food labels as "dough
conditioner," "reaction flavor" or "E920"

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.100
in the U.K..

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.670
You could be eating hair in pizza dough and
not even know it!

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.149
Darker, straighter hair was easier to extract
the L-cysteine, so most companies used hair

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:40.450
from China and India -- but once word got
out and people got grossed out, now it's taken

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.679
from duck feathers or altogether synthetic.

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.601
The synthetic version is halal, kosher, and
vegan!

00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:53.320
A Chinese company used the amino acids in
human hair to make soy sauce 'til they got

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.320
caught...

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.320
Mmm!

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.499
For something you might find a BIT more palatable...

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:01.710
NASA has been exploring using human hair to
help clean up oil spills.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.990
In 1989, a hairdresser used clippings from
his salon to create a human hair sponge to

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.580
soak up the Exxon-Valdez spill off the coast
of Alaska.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.750
The oil clung to the tiny scales in the keratin
and boom!

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.470
An oil sponge was born.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.200
Hair is also dead useful in fashion and art.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.840
For example, while doing hair for the movie
Batman Begins, a hairdresser took four-and-a-half

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.319
POUND of discarded human hair, and created
a kind-of... natural fiberglass.

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.500
Fiberglass is used in all sorts of construction
because it's strong and light, its made of

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.290
plastic reinforced with fibers of glass -- in
this case, the glass was replaced by the perfectly

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.000
renewable resource -- HUMAN HAIRS.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.189
It has practical purposes for everyday life
too, or... it DID.

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:51.810
Native Americans created human hair twine
and rope by weaving the strong, straight fibers

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.849
together -- horsehair was also used.

00:02:53.849 --> 00:03:00.100
This is sort of like the oldest use for crafting,
because of course hair is used for wigs, toupees,

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.040
beards, eyelashes, you name it -- there's
an industry for making it.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.129
Even... pubic wigs called Merkins.

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:08.129
Weird.

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.629
The messed up part about hair, is we just
get rid of it without knowing anything about

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:13.629
it.

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:15.370
Hair, we barely knew thee!

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.500
And buying razors is the worst.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.689
They're behind the plastic doors at the convenience
store for some reason and they're expensive.

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:26.590
Do we really need it to vibrate or tell me
the weather or explain Tolstoy?

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.590
No.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.720
Dollar Shave Club has come to fix the problem
of the stupid expensive shave.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.140
Their blades shave your happy little faces
just as good as the ones behind the stupid

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.420
plastic at the store -- but they'll come right
to you for a few bucks a month; a fraction

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.079
of the price.

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.579
and Dr. Carver's Easy Shave Butter makes shaving
your face feel like buttering a tasty biscuit.

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:45.579
It's real good.

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.260
So how do you feel about hair?

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.260
Weirded out?

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.260
Or into it?

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.120
Have you ever thought about what happens after
it hits the barber's floor?

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.799

keratin queries check me on twitter @trace501!

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.340
