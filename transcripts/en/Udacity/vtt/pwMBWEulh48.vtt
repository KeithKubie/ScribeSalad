00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.190
Okay, Michael what's your answer?

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:05.330
&gt;&gt; It looks like, half of them are right and half of them are

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.430
wrong. So, the number of mismatches, is, two out of four or a half.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.620
&gt;&gt; Right, that is exactly the right

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.140
answer ,because ,you got half of them right

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.760
and half of them wrong. But ,it assumes ,that your likely to see all four of

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.050
the examples, equally often. So, what if I told you, that, that's not in fact

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.450
the case. So ,here's another example of error for you. What if I told you that

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.070
each of the points, is, likely to be seen ,uh,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.398
in different proportions and in fact in these particular proportions.

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:35.020
So you're going to see the first one ,half the time.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.790
You're going to see the second one ,one 20th at

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.965
a time. You're also going to see the fourth one, one

00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:43.376
20th at a time and you'll see the third one

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.150
,four tenths of the time. Alright, so you got it

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.430
Michael? One half, one 20th, four tenths and one twentieth.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.890
&gt;&gt; Got it.
