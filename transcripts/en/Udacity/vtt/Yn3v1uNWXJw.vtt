00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.260
The Android Sandbox and the iOS Sandbox
have different implementations.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.620
But from a security point of view,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.780
one of the main differences is
how they handle permissions.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.490
For Android, an app can announce
the permissions they requires and

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.910
the users can approve these
permissions and install time.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.220
The apps can ask for
very powerful permissions.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.520
For iOS, all the apps have
the same set of basic permissions.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.509
If an app needs to access
system resources or data,

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.970
such as the users address book, user
approval is required at the first time.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.620
In general,
iOS apps have only limited permissions.
