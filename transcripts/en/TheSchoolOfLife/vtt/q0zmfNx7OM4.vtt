00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.500
Arthur Schopenhauer was a German 19th century philosopher,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.500
who deserves to be remembered today for the insights contained in his great work: "The World as Will and Representation"

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.720
Schopenhauer was the first serious Western philosopher to get interested in Buddhism

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.640
and his thought can best be read as a Western reinterpretation,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.600
and response to, the enlightened pessimism found in Buddhist thought.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.420
he wrote in an autobiographical text,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.300
And like the Buddha, it was Schopenhauer's goal to dissect and then come up with a solution to this suffering.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.180
It's simply the fault of universities that Schopenhauer has always been taught in such a dry academic way

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.560
that it has stopped him from being widely known, read and followed.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.940
And yet in truth, this is a man who – no less than the Buddha –

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.120
deserves disciples, schools, art-works and monasteries to put his ideas into practice.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.680
It's not too late

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.320
Schopenhauer’s philosophy starts by giving a name to a primary force within us

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.920
which he says is more powerful than anything else –

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.980
our reason, logic or moral sense: and which Schopenhauer terms The Will-to-Life

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.300
in German DER WILLE ZUM LEBEN

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.200
The Will-to-Life is a constant force which makes us thrust ourselves forward,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.540
cling to existence and look always to our own advantage.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.720
It’s blind, dumb and very insistent.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.400
What the Will-to-Life makes us focus on most of all is sex.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.900
From adolescence onwards, this Will thrums within us, turns our heads constantly

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.780
to erotic scenarios and makes us do very weird things – the most weird of which is fall in love all the time.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.620
Schopenhauer was very respectful of love, as one might be towards a hurricane or a tiger.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.220
He deeply resented the disruption caused to intelligent people by infatuations

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.520
or what we’d call crushes

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.180
but he refused to conceive of these as either disproportionate or accidental.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.380
In his eyes, love is connected to the most important underlying project

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.680
of the Will-to-Life and hence of all our lives: having children.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.020
“Why all this noise and fuss about love?" he asked

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.300
"Why all the urgency, uproar, anguish and exertion?”

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.380
“Because the ultimate aim of all love-affairs… is actually more important than all other aims in anyone’s life;

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.040
and therefore it is quite worthy of the profound seriousness with which everyone pursues it.”

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.780
The romantic dominates life because, Schopenhauer wrote: “what is decided by it

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.540
is nothing less than the composition of the next generation

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.820
the existence and special constitution of the human race in times to come.”

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.080
Of course, we rarely think of future children when we are asking someone out on a date.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.400
But in Schopenhauer’s view, this is simply because the intellect

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.740
remains much excluded from the real resolutions and secret decisions of its own will.”

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.300
Why should such deception be necessary? Because, for Schopenhauer,

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.000
we would never reliably to reproduce unless we had first – quite literally – lost our minds.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.260
This was a man deeply opposed to the boredom, routine, expense and sheer sacrifice of having children.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.560
Furthermore, Schopenhauer argued that most of the time,

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.380
if our intellect were properly in charge of choosing who we could fall in love with,

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.760
we would pick very different people to the ones we actually end up with.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.560
But we’re ultimately driven to fall in love, not with anyone we’ll just get on with well,

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.540
but with people whom the Will-to-Life recognises as ideal partners for the project of producing

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.200
what Schopenhauer bluntly called ‘balanced children.’

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.580
All of us are a little bit unbalanced ourselves, he thought

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.220
we’re a bit too masculine, or too feminine, too tall or too short, too rational or too impulsive.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.440
If such imbalances were allowed to persist, or were aggravated in the next generation,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.520
the human race would, within a short time, sink into oddity.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.280
The Will-to-Life must, therefore, push us towards people who can, on account of their compensating imbalances,

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.380
cancel out our own issues – a large nose combined with a button nose promise a perfect nose.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.800
He argued that short people often fall in love with tall people,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.180
and more feminine men with more assertive and masculine women.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:36.240
Unfortunately, this theory of balancing attraction led Schopenhauer to a very bleak conclusion:

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.960
namely, that a person who is highly suitable for producing a balanced child with is almost never,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.080
though we can't realise it at the time because we have been blindfolded by the will-to-life,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.200
very suitable for us.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.240
“We should not be surprised," he wrote, "by marriages between people who would never have been friends:

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:01.120
Love casts itself on people who, apart from sex, would be hateful, contemptible, and even abhorrent to us.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.280
The Will-to-Life’s ability to further its own ends rather than our happiness

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.900
may, Schopenhauer implied, be sensed with particular clarity

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.800
in that rather scary, lonely moment just after orgasm.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.940
He wrote: “Directly after copulation the devil’s laughter is heard”

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.780
Watching the human spectacle, Schopenhauer felt deeply sorry for us.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.960
We are all just like animals – except, because of our greater self-awareness, far more unhappy than animals.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.160
There are some poignant passages where Schopenhauer discusses the lives of different animals

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.600
but he dwells especially on the mole

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.840
"a stunted monstrosity," his words, "that dwells in damp narrow corridors,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.960
rarely sees the light of day and whose offspring look like gelatinous worms

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.220
but which still does everything in its power to survive and perpetuate itself.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.940
We're just like moles, and just as pitiful

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.500
we are driven frantically to push ourselves forward, we want to get good jobs to impress prospective partners,

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.640
we wonder endlessly about finding The One,

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.000
and are eventually briefly seduced by someone just long enough to produce a child,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.540
and then have to spend the next 40 years in misery with them to atone for our errors.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.840
Schopenhauer was always beautifully and comically gloomy about human nature

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:19.120
“There is only one inborn error," he wrote, "and that is the notion that we exist in order to be happy

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.040
So long as we persist in this inborn error… the world will seem to us full of contradictions.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.860
For at every step, in great things and small,

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:33.080
we are bound to experience that the world and life are certainly not arranged for the purpose of being happy.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:39.220
That’s why the faces of almost all elderly people are deeply etched with disappointment.”

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.420
Schopenhauer offers two solutions to deal with the problems of existence.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.500
The first solution is intended for rather rare individuals that he called ‘sages’.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.360
Sages are able, by heroic efforts, to rise above the demands of the Will-to-Life:

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.340
they see the natural drives within themselves towards selfishness, sex and vanity... and override them.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.940
They overcome their desires, live alone, often away from big cities,

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.840
never marry and can quell their appetites for fame and status.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.660
In Buddhism, Schopenhauer points out, this person is known as a monk.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:16.860
but he recognizes that only a tiny number of us in any generation will ever go in for such a life.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:23.780
The second and more easily available and realistic therapy is to spend as long as we can with art and philosophy,

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:31.580
whose task is to hold up a mirror to the frenzied efforts and unhappy turmoil created in all of us by the Will-to-Life.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.760
We may not be able to quell the Will-to-Life very often,

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.220
but in the evenings at the theatre, or on a walk with a book of poetry,

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.260
we can step back from the day to day and look at life without illusion.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.960
The art Schopenhauer loved best is the opposite of sentimental:

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:51.040
Greek tragedies, the aphorisms of La Rochefoucauld and the political theory of Machiavelli.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.820
Such works speak frankly about egoism, suffering, selfishness

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.280
and the horrors of married life

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:01.140
and extend a tragic, dignified, melancholy sympathy to the human race.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:05.440
It’s fitting that Schopenhauer’s own work fitted his description

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.140
of what philosophy and art should do for us.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.880
It too is deeply consoling in its morbid bitter pessimism.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.380
For example, he tells us:

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.160
After spending a lot of time trying, yet failing to be famous,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.280
and trying, yet failing to have a good relationships, towards the end of his life,

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.500
Schopenhauer did eventually find an audience who adored his writings.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.860
He lived quietly in an apartment in Frankfurt with his dog,

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.700
a white poodle whom he called Atman after the world soul of the Buddhists

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:50.220
but whom the neighbouring children less respectfully referred to as Mrs Schopenhauer.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.920
Shortly before his death, a sculptor made a famous bust of him.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.800
He died in 1860 at the age of 72, having achieved calm and serenity.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.540
He is a sage for our own times, someone whose bust should be no less widespread

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.160
and no less revered than that of the Buddha he so loved.
