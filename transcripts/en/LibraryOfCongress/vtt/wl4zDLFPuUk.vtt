00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.360
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: Good afternoon.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.150
I'm Fenella France, Chief
of the Preservation Research

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.570
and Testing Division, and
I'd like to welcome you today

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.920 position:56%
to a [inaudible] lecture on Medieval
Medicine for Modern Infections.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.070
Could Ancientbiotics
help in the fight

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.270
against antimicrobial resistance?

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.480
I'd like to introduce
our speaker today,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.620 position:56%
Dr. Erin Connelly who's the
[inaudible] fellow for data curation

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.910
and medieval studies [inaudible]
Institute for manuscript studies

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.160 position:56%
and the [inaudible] and manuscripts.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.990
She holds a Ph.D. in Medieval
English from the University

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.120
of Nottingham and her doctoral
[inaudible] was a first edition

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.260
of the middle English translation

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:04.290
of [inaudible] a significant
medieval medical text.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.440
She also holds a BC in biology

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.080
and worked briefly in
molecular oncology.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.780
She's part of the Ancientbiotics
team which explores the relevance

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.840
of medieval medicines
for modern infections.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.070
I know you're going to find
this absolutely fascinating,

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.510
and I'm going to hand over to Erin.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.430
[ Applause ]

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.010 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Erin Connelly: Thank you very
much to Fenella and to everyone here

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.350
at the Library of Congress for
inviting me to speak today.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.480
I am very much looking forward to
sharing this research with you.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.600
So we have a few objectives
for today's talk.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.720
In summary, the Ancientbiotics
team tests the efficacy

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.960
of medieval medicines
for modern infections.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.480
And I'm going to be talking
about a successful pilot study

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.280
on a 1000-year-old recipe
known as Bald's Eyesalve,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.140
which turned out to be a potent
anti-staphylococcal agent.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.240
Its repeatedly killed Staph
aureus biofilms in vitro

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.150
and it killed methicillin
resistant Staph aureus or MRSA

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.580
in a mouse chronic wound model.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.040
Now because this pilot
study occurred in 2015,

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.050
we'll also be talking about current

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.190
and future research plans
of which there are many.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.610
Now, I'm going to be
presenting scientific evidence

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.290
from the pilot study, but I speak
to you today as a medievalist

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.700
and although this research
does hold implications

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.500
for present day drug discovery.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.190
It also raises very interesting
questions about the methodology

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.570
of medieval practitioners.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.250
And for a long time,
the middle ages,

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.440 position:56%
medieval medicine has been dismissed
as irrelvant, overly superstitious,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.600
a time of gathering
information solely

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.280
to gather together information.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.410
We're all familiar with the term
dark ages, labeling the period

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.450
as unenlightened by
science or reason.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:45.900
However, recent scholarship may
show that there is more methodology

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.410
to the medicines of
medieval practitioners

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:56.850
and further inquiry may show
that their medicines were more

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.600
than just placebos
or palliative aids

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:07.290
but actual antibiotics being
used long before the advent

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.600
of modern infection control.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.620
So as a medievalist, I
thought it best begin

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.580
with a story from medical history.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:24.420
What you see on your
screen is an excerpt

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.900
from Thomas Gale's Certaie
Workes of Chirurgerie.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.060
Now, Thomas Gale was
a 16th century master

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.870
of the London Barber Surgeon's
Guild, and he's connected

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.170
with the [inaudible] of
one of the text studied

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.990
by the Ancientbiotics team.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.930
Fenella mentioned it's known
as the lilly of medicines.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.160
In the foleo preceding this except,

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:57.070 position:56%
Thomas Gale relates a personal case
study of a young boy with sore eyes.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.580
He says, "Every member of the guild
is working on treating this child.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.060
They try all their treatments,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.500
but it only brings the
child's condition to worse."

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.360
Until Gale says, "We left the
child to the work of nature."

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.580
However, the child's mother
found a recipe in an old book,

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.960
brought this recipe to
Gale who distilled it,

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.190
applied it to the child and as
you see underlined in the slide,

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:33.140
he says, "Restored the child's
eyes to perfect health and sight."

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.800
Now, although Gale's account
is several centuries old,

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.020
it is analgous to our
current situation.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.900
At present, there's an
urgent need for novel routes

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.470
to drug discovery due
to the emergence

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:57.540
of antibiotic resistant bacteria
and the lack of new drugs currently

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.860
in development to treat
antibiotic resistant infections.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.870
The World Health Organization
stated in September,

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:16.380
2016 that antimicrobial resistance
is an increasingly serious threat

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.200
to global public health
that requires action

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.200
across all government
sectors and society.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:30.930
In 2017, the CDC related a case
study of a woman in Nevada who died

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.900
of an infection that was resistant

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.500
to every known antimicrobial
in the United States.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.480
Current estimates say that
around 700,000 people a year

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.590
around the world die of
antimicrobial resistant infections

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.690
and if no action is
taken, that estimate jumps

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.670
to 10 million people by 2050.

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:01.350
Now on your screen here
is a dramatic gesture

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.230
by image comics funded
by the Welcome Trust

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.610
to capture broad public attention
about this threat to health.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.550
This is a comic book series

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:16.480
that envisions a post
antibiotic dystopia actually

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.820
in a much nearer future than 2050.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:25.400
This one is set in 2036, in which
millions of people are dying

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.200
of antibiotic resistant infections.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:37.880
Like Thomas Gale's remedy from an
old book, there are some historians

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.930
and scientists who
believe that the answer

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:46.620
to the antibiotic crisis may
be found in medical history

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.620
in combination with
modern technologies.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.180
So in response to this
pressing global threat,

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.910
the Ancientbiotics team
was formed in 2014.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:06.270
It is a truly interdisciplinary
and international team.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.700
We are united by the
belief that novel routes

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:15.220
to drug discovery are necessary
as well as the conviction

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.800
that the past could
inform the future.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:24.750
So along those lines, I'm going
to present some of the evidence

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:30.440
from the pilot study on an eye
remedy called Bald's Eyesalve,

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:36.640
and the following slides represent
data taken from the original paper,

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.530
which was published in in bio.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:45.970 position:56%
It's available online and represents
work done by [inaudible] Harrison,

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.270
Olive Roberts, Rebecca
Gabrilska [assumed spelling],

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.990
Kendra Rumball [assumed
spelling], Christina Lee

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.630
and Steve Digel [assumed spelling].

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:57.950
So here it is.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.690
Bald's Eyesalve.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:05.460
This is the recipe as it appears
in a book called Bald's Leechbook.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.760
1000-year-old remedy book
held by the British library.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.940
Now it is written in old English.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.410
This is an Anglosaxon recipe.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:23.240 position:56%
But in modern English, as translated
by Christina Lee, it reads something

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:27.680
like make an eyesalve
against a wind.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:33.540
Take equal amounts of an
allium species and garlic.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:40.160
Pound them well together, take
equal amounts of wine and oxgall.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.240
Mix that with the alliums.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.870
Put this in a brass vessel.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:50.420
Let the mixture stand for nine
nights in the brass vessel.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:55.580
Wring through a cloth
and clarify it well.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:00.900
Put in a horn and at night apply
it to the eye with a feather.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.560
This is the best medicine.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:11.340
Now, a wind in modern terms
could be translated as a sty

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.940
which is an infection
of the eyelash follicle.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:18.220
And in modern terms,
the most common cause

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:24.990
of infection is the gram-positive
bacterium Staphylococcus aureus,

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:32.170
which also causes other severe
and persistent infections.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.920
So what does the data show?

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:42.220
This is what the eyesalve
looks like.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:46.790
And because the allium species

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:51.700
in the recipe is a little
bit ambiguous, a leek version

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:57.770
and an onion version of eyesalve
was made, and this is because leek

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.580
and onion, they both contain
antimicrobial flavonoids,

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.180
not found in garlic which is
already part of the recipe.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:09.410
And onion also contains
an antimicrobial peptide.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.040
So two versions of the
eyesalve were made.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.040
One with leek, one with onion.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:21.690 position:56%
Preparations of individual
ingredients, versions of the recipes

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:26.340
with ingredients deleted and
then preparations of the recipe

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:31.190
to be tested before and after this
nine day activation period were

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.060
also prepared.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:38.090
And it is noteworthy that after
these nine days the recipe

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.060
is self-sterilizing.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:46.270
So first round of tests.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:50.750
Bald's eyesalve kills Staph
aureus in planktonic culture,

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:54.750
and in synethetic wound
biofilm model.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:12:01.280 position:56%
In figure A, a control of sterile
distilled water which is represented

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.620
by the black line as
well as the two versions

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.880
of the recipe, onion and leek.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.660
Onion is represented
by the red line.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:13.230
And the leek is represented
by the blue line were added

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.770
to Staph aureus growing
in synthetic wound fluid

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.750
and then the optical density

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:23.770
of the culture was taken
during 18 hours of incubation.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.600
You can very clearly see in this
image the difference in activity

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.990
between the control
and the two eyesalves.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:38.640
In figure B, a control again
of sterile distilled water,

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.050
the two variance of
eyesalve onion and leek

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:46.150
and then each individual
ingredient on its own were added

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:51.060
to Staph aureus growing in a
synthetic wound biofilm model.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.640
Here, the [inaudible]
denote treatments

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.400
that are significantly
different from the control.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.140
And you'll note here
that on their own,

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:05.140
each individual ingredient
had no significant effect

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.620
on the reduction in bacteria.

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:13.170
However, the highlighted version
of the two full recipes did.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:18.920
And this is a key idea, this
combination of ingredients.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:25.100 position:56%
This is where we seem to see this
potent anti-staphylococcal activity.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:29.920
So along those lines, the
activity of Bald's eyesalve

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:35.810
against Staph aureus biofilms
requires several ingredients.

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:38.050
What is this image showing?

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:41.810
Here, there are the two
versions of the eyesalve,

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.940
the full recipe, onion and leek.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:49.100
And then variance of the recipe
with ingredients deleted along

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:52.520
with an assessment
of their full partial

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.960
or no antimicrobial activity.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.300
So here the gray bar is
showing the control again

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:01.200
of sterile distilled water.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:03.380
The red bars are showing the full

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.540
and reduced versions
for the onion eyesalve.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:11.400 position:56%
The blue is showing full and reduced
versions for the leek eyesalve

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.240
and the green is showing
a variant of the recipe

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.700
with both onion and leek deleted.

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:23.000
So what to take away
from this image?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.380
Deleting wine and garlic
from both variance

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:32.730
of the eyesalve totally eliminates
the bactericidal activity.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:37.130
So it would seem that
the combination of wine,

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:41.460
garlic and allium species
are crucial

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.040
for the full efficacy
of Bald's eyesalve.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:52.710
Also, when onion is used instead of
leek, oxgall seems to be necessary.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:57.820 position:56%
In both cases, brass is dispensable.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:02.970
So because of this
combination of ingredients,

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:07.850
we also look to the nine
day activation period

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.160
to see perhaps this recipe.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.930
There might be some
methodology to it.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:17.170 position:56%
Here, again a control of sterile
distilled water and the two variance

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:21.100
of eyesalve were added
to Staph aureus growing

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:25.990
in a wound biofilm model
immediately after preparation.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:31.290
And the bactericidal
activity was quantified.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:35.690
Those results are shown
by the shaded bars.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:43.160
The experiment was repeated after
the nine day activation period,

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.860
and that activity is
shown by the open bars.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:53.500
You can clearly see the
difference in activity

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:58.540
over this nine day waiting period
between the shaded and open bars

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.700
in both variance of the eyesalve.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:10.750
So what I just talked about is in
vitro results against Staph aureus.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:16.630
Because it performed so well
in these tests, it was decided

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:23.030
that it should be tested in vivo
against a resistant pathogen.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:31.510
Tissue from wound samples of mice
infected with MRSA were submerged

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:35.510
in a control of sterile saline,

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:40.030
vancomycin which is a
clinical last line antibiotic

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:44.820
and then the two variance
of the eyesalve.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:49.290
Again, here asterisks
denote treatments

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.990
which are significantly
different from the control.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:59.610
You will note that the last line
antibiotic vancomycin produced no

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:03.670
significant reduction
in viable bacteria.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:07.200
However, both of the eyesalves did.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:15.680
So it would seem that Bald's
eyesalve shows potential

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:22.300
as an anti-staphylococcal agent
not only in vitro but in vivo

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.320
against a resistant pathogen.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:31.180
So what about against
nonbacterial parasites?

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.970
So Leishmaniasis for those who
might not be familiar with it,

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.200 position:56%
it's a protozoan parasite infection.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.570
It is caused by the bite
of female sand flies.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:47.380
It has a major problem in
warm parts of the world,

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:50.950
and it's becoming an
increasing problem

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:55.330
with large scale displacement
of humans

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:58.530
and people living in refugee camps.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:05.520
And what it does is it causes
very unpleasant lesions

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.740
which are then susceptible to
infection by secondary bodies

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.980 position:56%
like Staph aureus and other species.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.900
So this work is -- has
been done by Lee Haines

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.740
of the Liverpool School
of Tropical Medicine.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:25.880
She's pictured here in the slide
taking a swab from a patient,

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:32.030
and the other image that you see
is a [inaudible] stained slide

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:34.760
of human macrophage cells.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.600
The gray area are red blood cells.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:41.650
The purple area is the macrophage.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:45.300
The large dark purple area
is the nucleus and then

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:49.140
if you look closely you
can see dark purple specks.

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.450
Those are the Leishmaniasis
parasites,

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:58.230
and what they do is they
evade human immunity by hiding

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.280
within human macrophages.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:06.020
They rupture the cell and then
invade other macrophage cells.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:11.630
Oh, word of warning
before the next slide.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.350
I know we are not all
scientists here.

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:18.480
So I'm about to show a somewhat
graphic image of a patient

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:22.600
with pretty severely infected
Leishmaniasis lesions.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.960
So if you find that disturbing,
perhaps proceed with caution.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.970
Here we go.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:37.590
So you can see the immense
pain and suffering that results

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:41.010
from these lesions,
particularly when Staph aureus

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:44.650
or another bacteria
begins an infection.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.920
And especially for people
who have been displaced,

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.410
people living in refugee camps

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:54.310
without adequate access
to medical care.

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:58.930
And once these lesions heal,
they often cause scarring,

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:02.270
pretty significant
scarring on the face,

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:05.360
and that can lead to social stigma.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:09.580
It can lead to bullying and
depression, a loss of education

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.220
if children then don't want to
go to school and in some parts

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:15.450
of the world for young girls,

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:19.110
it can lead to a loss
of marriage prospects.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:22.940
So if you contract this and
you live in a part of the world

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:27.350
with stable access to medical
care, you could receive treatment

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:31.420
by cryotherapy or thermal therapy.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:37.470
But typically the drug most usually
used is called pentastem [ph],

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:43.580
and this is injected either
intramuscularly or intralesionally.

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:48.590
And depending on the
type of species,

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:51.650
Leishmaniasis species
causing the problem,

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:56.080
the treatment can be quite
painful, quite long up to 18 months

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.310
in duration for some people.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:04.450 position:56%
And you can imagine this is quite a
disheartening prospect for patients.

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:07.570
Some people will refuse
the injections and try

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:11.630
and treat it themselves by
burning the lesions with cigarettes

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:14.840
or with fire, trying
to cut the lesion,

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.430
which clearly is not going
to help the situation.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:25.490
So what does this have
to do with eyesalve?

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:36.100
In the assay shown here, live
parasites were exposed to dilutions

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:38.570
of both versions of the eyesalve.

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:42.790
Both onion and leek
over a two day period.

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:47.870
After the two day period,
a dye was added in order

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:51.970
to measure metabolic
activity to measure

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:55.530
if the parasites are alive or dead.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:22:01.380
When parasites are alive,
the dye turns bright pink.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:06.060
When parasites are dead,
the dye stays dark blue.

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.840
And you can see where
it says onion variant

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.810
and leek variant the
dye is dark blue.

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:16.740
It's clearly dead parasites.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.750
Now, this is quite
an exciting result

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.910
but it's also a preliminary result.

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:29.590
Right now the eyesalve is being
tested on human macrophage cells

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:34.760
in order to ascertain its
effects on human cells.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:43.450
So it has to be determined that the
eyesalve is harmless to human cells

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:50.050
but maintains its toxicity against
the parasites living within them.

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:57.040
To summarize this evidence, but I
went through a little bit quickly,

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.750 position:56%
all of the ingredients are necessary
for the eyesalve to work except

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:06.180
for potentially the brass elements.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:10.850
Also necessary is this
nine day activation period.

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:14.450
This idea of a combination
of ingredients

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:18.740
in premodern medicine
is quite a key idea.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.330
Why might this be working?

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:26.810
It could be that the
antimicrobial activity

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:31.790
of the individual ingredients
on their own is combining

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:36.350
to make the eyesalve greater
than some of its parts.

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:40.350
It could be that bacteria
is being attacked

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:42.940
on multiple different fronts.

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:48.540
It also could be that this nine day
activation period perhaps a novel

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:52.010
compound is being formed
over this time.

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:56.060
These are questions to be
answered by future research

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:59.690
and that is where it is heading.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.560
Another key point.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:06.540
The recipe is highly
reproducible, which is significant.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:13.060
As of right now, six people
have made a couple dozen batches

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:18.270
of the eyesalve using fresh
ingredients each time and all

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:22.390
of them work equally well
against Staph aureus.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:29.620
As I alluded to, current tests
are being done on Bald's eyesalve

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:34.510
for its effects on human
cells, and that will determine

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:36.260
where it goes from there.

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:44.120
Also, an analysis of how it's
working, why is it effective?

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.840
Is there a novel compound
being formed?

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.440
Why this cocktail of ingredients?

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:55.500
And switching gears a little bit,

00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:00.400
you'll recall from the beginning
I related story of Thomas Gale

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.420
and the Lylye of Medicynes.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:07.090
So this is the text that I
produced the first edition

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:12.090
of for my doctoral work,
and it contains a wealth

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:16.330
of pharmaceutical information
so from that text,

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:18.550
we're doing something
a little bit different.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:23.610
There is a chapter
on weakness of sight,

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:28.280
and within that chapter there
are different remedies for loss

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:35.100
of eyesight, debilitating vision,
problems related to old age.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.110
And so there's a recipe
that in translation

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:43.260
from the middle English it says God
has not given us a better recipe

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:44.560
than this one.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.410
It makes even old men to read
tiny letters without aid.

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:53.010
And so that is quite the promise.

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:59.100
And so we decided to test that
one against macular degeneration.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:02.120
That is an ongoing test
at the moment being run

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.590
by Lisa Charkarubarti [assumed
spelling] at the University

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:10.770 position:56%
of Nottingham but we do hope to have
some results for that by the summer.

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:17.780
Another interesting ingredient from
the Lylye of Medicynes is Plantago.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:25.280
Now, this may be an unfamiliar herb
but has a long and exalted history

00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:32.330
in medical history being used
by Greek authorities all the way

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:36.600
up to the present day even
in [inaudible] practices.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:41.260
One scholar has termed it nature's
Band-Aid because it's so effective

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:47.760
at wound healing, insect stings
and also infection prevention,

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:51.700
which is also part of
the recovery process.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:56.550
So right now we're -- this
is in theoretical stage,

00:26:56.550 --> 00:27:03.030
but we hope to look at Plantago
major, Plantago [inaudible]

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:07.690
for effects in wound healing
and infection prevention.

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:13.440
Also, you'll see on her a
cold and flu preventative.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:21.060
This is a drink that I have made
based on inspired by Dr. Bernard

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.960
of the Lyly of Medicynes

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:26.170
and something I've been taking
myself for about three years.

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:28.260
Anecdotal evidence is very strong.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:33.020
Of course, I'm not going to give
you the recipe because I cannot say

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:37.990 position:56%
to test this on yourself, definitely
not and do not test Bald's eyesalve.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:44.710
But that one because of this
particular cocktail of ingredience

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:48.120
and the anecdotal evidence I
think we can make a strong case

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.420
for this one.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:52.090
We're also going to be testing
that later in the summer.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:55.870
And maybe develop something
from that.

00:27:55.870 --> 00:28:01.900
So of all of these ongoing
interesting exciting projects,

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:06.210
for the remainder of our
time, I'd like to focus

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:12.120
in on a recipe database and a
pilot study we're going to do

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.550
on data mining, the
Lyly of Medicynes.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:19.540
Just a little bit more
about this text.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.190
There it is.

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:24.380
at the Bodleian Library.

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:30.470
It is the only extant middle
English translation of Bernard

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:34.600
of Gordon's Lilium medicinae,
which was originally written

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:39.120
in [inaudible] and
completed in 1305.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:45.590
Then the middle English translation
came about a century later.

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:48.120
Latest known printing
that we know of happened

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:51.190
in the late -- very
late 17th century.

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:58.340
So you can see from the date span
it was a hugely significant text

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:02.090
through the medieval period
through the Renaissance

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.890
and into the early modern period.

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:08.690
And like I said, it contains a lot

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.820
of very interesting
pharmaceutical information.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:15.670
That was probably the most
significant aspect of it.

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:20.600
So it makes a very good text
to base this pilot study on.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:28.710
What I've done, the lyly
contains around 6000 references

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:35.780
to particular ingredients, 360 very
specific recipes which represents

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:39.580
over 110 disease conditions.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:45.260
And I put these into a database
that we hope to analyze looking

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:51.050
for nonrandom co-occurrences
of these ingredient cocktails.

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:55.800
All of these recipes that
I've talked to you about now,

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:59.730
Bald's eyesalve, the remedy
for macular degeneration,

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:03.560
Plantago [inaudible] even
the cold and flu remedy,

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:08.610 position:56%
they've all been hand selected by
researchers using a prior knowledge.

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:10.140
It's quite time consuming.

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:15.520
And we're wondering if
there might be a faster way

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.500
to identify these cocktails
of ingredients

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:23.850
to inform laboratory testing and
eliminate this kind of hunting

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:26.580
and picking method
through medieval text.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.960
So that is what we're
aiming for in the future,

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:35.620
and this pilot study
has already commenced

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:39.100
and hopefully will again summer --
summer is going to be a big time --

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:43.200
we're looking to have some
data out in the summer.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:51.720
And not only would such a
project inform laboratory research

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:59.170
which has implications for new drug
discovery, but it could go some way

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:02.040
to answering some of the
questions I posed at the beginning

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.900
of this talk regarding
the methodology

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.710
of medieval medical practitioners.

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:11.420
Often it's viewed as when
you see the long list

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.610
of ingredients contained
in medieval text,

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:18.110 position:56%
you think they were just trying
anything they could without thought,

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:23.030
but it would seem there is more
methodology to these practices.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.820
Even in the Lyly of Medicynes,

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:29.120
he says if you don't know
what to do, try this remedy.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.490
See what happens.

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:35.310
But when you look at
recipes like Bald's eyesalve,

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:40.750
meticulously put together even
down to the amount of time it takes

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:43.370
to produce this bactericidal
activity.

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:47.550
So we hope to explore that as well.

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:54.290 position:56%
This is a little bit of a whirl wind
tour through two years of research,

00:31:54.290 --> 00:32:01.920
and I would like to close with
just a few concluding thoughts

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.720
on the great virtue
of interdisciplinary

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:10.270
and international collaboration.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:14.930
The arts and sciences
are often presented

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:17.560
as these diametric opposites.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:24.570
But hopefully, in this talk I've
shown how much we need each other

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:31.160 position:56%
and that when we work together we
can produce results that are greater

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.800
than the sum of our
individual parts.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:38.660
And clearly not every
collaboration is created equally.

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:43.940
And it requires very
specific traits to be part

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:49.010
of such a well integrated
and unified team.

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.560
Turning historical medical text

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:58.180
into new drug discovery requires
very close working relationships

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:03.210
with very different disciplines,
excellent communication skills,

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:09.400
open-mindedness, accessibility
and discoverability of data

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:14.490
and knowledge exchange across such
a wide variety of disciplines.

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:18.970
In our team, we have
paracytologists, medievalists,

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:24.420 position:56%
historians, climate historians,
microbiologists, medicinal chemists,

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.610
data scientists, mathematicians,

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:31.360
spreading the disciplines
and across countries.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:37.040
We might summarize that by saying
a global problem requires a

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.450
global mindset.

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:48.660
And with further research in this
spirit, it may be possible to show

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:53.730
that the Ancientbiotics of
yesterday have real implications

00:33:53.730 --> 00:33:56.700
for the antibiotics of today.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.980
And I know we're a
little bit earlier,

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:03.630
but that leaves lots
of time for questions.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:05.750
Thank you so much for
your attention.

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.550
Very happy to discuss [inaudible].

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:20.290
[ Applause ]

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:21.590
Yes.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:29.230
&gt;&gt; So if Bald's eyesalve worked
well with some of these conditions,

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:32.340
why do you think it
fell into disuse?

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.430
&gt;&gt; Erin Connelly: Disuse
in medical history?

00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:37.400
&gt;&gt; Disuse -- presumably at some
point people stopped using it

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.330
because even the woman that we're
told about in the little story had

00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:43.660
to go look it up in an old
book because the doctors

00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:46.140
at the time had forgotten about it.

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:47.440
&gt;&gt; Erin Connelly: Oh, yes.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.550
Sorry. Thomas Gale's remedy,

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:52.780
that was a different eye
remedy to Bald's eyesalve.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:56.540
So and for those who might
not have heard the question,

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.560
she was asking why did
Bald's eyesalve fall

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.990
out of use if it was so effective?

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:06.150
So Thomas Gale used a different
eye remedy, but yeah at some point,

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:09.190
we did stop using this
combination of ingredients to put

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:11.440
on our infections on our eye.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:15.030
So there could be a couple
of different answers to that.

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:21.050
One is the view of the
medieval period as a dark age.

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:28.000 position:56%
Other generations looking back and
saying no, we are far more advanced.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.240
There's nothing we
can learn from that.

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:37.040
There has been pretty permanent
outlook for a long bit of history.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:44.700
Second, all bacteria will develop
methods to the antibiotics,

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.660
whatever form it is, being --
that they're being exposed to.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:52.540
So they will develop
resistance to them.

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:56.090
So it's possible that
Bald's eyesalve

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:59.850
and other treatments being
constantly used bacteria,

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:03.770
constantly being exposed to
that form of an antibiotic

00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:06.140
that they developed
resistance to it.

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.440
So it didn't work.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.350 position:56%
We've not used it for all this time.

00:36:10.350 --> 00:36:15.200
Maybe that's one of the reasons
why it's showing such efficacy.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:20.130
And if nothing else,
perhaps something like it.

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:22.500
This is speculating
far into the future.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:27.760
If it was to become something
that was useful as an antibiotic,

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:31.880
you know eventually bacteria
would become resistant to that.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.110
But it could buy some time.

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:37.900
I mean, thinking about that
statistic, which was put forth

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:43.130
by the AMR review,
Antimicrobial Review 2014.

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:49.050
700,000 people currently dying, up
to ten million estimated by 2050.

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:51.810
I mean, it could buy some time

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:56.560
and then there could be a
return to other antibiotics.

00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:01.970
So -- and part of that is
the antibiotic revolution.

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:07.010
We live in very unique times
with laboratory science

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:12.420
and although it is true that a lot
of our compounds that we would see

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:17.720
as pharmaceuticals are
derived from natural sources.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.460
It often doesn't come
to us in that way.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.310
So there is a connection there

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:30.900
of using nature to
find new antibiotics.

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:36.510
Did I answer -- yes.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:41.690
[ Inaudible ]

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:45.610
Yes. No. That's a very
good question actually.

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:48.690
I brought the paper with me because
I want to get it exactly right.

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:52.050
It's actually where
the wine was sourced,

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:55.580
it was an English white wine
from an area of the country

00:37:55.580 --> 00:38:00.780
when old English monastery
used to own the vineyard there.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.940
So it was as close as we could get.

00:38:05.330 --> 00:38:07.080
Yes. Here we go.

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:11.930 position:56%
Organic English white whine produced
by a vineyard situated seven miles

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:15.200
from the village of
Panbora [ph] and Somerset.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:19.630
A charter of 8956 tells us
that the Anglosaxon monastery

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:22.790
of St. Mary's Abbey in
[inaudible] held hand rights

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:26.040
to a vineyard at Panbora.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.760
So we also with the honey as well

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:33.640
because obvoiusly this is
not an exercise in trying

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.800
to replicate the medieval past,

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.370
which we would argue is
probably somewhat futile

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:42.960
because we cannot replicate
those conditions whatsoever.

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:47.150
Our purposes are totally different,
but we did try and get close

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:48.920
to ingredients like the wine.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:53.340
The honey was sourced from
[inaudible], a lady in Surrey

00:38:53.340 --> 00:39:00.000
who had recreated a medieval garden
with medicinal herbs and plants

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.590
and bees nearby were
pollinating those plants.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:06.220
So that's where we
obtained the honey from.

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.820
And just for some continuity.

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:11.790
Yes.

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:13.940
&gt;&gt; I have two questions.

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:17.460
One was in your studies did
you find that the formula --

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.770
Bald's formula -- was
bactericidal or bacteriostatic?

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:26.240 position:56%
And the other one is I'm kind of
mystified by the nine day shelf life

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.270
or the -- actually I'd like
to know the shelf life.

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:32.120
Once it reached the nine day,
was it potent on nine days?

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:36.020
Which was probably just
serendipitously discovered.

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:37.980
&gt;&gt; Erin Connelly: Trial
and error, yeah.

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:41.960
&gt;&gt; And how long was it
good for thereafter?

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.260
&gt;&gt; Erin Connelly: Yes.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:48.670
So I'm not a Ph.D. microbiologist.

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:51.140
But I'm going to answer this.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:55.580
I will recommend that you
look to the paper as well

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:59.640
and anything I don't
answer, contact Fred Harrison

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:03.070
or Steve Digel whose email
addresses are on the paper.

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:04.700
And they'll be happy to answer it.

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:08.710
So the question for those who
didn't hear it was Bald's eyesalve

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:12.060
bacteriocidal or bacteristatic?

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:16.330
And the answer that's coming to me
from the paper is bacteriocidal,

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:23.870
and in the results as well it was
found the word design has actually

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:27.270
been used in reference
to this recipe.

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:31.870
In that it treats the
infection that it was designed

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:34.830
to treat almost in a targeted way.

00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:40.430
And the eyesalve has been
tested against other pathogens

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:47.530 position:56%
such as K pneumoniae and E. coli and
Enterobacter and things like that.

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:51.290
And the activity is different
so it's not like dumping bleach

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:53.530
on something where it
just kills everything.

00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:57.290 position:56%
It seems to be specifically targeted
to what it was made to treat,

00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:00.440 position:56%
which is very interesting and worthy

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:04.000
of more research and
that is ongoing.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.990
And then the other question was --

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:11.450
was the eyesalve good for
the entire nine day period?

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:13.360
What was its activity
through that period

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.860
and how long does it stay good?

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:18.810
That is actually being
looked at at the moment.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:23.550
There have been some old samples of
the eyesalve that are being tested.

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:26.740
I was actually just speaking
to the microbiologist

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:30.260
who performed this work,
and she had some old samples

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:31.560
that they're testing.

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:36.840
So I'm not sure about the terminal
dates, how long it stays good.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:42.420
I believe it has been tested, but
I can't give it's bad after 30 days

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:45.510
or it becomes toxic
after this period.

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:48.530
[ Inaudible ]

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:49.830
At room temperature.

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:52.460
And that was a consideration
in running this test.

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:57.170
There were a lot of decisoins that
had to be made and it was decided

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:02.470 position:56%
to keep the eyesalve in the
refrigerator because in the building

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:05.600
where the lab was, the
heat comes on and off.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.020
And it was decided that
fluctuations in temperature

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.100
like that would be more
unrealistic then keeping it

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:16.310
at a steady temperature because
often in other medieval recipes --

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:20.850
actually the one with
macular degeneration,

00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:25.400
one of the instructions says
make it as hot as a hen's nest

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:29.150
when she's sitting on a nest.

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:31.120
What temperature would that be?

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:38.320
So I'll find a hen or -- so
that is during the winter.

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.960
If it's being made during the
summer, the recipe is to sit

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:46.260
in a cool dark shadow so it's what
they had in their environment,

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:48.580
but they're looking for
a steady temperature.

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:52.830
With the hen, steady temperature,
dark shadow, steady temperature.

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:55.400
So that's why we chose
refrigeration.

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:57.190
Yes.

00:42:57.190 --> 00:43:01.120
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that one of the
things that you discovered is

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:04.780
that the Bald's eyesalve recipe for
instance is highly reproducible.

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.650
You can make the same
thing again and again.

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:13.050
Is there any intent to try making
the recipe with modern wine

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:15.690
and honey since those two
ingredients seem to be

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:19.300
so much limited in availability?

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.870
&gt;&gt; Erin Connelly: Well, we could
say it was made with modern wine

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:27.740
and honey because we don't
really have access --

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:31.630
all of these ingredients are
modern in the sense that --

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:33.660
sorry, for those who
didn't hear the question,

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:38.670
it was has there been any
attempt to perhaps change the wine

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:43.650
and honey other then the ones
that we used in the original test?

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:45.210
Yeah, okay.

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:50.000
No. It's -- well with the
six who have reproduced it,

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.470
I'm not entirely sure if they
used the exact same sources,

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:57.050
although I think they did

00:43:57.050 --> 00:44:00.820
because they were trying
to replicate it exactly.

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:04.770
I know that in the recipe
that I made with the cold

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:09.760
and flu preventative I changed
the honey multiple times,

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:14.400
and we still need to
test this, but I will say

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:19.070
that Manuka honey would be
worth trialing in one of these

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:23.490
because it is -- it has the highest
antimicrobial content of any honey.

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:29.040
And it's what I use in my recipe.

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:33.000
Maybe it's a placebo effect
because I really believe in it.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.670
But that waits to be seen.

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:43.370 position:56%
Yeah, because often medieval recipes
-- even with vinegar and with wine,

00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:48.030
they'll say make it a weak
wine, make it a strong vinegar.

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:52.390
Sometimes they don't give a lot
of guidance to what that means.

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:56.240
Obviously with a weak wine, you
would think perhaps it's newly made

00:44:56.240 --> 00:45:00.320
or they're diluting it with
water or some other ingredients.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:04.220
But yeah, did that answer?

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:08.240
&gt;&gt; To a certain extent, but one of
the things that I was more curious

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:13.140
about is if these recipes
prove to be efficacious,

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:17.950
then in order to ramp up
production you have to be able

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:22.620
to source ingredients on a
mass scale, and it seems to me

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:28.640
that a small vineyard [inaudible]
a local bee keeper aren't going

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:31.870
to serve for mass production.

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:33.170
&gt;&gt; Erin Connelly: No, no.

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:37.110
In that case, we would have
to find a different source.

00:45:37.110 --> 00:45:43.610 position:56%
And I would -- I would say Manuka
is one of the best that we could do.

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:47.240
But no, that tiny vineyard
and the poor bee keeper,

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:52.160
no for worldwide production, but
of course we're not there yet.

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:59.730
That was mainly done for the sake
of the pilot study and to keep it

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:04.380
as close to the Anglosaxon
source as possible.

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:09.340
And also because no one
expected it to be so effective.

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:13.050
It was what we could call
a Friday afternoon project.

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:17.080
Everybody did this
in their spare time,

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:19.220
kind of still doing it that way.

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:25.550
And it was really quite shocking
when these results came back

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:31.300
and right now the recipe --
we're looking into the mechanism

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:33.630
and action and that kind of thing.

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:36.870
But its effects on human
cells need to be looked

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:41.140
at first before we
look at anything else.

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.640
Thank you.

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.210
Yes.

00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:49.650
&gt;&gt; Someone online asks if
your team had any thoughts

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:53.960
about substituting the Oxgall?

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:55.650
&gt;&gt; Erin Connelly: No.

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:59.010
Did they mention what they thought
it might be substituted with?

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:01.880
&gt;&gt; They mentioned the
possible objectives would be

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.990
for vegans or those with allergies.

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:05.850
&gt;&gt; Erin Connelly: Oh, right.

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:09.470
The thought with Oxgall
because -- here I'll show you.

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:15.320
That is a good point.

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:19.100
So in this graph, you
see with the leek version

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:22.960
of the eyesalve, Oxgall
is not necessary.

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:27.900 position:56%
With the onion version, there's only
partial activity when it's limited.

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:34.050
So it's an ingredient sort of like
brass that could be dispensable.

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:40.650
The eyesalve is not showing
its full activity in --

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:42.610
with that ingredient present.

00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:49.080
So in the future, it could
be something to look at.

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.070
I'm not sure what we
would substitute it

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:52.980
with because [inaudible] bile.

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:55.880
Bile can act as a surfactant.

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.180
Yes.

00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:58.480
&gt;&gt; Are you getting any
interesting responses

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:02.670
from the medical biology
research community [inaudible]?

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:10.570
&gt;&gt; Eric Connelly: Yes, actually --

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:13.810
so the question was have there
been any interesting responses

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:16.490
from the microbiologist community?

00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:24.200
And yes, actually in 2015 when this
data was announced and published,

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:27.850
it actually attracted
worldwide attention.

00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:30.470
And the two leads of the project,

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:33.920
Christina Lee who's
the Anglosaxonist

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:37.360
who translated the recipe and
Fraya [assumed spelling] Harrison

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:42.510
who led the microbiology work,
they did a lot of interviews

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:49.930
with worldwide news outlets and the
paper has quite high impact rating,

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:54.120
and it kind of went all over the
world for a time and responses

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:59.400
from microbiologists unless there's
something I don't know about,

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:01.250
they've been very positive.

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:07.460
And I think people are quite
inspired not just by this research

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:12.720
but by lots of research going on
with neutraceuticals and looking

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.750
to the past for inspiration.

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:22.530
There's even a team in Sweden I
believe that just produced mead,

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:26.900
viking mead which is
highly antibacterial.

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.990
They produced it for sale.

00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:31.060
So you can buy it if you like.

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:35.220
And for the person with the honey
question, they did use honey in it.

00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:37.330
It'd be interesting to
note what honey they used

00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:38.960
because I'm not sure.

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:41.280
I just saw that data last night.

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:46.300
So I think it's a -- we're right
on the verge perhaps of something.

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:49.480
But yeah, responses
have been very positive

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:52.370
and I think people are quite
excited about this research

00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:54.690
and the potential it has.

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:57.570 position:56%
Of course, this is very preliminary.

00:49:57.570 --> 00:50:04.570 position:56%
It has to be tested on human cells
before anymore progress can be made.

00:50:04.570 --> 00:50:06.370
Yeah.

Do you have any further
questions for Erin?

I do have to say that in New Zealand
we use Manuka honey in all kinds

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:19.770
of everything [inaudible].

in, I thought Manuka, New Zealand.
