00:00:00.241 --> 00:00:03.011
- There's some very, very
interesting dishes that we got,

00:00:03.011 --> 00:00:05.619
and the anticipation buildup
watching them cook all

00:00:05.619 --> 00:00:08.101
of the dishes in the
kitchen, it was breathtaking.

00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:09.607
You can see the chilies mixed throughout.

00:00:09.607 --> 00:00:11.582
They added some Sichuan pepper I think.

00:00:11.582 --> 00:00:14.958
(atmospheric slow pulsating beat music)

00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.086
It's absolutely spectacular.

00:00:17.086 --> 00:00:20.001
When you come to Yunnan,
when you come to Dali,

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.217
this is the dish you have to seek out.

00:00:22.217 --> 00:00:26.384
(atmospheric slow pulsating beat music)

00:00:28.082 --> 00:00:30.089
Good morning, I hope you're
having an amazing day.

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.575
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in
Dali in Yunnan, China.

00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:35.415
This is Day one of our Yunnan food tour

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:37.447
that I'm taking with Zouba tours.

00:00:37.447 --> 00:00:40.135
A big thank you to Frank
for setting everything up.

00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:41.864
Today we're gonna be meeting up with Luxi,

00:00:41.864 --> 00:00:45.571
and she's gonna take
us to especially focus

00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:48.988
on the Bai ethnic group for Chinese food.

00:00:51.105 --> 00:00:53.855
Ready to go on a food tour today?

00:00:55.842 --> 00:00:58.872
We're heading first this morning
to a place called Xizhou,

00:00:58.872 --> 00:01:01.143
and we're gonna have breakfast there.

00:01:01.143 --> 00:01:05.310
(atmospheric slow pulsating beat music)

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:17.180
That was about a 30 minute
drive, but it was a beautiful

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.041
drive passing by the mountains
and villages, and the mist.

00:01:22.041 --> 00:01:24.374
Absolutely gorgeous scenery.

00:01:30.555 --> 00:01:31.388
Ni hao.

00:01:32.906 --> 00:01:37.347
- [Luxi] The most popular
breakfast for locals.

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:41.479
(speaks in foreign language)

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.394
And we start a pea soup.

00:01:43.394 --> 00:01:47.144
(speaks in foreign language)

00:02:01.797 --> 00:02:03.903
- [Mark] Pea porridge, right?

00:02:03.903 --> 00:02:05.741
- [Luxi] Maybe I take this away.

00:02:05.741 --> 00:02:09.491
(speaks in foreign language)

00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:23.802
- Before we get started
eating I just want to quickly

00:02:23.802 --> 00:02:25.493
introduce you to Luxi.

00:02:25.493 --> 00:02:26.483
- Hi.

00:02:26.483 --> 00:02:29.966
She is gonna be our guide in Dali,

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:33.051
and she's very knowledgeable about food.

00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:34.467
She has a cooking school.

00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:36.642
- [Luxi] Yeah my cooking school
is called Rice and Friends.

00:02:36.642 --> 00:02:38.538
- Rice and Friends,
and I'll leave the link

00:02:38.538 --> 00:02:40.018
in the description box.

00:02:40.018 --> 00:02:43.595
She knows a lot about food,
so it's an honor to be able

00:02:43.595 --> 00:02:46.226
to hang out with her and
to walk around and eat.

00:02:46.226 --> 00:02:47.059
Okay, let's eat.

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:49.974
- Mother, and selling the
same thing since she was

00:02:49.974 --> 00:02:53.655
teenager girl, so it was
like forever, yeah it's like

00:02:53.655 --> 00:02:56.255
absolutely my favorite, the most delicious

00:02:56.255 --> 00:02:57.794
one I have ever
- The same, she's been selling

00:02:57.794 --> 00:02:59.929
this since she was a teenager
right here in the same place?

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:01.363
- Yeah, helping her mother.

00:03:01.363 --> 00:03:02.308
- Wow.

00:03:02.308 --> 00:03:05.808
- It's the most delicious one I ever find.

00:03:10.675 --> 00:03:12.727
I asking her to give you extra chili.

00:03:12.727 --> 00:03:15.410
Usually my guess is like a job.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.352
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:03:16.352 --> 00:03:19.185
Extra chili is always okay for me.

00:03:22.772 --> 00:03:24.939
Mmmm, oh that's fantastic.

00:03:27.248 --> 00:03:30.994
Oh, it's like you can
taste that it, it has that

00:03:30.994 --> 00:03:33.681
kind of starchy pea texture to it.

00:03:33.681 --> 00:03:35.625
Every now and then you can taste
the little bits of peanuts,

00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:37.065
you can taste the dried
chili, I got a chili seed

00:03:37.065 --> 00:03:39.208
in that bite, oh it's delicious.

00:03:39.208 --> 00:03:43.375
And you can tell it's really
kind of filling and warming.

00:03:46.512 --> 00:03:49.679
I like it, it's really nice and goopy.

00:03:53.751 --> 00:03:58.115
So we have here, this one
has the hardened pea cake,

00:03:58.115 --> 00:03:59.800
and then also with some noodles and also

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.456
with all the same lots of
the same seasonings as well.

00:04:02.456 --> 00:04:06.370
It's fully, fully coated in
that chili oil and sauce,

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.537
so this looks kind of like
a slurper's kind of a dish.

00:04:16.135 --> 00:04:16.968
Mmmm.

00:04:18.672 --> 00:04:20.918
The vinegar in there is really nice.

00:04:20.918 --> 00:04:25.251
Definitely a totally different
texture from the porridge.

00:04:25.251 --> 00:04:27.263
You can taste all those
individual noodles,

00:04:27.263 --> 00:04:31.062
and then the hardened pea porridge is,

00:04:31.062 --> 00:04:33.979
it almost has a tofu texture to it.

00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:42.968
I really like the noodles.

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:48.286
I can also really taste the pickled radish

00:04:48.286 --> 00:04:49.336
that she added in there.

00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:52.542
That adds another vinegary
sour component to it.

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:53.980
This is delicious.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.563
(market people chattering)

00:05:00.621 --> 00:05:03.621
Xie, xie, xie xie, xie xie, xie xie.

00:05:07.646 --> 00:05:11.230
The family that runs it
is so friendly, so nice,

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.384
they really loved Micah too,
and we are on our way to go

00:05:15.384 --> 00:05:17.967
eat something called baba next.

00:05:19.609 --> 00:05:22.283
- [Luxi] So this is my
favorite baba place.

00:05:22.283 --> 00:05:25.034
- We've arrived to Luxi's
favorite baba shop.

00:05:25.034 --> 00:05:28.657
And baba is this, it's
like a bread circle.

00:05:28.657 --> 00:05:31.712
There's both sweet and savory,
and we're gonna have a chance

00:05:31.712 --> 00:05:34.812
to watch her make it before we eat it.

00:05:34.812 --> 00:05:36.339
- [Luxi] We call it
the Chinese mini pizza.

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:38.297
- [Mark] Chinese mini pizza or pita?

00:05:38.297 --> 00:05:39.401
What an amazing place.

00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:42.593
- [Luxi] So there are three
types of baba over here.

00:05:42.593 --> 00:05:45.306
The first is like this,
this is like the plain baba,

00:05:45.306 --> 00:05:48.515
the dough is made from wheat flour, water,

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:50.515
yeast and baking powder.

00:05:52.177 --> 00:05:56.344
So rose jam, sweet red bean
paste, and then brown sugar.

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:05.299
- So impressive to
stand here and watch her

00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:09.571
as she makes this
traditional, kind of a pastry,

00:06:09.571 --> 00:06:11.950
a Chinese Yunnan pastry.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.117
And the dough is, very
good, the dough, is almost,

00:06:18.474 --> 00:06:20.612
it's almost like runny dough, and she adds

00:06:20.612 --> 00:06:23.542
in a handful of lard, straight lard,

00:06:23.542 --> 00:06:27.844
which provides some massive
flavor I can guarantee.

00:06:27.844 --> 00:06:30.590
And now she's adding in some minced pork

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.423
and some green onions.

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:48.216
(woman speaks in foreign language)

00:06:48.216 --> 00:06:51.191
Amazing how she is able
to work that dough,

00:06:51.191 --> 00:06:53.963
because that dough is
so, it's so, elastic,

00:06:53.963 --> 00:06:56.035
it's almost like elastic, like rubber,

00:06:56.035 --> 00:06:57.348
it's amazing how she works that dough

00:06:57.348 --> 00:07:01.644
and how she's mixed in multiple
handfuls of minced pork

00:07:01.644 --> 00:07:04.899
and green onions, and
then just flattened it out

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:07.891
and then she balled it up into
almost like a cinnamon roll

00:07:07.891 --> 00:07:10.698
looking piece of bread, and
then she added in some more

00:07:10.698 --> 00:07:14.865
pork and now she's rolling
it out into that pizza shape.

00:07:16.055 --> 00:07:17.388
And there it is.

00:07:19.623 --> 00:07:23.123
And now it's being brushed with lard also?

00:07:25.371 --> 00:07:28.038
(food sizzling)

00:07:33.393 --> 00:07:35.817
(Luxi speaks in foreign language)

00:07:35.817 --> 00:07:37.602
- [Mark] Oh that's the
heat the bottom of it.

00:07:37.602 --> 00:07:38.937
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:07:38.937 --> 00:07:41.457
One is the charcoal at the bottom,

00:07:41.457 --> 00:07:43.241
and then one is the charcoal at the top.

00:07:43.241 --> 00:07:45.626
And so he said it was getting
too hot on the bottom,

00:07:45.626 --> 00:07:48.192
so he transferred it to the bottom,

00:07:48.192 --> 00:07:51.692
the baba, and now he's fanning that flame.

00:07:58.729 --> 00:08:01.215
And now that the charcoal
is a perfect temperature,

00:08:01.215 --> 00:08:03.792
he's cooking it both from
the bottom and the top

00:08:03.792 --> 00:08:06.659
so then the baba just
stuck within the middle

00:08:06.659 --> 00:08:10.576
and it's just getting
heat from all directions.

00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:25.208
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:08:32.228 --> 00:08:33.900
Salty and sweet.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.137
This is as fresh as could be, he literally

00:08:36.137 --> 00:08:39.098
just pulled them out of the oven.

00:08:39.098 --> 00:08:41.197
I think I'll go for the
sweet version first.

00:08:41.197 --> 00:08:42.030
The bread is still steaming,
it's really fluffy yet it feels

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.084
crunchy on the outside because
of that lard, and then,

00:08:44.084 --> 00:08:46.595
on this side there's more,
this is the rose jam.

00:08:46.595 --> 00:08:48.928
Oh, it kind of squeezed out.

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:58.659
Oh there's red beans in there
too, sweet beans in there too.

00:09:02.122 --> 00:09:04.455
Oh wow, oh, that is awesome.

00:09:06.374 --> 00:09:11.086
It's so hot, it's so fresh,
it's like the literally

00:09:11.086 --> 00:09:15.285
the perfect consistency
because it's slightly gooey,

00:09:15.285 --> 00:09:17.724
but crunchy crispy at the
same time, and you've got

00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:19.767
that sweet inner filling,
and it does have a little bit

00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:21.767
of a floral aroma to it.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:27.523
Wow.

00:09:27.523 --> 00:09:31.328
So while perhaps a western
pastry would use butter

00:09:31.328 --> 00:09:35.769
to keep it flaky and moist,
this uses just pure lard.

00:09:35.769 --> 00:09:38.393
That pork that she sort
of mixed in as well as,

00:09:38.393 --> 00:09:40.184
there's some on the top of this piece,

00:09:40.184 --> 00:09:43.184
depending on the piece that you get.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:51.126
That gooey crispiness contrast,
this one you can taste

00:09:51.126 --> 00:09:53.239
the meatiness of it, it's actually rich,

00:09:53.239 --> 00:09:56.406
because there's so much lard in there.

00:09:57.657 --> 00:09:58.490
Wow.

00:10:01.238 --> 00:10:02.201
It's so good.

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:04.945
So that's lard too, right?

00:10:04.945 --> 00:10:08.018
That baba, it literally
almost has like the flaky

00:10:08.018 --> 00:10:12.216
crunchiness of a croissant,
but instead of butter,

00:10:12.216 --> 00:10:13.383
it's all lard.

00:10:16.718 --> 00:10:18.565
That is just sizzling.

00:10:18.565 --> 00:10:20.260
We're having one more version,

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.875
and this is a very special version.

00:10:21.875 --> 00:10:24.557
This shop, they only
make about 20 per day.

00:10:24.557 --> 00:10:27.307
So you gotta get lucky to get it.

00:10:28.213 --> 00:10:30.738
And the difference is that
the dough is made with

00:10:30.738 --> 00:10:33.252
caramelized brown sugar,
which is mixed into the dough,

00:10:33.252 --> 00:10:34.437
rather than just the plain dough.

00:10:34.437 --> 00:10:36.213
So you can see it has a dark color,

00:10:36.213 --> 00:10:39.380
it actually looks like a giant cookie.

00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:43.179
Very hot.

00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:45.518
Oh yeah, it has a molasses flavor

00:10:45.518 --> 00:10:48.018
from that roasted brown sugar.

00:10:50.213 --> 00:10:51.046
Thank you.

00:10:52.349 --> 00:10:56.101
Have a great trip, nice to meet you, okay.

00:10:56.101 --> 00:10:58.885
Oh we're going this way, okay.

00:10:58.885 --> 00:11:01.744
That like sets a new
level for pastry for me.

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:03.968
Oh there's baba, baba all over.

00:11:03.968 --> 00:11:07.385
(mellow jazz beat music)

00:11:11.042 --> 00:11:12.656
We're walking through the streets now,

00:11:12.656 --> 00:11:15.612
and we've sort of
transitioned from the old town

00:11:15.612 --> 00:11:18.723
to this looks like we're
in a giant flea market

00:11:18.723 --> 00:11:22.890
with everything, people are
selling clothes and tools.

00:11:23.873 --> 00:11:26.083
There's fruit, there's
vegetables, there's Chinese

00:11:26.083 --> 00:11:30.300
medicine and herbs,
and there's tea stalls.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.796
I think everything is
available at this market

00:11:31.796 --> 00:11:33.590
that you're looking for.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.349
Oh wow, look at those giant, whoa,

00:11:35.349 --> 00:11:38.016
those look like gigantic lemons.

00:11:39.887 --> 00:11:43.470
(market people chattering)

00:11:47.869 --> 00:11:51.419
It's just action-packed at this market.

00:11:51.419 --> 00:11:55.002
(market people chattering)

00:12:03.956 --> 00:12:07.221
I'm just fascinated...whoa,
fish out of water.

00:12:07.221 --> 00:12:08.858
When you walk through the
market, you'll see all sorts

00:12:08.858 --> 00:12:12.404
of different, exotic-looking
mushrooms and flowers.

00:12:12.404 --> 00:12:16.571
We're walking through the
chicken station right now.

00:12:17.542 --> 00:12:19.862
We're on our way to go to
a place where they're gonna

00:12:19.862 --> 00:12:24.029
make the famous, well-known
Yunnanese type of rice noodle.

00:12:25.413 --> 00:12:28.996
(machinery motors running)

00:12:33.864 --> 00:12:35.316
Squeezes out of that grinder,

00:12:35.316 --> 00:12:38.805
it definitely looks like
intestines that are coming out.

00:12:38.805 --> 00:12:40.382
What's totally different and what sets

00:12:40.382 --> 00:12:44.146
this type of Yunnanese, very
unique rice noodle apart

00:12:44.146 --> 00:12:48.447
from other rice noodles is
that they use pre-cooked rice

00:12:48.447 --> 00:12:49.765
to make this type of noodle.

00:12:49.765 --> 00:12:51.832
So you can see all of
the rice around here,

00:12:51.832 --> 00:12:53.626
it's already steamed rice.

00:12:53.626 --> 00:12:56.289
And the steamed rice, she sticks it into,

00:12:56.289 --> 00:13:00.456
this is actually an old-school
sausage meat grinder,

00:13:01.874 --> 00:13:06.543
then she grinds the rice
into a paste, into a dough.

00:13:06.543 --> 00:13:08.611
She's actually re-doing
it again, so I think

00:13:08.611 --> 00:13:11.526
they grind it through there
a couple of different times.

00:13:11.526 --> 00:13:13.911
I have a little taste,
yeah, it has a dough,

00:13:13.911 --> 00:13:16.828
almost like Play Doh texture to it.

00:13:19.229 --> 00:13:21.312
Wow, that's really gummy.

00:13:23.892 --> 00:13:25.917
Right now it's flavorless
because there's no flavor in it,

00:13:25.917 --> 00:13:30.300
but they make a variety of
different shapes out of it.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:33.029
So they'll make thin strips
for noodles, they make it

00:13:33.029 --> 00:13:36.231
into a block and you can
hand-cut your noodles.

00:13:36.231 --> 00:13:39.184
They make it into a paper-thin
sheet, which I think is

00:13:39.184 --> 00:13:42.623
used almost like a pancake,
but it's so diverse,

00:13:42.623 --> 00:13:45.953
so many different dishes can be prepared

00:13:45.953 --> 00:13:49.620
from this type of rice
delicacy preparation.

00:14:01.993 --> 00:14:03.412
Okay, nice to meet you.

00:14:03.412 --> 00:14:04.350
- [Man] Nice to meet you.

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:05.183
- [Mark] Bye bye.

00:14:05.183 --> 00:14:06.016
- [Man] Have a nice trip.

00:14:06.016 --> 00:14:07.365
- [Mark] Thank you, you too.

00:14:07.365 --> 00:14:12.078
(atmospheric slow pulsating beat music)

00:14:12.078 --> 00:14:13.304
(Luxi speaks in foreign language)

00:14:13.304 --> 00:14:15.369
- [Mark] Oh right here is
where they make the cheese.

00:14:15.369 --> 00:14:19.426
- [Luxi] And this one
is one-night-old whey.

00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:20.843
- [Mark] Just a family
business, they make cheese.

00:14:20.843 --> 00:14:22.768
We came back to this
little courtyard back here,

00:14:22.768 --> 00:14:25.324
it's filled with textiles, it's really,

00:14:25.324 --> 00:14:27.536
really picturesque back here.

00:14:27.536 --> 00:14:29.109
He's going to demonstrate how they make

00:14:29.109 --> 00:14:32.609
a traditional Yunnanese cheese using a wok

00:14:34.193 --> 00:14:37.759
and then kind of stretching it out.

00:14:37.759 --> 00:14:40.881
In most parts of China, dairy and cheese

00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:43.632
is not common or non-existent.

00:14:43.632 --> 00:14:46.658
And so Yunnan is one of the
only provinces in China where

00:14:46.658 --> 00:14:49.177
you'll find a traditional form
of cheese, and there's a lot

00:14:49.177 --> 00:14:51.475
of history that goes back possibly

00:14:51.475 --> 00:14:53.433
it was introduced by Mongolians.

00:14:53.433 --> 00:14:56.233
- Yes, by Mongolians.
- To this area, to this

00:14:56.233 --> 00:14:57.066
specific area of Yunnan.

00:14:57.066 --> 00:14:58.940
- Yeah, when they came to this area

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.357
during like the 80s, something like 1200.

00:15:03.619 --> 00:15:07.514
Right now it's very tough,
very rough, so it breaks

00:15:07.514 --> 00:15:11.115
very easily, and he's
using his thick chopsticks

00:15:11.115 --> 00:15:12.630
and very smooth.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:14.244
- [Mark] Look at his, look at how,

00:15:14.244 --> 00:15:17.558
how strong his, look at
how strong his thumbs...

00:15:17.558 --> 00:15:21.641
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:15:35.914 --> 00:15:38.106
- [Luxi] And this is where it's different

00:15:38.106 --> 00:15:39.825
from Mongolia cheese.

00:15:39.825 --> 00:15:44.706
Becomes like these pieces, so
the yellow pieces like that.

00:15:44.706 --> 00:15:45.846
- [Mark] Oh okay, so

00:15:45.846 --> 00:15:47.400
then it just dries like that
- so then after you put it

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.758
- [Luxi] under the sun for one day.

00:15:48.758 --> 00:15:49.771
It becomes like that.

00:15:49.771 --> 00:15:53.370
From here, you can grate
it, and you deep fried it,

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.150
and tonight we're going to
have the salad made from this.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.340
- [Mark] Okay I'm gonna
have a chance real fast

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.311
to try making some cheese.

00:15:59.311 --> 00:16:03.478
Stir it in one direction
slowly until it separates.

00:16:05.867 --> 00:16:06.700
(laughs) Wow.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.776
- [Luxi] Yeah, you kind of like spread

00:16:08.776 --> 00:16:11.026
and then bring it together.

00:16:15.191 --> 00:16:16.781
Ah good, very good.

00:16:16.781 --> 00:16:19.078
Yeah, exactly like that.

00:16:19.078 --> 00:16:21.332
- [Mark] I've never used
my thumb like this ever.

00:16:21.332 --> 00:16:23.918
Oh yeah, oh man, if you're
not good with these thick

00:16:23.918 --> 00:16:28.085
chopsticks, your cheese will
come to a melting point.

00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:33.398
Okay, and now you just kind
of delicately work it with--

00:16:33.398 --> 00:16:37.565
(atmospheric pulsating beat music)

00:16:41.882 --> 00:16:44.270
Oh okay, so you gotta stretch it.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.894
Oh we gotta a couple holes in my cheese,

00:16:46.894 --> 00:16:49.631
and then wrap it around.

00:16:49.631 --> 00:16:51.399
Got a little bit of a holey cheese.

00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:53.272
My cheese didn't turn out the most pretty,

00:16:53.272 --> 00:16:54.911
but it was a lot of fun trying,

00:16:54.911 --> 00:16:56.929
and now we're gonna move
over to this little corner

00:16:56.929 --> 00:17:01.096
and try some of the cheese in
different forms and styles.

00:17:04.946 --> 00:17:06.277
We got two different types of cheese.

00:17:06.277 --> 00:17:07.657
This one is just the fresh cheese,

00:17:07.657 --> 00:17:09.673
kind of like the mozzarella, that cheese

00:17:09.673 --> 00:17:11.136
that I just made fresh.

00:17:11.136 --> 00:17:13.771
And this one actually was
pretty cool how he made it.

00:17:13.771 --> 00:17:17.602
He took the dried cheese,
the one that dries for a day,

00:17:17.602 --> 00:17:21.769
and then he filled it up,
he wiped a layer of rose jam

00:17:23.417 --> 00:17:25.890
onto it, and then he grilled
it over the hot plate.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:29.571
Raveled it up onto a
chopstick to make it turn into

00:17:29.571 --> 00:17:33.738
that spiral and you can see
it's kind of crispy as well.

00:17:35.139 --> 00:17:38.727
Kind of has a, yeah
definitely a dried cheese

00:17:38.727 --> 00:17:43.218
kind of flavor to it, it's
kind of mild in cheese flavor,

00:17:43.218 --> 00:17:45.280
and then you taste that
rose jam, and then it has

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.280
that smoky taste from
being grilled and bubbled.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:55.439
Oh, that's really nice,
that's a great combination.

00:17:55.439 --> 00:17:57.481
That's almost like, like eating cheese

00:17:57.481 --> 00:17:59.561
with a cranberry sauce almost.

00:17:59.561 --> 00:18:02.440
And then the final one we have
here is deep fried cheese,

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:04.547
and you can see that bubbly skin

00:18:04.547 --> 00:18:07.380
that almost looks like cracklings.

00:18:13.341 --> 00:18:17.508
Deep fried on is a little
bit, it's a little strange.

00:18:18.591 --> 00:18:21.647
It's kind of dry, and kind
of tasteless actually.

00:18:21.647 --> 00:18:24.583
Oh, you're supposed to put sugar in it.

00:18:24.583 --> 00:18:26.550
- [Luxi] Ring the bell?

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:28.610
(bell rings)

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:32.777
- That was a completely new
type of cheese experience,

00:18:33.637 --> 00:18:36.750
both in the making and
in the style of eating,

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:40.420
very, very, interesting,
and what a cool courtyard.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.044
We jumped back in the
car, it's kind of bumpy,

00:18:43.044 --> 00:18:45.685
we're driving down the cobblestone road.

00:18:45.685 --> 00:18:48.870
From here, we're driving
to the village market.

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:53.037
(atmospheric slow pulsating beat music)

00:19:02.037 --> 00:19:04.394
This looks like a pretty cool
market, kind of on the side

00:19:04.394 --> 00:19:07.581
of the mountain, and we're all
gonna see what we find here.

00:19:07.581 --> 00:19:10.493
This market is so cool because
it has such a community,

00:19:10.493 --> 00:19:11.987
mountain feel to it.

00:19:11.987 --> 00:19:16.903
People from this entire little
area community they come here

00:19:16.903 --> 00:19:21.890
to socialize, to sell things
that they specialize in.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:26.057
Another great market, so
much to see, so many smells,

00:19:26.963 --> 00:19:29.899
so many colorful ingredients.

00:19:29.899 --> 00:19:32.937
There's food cooking,
there's fresh ingredients.

00:19:32.937 --> 00:19:35.604
(food sizzling)

00:19:50.797 --> 00:19:51.949
Oh, okay.

00:19:51.949 --> 00:19:55.532
(market people chattering)

00:19:59.681 --> 00:20:00.942
Xie xie.

00:20:00.942 --> 00:20:04.431
Something that's very common
in the Bai ethnic culture

00:20:04.431 --> 00:20:07.014
culinary scene is pork sashimi.

00:20:08.153 --> 00:20:11.826
Completely raw pig, and so
she is slicing up some pork

00:20:11.826 --> 00:20:14.530
right here, that's all
gonna be pork sashimi,

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.802
and she just cut me a piece of the skin.

00:20:16.802 --> 00:20:21.476
Looks kind of like a little
piece of chewing gum here.

00:20:21.476 --> 00:20:25.476
Whoa, that is kinda like
a piece of chewing gum.

00:20:27.553 --> 00:20:29.954
Okay, it's actually quite awesome though.

00:20:29.954 --> 00:20:33.960
It's very leathery,
like extremely leathery,

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.462
kind of like blubbery.

00:20:36.462 --> 00:20:39.697
With some chili oil, that
could be really good.

00:20:39.697 --> 00:20:40.530
Xie, xie.

00:20:44.216 --> 00:20:46.560
And she gave me another piece
and this one I'm reaching

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.807
in, these are all the sauce condiments.

00:20:48.807 --> 00:20:51.367
You can mix your sauce but,
since we're just standing here

00:20:51.367 --> 00:20:53.880
eating I'm just eat a
little bit of that chili oil

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.047
on this piece of pig skin.

00:20:58.946 --> 00:21:00.863
Definitely interesting.

00:21:01.839 --> 00:21:04.496
It's pretty good, actually,
with that chili oil,

00:21:04.496 --> 00:21:06.377
that makes it better, that's for sure.

00:21:06.377 --> 00:21:08.456
This is some pretty hard
core eating right here,

00:21:08.456 --> 00:21:12.143
just straight up fresh
pig, just minced up.

00:21:12.143 --> 00:21:14.544
You get some slices of the fat,

00:21:14.544 --> 00:21:18.711
you get some minced raw
pig, and you get the skin.

00:21:19.655 --> 00:21:22.185
Skin was pretty tasty, but
we're actually gonna go

00:21:22.185 --> 00:21:25.280
to a restaurant for
lunch right after this.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.947
That was a very cool experience.

00:21:32.815 --> 00:21:36.462
(Luxi speaks in foreign language)

00:21:36.462 --> 00:21:37.751
It's called a chicken mushroom

00:21:37.751 --> 00:21:39.335
because it tastes like chicken.

00:21:39.335 --> 00:21:41.835
(jazzy music)

00:21:44.983 --> 00:21:46.150
It does kind of taste like chicken,

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.650
it's really, really flavorful.

00:21:49.991 --> 00:21:54.320
(market people chattering)

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.336
The market was very
cool, especially the lady

00:21:56.336 --> 00:21:59.976
who served me the raw pig
skin, she was amazing.

00:21:59.976 --> 00:22:01.484
We're now off to go eat lunch.

00:22:01.484 --> 00:22:05.651
(atmospheric slow pulsating beat music)

00:22:07.761 --> 00:22:11.425
(Luxi speaks in foreign language)

00:22:11.425 --> 00:22:12.783
We just made it to the lunch restaurant,

00:22:12.783 --> 00:22:14.697
and we're in the kitchen now.

00:22:14.697 --> 00:22:17.355
I think you can come in the
kitchen to sort through their

00:22:17.355 --> 00:22:20.114
(mumbles), they have the fridge just full,

00:22:20.114 --> 00:22:22.266
it just looks like a rainbow of colors.

00:22:22.266 --> 00:22:25.200
There's flowers, there's
mushrooms, vegetables.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.370
Very good things are
happening in this kitchen.

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:29.547
- [Luxi] We have pork sashimi,

00:22:29.547 --> 00:22:32.464
and we have this pine needle salad.

00:22:34.513 --> 00:22:38.680
(kitchen workers speaking
in foreign language)

00:22:39.824 --> 00:22:44.080
- [Mark] You can see
yourself in the screen.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.247
(kitchen workers speaking
in foreign language)

00:22:52.381 --> 00:22:54.715
- [Mark] People in Yunnan
are so friendly too.

00:22:54.715 --> 00:22:55.801
Just check this guy out.

00:22:55.801 --> 00:22:57.418
Look at the gills on that mushroom,

00:22:57.418 --> 00:22:59.138
and look at that blue color.

00:22:59.138 --> 00:23:01.610
If I didn't know this was
edible I would definitely think

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:03.943
it was a dangerous mushroom.

00:23:22.566 --> 00:23:25.233
(food sizzling)

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:36.278
Now he's preparing all the
dishes that require a wok.

00:23:36.278 --> 00:23:39.244
And his wok skills are just impressive,

00:23:39.244 --> 00:23:41.972
he just flies on that
wok, on and off the fire,

00:23:41.972 --> 00:23:45.232
it's roaring like a jet engine.

00:23:45.232 --> 00:23:47.899
(food sizzling)

00:24:00.842 --> 00:24:02.612
I think they are done
with all of our dishes.

00:24:02.612 --> 00:24:05.897
They have cooked everything,
that was one of those meals

00:24:05.897 --> 00:24:09.161
that you watch being cooked
and it's just breathtaking.

00:24:09.161 --> 00:24:10.828
Oh, nice, very nice.

00:24:12.154 --> 00:24:15.654
- [Woman] Micah, sit down, Micah sit down.

00:24:21.113 --> 00:24:22.353
- [Mark] Most of the
dishes that we ordered,

00:24:22.353 --> 00:24:26.520
these are Yunnanese Bai
dishes, the Bai ethnic group.

00:24:27.838 --> 00:24:30.758
There's some very, very
interesting dishes that we got.

00:24:30.758 --> 00:24:33.509
I'm like actually, this
is one of those meals

00:24:33.509 --> 00:24:35.251
where I'm starting to shake a little bit

00:24:35.251 --> 00:24:38.246
because I'm so excited to
taste all of the dishes,

00:24:38.246 --> 00:24:40.399
and the anticipation build
up watching them cook

00:24:40.399 --> 00:24:44.513
all of the dishes in the
kitchen, it was breathtaking.

00:24:44.513 --> 00:24:46.518
I got a little taste test, a little teaser

00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:48.402
of the skin back at the market.

00:24:48.402 --> 00:24:52.873
So normally, throughout China,
especially pork would be

00:24:52.873 --> 00:24:56.712
cooked pretty, pretty well
done, pretty, pretty thoroughly.

00:24:56.712 --> 00:25:00.890
And my mother is Chinese,
and my Chinese family,

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:05.881
they have often, they always
indicate that you really need

00:25:05.881 --> 00:25:07.593
to cook that pork well-done.

00:25:07.593 --> 00:25:10.969
This is the exact opposite
of what you've been told

00:25:10.969 --> 00:25:13.417
about cooking pork all the way through.

00:25:13.417 --> 00:25:16.216
This is pork sashimi,
that is just straight up

00:25:16.216 --> 00:25:17.966
minced pig, red meat.

00:25:18.823 --> 00:25:20.760
And I'm gonna go ahead
and dip this in the sauce.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.954
You can see the sauce is just
loaded as well, there's lots

00:25:23.954 --> 00:25:28.256
of dried chilis in there, you
can smell the Sichuan pepper.

00:25:28.256 --> 00:25:30.273
I think there's probably some vinegar

00:25:30.273 --> 00:25:33.856
and maybe some sesame
oil in there as well.

00:25:36.493 --> 00:25:38.826
Oh, oh, oh that's delicious.

00:25:39.835 --> 00:25:42.472
It's definitely raw pork,
you don't really taste

00:25:42.472 --> 00:25:45.403
the rawness of it because
it's doused in that sauce,

00:25:45.403 --> 00:25:49.628
and that sauce is just
a complexity of chili,

00:25:49.628 --> 00:25:53.378
you taste the sourness,
you taste the floral,

00:25:54.243 --> 00:25:56.827
kind of citrusiness of the
Sichuan pepper in there.

00:25:56.827 --> 00:26:00.994
The sauce is an absolute must
that makes it crazy good.

00:26:04.902 --> 00:26:07.819
Oh, that one is a little less chewy

00:26:08.821 --> 00:26:09.843
than the one I had before.

00:26:09.843 --> 00:26:12.809
That almost has a little snap to it.

00:26:12.809 --> 00:26:14.330
This is an eggplant salad.

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:17.364
They fire-roasted eggplant,
and then they peeled out

00:26:17.364 --> 00:26:20.691
the insides all nice
and mushy and beautiful.

00:26:20.691 --> 00:26:23.738
Then they mixed it with
some dried chili flakes,

00:26:23.738 --> 00:26:26.659
there's some herbs in
there, and the trick,

00:26:26.659 --> 00:26:29.075
the secret of this dish is he added

00:26:29.075 --> 00:26:31.464
a spoonful of lard into the wok.

00:26:31.464 --> 00:26:34.329
He brought it to a rolling
boil and then just poured

00:26:34.329 --> 00:26:36.752
this all over it, and
then they mixed it all up,

00:26:36.752 --> 00:26:38.696
and so that's this dish.

00:26:38.696 --> 00:26:41.196
It looks absolutely fantastic.

00:26:45.436 --> 00:26:49.561
Mmm, it's kind of served a little bit cold

00:26:49.561 --> 00:26:51.960
but that's amazing.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:54.080
You can taste the
smokiness of the eggplant,

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.913
you can taste the dried chili in there.

00:26:55.913 --> 00:26:57.440
The herbs are mixed in,
there's green onions,

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:00.377
there's some cilantro in there too.

00:27:00.377 --> 00:27:02.550
Next up, this is also a
really interesting dish,

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:04.068
which is a pine needle salad.

00:27:04.068 --> 00:27:07.635
Luxi was telling me that this
is one of the only species

00:27:07.635 --> 00:27:11.976
of pine tree that you can eat
the needles, that are edible.

00:27:11.976 --> 00:27:13.569
They blanched the pine
needles and then they mixed it

00:27:13.569 --> 00:27:15.010
with a bunch of spices.

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:17.298
You can see the chilis mixed throughout.

00:27:17.298 --> 00:27:19.343
They added some Sichuan pepper, I think.

00:27:19.343 --> 00:27:20.727
And then again I think he added some lard

00:27:20.727 --> 00:27:23.670
to this as well for
the dressing of course.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:27.837
(atmospheric slow pulsating beat music)

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.937
Wow, okay, immediately, the
first thing that you taste

00:27:35.013 --> 00:27:38.303
is that kind of like aroma that you smell

00:27:38.303 --> 00:27:40.678
when you smell a pine tree.

00:27:40.678 --> 00:27:42.551
But you can taste that in your mouth.

00:27:42.551 --> 00:27:43.877
Oh, it's wonderful.

00:27:43.877 --> 00:27:48.044
And then, the needles, they
have a little bit of a crispness

00:27:48.919 --> 00:27:52.816
to them, then you got all that
flavor from the dried chili.

00:27:52.816 --> 00:27:56.983
Okay we got some broad beans,
which are also stir-fried.

00:28:00.224 --> 00:28:02.777
Excellent, those have
more of a silky texture

00:28:02.777 --> 00:28:04.415
rather than a starchy texture.

00:28:04.415 --> 00:28:06.799
Yunnan is so famous, so
well-known throughout China

00:28:06.799 --> 00:28:08.466
for their mushrooms.

00:28:09.871 --> 00:28:13.853
Mmmm, oh the mushrooms
are really, really tender.

00:28:13.853 --> 00:28:18.017
Mushrooms are literally like
meat for the depth of umami

00:28:18.017 --> 00:28:19.782
and flavor that they can provide.

00:28:19.782 --> 00:28:24.471
(atmospheric slow pulsating beat music)

00:28:24.471 --> 00:28:26.463
What an amazing feast.

00:28:26.463 --> 00:28:28.646
This one is just a classic
stir-fry, he added in

00:28:28.646 --> 00:28:30.945
some dry chilis, there's some,

00:28:30.945 --> 00:28:32.559
are they spring onions or leek?

00:28:32.559 --> 00:28:35.726
- [Luxi] Spring onion and garlic leaf.

00:28:39.361 --> 00:28:41.594
- It has such a smoky wok taste.

00:28:41.594 --> 00:28:45.620
It's a little oily and
delicious, absolutely delicious.

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:49.509
One more dish that they
kindly offered us, gave us,

00:28:49.509 --> 00:28:51.176
is this snail salad.

00:28:52.307 --> 00:28:55.916
Mmm, oh that kind of
like pops in your mouth.

00:28:55.916 --> 00:28:57.728
It's not even chewy, actually, it's more,

00:28:57.728 --> 00:29:00.130
again it kind of like snaps in your mouth

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:02.713
without being elastic-y at all.

00:29:05.826 --> 00:29:08.518
Okay all the food is
incredibly good, but I think

00:29:08.518 --> 00:29:12.268
as far as uniqueness
and Bai cultural dishes,

00:29:15.259 --> 00:29:19.037
this pine needle salad
is one of the highlights

00:29:19.037 --> 00:29:20.733
of the meal right here.

00:29:20.733 --> 00:29:23.816
Along with the pig sashimi of course.

00:29:28.428 --> 00:29:30.532
It's absolutely spectacular.

00:29:30.532 --> 00:29:32.590
When you come to Yunnan,
when you come to Dali,

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:35.338
this is the dish you have to seek out.

00:29:35.338 --> 00:29:38.029
Okay, now I'm gonna move
back into the pig sashimi,

00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:41.093
and I'm gonna make a bite that counts.

00:29:41.093 --> 00:29:45.260
(atmospheric slow pulsating beat music)

00:30:05.055 --> 00:30:09.135
I'm just blown away by this entire meal.

00:30:09.135 --> 00:30:12.687
The flavor of chilis
is so well pronounced.

00:30:12.687 --> 00:30:15.520
The natural ingredients, the herbs

00:30:16.805 --> 00:30:18.504
that they used in their cooking.

00:30:18.504 --> 00:30:21.935
I loved the mushrooms,
I loved the naturalness

00:30:21.935 --> 00:30:25.951
of this entire feast,
and just how they've made

00:30:25.951 --> 00:30:28.451
such good use of what's local.

00:30:30.133 --> 00:30:31.607
Local ingredients.

00:30:31.607 --> 00:30:33.831
And I think that's what makes this food

00:30:33.831 --> 00:30:36.063
and this meal so incredibly good.

00:30:36.063 --> 00:30:39.694
As well as just all those,
they cook with love here,

00:30:39.694 --> 00:30:40.623
that's for sure.

00:30:40.623 --> 00:30:44.790
(atmospheric slow pulsating beat music)

00:30:55.104 --> 00:30:57.687
I'm very, very happy right now.

00:31:04.247 --> 00:31:08.164
Wow, that was just an
absolutely stunning meal.

00:31:09.216 --> 00:31:11.817
I'm a little off-balance after that meal.

00:31:11.817 --> 00:31:14.792
That was a crazy good meal.

00:31:14.792 --> 00:31:15.954
Xie xie.

00:31:15.954 --> 00:31:16.787
Thank you.

00:31:17.764 --> 00:31:18.597
Xie xie.

00:31:18.597 --> 00:31:20.180
Thank you, bye bye.

00:31:21.076 --> 00:31:25.243
(atmospheric slow pulsating beat music)

00:31:26.643 --> 00:31:29.365
On the way driving back
towards the old town of Dali,

00:31:29.365 --> 00:31:31.652
we are stopping by Erhai Lake.

00:31:31.652 --> 00:31:34.884
This is a beautiful, high-elevation lake.

00:31:34.884 --> 00:31:37.986
The water is gorgeous, and it stretches

00:31:37.986 --> 00:31:39.043
really, really long.

00:31:39.043 --> 00:31:42.764
If you look at a map this
is really a long and narrow

00:31:42.764 --> 00:31:46.038
lake, and it's beautiful scenery,

00:31:46.038 --> 00:31:48.714
another one of the
iconic landmarks of Dali.

00:31:48.714 --> 00:31:52.881
(atmospheric slow pulsating beat music)

00:32:04.022 --> 00:32:08.117
We drove over to Dali old
town, and this is a beautiful

00:32:08.117 --> 00:32:10.245
walking streets, there's shopping,

00:32:10.245 --> 00:32:12.540
there's restaurants,
it's very picturesque.

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:13.373
We're gonna have dinner.

00:32:13.373 --> 00:32:17.540
Lunch was not, pig sashimi and
lunch was not that long ago,

00:32:18.395 --> 00:32:20.379
but I'm ready for dinner.

00:32:20.379 --> 00:32:22.657
We got a table upstairs, and this is like

00:32:22.657 --> 00:32:26.636
an old-style house, really,
really nice restaurant.

00:32:26.636 --> 00:32:29.656
I got a seat right here on the wall,

00:32:29.656 --> 00:32:32.524
but you don't want to
lean back too, too far.

00:32:32.524 --> 00:32:33.524
Pretty cool.

00:32:35.378 --> 00:32:37.632
We ordered some of their
signature dishes here.

00:32:37.632 --> 00:32:42.201
And it really is, it looks
really, really good quality.

00:32:42.201 --> 00:32:44.027
This is a nice sit-down restaurant.

00:32:44.027 --> 00:32:47.048
We got some of their spareribs,
we got, this is a dish

00:32:47.048 --> 00:32:50.415
that I'm excited to try which is chicken,

00:32:50.415 --> 00:32:54.546
somehow kind of marinated in
Pu-erh tea, and Pu-erh tea

00:32:54.546 --> 00:32:58.825
is a fermented black tea
which is famous in Yunnan.

00:32:58.825 --> 00:33:00.881
Look at all those chilis
just caked up on there,

00:33:00.881 --> 00:33:03.023
that is absolutely gorgeous.

00:33:03.023 --> 00:33:06.227
And Sichuan pepper, it's just loaded.

00:33:06.227 --> 00:33:10.144
Oh, and there's just
layers of chicken as well.

00:33:12.091 --> 00:33:13.953
Yeah, that is amazing.

00:33:13.953 --> 00:33:16.520
You can taste a little bit
of that tea flavor in there,

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.290
but then that chili is so fragrant,

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:21.450
the Sichuan pepper to eat out of there.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:23.533
Oh, oh, oh, those chilis,

00:33:26.411 --> 00:33:28.507
they have so much flavor

00:33:28.507 --> 00:33:31.252
and they're just purely crispy.

00:33:31.252 --> 00:33:34.335
That, along with rice is just insane.

00:33:36.851 --> 00:33:38.780
So those are all thin strips of cheese?

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.324
In this cheese salad there's
carrot, and all the thin

00:33:41.324 --> 00:33:44.633
strips of white, I think
that's thin strips of cheese.

00:33:44.633 --> 00:33:46.716
There's peanuts in there.

00:33:50.954 --> 00:33:53.704
Mmmm, oh, that's a lot of flavor.

00:33:55.987 --> 00:33:59.654
It almost has a smokey
bacon-y flavor to it.

00:34:00.798 --> 00:34:02.349
It's kind of like a papaya salad

00:34:02.349 --> 00:34:04.516
but with strips of cheese.

00:34:08.588 --> 00:34:12.755
Oh, oh it's so tender, and
it has a silky texture to it.

00:34:14.877 --> 00:34:19.044
And then, oh that's just
like pure comfort porkiness.

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:24.878
This one is a Dai style
salad, and it originates

00:34:24.878 --> 00:34:28.045
near to the Myanmar, maybe Lao border.

00:34:29.175 --> 00:34:32.184
There's mushrooms in here,
there's sawtooth herb,

00:34:32.184 --> 00:34:35.254
and there are pieces of ginger as well.

00:34:35.254 --> 00:34:38.754
This looks very light and very refreshing.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:41.964
Oh, a little dribble.

00:34:41.964 --> 00:34:44.148
I really like the ginger in there,

00:34:44.148 --> 00:34:47.079
and tangy, astringent dressing.

00:34:47.079 --> 00:34:50.324
Fresh food really refreshing,
really, really tasty.

00:34:50.324 --> 00:34:54.491
(atmospheric slow pulsating beat music)

00:34:57.436 --> 00:34:58.519
Cheese salad.

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:05.189
This is another beautiful looking dessert.

00:35:05.189 --> 00:35:08.779
I think it's some type of,
it looks kind of like yogurt.

00:35:08.779 --> 00:35:12.946
(atmospheric slow pulsating beat music)

00:35:14.601 --> 00:35:15.934
Oh that is nice.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.959
That's delicious, yeah.

00:35:18.959 --> 00:35:22.142
(atmospheric slow pulsating beat music)

00:35:22.142 --> 00:35:23.772
Just finished with
dinner, totally different

00:35:23.772 --> 00:35:25.547
from what we ate earlier in the day,

00:35:25.547 --> 00:35:27.158
from the meal we ate earlier in the day.

00:35:27.158 --> 00:35:30.146
This was more of a modern but really,

00:35:30.146 --> 00:35:31.754
really well done restaurant.

00:35:31.754 --> 00:35:34.742
A little bit trendy, delicious flavors,

00:35:34.742 --> 00:35:37.866
and it's right within the
old town here in Dali.

00:35:37.866 --> 00:35:40.386
Wow, that was a lot of food.

00:35:40.386 --> 00:35:44.019
It's been a fantastic day
of Chinese food in Yunnan.

00:35:44.019 --> 00:35:47.363
Oh man, the highlight for
me today was probably lunch.

00:35:47.363 --> 00:35:49.139
That was a spectacular meal.

00:35:49.139 --> 00:35:51.404
I want to say a huge thank you to Luxi,

00:35:51.404 --> 00:35:53.546

00:35:53.546 --> 00:35:56.819

Frank from Zouba Tours,
