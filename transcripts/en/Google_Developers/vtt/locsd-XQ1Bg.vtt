00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:07.230
Today we're going to focus
on what's called a one

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.920
pager, or an executive summary.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.140
Something that you
send to an investor

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.690
in order to get a meeting.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.250
You've got your start up,
you're starting to raise funds,

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.040
and now you need
a snapshot of what

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.020
you do to get people
interested in calling you in.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.850
Well, there's absolutely
no way that you're

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.100
going to be able to tell
your entire story on one

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.040
page or even two pages.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.650
So you just want
to intrigue them.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.910
You want to give them
just enough of the story

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.480
to get them excited about it,
to see that you have something

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.579
innovative and
new, and something

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.120
that has a market out there that
they can make some money off

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.619
of.

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:40.550
And then, that's
enough to call you in.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.360
So you're not endeavoring
to get an investment out

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.640
of this piece of paper.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.530
What you're endeavoring
to get is a meeting.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.270
So you want to get them
just excited enough.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.307
Well similar to a pitch, we
want to start with the pain.

00:00:52.307 --> 00:00:54.890
You want them to understand that
there's a problem that you're

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.010
addressing, so maybe
about a paragraph--

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.980
or at the most, two-- addressing
the fact that there's a gap.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.575
Something is not solved.

00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:03.950
And you want to
write in language

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.990
that's very conversational,
very flowing.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.406
You want them to
feel like they're

00:01:07.406 --> 00:01:10.580
sitting in a room with you and
you're describing it to them.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.530
Not a lot of technical speak,
not a lot of very high language

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.270
and big words.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.040
That does the
opposite of impress.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.670
That kind of depresses.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.000
So get them understanding
that there's a pain

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.980
and get them to feel that pain.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.660
Now, it's always nice to write
a little headline about the pain

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.618
and about the solution.

00:01:26.618 --> 00:01:29.350
So if they're just scanning
the page, they can kind of see,

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.590
oh, here's a one liner
that describes it.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.590
And then they dig down and read.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.420
Now, you want to be able to
explain your startup first

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.770
in one line.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.620
We do X for Y by Z, which
would be your secret sauce.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.710
Now when we say
secret sauce, we mean

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.760
something that's just
unique to you, something

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.380
that you do that others
don't, your secret weapon.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.570
Something that really will set
you apart and get them excited.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.080
Then you can move on to
features and benefits.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.940
You don't want to give
any more than seven

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.857
or any less than five.

00:01:59.857 --> 00:02:01.231
You want them to
see that there's

00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:02.900
some exciting things
happening there,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.370
but you don't want
to just run off

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.870
an endless list of features.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.050
You want to really give
them the exciting bits that

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.650
make them see that there's
a real need for this.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.050
Next thing you
want to talk about

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.360
is your current
status and traction.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.440
What phase are you at
of your development?

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.070
Are you in alpha, do you have
a working prototype, beta,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.890
paying customers,
making any money?

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.020
They really need to know where
you're at in your process.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.720
Do you have any IP
or patentability?

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.720
Have you filed a patent?

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.949
Do you have a patent pending?

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:33.990
These are very important
things for them to know.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.534
Have you gotten any
funding up until now?

00:02:36.534 --> 00:02:38.200
These are all questions
you'll be asked.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.940
So basically, we're thinking of
their questions ahead of time

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.070
and answering them
on the one pager.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.570
Now that they got what
you do and they're

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.920
kind of getting excited
about the features,

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.790
what's the next question
they want to know?

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.730
How big is the market and is
there really an opportunity?

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.920
So in the addressable
market section

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.860
you want to talk
about big numbers.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.760
How big is your market?

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.990
How many users are there?

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.950
What's the value?

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.600
How much have people spent
on related items or related

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.060
products and services, showing
that you truly have a market?

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.990
Then we want to talk about
how you'll enter that market,

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.280
or your go to market strategies.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.430
So how are you
going to get users?

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.050
It could be your end users or
could be your distributors.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.190
So will you have distribution
channels, people that actually

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.000
will resell your items?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.210
Will you have
strategic partnerships

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.980
with big organizations
that maybe

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.910
will help you get the word out?

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.120
Will you just take out
ads on social campaigns,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.835
or maybe talk to
bloggers, blog yourself?

00:03:36.835 --> 00:03:38.710
There's a lot of different
ways to get there.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.190
So you want to examine the
strategies that are out there

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.490
and think of the
top three or four

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.370
that really will make
sense and work for you.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.380
Now comes the money time.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.290
The business model
or business models.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.050
How are you going to make money?

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.280
Again it might seem a
little bit silly or funny

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.040
at the beginning of
a start up to say,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.165
well, here's how exactly
we're going to make money,

00:03:59.165 --> 00:04:00.970
when you might not even
have a product yet.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.750
And that's OK.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.490
Investors understand
that that's probably

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.560
going to be the thing
that shifts the most.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.800
But you want to
give them a clue.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.190
You want to give them an
idea, an inkling, that you

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.630
know what you're talking about.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.950
So what business model
works best for you

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.480
is it a freemium model?

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.029
Are their premium services
that you'll be selling?

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:20.990
Another really important piece
that you want to talk about

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.630
are your competitors.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.130
Now on a one pager,
the best thing to do

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.950
is try to divide
your competitors

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.450
into different types--
maybe three or four types--

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.650
where you might
belong to one of them.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.090
And talk about the big players--
maybe the top three big players

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.920
in each.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.980
You want to talk about what
this competitor type does,

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.070
and what they're lacking
that you actually

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.450
bring to the table.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.070
Of course we want to
talk about the team.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.880
Now unfortunately, on a
one pager or a two pager,

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.640
there's not enough room to
put in everybody's resumes.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.880
So you want to give two or
three bullet points on each team

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.350
member that shows their
core competencies, that

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.820
shows their biggest
strengths and skills.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.540
And finally-- probably
the most important part--

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.380
funding requirements,
or "the ask."

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.580
How much money are
you seeking to raise?

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.342
And don't do ranges.

00:05:08.342 --> 00:05:10.300
Investors want to know
how much you're raising.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.650
So you might change it
from investor to investor,

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.920
but go ahead and
decide on a sum.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.810
And then at the end you can
write your objective statement.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.470
This will bring us to 18
months and break even,

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.880
or cash flow positive.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.884
Because they want to see
how long this will last

00:05:24.884 --> 00:05:27.300
and if you're actually going
to be making money, or you're

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.395
going to need to seek a
bigger investment later on.

00:05:30.395 --> 00:05:31.270
So there you have it.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.960
Now, as a little bonus, I like
to add in a little section

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.460
I call key investment
merits, or why us, why now.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.720
On the front page you want to
put on your top five or six

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.140
bullets that you make you
an attractive investment

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.130
opportunity.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.180
Pull out the highlights
so that they really

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.580
see what's special about you.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.099
Now, it might be the last
thing that you write,

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.640
but you want it to
be the first thing

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.670
that they see because
it really will call them

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.790
into reading your document.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.300
Oh, and of course, don't forget
your contact information.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.990
Choose one point of
contact, probably the CEO.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.960
Put your phone number, your
email-- put a full phone number

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.790
if you want people
from other countries

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.020
to be able to call you-- and
the best place to reach you,

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.410
your company name, and
where you're located.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.740
If you have several offices
you can write that as well.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.740
So there you have it.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.573
There's the content.

00:06:21.573 --> 00:06:24.880
