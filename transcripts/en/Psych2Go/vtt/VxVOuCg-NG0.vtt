What is Maladaptive Daydreaming?

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.200
Have you ever sat through a boring class?

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.580
Only to find yourself drifting into a daydream?

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.020
Maybe you have dreamt about laying in paradise,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.560
Minutes before checking out of a shift

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.760
In most cases,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.640
We daydream when we wish to be elsewhere

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.020
but can't change the current setting or situation just yet.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.060
It sounds harmless, creative, and fun right?

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.180
But too much of anything is always bad for you.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.960
Here's what you need to know about maladaptive daydreaming

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.480
What is it?

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.200
Maladaptive daydreaming is a term first coined by Professor Eli Somer.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.980
It is a psychiatric phenomenon that can interfere

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.600
with you ability to carry out daily tasks

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.860
including your academics, work, and other regular activities.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.420
Professor Somer found that maladaptive day dreaming occurs in people's lives that have suffered from severe trauma.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.940
As a result, they would daydream in order to escape their harsh painful realities.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.540
What's interesting about maladaptive daydreaming is that it actually isn't represented in the DSM handbook

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.460
that psychologists often refer to when diagnosing patients.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.620
However, some professionals believe it is a mental disorder that can severely affect the individual.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.280
What are the symptoms?

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.360
People who experience maladaptive daydreaming

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.760
often get triggered  by real life traumatizing events or mere reminders of them.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.740
They usually have very vivid detailed daydreams that contain rich, imaginative plots.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.780
You might whisper during these daydreams

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.180
which can last for hours and effect your ability to finish tasks.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.820
You might have trouble sleeping at night too.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.480
Maladaptive daydreaming can also coexist with

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.960
other psychiatric problems including ADD, OCD, and depression.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.360
Is there treatment for it?

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.600
Unfortunately, there is no known treatment for maladaptive daydreaming.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.440
However there are techniques you can use

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.440
to reduce the symptoms such as avoiding potentially triggering people, places, and situations.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.260
There is also medication one can take to manage their daydreams.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.440
