00:00:01.614 --> 00:00:02.957
- [Narrator] So in previous videos

00:00:02.957 --> 00:00:04.754
we talked about the claim that if

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:05.671
I have two random variables, x and y,

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:07.834
that are independent, then the variance

00:00:07.834 --> 00:00:10.675
of the sum of those two random variables

00:00:10.675 --> 00:00:13.070
or the difference of
those two random variables

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.810
is going to be equal to
the sum of the variances.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.245
So that if you have independent

00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:19.202
random variables, your variation

00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:22.333
is going to increase when you take

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.117
a sum or a difference.

00:00:24.117 --> 00:00:26.234
And we've built a little
bit of intuition there.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:27.758
What I wanna talk about in this video,

00:00:27.758 --> 00:00:30.089
it's really about building
even more intuition,

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.324
is get a gut feeling for why this

00:00:32.324 --> 00:00:36.178
independence is important
for making this claim.

00:00:36.178 --> 00:00:37.774
And to get that intuition, let's

00:00:37.774 --> 00:00:39.487
look at two random variables that are

00:00:39.487 --> 00:00:40.922
definitely random variables but that

00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:42.997
are definitely not independent.

00:00:42.997 --> 00:00:46.330
So let's let x is equal to the number

00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:50.692
of hours that the next person you meet,

00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:56.700
so I'll say random person,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.200
random person slept yesterday.

00:01:05.063 --> 00:01:07.480
And let's say that y is equal

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.107
to the number of hours that same

00:01:13.678 --> 00:01:15.928
person was awake yesterday.

00:01:22.696 --> 00:01:25.145
And appreciate why these are not

00:01:25.145 --> 00:01:27.032
independent random variables.

00:01:27.032 --> 00:01:30.365
One of them is gonna
completely determine the other.

00:01:30.365 --> 00:01:31.262
If I slept eight hours yesterday

00:01:31.262 --> 00:01:33.989
then I would have been awake for 16 hours.

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:35.251
Or if I slept for 16 hours then I

00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:37.120
would have been awake for eight hours.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.398
We know that x plus y, even though

00:01:40.398 --> 00:01:41.846
they're random variables, and there

00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:43.631
could be variation in x and there could

00:01:43.631 --> 00:01:44.514
be variation in y.

00:01:44.514 --> 00:01:45.575
But for any given person, remember,

00:01:45.575 --> 00:01:47.473
these are still based on that same person.

00:01:47.473 --> 00:01:51.556
X plus y is always going
to be equal to 24 hours.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.453
So these are not
independent, not independent.

00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:02.001
If you're given one of the variables

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:04.947
it would completely determine
what the other variable is.

00:02:04.947 --> 00:02:06.730
The probability of getting a certain

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.600
value for one variable is going to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.599
be very different, given what value

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.615
you got for the other variable.

00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:14.703
So they're not independent at all.

00:02:14.703 --> 00:02:16.795
So in this situation, if someone said,

00:02:16.795 --> 00:02:19.172
let's just say for the sake of argument,

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:21.089
that the variance of x,

00:02:22.316 --> 00:02:26.233
the variance of x is
equal to, I don't know,

00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:30.230
let's say it's equal to four,

00:02:31.352 --> 00:02:34.235
the unit's four variance so
it would be squared hours.

00:02:34.235 --> 00:02:36.558
So four hours squared.

00:02:36.558 --> 00:02:38.917
We could say that the standard deviation

00:02:38.917 --> 00:02:42.269
for x in this case would be two hours.

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.805
And let's say that the variance,

00:02:43.805 --> 00:02:46.050
let's say the standard deviation of y

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.300
is also equal to two hours.

00:02:50.884 --> 00:02:53.363
And let's say that the variance of y,

00:02:53.363 --> 00:02:56.103
variance of y, well it would be the square

00:02:56.103 --> 00:02:57.496
of the standard deviation.

00:02:57.496 --> 00:03:00.189
And so it would be four hours,

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:03.889
four hours squared would be our units.

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.671
So if we just tried to blindly say,

00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:08.632
"Oh, I'm just gonna apply this little

00:03:08.632 --> 00:03:10.644
"expression, this claim we have,"

00:03:10.644 --> 00:03:12.125
without thinking about the independents

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.154
we would try to say,
"Well then, the variance

00:03:14.154 --> 00:03:17.821
"of x plus y, the variance of x plus y

00:03:21.043 --> 00:03:23.404
"must be equal to the
sum of their variances."

00:03:23.404 --> 00:03:25.887
So it would be four plus four.

00:03:25.887 --> 00:03:29.054
So is it equal to eight hours squared?

00:03:32.336 --> 00:03:34.250
Well that doesn't make any sense.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.964
Because we know that a random variable

00:03:36.964 --> 00:03:39.762
that is equal to x plus y, this is always

00:03:39.762 --> 00:03:41.311
going to be 24 hours.

00:03:41.311 --> 00:03:44.128
In fact, it's not going
to have any variation.

00:03:44.128 --> 00:03:47.099
X plus y is always gonna be 24 hours.

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:49.405
So for these two random variables,

00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:51.871
because they are so connected.

00:03:51.871 --> 00:03:53.942
They are not independent at all,

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:56.551
this is actually going to be zero.

00:03:56.551 --> 00:03:58.655
There is zero variance here.

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:01.279
X plus y is always going to be 24.

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:04.164
At least on earth where
we have a 24 hour day.

00:04:04.164 --> 00:04:05.408
I guess if someone lived on another

00:04:05.408 --> 00:04:07.414
planet or something it
could be slightly different.

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:08.369
And we're assuming that we have

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:10.984
an exactly 24 hour day on earth.

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:13.201
So this is to give you a gut sense

00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:16.420
of why independence matters
for making this claim.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.956
And if you have things
that are not independent

00:04:17.956 --> 00:04:19.669
it gives you a good sense for why

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.428
this claim doesn't hold up as much.
