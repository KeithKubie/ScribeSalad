00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.320
Malaria is a devastating disease that affects
millions worldwide but new research has found

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.850
that the bark of two trees in Africa may be
the key to destroying, not only the malaria

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.710
parasite, but also the mosquito responsible
for transmitting the disease to humans!

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.150
Malaria is one of the most widely distributed
diseases in the world, that affected over

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.990
200 million people and led to 438,000 deaths
worldwide in 2015 alone.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.380
The disease is caused by parasites that are
spread to humans by female Anopheles mosquitoes.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.470
The symptoms can include fever, seizures,
and acute kidney failure.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.039
Malaria can remain in a personâ€™s system
for months, even years, leading to relapses.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.180
Thus, preventing the spread of malaria can
potentially save countless lives, but how

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.860
exactly can the bark of a tree solve the problem?

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.969
Well, locals in West Africa have long used
native vegetation, including tree bark from

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.219
local trees to help treat malaria.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.810
In 2011, an entomologist in the Republic of
Congo claimed that the bark of the Olon tree,

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.870
which is part of the citrus family, was able
to kill the mosquitoes that spread malaria,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.309
as well as cockroaches and weevils.

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.880
Researchers created an extract from the bark
and found that not only did it kill the mosquitoes,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.910
but it also killed the malaria parasite itself!

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.190
When scientists took a closer look, they determined
that two separate compounds were at work.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.409
One compound called pellitorine killed mosquitoes
and another compound, dihydronitidine destroyed

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.000
the malaria parasite!

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.390
And they found a similar tree species in Mali
that also has the pellitorine.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.140
These discoveries could the potentially save
hundreds of thousands of lives a year; however,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.659
the pharmaceutical industry has not shown
interest in conducting clinical trials...yet.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.829
In the meantime, researchers are hoping to
educate locals about the benefits of the extract

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.549
including encouraging them to spray puddles
with the solution to kill mosquitoes.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.149
What if there were no mosquitoes?!

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:45.149
Is that possible?

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.720
Find out in this video from Trace and myself!

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.380
And what do you think?

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.580
If you could get rid of mosquitoes all together,
would you?

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.680
Or do you see a benefit in having them around?

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.060
