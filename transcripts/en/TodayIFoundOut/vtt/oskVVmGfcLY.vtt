00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:08.900
Do Fish Really Like Eating Earthworms?

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.830
Worms, or more specifically earthworms which
are by far what most people mean when they

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.130
use the term “worms” in the fishing scenario,
don’t live in water.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.380
In fact, the reason you see so many on the
ground during heavy rains is because, when

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.370
stuck in soil that is too wet, they can’t
breathe properly and must come up for air,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.800
despite the extreme risks to their lives in
doing so.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.219
You see, while earthworms don’t have lungs,
they do need oxygen and acquire it through

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.310
their skin.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.989
During heavy rains, the high water content
of the soil doesn’t allow gases to diffuse

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.239
across their skin.

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.270
Thus, they must brave the surface world or
die.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.420
Back to fish: if you went to a random lake
somewhere in the world, the odds that the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.989
fish living there have encountered an earthworm
are pretty small.

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.449
Sure, storms are bound to wash some worms
into lakes and ponds every now and again and

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.920
there are fisherman who catch and release
that use worms as bait (though one would think

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.810
this would make a fish less likely to want
to eat a worm), but for the most part, earthworms

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.630
aren’t something fish ever encounter naturally.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.299
So why is this the go-to bait used to catch
a fish?

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.430
As it turns out, while it’s true fish are
unlikely to encounter an earthworm in their

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.159
lifetime, they are quite likely to encounter
something that sort of looks like one.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.610
Further, many fish really aren’t that picky
about what they eat.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.280
For example, a catfish will happily eat dead
bugs, plants, snails, fish eggs and even other

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.600
fish; more pertinently, they will also eat
things like leeches and insect larvae, both

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.420
of which you could argue look kind of like
earthworms.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.219
Catfish will also eat things like aquatic
worms, which are somewhat similar to earthworms,

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:51.659
though are their own distinct species.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.200
All that said, with bait, you don’t want
to present just any old food source, you want

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.951
to present the preferred food source of the
thing you’re trying to catch.

00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:07.770
And, as any experienced fisherman will tell
you, fish are mostly attracted to bait for

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.000
two reasons: smell and movement, with different
fish being more attracted to some baits than

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
others.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.490
For example, ocean dwelling fish (or at least
the ocean dwelling fish people commonly want

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.690
to catch) mostly feed on smaller fish or carrion.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.780
As such, cut bait (cut up pieces of fish)
is usually recommended because the scent of

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.020
blood (generally) carries better through the
ocean and will get you a better response than

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.020
movement.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.130
In lakes and ponds, however, where the main
diet of fish is a little more varied, your

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.650
options for bait are a bit more open.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.380
For example, fish in lakes are just as happy
to eat insects that fall into the water as

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.170
they are to eat bits of dead plant.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.070
So you can happily fish using things like
crickets, bees and even bread if you really

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.070
want to.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.720
You can even buy special paste that you can
rub on bait and lures to make them smell more

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.280
delicious to certain species of fish.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.790
You can also forgo bait entirely and just
use lures that look like bait and jiggle around

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.490
in the water, or find lures that are designed
to skip along the surface of the water and

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.350
catch fish by tricking them into thinking
they’re a small insect or something.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.990
With all this in mind, you might be inclined
to think that it’s not that fish like earthworms

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.350
inherently, it’s more that they’ll eat
anything and earthworms are a good all round

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.150
substitute because, before they succumb to
suffocation in the water, they wiggle around

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.670
a lot (perhaps even more so because they’re
suffocating and, of course, have a hook jammed

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.200
through the body).

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.860
Fish love movement and, anecdotally, most
fisherman will tell you you’ll catch a lot

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.290
more fish with a live worm than a dead one.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.940
So this seems reasonable enough.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.200
And, who knows, perhaps the fish even like
the scent.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.180
That said, it turns out, neither of those
things seem necessary, at least with bass,

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.740
though much more research needs done to determine
this more definitively.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.210
You see, in an experiment conducted by the
Berkley Fish Research Center, bass that had

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.780
literally never seen a worm, or anything that
looked like a worm (or any other prey for

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.020
that matter) in their entire lives were put
into special tanks where researchers dangled

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.940
bits of plastic that looked like the food
they had been given all their lives.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.950
The response was lackluster.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.970
The fish just weren’t that interested in
plastic versions of their normal food.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.370
The researchers then dangled plastic that
looked like a worm.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.710
To the researchers’ surprise, the bass reacted
very strongly to lures shaped like worms.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.350
And here’s the most interesting part, they
did so even when the worm-shaped plastic was

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.640
completely still.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.190
In the end, it was discovered that the bass
were a whopping 10 times more likely to try

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.360
to eat plastic lures shaped like worms over
the plastic lures shaped like their normal

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.360
food.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.430
The researchers couldn’t come up with a
reason to explain this behaviour, especially

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.940
considered the fish still loved the worm-shaped,
scentless, plastic when it was motionless.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.760
Was it because they are just naturally curious,
seeing a completely new object and having

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.260
the built in reflex to see if it’s edible?

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.870
Was it because it’s hard-wired into their
brains for some reason to want to eat worm-shaped

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.870
objects?

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.870
Who knows?

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.450
It remains an interesting footnote until more
research is done.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.640
This also brings up the question of whether
the same thing carries over to other fish.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:19.640
We don’t know.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:48.700
But at least one type of fish really do seem
to like things that look like earthworms.
