00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.470
Insomniacs have different brains!

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.550
Weird brains!

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.430
Super tired brains.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.960
God, I hate my insomnia.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.450
Anthony Carboni here for DNews and I had the
worst insomnia from junior high almost all

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.450
the way up through college.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.450
It's awful.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.900
You're always drained, you can't think straight,
you're depressed.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.300
While insomnia can be a symptom of a lot of
things, we've never really pinpointed what

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.260
the physiological change is in the body that
makes it happen specifically.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.600
I never saw a specialist about it, but I'm
pretty sure I had Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder-

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.980
it's common in teenagers and it basically
means your circadian rhythm is all off-balance-

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.180
your biological clock doesn't match up with
the day and night cycle.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.950
It can get less severe as you get older- mine
only happens for a couple weeks a time now,

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.890
then goes away for a bit.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.640
Insomnia can also be caused by psychological
things like stress or physical issues like

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.640
sleep apnea.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.790
But researchers looking to start treating
insomnia at the biological root of the problem

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.070
found a potential culprit: plasticity in the
brain's motor cortex.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.471
We've talked about neuroplasticity before:
its your brain's ability to adapt and change

00:01:05.471 --> 00:01:06.580
to different stimuli and situations.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.560
It means if you want to change your habits
or get better at something, you can because

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.450
your brain will adapt to it eventually.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.560
The going theory was that since people who
suffer from insomnia have decreased memory

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.200
and a hard time concentrating and retaining
information, their brains would be less plastic.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.580
Maybe being unable to process all that daytime
info leads to sleeping problems.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.259
But a new study out of Johns Hopkins university
says no- an insomniac's motor cortex is more

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.430
adaptable than someone who can sleep easily.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.200
They hooked up some healthy sleepers and insomniacs
to electrodes and tried some transcranial

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.750
magnetic stimulation or TMS on them.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.290
Basically, it delivers precise levels of electrical
currents to parts of the brain- but not in

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.850
a weird, shock therapy, seen it in the movies
way.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.869
In a more controlled, FDA approved, lets study
the brain and try to help people sort of way.

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.780
So, they basically trained the sleeping subjects,
using TMS, to move their thumbs in a certain

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.619
way in reaction to stimulation.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.600
I feel like the more I explain this, the less
safe TMS is actually going to sound.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.600
AAAAANYWAY.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.110
Then they tried to retrain the subjects to
have their thumbs move in the OTHER direction.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.309
And the insomniacs adapted to the change much
more easily.

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:12.689
So- what does that mean?

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.129
Is neuroplasticity bad?

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.450
Is it causing insomnia or is it the brain
of an insomniac trying help the body cope

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.159
with all the other physical and emotional
stresses that come with a lack of sleep?

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.180
This is where I go "The researchers aren't
sure," and you all groan and throw rotten

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.180
vegetables at me.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.980
But here's what's good and exciting about
the research: if the overly changeable motor

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.249
cortex is connected to releasing all the stress
hormones and causing all the other emotional

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:42.420
issues of insomnia, TMS could be used to calm
the brain down and help people get into the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.790
habit of healthy sleep.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.010
It'll also make diagnosing legitimate insomnia
much easier- right now there's no way to objectively

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.139
test for it, so a lot of people think they're
insomniacs when they have other, more easily

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.749
treatable issues- and vice versa.

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:58.359
In the meantime, if you're up, you can always
tweet.

00:02:58.359 --> 00:02:59.359
At me.

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:04.349
There's a good chance I am, too.
