down at the cafeteria what we talk about
 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.230
down at the cafeteria what we talk about
is how do we communicate science and the

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240
is how do we communicate science and the
 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.930
is how do we communicate science and the
science of our changing planet to our

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940
science of our changing planet to our
 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.960
science of our changing planet to our
peers and to the public and to

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970
peers and to the public and to
 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.280

data that what people think about

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180
data that what people think about
 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.330
data that what people think about
climate and then we're going to have

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340
climate and then we're going to have
 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.630
climate and then we're going to have
questions in a dialogue so that's the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640
questions in a dialogue so that's the
 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.790
questions in a dialogue so that's the
plan and we're going to start first with

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800
plan and we're going to start first with
 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.580
plan and we're going to start first with

buy my book which is all about science
 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.610
buy my book which is all about science
but I'm going to talk about the

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620
but I'm going to talk about the
 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.580
but I'm going to talk about the
environment in which climate science is

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590
environment in which climate science is
 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.120
environment in which climate science is
being done um you would have had to have

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130
being done um you would have had to have
 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.860
being done um you would have had to have
been living under a rock the last six

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870
been living under a rock the last six
 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.620
been living under a rock the last six
months if you were not aware of the fact

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630
months if you were not aware of the fact
 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.729
months if you were not aware of the fact
that climate science has become

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739
that climate science has become
 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.360
that climate science has become
intensely politicized this is the kind

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370
intensely politicized this is the kind
 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.910
intensely politicized this is the kind
of thing that happens whenever people

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920
of thing that happens whenever people
 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.009
of thing that happens whenever people
perceive that there is a threat to

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019
perceive that there is a threat to

coming out of the scientific community
 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.370
coming out of the scientific community
this is not unique to climate science

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380
this is not unique to climate science
 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.659
this is not unique to climate science
it's something that occurs with

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669
it's something that occurs with
 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.210
it's something that occurs with
evolutionary biology it's something that

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220
evolutionary biology it's something that
 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.009
evolutionary biology it's something that
occurs with fishery science it's

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019
occurs with fishery science it's
 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.259
occurs with fishery science it's
something that occurs really whenever

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269
something that occurs really whenever
 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.979
something that occurs really whenever
science is seemed to impinge upon

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989
science is seemed to impinge upon
 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.750
science is seemed to impinge upon
something that people are much more

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760
something that people are much more
 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.089
something that people are much more
closely tied to than the scientific

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099
closely tied to than the scientific
 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.020
closely tied to than the scientific
method so people are much more wedded to

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030
method so people are much more wedded to
 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.029
method so people are much more wedded to
their political opinion about how

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039
their political opinion about how

picture they generally see the science
 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.450
picture they generally see the science
and they look at the science the stuff

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460
and they look at the science the stuff
 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.770
and they look at the science the stuff
that's going on in the peer-reviewed

that's going on in the peer-reviewed
 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.660

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340
public debate is completely divorced
 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.160
public debate is completely divorced
from the scientific debate so the

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.170
from the scientific debate so the
 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.780
from the scientific debate so the
scientific debate you know we have whole

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790
scientific debate you know we have whole
 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.570
scientific debate you know we have whole

reconstruct climate in the medieval

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250
reconstruct climate in the medieval
 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.220
reconstruct climate in the medieval
period we have whole conferences on the

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.230
period we have whole conferences on the
 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.490
period we have whole conferences on the
interactions of aerosols and clouds and

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500
interactions of aerosols and clouds and
 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.230
interactions of aerosols and clouds and
the micro physics that goes on those

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240
the micro physics that goes on those
 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.180
the micro physics that goes on those
much those are the things that people in

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190
much those are the things that people in
 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.550
much those are the things that people in
a scientific community are debating the

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560
a scientific community are debating the
 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.250
a scientific community are debating the
public debate is what to do about

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260
public debate is what to do about
 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.200
public debate is what to do about
emissions what to do about climate

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210
emissions what to do about climate
 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:52.790
emissions what to do about climate
policy what to do about energy policy

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800
policy what to do about energy policy
 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.330
policy what to do about energy policy
those are very different things ah but

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340
those are very different things ah but
 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.450
those are very different things ah but
the science is only looked at in the

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460
the science is only looked at in the
 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.820
the science is only looked at in the
public sphere to the extent that it

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830
public sphere to the extent that it
 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.780
public sphere to the extent that it
projects onto this public debate now the

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:05.790
projects onto this public debate now the
 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.150
projects onto this public debate now the
media's idea about what the scientific

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160
media's idea about what the scientific
 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.100
media's idea about what the scientific
debate is completely determined by the

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.110
debate is completely determined by the
 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.110
debate is completely determined by the
public debate and not by the science and

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120
public debate and not by the science and
 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.010
public debate and not by the science and
so you end up with stories making news

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020
so you end up with stories making news
 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.060
so you end up with stories making news
or events making news not on their

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.070
or events making news not on their
 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.050
or events making news not on their
intrinsic scientific merit but on to

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060
intrinsic scientific merit but on to
 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.940
intrinsic scientific merit but on to
what extent they project onto this

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:25.950
what extent they project onto this
 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.570
what extent they project onto this
public debate that's a very distorted

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:29.580
public debate that's a very distorted
 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:34.430
public debate that's a very distorted
view of what goes on in the science one

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440
view of what goes on in the science one
 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.070
view of what goes on in the science one
of the other elements that is

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080
of the other elements that is
 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.620
of the other elements that is
problematic in the media environment is

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:39.630
problematic in the media environment is
 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.070
problematic in the media environment is
the fact that the media reports on news

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080
the fact that the media reports on news
 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.320
the fact that the media reports on news
and that's not a problem that's just who

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:45.330
and that's not a problem that's just who
 

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.680
and that's not a problem that's just who
they are they report news things like

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:48.690
they are they report news things like
 

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.570
they are they report news things like
well we've known that carbon dioxide is

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:50.580
well we've known that carbon dioxide is
 

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.770
well we've known that carbon dioxide is
a greenhouse gas for over a hundred

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:51.780
a greenhouse gas for over a hundred
 

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.440
a greenhouse gas for over a hundred
years now well that's not news right

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:54.450
years now well that's not news right
 

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.960
years now well that's not news right
because it's a hundred years old and so

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:56.970
because it's a hundred years old and so
 

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.029
because it's a hundred years old and so
things that everybody knows the vast

00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039
things that everybody knows the vast
 

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:00.350
things that everybody knows the vast
amount of

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360
amount of
 

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.999
amount of
tacit knowledge that all of the

00:08:01.999 --> 00:08:02.009
tacit knowledge that all of the
 

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:04.129
tacit knowledge that all of the
scientific community holds none of that

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139
scientific community holds none of that
 

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:06.649
scientific community holds none of that
is ever news okay so none of that ever

00:08:06.649 --> 00:08:06.659
is ever news okay so none of that ever
 

00:08:06.659 --> 00:08:09.499
is ever news okay so none of that ever
gets reported by the media instead we

00:08:09.499 --> 00:08:09.509
gets reported by the media instead we
 

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:13.010
gets reported by the media instead we
have a focus on the studies that seem to

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.819
opinion of climate science and and go
like why are they asking these people

00:16:01.819 --> 00:16:01.829
like why are they asking these people
 

00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:03.829
like why are they asking these people
because they don't have anybody else to

00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839
because they don't have anybody else to
 

00:16:03.839 --> 00:16:10.460
because they don't have anybody else to
turn to so one of the things well so

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:10.470
turn to so one of the things well so
 

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.710
turn to so one of the things well so
it's okay so I mean they did that I

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720
it's okay so I mean they did that I
 

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.670
it's okay so I mean they did that I
think the other speakers are going to

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680
think the other speakers are going to
 

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.660
think the other speakers are going to
tell us what it is that we need to be

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:14.670
tell us what it is that we need to be
 

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:17.600
tell us what it is that we need to be
doing about this let me leave you with a

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:17.610
doing about this let me leave you with a
 

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.910
doing about this let me leave you with a
couple of thoughts that have arisen out

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920
couple of thoughts that have arisen out
 

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.660
couple of thoughts that have arisen out
of the last

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:22.670
of the last
 

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:29.320
of the last
few months one of the things to be aware

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:29.330
few months one of the things to be aware
 

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:32.140
few months one of the things to be aware
of is that the things that we worry

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:32.150
of is that the things that we worry
 

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.790
of is that the things that we worry
about a lot what we talked about over

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800
about a lot what we talked about over
 

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.860
about a lot what we talked about over
lunch in the non cafeteria for instance

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:35.870

these are not the preoccupations of the

these are not the preoccupations of the
 

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:41.320
these are not the preoccupations of the
majority of the population despite

everything that went on with the
Climategate affair most people if you go

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:47.450
Climategate affair most people if you go
 

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.770
Climategate affair most people if you go
outside of a very small group of people

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:50.780
outside of a very small group of people

most of it went completely over the

most of it went completely over the
 

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.820
most of it went completely over the

in discussions of climate science is

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:07.730
in discussions of climate science is
 

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:10.120

before that but that's not to say that

we've done a good job with communicating

change um so I'm just going to leave you

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:19.480
change um so I'm just going to leave you
 

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.300
change um so I'm just going to leave you
with that thought and then these people

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:21.310
with that thought and then these people
 

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:22.530
with that thought and then these people
are going to tell me that I have no idea

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:22.540
are going to tell me that I have no idea
 

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:25.920
are going to tell me that I have no idea

how we as scientists do or don't
 

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:43.630
how we as scientists do or don't
communicate science very well next we're

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:43.640
communicate science very well next we're
 

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.880
communicate science very well next we're
going to hear from Ned Gardner who got

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:45.890
going to hear from Ned Gardner who got
 

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.880
going to hear from Ned Gardner who got
his PhD in landscape ecology and then

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:48.890
his PhD in landscape ecology and then
 

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.770
his PhD in landscape ecology and then
went on to work for the American Museum

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:50.780
went on to work for the American Museum
 

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:52.960
went on to work for the American Museum
of Natural History and producing video

bulletins and actually really working on

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:54.860
bulletins and actually really working on
 

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.030
bulletins and actually really working on
communicating science and it's now

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:57.040
communicating science and it's now
 

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.010
communicating science and it's now
taking his fascination of using images

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:00.020
taking his fascination of using images
 

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:05.260
taking his fascination of using images
and data actually moved to Noah where

he's working on the basically how how do

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:09.470
he's working on the basically how how do
 

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:12.490
he's working on the basically how how do
we communicate climate two and climate

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:12.500
we communicate climate two and climate
 

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.560
we communicate climate two and climate
change the public submit we're looking

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:14.570
change the public submit we're looking
 

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:22.300

forward to hearing your insights on this

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:22.310
 

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:24.370
and I'm not going to refute anything

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:24.380
and I'm not going to refute anything
 

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:29.110

that dr. Schmidt just said I sympathize

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120
that dr. Schmidt just said I sympathize
 

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.510
that dr. Schmidt just said I sympathize
completely and I think no one will be

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520
completely and I think no one will be
 

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.430
completely and I think no one will be

that first category and it really

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:07.730
that first category and it really
 

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:10.000
that first category and it really
surprises me that there are people in

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.010
surprises me that there are people in
 

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:13.000
surprises me that there are people in

but thinking it's bad is not going to

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:16.130
but thinking it's bad is not going to
 

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:19.090
but thinking it's bad is not going to
make it go away it does exist and it is

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:19.100
make it go away it does exist and it is
 

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:21.220

a problem we have to deal with in our
 

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:27.090
a problem we have to deal with in our
society so the I think there is some

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:27.100
society so the I think there is some
 

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.980
society so the I think there is some
work being done to bridge this gap

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:29.990
work being done to bridge this gap
 

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.370
work being done to bridge this gap
that's worth pointing out

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:33.380
that's worth pointing out
 

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:37.360
that's worth pointing out
and it is it comes from the cultural

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:37.370

my previous career I was at the American
 

00:25:13.249 --> 00:25:14.560
my previous career I was at the American
Museum of Natural History down the

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:14.570
Museum of Natural History down the
 

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:18.009
Museum of Natural History down the
street on right off central park west

00:25:18.009 --> 00:25:18.019
street on right off central park west
 

00:25:18.019 --> 00:25:22.180
street on right off central park west
and we took scientific data worked very

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:22.190
and we took scientific data worked very
 

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:26.080
and we took scientific data worked very
closely with NASA in fact and Noah to

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:26.090
closely with NASA in fact and Noah to
 

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:28.239
closely with NASA in fact and Noah to
really give people the details of the

00:25:28.239 --> 00:25:28.249
really give people the details of the
 

00:25:28.249 --> 00:25:30.639
really give people the details of the
science so in this set of examples i'm

00:25:30.639 --> 00:25:30.649
science so in this set of examples i'm
 

00:25:30.649 --> 00:25:32.859
science so in this set of examples i'm
going to talk about communicating the

00:25:32.859 --> 00:25:32.869
going to talk about communicating the
 

00:25:32.869 --> 00:25:34.930
going to talk about communicating the
science and getting to the scientific

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:34.940
science and getting to the scientific
 

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.470
science and getting to the scientific
principles now necessarily we have to

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480
principles now necessarily we have to
 

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.570
principles now necessarily we have to
come up with messages and ways of

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:40.580
come up with messages and ways of
 

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:42.820
come up with messages and ways of
communicating scientific concepts that

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:42.830
communicating scientific concepts that
 

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:44.680
communicating scientific concepts that
people can understand because the fact

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:44.690
people can understand because the fact
 

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:48.039
people can understand because the fact
is we don't have a society of PhDs in

00:25:48.039 --> 00:25:48.049
is we don't have a society of PhDs in
 

00:25:48.049 --> 00:25:51.129
is we don't have a society of PhDs in
physics we have to communicate with

00:25:51.129 --> 00:25:51.139
physics we have to communicate with
 

00:25:51.139 --> 00:25:53.590
physics we have to communicate with
people if we want them to understand the

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:53.600
people if we want them to understand the
 

00:25:53.600 --> 00:26:00.549
people if we want them to understand the
science so so we learn things like don't

00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559
science so so we learn things like don't
 

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:03.070
science so so we learn things like don't
know what colors me when you look up

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:03.080
know what colors me when you look up
 

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.739
know what colors me when you look up
data so scientists know what how to read

00:26:05.739 --> 00:26:05.749
data so scientists know what how to read
 

00:26:05.749 --> 00:26:07.899
data so scientists know what how to read
a color scale and go right in order and

00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:07.909
a color scale and go right in order and
 

00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:09.549
a color scale and go right in order and
establish that there's relationship

00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:09.559
establish that there's relationship
 

00:26:09.559 --> 00:26:10.740
establish that there's relationship
between of colors

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:10.750
between of colors
 

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.650
between of colors
and the colors on the hook and then

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:13.660
and the colors on the hook and then
 

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.590
and the colors on the hook and then
those main departures of temperature

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:16.600
those main departures of temperature
 

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.370
those main departures of temperature
from average conditions in the ocean so

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:20.380
from average conditions in the ocean so
 

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.750
from average conditions in the ocean so
there's a whole subtext that we don't

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760
there's a whole subtext that we don't
 

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.430
there's a whole subtext that we don't
have to explain well that went fast

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440

more precipitation in the southern and
 

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:53.550
more precipitation in the southern and
eastern United States so we are in an El

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:53.560
eastern United States so we are in an El
 

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.370

of the factors that contributed to this

00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960
of the factors that contributed to this
 

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:05.190
of the factors that contributed to this
winter's heavy snowfall what happens is

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200
winter's heavy snowfall what happens is
 

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.200
winter's heavy snowfall what happens is
that the warmer ocean temperature in

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:07.210

the previous visualization leads to

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200
the previous visualization leads to
 

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.320
the previous visualization leads to
higher evaporation and that has it is

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:13.330
higher evaporation and that has it is
 

00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:15.030
higher evaporation and that has it is
called a teleconnections where that

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:15.040
called a teleconnections where that

moisture that falls as precipitation so

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:25.240
moisture that falls as precipitation so
 

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.320
moisture that falls as precipitation so
being in an alma no is a factor for what

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:28.330
being in an alma no is a factor for what
 

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:30.210

that that's pretty much what happens

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:25.460
that that's pretty much what happens
 

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.919
that that's pretty much what happens
whenever you have an Arctic Oscillation

00:28:27.919 --> 00:28:27.929
whenever you have an Arctic Oscillation
 

00:28:27.929 --> 00:28:30.139
whenever you have an Arctic Oscillation
in the phase it's in now which is a

in the phase it's in now which is a
 

00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:32.509
in the phase it's in now which is a
negative phase so this is just a

00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:32.519
negative phase so this is just a
 

00:28:32.519 --> 00:28:37.519

when the conditions we experienced this
year happen it's in our record and we

00:28:54.649 --> 00:28:54.659
year happen it's in our record and we
 

00:28:54.659 --> 00:28:56.990
year happen it's in our record and we
can document it and show it to you so

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:57.000
can document it and show it to you so
 

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.180
can document it and show it to you so
that's one way visualization can help

00:28:59.180 --> 00:28:59.190
that's one way visualization can help
 

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:01.159
that's one way visualization can help
establish a frame of reference to show

00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:28.490
ocean-atmosphere models so in this case
we have and by what I'm trying to get at

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:28.500
we have and by what I'm trying to get at
 

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.799
we have and by what I'm trying to get at
is that this is not a prediction of

00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:30.809
is that this is not a prediction of
 

00:29:30.809 --> 00:29:32.990
is that this is not a prediction of
those models that we would experience

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000
those models that we would experience
 

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.690
those models that we would experience
this so in this case this is about the

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:35.700
this so in this case this is about the
 

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.999
this so in this case this is about the
variability of the weather climate

00:29:37.999 --> 00:29:38.009
variability of the weather climate
 

00:29:38.009 --> 00:29:41.119
variability of the weather climate
system so separating variability this is

00:29:41.119 --> 00:29:41.129
system so separating variability this is
 

00:29:41.129 --> 00:29:42.680
system so separating variability this is
what our attribution team came up with

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:42.690
what our attribution team came up with
 

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:46.430
what our attribution team came up with
so we will get back to it we'll get back

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440
so we will get back to it we'll get back
 

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:52.399
so we will get back to it we'll get back
to it and in fact we have a record that

00:29:52.399 --> 00:29:52.409
to it and in fact we have a record that
 

00:29:52.409 --> 00:29:55.759

Oscillation observations which is the

00:29:58.999 --> 00:29:59.009
Oscillation observations which is the
 

00:29:59.009 --> 00:30:01.369
Oscillation observations which is the
difference in pressure between this

00:30:01.369 --> 00:30:01.379
difference in pressure between this
 

00:30:01.379 --> 00:30:03.769

region of the Atlantic and this region

00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:03.779

00:30:03.779 --> 00:30:05.690
region of the Atlantic and this region
and what we see is that this year we

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:05.700
and what we see is that this year we
 

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.090
and what we see is that this year we
were in a very negative phase of the

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:08.100
were in a very negative phase of the
 

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:12.490
were in a very negative phase of the
North Atlantic Oscillation which was a

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:12.500
North Atlantic Oscillation which was a
 

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:16.879
North Atlantic Oscillation which was a
typical in our record and in the last

00:30:16.879 --> 00:30:16.889
typical in our record and in the last
 

00:30:16.889 --> 00:30:19.249

decade or two decades we've really been
 

00:30:19.259 --> 00:30:23.299
decade or two decades we've really been
in more of a positive phase overall this

00:30:23.299 --> 00:30:23.309
in more of a positive phase overall this
 

00:30:23.309 --> 00:30:26.180

if you don't believe in climate change
you will you will neglect information

you will you will neglect information
 

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:55.650
you will you will neglect information

about to the Dean and the crew had to
 

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:46.890
about to the Dean and the crew had to
write this letter they are like 15 20

00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:46.900
write this letter they are like 15 20

minutes the letter was actually
 

00:50:48.369 --> 00:50:50.160
minutes the letter was actually
submitted to the Dean and he's probably

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:50.170

still reading all of these and and then

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:53.740
still reading all of these and and then

game after they had worked together so

00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440
game after they had worked together so
 

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:04.260
game after they had worked together so
four levels of affiliation and mentioned

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:04.270
four levels of affiliation and mentioned
 

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:05.430
four levels of affiliation and mentioned
these students did not know each other

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440
these students did not know each other

00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:12.910
from from all over campus
so in this experiment we found that as

00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:12.920
so in this experiment we found that as
 

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:17.339
so in this experiment we found that as
affiliation increased so did cooperation

00:51:17.339 --> 00:51:17.349
affiliation increased so did cooperation
 

00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:21.430
affiliation increased so did cooperation
affiliation made social goals and

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440
affiliation made social goals and
 

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:25.120
affiliation made social goals and
concern for other a creator priority the

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:25.130
concern for other a creator priority the
 

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:28.960
concern for other a creator priority the
added benefit of cooperation made up for

added benefit of cooperation made up for
 

00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:31.960
added benefit of cooperation made up for
the sacrificed money that people left on

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:31.970

the table so in this case and in game

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:36.230
the table so in this case and in game
 

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:38.680
the table so in this case and in game
theoretical terms we can say that a

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:38.690
theoretical terms we can say that a
 

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:41.260
theoretical terms we can say that a
common dilemma can be transformed by

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:41.270
common dilemma can be transformed by
 

00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:43.390
common dilemma can be transformed by
social goals to a payoff structure with

00:51:43.390 --> 00:51:43.400
social goals to a payoff structure with
 

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:46.390
social goals to a payoff structure with
multiple equilibrium so an experiment

00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400
multiple equilibrium so an experiment
 

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.310
multiple equilibrium so an experiment
the in this experiments worked even

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:48.320
the in this experiments worked even
 

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.900
the in this experiments worked even
though students had these temporary

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:49.910
though students had these temporary
 

00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:52.089
though students had these temporary
affiliations they didn't know each other

00:51:52.089 --> 00:51:52.099
affiliations they didn't know each other
 

00:51:52.099 --> 00:51:54.040
affiliations they didn't know each other
before hand and they were not committed

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:54.050
before hand and they were not committed
 

00:51:54.050 --> 00:51:56.260
before hand and they were not committed
to doing anything with each other ever

00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:56.270
to doing anything with each other ever
 

00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:58.690

using it to raise attention to lead to
 

00:56:43.519 --> 00:56:45.670
using it to raise attention to lead to
stronger engagement with an issue and to

stronger engagement with an issue and to
 

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:50.739
stronger engagement with an issue and to
motivate action well there are downsides

00:56:50.739 --> 00:56:50.749

about so many things at the same time is
 

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:33.609
about so many things at the same time is

tired of seeing the polar bear because

00:57:41.810 --> 00:57:41.820
tired of seeing the polar bear because
 

00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:43.520
tired of seeing the polar bear because
they feel like well we've seen is over

they feel like well we've seen is over
 

00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:45.170
they feel like well we've seen is over
and over again it doesn't trigger the

the polar bear became the poster child

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480
the polar bear became the poster child
 

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:56.000
the polar bear became the poster child

I would suggest then is a combination of

00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:02.530
I would suggest then is a combination of
 

00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:05.640
I would suggest then is a combination of
the emotional and the analytic appeal

00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:05.650
the emotional and the analytic appeal
 

00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:10.230
the emotional and the analytic appeal
and here we have a slide of some 20 time

00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.240
and here we have a slide of some 20 time

series of glacial retreat across the
 

00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:16.200

people engaged we should focus in on one

00:58:26.220 --> 00:58:26.230
people engaged we should focus in on one
 

00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:28.770
people engaged we should focus in on one
of the time series and pick one point

00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:28.780
of the time series and pick one point
 

00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:31.440
of the time series and pick one point
and see this is what this glacier looked

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:31.450
and see this is what this glacier looked
 

00:58:31.450 --> 00:58:36.090
and see this is what this glacier looked
like at point x at time X then we look

00:58:36.090 --> 00:58:36.100
like at point x at time X then we look
 

00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:39.390
like at point x at time X then we look
at like there was an 800-meter retreat

00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:39.400
at like there was an 800-meter retreat
 

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:41.820
at like there was an 800-meter retreat
in length of this glacier what does that

00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:41.830
in length of this glacier what does that
 

00:58:41.830 --> 00:58:44.490

look like try to show a photo there are

00:58:44.490 --> 00:58:44.500
look like try to show a photo there are
 

00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:46.380
look like try to show a photo there are
lots of photos available now for a lot

lots of photos available now for a lot
 

00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:49.530
lots of photos available now for a lot
of these glaciers that you can put

00:58:49.530 --> 00:58:49.540
of these glaciers that you can put
 

00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:51.300
of these glaciers that you can put
together and can show what it actually

00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:51.310
together and can show what it actually
 

00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:54.090
together and can show what it actually
looks like when a glacier retreats and

00:58:54.090 --> 00:58:54.100
looks like when a glacier retreats and
 

00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:56.490
looks like when a glacier retreats and
then you can you can go through multiple

00:58:56.490 --> 00:58:56.500
then you can you can go through multiple
 

00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:58.320
then you can you can go through multiple
of these clashes and try to show that

00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:58.330
of these clashes and try to show that
 

00:58:58.330 --> 00:59:00.360
of these clashes and try to show that
the information will never be as

00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:00.370
the information will never be as
 

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:02.760
the information will never be as
comprehensive as the time series but you

00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:02.770
comprehensive as the time series but you
 

00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:04.320
comprehensive as the time series but you
have to you have created a way for

00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:04.330
have to you have created a way for
 

00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:06.900
have to you have created a way for
people to want to know more what

00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:06.910
people to want to know more what
 

00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:08.820
people to want to know more what
happened to this glacier you can then

00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:08.830
happened to this glacier you can then
 

00:59:08.830 --> 00:59:10.740
happened to this glacier you can then
ask an elderly person who has been

00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:10.750
ask an elderly person who has been
 

00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:13.050
ask an elderly person who has been
around for 80 90 years to explain the

experience with living near this glacier
 

00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:19.380
experience with living near this glacier
you can explain the impact of glacier

00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:19.390
you can explain the impact of glacier
 

00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:23.760
you can explain the impact of glacier
retreat on agriculture downstream or you

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:23.770
retreat on agriculture downstream or you
 

00:59:23.770 --> 00:59:26.190
retreat on agriculture downstream or you
can explain the impact on children's and

00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:26.200
can explain the impact on children's and
 

00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:28.020
can explain the impact on children's and
on water availability and children's

from glaciers at that point you may have

00:59:35.130 --> 00:59:35.140
from glaciers at that point you may have
 

00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:37.200
from glaciers at that point you may have
people's attention so they actually want

00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:37.210
people's attention so they actually want
 

00:59:37.210 --> 00:59:38.880
people's attention so they actually want
to know why are cleaved palacios rich

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:38.890
to know why are cleaved palacios rich
 

00:59:38.890 --> 00:59:41.430
to know why are cleaved palacios rich
reading and you can show co2 emissions

00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440
reading and you can show co2 emissions
 

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:43.110

in medical decisions where radiologists

01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:02.800
in medical decisions where radiologists
 

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:06.180
in medical decisions where radiologists
who are looking at at images they find

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:06.190
who are looking at at images they find
 

01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:09.600
who are looking at at images they find
one abnormality and stop looking for

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:09.610
one abnormality and stop looking for
 

01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:12.240
one abnormality and stop looking for
more because they like to have

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:12.250
more because they like to have
 

01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:14.490
more because they like to have
identified a problem and this is nothing

01:01:14.490 --> 01:01:14.500
identified a problem and this is nothing
 

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:17.820
identified a problem and this is nothing
to do with IQ obviously and it's just a

01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:17.830
to do with IQ obviously and it's just a
 

01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:21.120
to do with IQ obviously and it's just a
it's a it's a problem of attention and

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:21.130
it's a it's a problem of attention and
 

01:01:21.130 --> 01:01:24.590
it's a it's a problem of attention and
and cognition and obviously very serious

01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:24.600
and cognition and obviously very serious
 

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:29.670
and cognition and obviously very serious
so um what can we do about this we can

01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680
so um what can we do about this we can
 

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:32.400
so um what can we do about this we can
provide checklists for people that they

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:32.410
provide checklists for people that they
 

01:01:32.410 --> 01:01:34.290
provide checklists for people that they
can follow so they take more than one

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:34.300
can follow so they take more than one
 

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:37.260
can follow so they take more than one
action that doesn't always work if we

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:37.270
action that doesn't always work if we
 

01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:39.840
action that doesn't always work if we
know that people only take one action we

01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:39.850
know that people only take one action we
 

01:01:39.850 --> 01:01:43.020
know that people only take one action we
should try to promote the most powerful

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:43.030
should try to promote the most powerful
 

01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:45.450

action order the the action or behavior

01:01:45.450 --> 01:01:45.460
action order the the action or behavior
 

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:47.220
action order the the action or behavior
that has the greatest potential for

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:47.230
that has the greatest potential for
 

01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:50.280
that has the greatest potential for
saving energy or for mitigating climate

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:50.290
saving energy or for mitigating climate
 

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:52.050

change if we know that people only do

01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:52.060
change if we know that people only do
 

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:54.480
change if we know that people only do
one thing and that's one of the solution

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:54.490
one thing and that's one of the solution
 

01:01:54.490 --> 01:01:58.070
one thing and that's one of the solution
we could deal with this let me conclude

01:01:58.070 --> 01:01:58.080
we could deal with this let me conclude
 

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.300

decisions that are not good for us we

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:05.830
decisions that are not good for us we
 

01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:08.990
decisions that are not good for us we
ignore others in our decision making and

01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.000
ignore others in our decision making and
 

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.970

you're trying to communicate these

01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:21.790
you're trying to communicate these
 

01:08:21.790 --> 01:08:23.130
you're trying to communicate these
people on what it is that you want to

01:08:23.130 --> 01:08:23.140
people on what it is that you want to
 

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:27.120
people on what it is that you want to
communicate now and I have to kind of

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:27.130
communicate now and I have to kind of
 

01:08:27.130 --> 01:08:29.550
communicate now and I have to kind of
pull on something that you said that

01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:29.560
pull on something that you said that
 

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.470

communication was there in order to
change behavior now that is a reason to

01:08:34.770 --> 01:08:34.780
change behavior now that is a reason to
 

01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:36.930
change behavior now that is a reason to
communicate but it certainly isn't the

01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:36.940
communicate but it certainly isn't the
 

01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:39.750
communicate but it certainly isn't the
only reason to communicate and I think

01:08:39.750 --> 01:08:39.760
only reason to communicate and I think
 

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:42.120
only reason to communicate and I think
if we talk about the goal of

communication merely to change people's
 

01:08:44.109 --> 01:08:46.470
communication merely to change people's
behavior then I think we can quite

behavior then I think we can quite
 

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:48.570

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:34.450
that policy in order to get that policy
 

01:09:34.450 --> 01:09:37.230
that policy in order to get that policy
that there are lots and lots of overlaps

01:09:37.230 --> 01:09:37.240
that there are lots and lots of overlaps
 

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:44.610
that there are lots and lots of overlaps
that I find all the time with people who

01:09:44.610 --> 01:09:44.620
that I find all the time with people who
 

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:47.310
that I find all the time with people who
are you know they'll they'll swear blind

01:09:47.310 --> 01:09:47.320
are you know they'll they'll swear blind
 

01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:49.260
are you know they'll they'll swear blind
that Michael Mann is the worst person in

01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:49.270
that Michael Mann is the worst person in
 

01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:51.780
that Michael Mann is the worst person in
the world but are perfectly happy to

01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:51.790
the world but are perfectly happy to
 

01:09:51.790 --> 01:09:54.960
the world but are perfectly happy to
drive around in an electric car right ok

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:54.970
drive around in an electric car right ok
 

01:09:54.970 --> 01:09:57.150
drive around in an electric car right ok
so I don't care what their opinion is

01:09:57.150 --> 01:09:57.160
so I don't care what their opinion is
 

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.880
so I don't care what their opinion is
about you know friends of mine but it

01:09:59.880 --> 01:09:59.890
about you know friends of mine but it
 

01:09:59.890 --> 01:10:01.500
about you know friends of mine but it
matters whether they change their

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:01.510
matters whether they change their
 

01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:05.460
matters whether they change their
behavior so looking for overlaps where

01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:05.470
behavior so looking for overlaps where
 

01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:07.890
behavior so looking for overlaps where
they would want to do something that

01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:07.900
they would want to do something that
 

01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:09.780
they would want to do something that
your people in the inner city also want

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:09.790
your people in the inner city also want
 

01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:12.330
your people in the inner city also want
to do is much much more important than

01:10:12.330 --> 01:10:12.340
to do is much much more important than
 

01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:13.850
to do is much much more important than
getting them to change their mind

01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:13.860
getting them to change their mind
 

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:16.280
getting them to change their mind
about any scientific aspect which quite

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:16.290
about any scientific aspect which quite
 

01:10:16.290 --> 01:10:19.700
about any scientific aspect which quite
frankly you know most people's opinion

01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:19.710
frankly you know most people's opinion
 

01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:22.669
frankly you know most people's opinion
about science per se doesn't have much

01:10:22.669 --> 01:10:22.679
about science per se doesn't have much
 

01:10:22.679 --> 01:10:25.340
about science per se doesn't have much
impact on anything but getting policies

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:25.350
impact on anything but getting policies
 

01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:26.930
impact on anything but getting policies
put in place getting people to make

01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:26.940
put in place getting people to make
 

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:29.270
put in place getting people to make
decisions whether they're conscious or

01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280
decisions whether they're conscious or
 

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.740
decisions whether they're conscious or
not of why they're making that decision

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:30.750
not of why they're making that decision
 

01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:33.220
not of why they're making that decision
that's much more important and so

01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:33.230
that's much more important and so
 

01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:36.830
that's much more important and so
finding overlaps in terms of actions is

01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840
finding overlaps in terms of actions is
 

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:38.840
finding overlaps in terms of actions is
much much more important than trying to

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:38.850
much much more important than trying to
 

01:10:38.850 --> 01:10:43.430
much much more important than trying to
get everybody to think the same way i

01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:43.440
get everybody to think the same way i
 

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.430
get everybody to think the same way i
would say identifying a person of trust

01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:46.440
would say identifying a person of trust
 

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:49.910
would say identifying a person of trust
is the other thing is like finding a

problem but i think it's identifying the
 

01:11:22.650 --> 01:11:25.939

there is no way not to frame an issue

writing about climate change and can you
 

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:39.600
writing about climate change and can you
speak ? a company I'm sorry my name is

mean with the weather that we've had

01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:45.640
mean with the weather that we've had
 

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:47.190

this winter there are so many people who

this winter there are so many people who
 

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.830
this winter there are so many people who
have actually experienced horrible you

01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:49.840
have actually experienced horrible you

know emotional upheavals and traumas

01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:52.390
know emotional upheavals and traumas
 

01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:53.850
know emotional upheavals and traumas
from the weather and yet I've never

01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:53.860
from the weather and yet I've never
 

01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:56.850
from the weather and yet I've never
heard anything on the news or in the

01:12:56.850 --> 01:12:56.860
heard anything on the news or in the

paper connect the weather or the extreme
 

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:01.620
paper connect the weather or the extreme
weather to climate change and so if

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:01.630
weather to climate change and so if
 

01:13:01.630 --> 01:13:03.450

explain that well the reason why hasn't
 

01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:18.600
explain that well the reason why hasn't
happened is because there isn't that

01:16:55.989 --> 01:16:58.390
and the weather component is is not
something that we can deal with by

01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.400
something that we can deal with by
 

01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.590
something that we can deal with by
always when we can deal with it but it's

01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600
always when we can deal with it but it's
 

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:00.790
always when we can deal with it but it's
not something that the climate models

01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:00.800
not something that the climate models
 

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.520
not something that the climate models
are telling us about so so when when

01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:03.530
are telling us about so so when when
 

01:17:03.530 --> 01:17:07.390
are telling us about so so when when
there's a there's an apparent conflict

01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:07.400
there's a there's an apparent conflict
 

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:10.330
there's a there's an apparent conflict
between a weather events and a

01:17:10.330 --> 01:17:10.340
between a weather events and a
 

01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:14.770
between a weather events and a
projection for 2100 there isn't conflict

01:17:14.770 --> 01:17:14.780
projection for 2100 there isn't conflict
 

01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:16.270
projection for 2100 there isn't conflict
because one is a projection for twenty

01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:16.280
because one is a projection for twenty
 

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.280
because one is a projection for twenty
one hundred ninety years time and the

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:18.290
one hundred ninety years time and the
 

01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:19.510
one hundred ninety years time and the
other one is a weather event that

01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.520
other one is a weather event that
 

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:21.010
other one is a weather event that
happened last week these are not the

01:17:21.010 --> 01:17:21.020
happened last week these are not the
 

01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:23.200

same things kill who take the next

question I just wanted to point out that

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:26.510
question I just wanted to point out that
 

01:17:26.510 --> 01:17:30.190
question I just wanted to point out that
I mean the point of my examples was to

01:17:30.190 --> 01:17:30.200
I mean the point of my examples was to
 

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:33.790
I mean the point of my examples was to
really show that one of the challenges

01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:33.800
really show that one of the challenges
 

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:35.590
really show that one of the challenges
we have an establishing connection is

01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:35.600
we have an establishing connection is
 

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.959
we have an establishing connection is
with climate information is really

01:17:37.959 --> 01:17:37.969
with climate information is really
 

01:17:37.969 --> 01:17:40.080
with climate information is really
getting people to even appreciate the

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:40.090
getting people to even appreciate the
 

01:17:40.090 --> 01:17:42.520
getting people to even appreciate the
spatial and temporal scales on which

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:42.530
spatial and temporal scales on which
 

01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:45.940
spatial and temporal scales on which
climate is even studied and understood

01:17:45.940 --> 01:17:45.950
climate is even studied and understood
 

01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:50.140
climate is even studied and understood
and so that's why we can look at climate

01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:50.150
and so that's why we can look at climate
 

01:17:50.150 --> 01:17:53.680
and so that's why we can look at climate
phenomena on a seasonal basis and I

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:53.690
phenomena on a seasonal basis and I
 

01:17:53.690 --> 01:17:55.600
phenomena on a seasonal basis and I
agree wholeheartedly that the

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:55.610
agree wholeheartedly that the
 

01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:57.280
agree wholeheartedly that the
attribution I do with that has to do

01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:57.290
attribution I do with that has to do
 

01:17:57.290 --> 01:18:01.630
attribution I do with that has to do
with cycles and bigger patterns and we

01:18:01.630 --> 01:18:01.640
with cycles and bigger patterns and we
 

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:04.330
with cycles and bigger patterns and we
study those over seasonal or decadal

01:18:04.330 --> 01:18:04.340
study those over seasonal or decadal
 

01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:08.050
study those over seasonal or decadal
scales and the point of my showing that

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:08.060
scales and the point of my showing that
 

01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:10.510
scales and the point of my showing that
climate projection is that the best way

01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:10.520
climate projection is that the best way
 

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:13.890
climate projection is that the best way
to interpret those are as multidecadal

01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:13.900
to interpret those are as multidecadal
 

01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:16.959
to interpret those are as multidecadal
summaries that's a an efficient way of

summaries that's a an efficient way of
 

01:18:16.969 --> 01:18:19.720
summaries that's a an efficient way of
understanding what projections from

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:19.730
understanding what projections from
 

01:18:19.730 --> 01:18:23.050
understanding what projections from
models tell us but I agree also that

01:18:23.050 --> 01:18:23.060
models tell us but I agree also that
 

01:18:23.060 --> 01:18:24.300
models tell us but I agree also that
they don't tell us about whether

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:24.310
they don't tell us about whether

01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:31.270
establishing an emotional connection
with climate issues can be a useful

01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:31.280
with climate issues can be a useful

so so I but but but your your finger

01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:19.980
so so I but but but your your finger
 

01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:23.180
so so I but but but your your finger
point is is I think valid and the

01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:23.190
point is is I think valid and the
 

01:21:23.190 --> 01:21:25.990
point is is I think valid and the
question is well how do you how do you

01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:26.000
question is well how do you how do you
 

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.040
question is well how do you how do you
build trust and how do you let people

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:31.050
build trust and how do you let people
 

01:21:31.050 --> 01:21:33.320
build trust and how do you let people
see what it is that you're doing the

01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:33.330
see what it is that you're doing the
 

01:21:33.330 --> 01:21:36.260
see what it is that you're doing the
process the methodology the issue is not

01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:36.270
process the methodology the issue is not
 

01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:39.920
process the methodology the issue is not
about specific results the issue is not

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:39.930
about specific results the issue is not
 

01:21:39.930 --> 01:21:41.960
about specific results the issue is not
about trying to prove to somebody that

noticed when I give talks about that is
 

01:22:43.470 --> 01:22:47.440

that people really respond well to
 

01:22:47.450 --> 01:22:50.120
that people really respond well to
stories about the scientists doing their

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:50.130
stories about the scientists doing their
 

01:22:50.130 --> 01:22:53.780

ago 200 years though people really

01:23:20.150 --> 01:23:20.160
ago 200 years though people really
 

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:23.400

scientists you know we're trying to work

01:23:24.570 --> 01:23:24.580
scientists you know we're trying to work
 

01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:25.770
scientists you know we're trying to work
out what's going on we're trying to

01:23:25.770 --> 01:23:25.780
out what's going on we're trying to
 

01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:27.900
out what's going on we're trying to
trying to puzzle our way through and we

01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:27.910
trying to puzzle our way through and we
 

01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:30.720
trying to puzzle our way through and we
only have partial data and uncertain

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:30.730
only have partial data and uncertain
 

01:23:30.730 --> 01:23:32.490
only have partial data and uncertain
methods and we're still trying to work

01:23:32.490 --> 01:23:32.500
methods and we're still trying to work
 

01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:34.230
methods and we're still trying to work
something out people really identify

01:23:34.230 --> 01:23:34.240
something out people really identify
 

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:35.760
something out people really identify
with that and so I think if we if we

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:35.770
with that and so I think if we if we
 

01:23:35.770 --> 01:23:40.530
with that and so I think if we if we
bring up our more of those people and we

01:23:40.530 --> 01:23:40.540
bring up our more of those people and we
 

01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:42.510
bring up our more of those people and we
say no you know we don't need to just

01:23:42.510 --> 01:23:42.520
say no you know we don't need to just
 

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:44.700

for watching the poles and the question
 

01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:00.910
for watching the poles and the question
will be can we get past what Europe

01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:00.920
will be can we get past what Europe
 

01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:05.950

that is that images are very important
 

01:29:07.670 --> 01:29:09.760
that is that images are very important
for communicating and how can we get

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:09.770
for communicating and how can we get
 

01:29:09.770 --> 01:29:12.430

how can we capture images that will
 

01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:14.950
how can we capture images that will
convey change and I thought that may

01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960
convey change and I thought that may
 

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:16.440

01:33:44.630 --> 01:33:47.649
the government and in the media do you
think we can arrive at the truth about

01:33:47.649 --> 01:33:47.659
think we can arrive at the truth about
 

01:33:47.659 --> 01:33:50.919
think we can arrive at the truth about
and the American people can can arrive

01:33:50.919 --> 01:33:50.929
and the American people can can arrive
 

01:33:50.929 --> 01:33:56.879
and the American people can can arrive
at it at the truth about global warming

01:33:56.879 --> 01:33:56.889
 

01:33:56.889 --> 01:33:59.080
Josephine you want to take that one I

01:33:59.080 --> 01:33:59.090
Josephine you want to take that one I
 

01:33:59.090 --> 01:34:02.169
Josephine you want to take that one I
would like to take all the CEOs off like

01:34:02.169 --> 01:34:02.179
would like to take all the CEOs off like
 

01:34:02.179 --> 01:34:05.080
would like to take all the CEOs off like
the big energy sector and put them in a

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:05.090
the big energy sector and put them in a
 

01:34:05.090 --> 01:34:07.179
the big energy sector and put them in a
room and run our experiment with them

01:34:07.179 --> 01:34:07.189
room and run our experiment with them
 

01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:11.259
room and run our experiment with them
and try to motivate their social goals

01:34:11.259 --> 01:34:11.269
and try to motivate their social goals
 

01:34:11.269 --> 01:34:14.109
and try to motivate their social goals
and I think in each of them there is

01:34:14.109 --> 01:34:14.119
and I think in each of them there is
 

01:34:14.119 --> 01:34:20.439
and I think in each of them there is
also a father or a person who goes who

01:34:20.439 --> 01:34:20.449
also a father or a person who goes who
 

01:34:20.449 --> 01:34:24.729
also a father or a person who goes who
attends a religious group who cares for

01:34:24.729 --> 01:34:24.739
attends a religious group who cares for
 

01:34:24.739 --> 01:34:28.509
attends a religious group who cares for
others if we can tap into those parts in

01:34:28.509 --> 01:34:28.519
others if we can tap into those parts in
 

01:34:28.519 --> 01:34:31.959
others if we can tap into those parts in
the people who make decisions and people

01:34:31.959 --> 01:34:31.969
the people who make decisions and people
 

01:34:31.969 --> 01:34:36.850
the people who make decisions and people
who Lobby and two people who control the

01:34:36.850 --> 01:34:36.860
who Lobby and two people who control the
 

01:34:36.860 --> 01:34:40.660
who Lobby and two people who control the
money that would be great we are I have

01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:40.670
money that would be great we are I have
 

01:34:40.670 --> 01:34:42.279
money that would be great we are I have
not found access to them but I think

01:34:42.279 --> 01:34:42.289
not found access to them but I think
 

01:34:42.289 --> 01:34:44.489
not found access to them but I think
there I don't think it's completely

01:34:44.489 --> 01:34:44.499
there I don't think it's completely
 

01:34:44.499 --> 01:34:48.819
there I don't think it's completely
hopeless I think if we have to find a

01:34:48.819 --> 01:34:48.829
hopeless I think if we have to find a
 

01:34:48.829 --> 01:34:52.870
hopeless I think if we have to find a
way to reach people so that they see the

01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880
way to reach people so that they see the
 

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:56.020
way to reach people so that they see the
downside of the self-interest short-term

01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:56.030
downside of the self-interest short-term
 

01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:59.080
downside of the self-interest short-term
self-interest and again I think it's a

01:34:59.080 --> 01:34:59.090
self-interest and again I think it's a
 

01:34:59.090 --> 01:35:04.540
self-interest and again I think it's a
very difficult group to reach and but if

01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:04.550
very difficult group to reach and but if
 

01:35:04.550 --> 01:35:07.479
very difficult group to reach and but if
we can if you can't reach them if we can

01:35:07.479 --> 01:35:07.489
we can if you can't reach them if we can
 

01:35:07.489 --> 01:35:10.509
we can if you can't reach them if we can
reach enough others who will then put

01:35:10.509 --> 01:35:10.519
reach enough others who will then put
 

01:35:10.519 --> 01:35:14.140
reach enough others who will then put
pressure on their leaders that that

01:35:14.140 --> 01:35:14.150
pressure on their leaders that that
 

01:35:14.150 --> 01:35:17.109
pressure on their leaders that that
might be a way a way to do it but I

01:35:17.109 --> 01:35:17.119
might be a way a way to do it but I
 

01:35:17.119 --> 01:35:20.830
might be a way a way to do it but I
think it's a really big obstacle I it's

01:35:20.830 --> 01:35:20.840
think it's a really big obstacle I it's
 

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:23.990
think it's a really big obstacle I it's
that's not an easy solution

01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000
 

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.180
I've endorsed that idea i mean i've been

01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:27.190
I've endorsed that idea i mean i've been
 

01:35:27.190 --> 01:35:29.610
I've endorsed that idea i mean i've been
thinking about that too a way to get

01:35:29.610 --> 01:35:29.620
thinking about that too a way to get

that immersive visualization but also
carefully crafted narrative can really

carefully crafted narrative can really
 

01:35:42.190 --> 01:35:45.150
carefully crafted narrative can really
facilitate people having these shifts

01:35:45.150 --> 01:35:45.160
facilitate people having these shifts
 

01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:46.890
facilitate people having these shifts
and realizing that it is one earth

one of the main goals of which is
 

01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:41.160
one of the main goals of which is
communicating climate science so I'm

01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:41.170
communicating climate science so I'm
 

01:36:41.170 --> 01:36:42.990
communicating climate science so I'm
always interested in these discussions

01:36:42.990 --> 01:36:43.000
always interested in these discussions

talked about the barriers to this issue

01:36:49.530 --> 01:36:49.540
talked about the barriers to this issue
 

01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:51.270
talked about the barriers to this issue
one of which the first one being

because we make decisions based on

because we make decisions based on
 

01:36:57.880 --> 01:36:59.910
because we make decisions based on

uncertainty all the time in our
 

01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:01.260
uncertainty all the time in our
investments and when we purchase

insurance and when I have devoted my
 

01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:05.580

no job market yet for it so why for this

01:37:08.880 --> 01:37:08.890
no job market yet for it so why for this
 

01:37:08.890 --> 01:37:12.180
no job market yet for it so why for this
issue is the uncertainty such a problem

01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:12.190
issue is the uncertainty such a problem
 

01:37:12.190 --> 01:37:15.870
issue is the uncertainty such a problem
yes very good question i think it's

01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:15.880
yes very good question i think it's
 

01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:17.310
yes very good question i think it's
something a question that we have tried

01:37:17.310 --> 01:37:17.320
something a question that we have tried
 

01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:19.530
something a question that we have tried

science is fundamentally about

science is fundamentally about

but it's never making it go away

but it's never making it go away
everything that we do in science is

01:41:05.569 --> 01:41:05.579
everything that we do in science is
 

01:41:05.579 --> 01:41:07.359
everything that we do in science is
always about uncertainty you know even

01:41:07.359 --> 01:41:07.369
always about uncertainty you know even
 

01:41:07.369 --> 01:41:10.400

that's a pretty good you know even

01:41:11.780 --> 01:41:11.790
that's a pretty good you know even

quantum electro chromodynamics is not

quantum electro chromodynamics is not
 

01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:16.460
quantum electro chromodynamics is not
certain it's very good but it's still

01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:16.470
certain it's very good but it's still
 

01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:18.560

not a hundred percent right nothing is

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:18.570
not a hundred percent right nothing is
 

01:41:18.570 --> 01:41:20.600
not a hundred percent right nothing is
every one hundred percent and so I think

01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:20.610
every one hundred percent and so I think
 

01:41:20.610 --> 01:41:23.270
every one hundred percent and so I think
it's much more important that when these

01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280
it's much more important that when these
 

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:25.760
it's much more important that when these
kinds of issues come up and so it's all

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:25.770
kinds of issues come up and so it's all
 

01:41:25.770 --> 01:41:28.280
kinds of issues come up and so it's all
we're so uncertain that we just try and

01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:28.290
we're so uncertain that we just try and
 

01:41:28.290 --> 01:41:30.080
we're so uncertain that we just try and
break the link that people have between

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:30.090
break the link that people have between
 

01:41:30.090 --> 01:41:32.960
break the link that people have between
science and certainty which I think kind

01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:32.970
science and certainty which I think kind
 

01:41:32.970 --> 01:41:34.430
science and certainty which I think kind
of just can't bubble was under a lot of

01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440
of just can't bubble was under a lot of
 

01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:36.920
of just can't bubble was under a lot of
people with subconscious and and that's

01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:36.930
people with subconscious and and that's
 

01:41:36.930 --> 01:41:38.120
people with subconscious and and that's
what you break and then it doesn't

01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:38.130
what you break and then it doesn't
 

01:41:38.130 --> 01:41:40.520
what you break and then it doesn't
become an issue it then it's well how do

01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:40.530
become an issue it then it's well how do
 

01:41:40.530 --> 01:41:42.470
become an issue it then it's well how do
we act in the face of uncertainty and

01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480
we act in the face of uncertainty and
 

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:44.180
we act in the face of uncertainty and
and I think that what you were

01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:44.190
and I think that what you were
 

01:41:44.190 --> 01:41:46.310
and I think that what you were
discussing there is really trying to

01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320
discussing there is really trying to
 

01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:50.060
discussing there is really trying to
move that forward okay our last question

01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:50.070
move that forward okay our last question
 

01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:53.090
move that forward okay our last question
well just one small addition to that is

01:41:53.090 --> 01:41:53.100
well just one small addition to that is
 

01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:56.000
well just one small addition to that is
that I don't I just think that the

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:56.010
that I don't I just think that the
 

01:41:56.010 --> 01:41:57.950
that I don't I just think that the
reason uncertainty sticks is that it

01:41:57.950 --> 01:41:57.960
reason uncertainty sticks is that it
 

01:41:57.960 --> 01:41:59.890
reason uncertainty sticks is that it
gets a people's sense of security and

01:41:59.890 --> 01:41:59.900
gets a people's sense of security and
 

01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:02.180
gets a people's sense of security and
insecurity about what they have and

01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:02.190
insecurity about what they have and
 

01:42:02.190 --> 01:42:03.710
insecurity about what they have and
don't have and it's not about science at

01:42:03.710 --> 01:42:03.720
don't have and it's not about science at
 

01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:10.130
don't have and it's not about science at
all it's an emotional response so yeah I

01:42:10.130 --> 01:42:10.140
all it's an emotional response so yeah I
 

01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:15.290
all it's an emotional response so yeah I

the science because if you're debating
about you know whether there should be

01:42:29.630 --> 01:42:29.640

not you believe climate change is
 

01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:46.910
not you believe climate change is
happening so you you talk about policy

01:42:46.910 --> 01:42:46.920
happening so you you talk about policy
 

01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:49.100
happening so you you talk about policy
issues but then you start arguing about

01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:49.110
issues but then you start arguing about
 

01:42:49.110 --> 01:42:51.170
issues but then you start arguing about
the science so I'm wondering if you guys

advertising and commercial works for
people and um but when scientists start

01:49:50.980 --> 01:49:50.990
people and um but when scientists start
 

01:49:50.990 --> 01:49:53.620
people and um but when scientists start
to use those tools it's being seen as

01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:53.630
to use those tools it's being seen as
 

01:49:53.630 --> 01:49:55.810
to use those tools it's being seen as
manipulation and people don't realize

01:49:55.810 --> 01:49:55.820
manipulation and people don't realize
 

01:49:55.820 --> 01:49:57.910
manipulation and people don't realize
that every day everything that they see

01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920
that every day everything that they see
 

01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:00.850
that every day everything that they see
is being brought to them in a way that

01:50:00.850 --> 01:50:00.860
is being brought to them in a way that
 

01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:03.250
is being brought to them in a way that
is trying trying to manipulate them to

01:50:03.250 --> 01:50:03.260
is trying trying to manipulate them to
 

01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:05.980
is trying trying to manipulate them to
sell them something and but when science

01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:05.990
sell them something and but when science
 

01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:08.470
sell them something and but when science
does it it's seen as its its objective

01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480
does it it's seen as its its objective
 

01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:11.620
does it it's seen as its its objective
and and science doesn't want to engage

01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:11.630
and and science doesn't want to engage
 

01:50:11.630 --> 01:50:15.640
and and science doesn't want to engage
in using these tools so i think doing it

01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:15.650
in using these tools so i think doing it
 

01:50:15.650 --> 01:50:19.080
in using these tools so i think doing it
in more in more subtle ways might be

01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:19.090
in more in more subtle ways might be
 

01:50:19.090 --> 01:50:23.050
in more in more subtle ways might be
might be more effective also in getting

01:50:23.050 --> 01:50:23.060
might be more effective also in getting
 

01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:25.680
might be more effective also in getting
like scientists excited about

01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:25.690
like scientists excited about
 

01:50:25.690 --> 01:50:28.060
like scientists excited about
communicating science i think sign it's

01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:28.070
communicating science i think sign it's

only in the last over the last few years

01:50:30.250 --> 01:50:30.260
only in the last over the last few years
 

01:50:30.260 --> 01:50:32.440
only in the last over the last few years
that scientists have stepped out and i

01:50:32.440 --> 01:50:32.450
that scientists have stepped out and i
 

01:50:32.450 --> 01:50:34.390
that scientists have stepped out and i
want to communicate in different ways

01:50:34.390 --> 01:50:34.400
want to communicate in different ways
 

01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:36.130
want to communicate in different ways
other than just in peer-reviewed

01:50:36.130 --> 01:50:36.140
other than just in peer-reviewed
 

01:50:36.140 --> 01:50:38.410
other than just in peer-reviewed
journals and it's very new to scientist

01:50:38.410 --> 01:50:38.420
journals and it's very new to scientist
 

01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:40.960
journals and it's very new to scientist
scientists are not used to that at being

01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:40.970
scientists are not used to that at being
 

01:50:40.970 --> 01:50:43.960
scientists are not used to that at being
in a spotlight and and most of most of

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:43.970
in a spotlight and and most of most of
 

01:50:43.970 --> 01:50:47.080
in a spotlight and and most of most of
us don't don't like it that much that's

01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:47.090
us don't don't like it that much that's
 

01:50:47.090 --> 01:50:49.360
us don't don't like it that much that's
why we're in science I guess but I think

01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:49.370
why we're in science I guess but I think
 

01:50:49.370 --> 01:50:51.790
why we're in science I guess but I think
a combination of that and yeah using the

01:50:51.790 --> 01:50:51.800
a combination of that and yeah using the
 

01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:53.800
a combination of that and yeah using the
tools in a way that people feel

01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:53.810
tools in a way that people feel
 

01:50:53.810 --> 01:50:56.320
tools in a way that people feel
comfortable with would be a very good

01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:56.330
comfortable with would be a very good
 

01:50:56.330 --> 01:50:58.690
comfortable with would be a very good
thing to do but I don't think that we

01:50:58.690 --> 01:50:58.700
thing to do but I don't think that we
 

01:50:58.700 --> 01:51:01.960
thing to do but I don't think that we
can hand on our communication over to

01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:01.970
can hand on our communication over to
 

01:51:01.970 --> 01:51:05.020
can hand on our communication over to
Madison Avenue is actually they come to

us and want to know about our research
 

01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:09.100
us and want to know about our research
because they feel like we know more

because they feel like we know more
 

01:51:09.110 --> 01:51:38.400
because they feel like we know more
about it today

I'm trying to suggest in the first part

01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:08.810
I'm trying to suggest in the first part
 

01:53:08.810 --> 01:53:10.180
I'm trying to suggest in the first part
of my answer though is that there are

01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:10.190
of my answer though is that there are
 

01:53:10.190 --> 01:53:13.600
of my answer though is that there are
commercial interests that will spin up

01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:13.610
commercial interests that will spin up
 

01:53:13.610 --> 01:53:17.860
commercial interests that will spin up
PR around climate issues but that is

01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:17.870
PR around climate issues but that is
 

01:53:17.870 --> 01:53:20.110
PR around climate issues but that is
different from communicating the science

01:53:20.110 --> 01:53:20.120
different from communicating the science
 

01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:23.890
different from communicating the science
and so those people are clients and

01:53:23.890 --> 01:53:23.900
and so those people are clients and
 

01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:26.140
and so those people are clients and
consumers of the information just as all

01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:26.150
consumers of the information just as all
 

01:53:26.150 --> 01:53:28.390
consumers of the information just as all
those other sectors I described and

those other sectors I described and
 

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:31.690
those other sectors I described and
hopefully we can serve all of them with

01:53:31.690 --> 01:53:31.700
hopefully we can serve all of them with
 

01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:33.970
hopefully we can serve all of them with
the information that we can collate

01:53:33.970 --> 01:53:33.980
the information that we can collate
 

01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:36.940
the information that we can collate
together about climate science and I

01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:36.950
together about climate science and I
 

01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:39.100
together about climate science and I
think though that this gets back a

01:53:39.100 --> 01:53:39.110
think though that this gets back a
 

01:53:39.110 --> 01:53:41.229
think though that this gets back a
little bit to Jim's question about what

01:53:41.229 --> 01:53:41.239
little bit to Jim's question about what
 

01:53:41.239 --> 01:53:43.540
little bit to Jim's question about what
are we doing differently I think we do

01:53:43.540 --> 01:53:43.550
are we doing differently I think we do
 

01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:44.709
are we doing differently I think we do
recognize

01:53:44.709 --> 01:53:44.719

that communication requires a set of

01:53:48.370 --> 01:53:48.380
that communication requires a set of

that communication requires a set of
skills and expertise that is distinct

skills and expertise that is distinct
 

01:53:52.969 --> 01:53:55.629
skills and expertise that is distinct
from doing the science and so building

01:53:55.629 --> 01:53:55.639
from doing the science and so building
 

01:53:55.639 --> 01:53:59.350
from doing the science and so building
that capability and I am intentionally

01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360
that capability and I am intentionally
 

01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:01.959
that capability and I am intentionally
distinguishing that from PR I just think

01:54:01.959 --> 01:54:01.969
distinguishing that from PR I just think
 

01:54:01.969 --> 01:54:04.259
distinguishing that from PR I just think
that actually translating science into

01:54:04.259 --> 01:54:04.269
that actually translating science into
 

01:54:04.269 --> 01:54:06.580
that actually translating science into
useable nuggets of information for

01:54:06.580 --> 01:54:06.590
useable nuggets of information for
 

01:54:06.590 --> 01:54:11.020
useable nuggets of information for
different populations is a skill and one

01:54:11.020 --> 01:54:11.030
different populations is a skill and one
 

01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:12.459
different populations is a skill and one
that is going to require professional

01:54:12.459 --> 01:54:12.469
that is going to require professional
 

01:54:12.469 --> 01:54:15.580
that is going to require professional
development and career building for this

01:54:15.580 --> 01:54:15.590
development and career building for this
 

01:54:15.590 --> 01:54:19.930
development and career building for this
generation but I see that as distinct

01:54:19.930 --> 01:54:19.940
generation but I see that as distinct
 

01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:23.830
generation but I see that as distinct
from PR and I don't have a problem with

01:54:23.830 --> 01:54:23.840
from PR and I don't have a problem with
 

01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:27.100
from PR and I don't have a problem with
people using PR for PR but I recognize

01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:27.110
people using PR for PR but I recognize
 

01:54:27.110 --> 01:54:30.160
people using PR for PR but I recognize
it for what it is and I think building a

it for what it is and I think building a
 

01:54:30.170 --> 01:54:32.500
it for what it is and I think building a
capability around communication is very

01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:32.510
capability around communication is very
 

01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:35.739
capability around communication is very
important because of all the myth the

clear PR action but that has to come

01:55:02.259 --> 01:55:02.269
clear PR action but that has to come
 

01:55:02.269 --> 01:55:06.430
clear PR action but that has to come
from society that can't come from the

from society that can't come from the
 

01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:09.359
from society that can't come from the
government telling society what to do I

01:55:09.359 --> 01:55:09.369
government telling society what to do I
 

01:55:09.369 --> 01:55:11.799

mean that's not how our governments

01:55:11.799 --> 01:55:11.809
mean that's not how our governments
