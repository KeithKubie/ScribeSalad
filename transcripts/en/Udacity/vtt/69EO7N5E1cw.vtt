00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
All right so let's clean this up a bit. We've broken FR down into x and y component.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
That means we don't need FR anymore, instead, we're going to replace it with FRx,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which points to the right and FRy, which points down.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let's say, I'll tell you the mass is 10 kg. Can you fill out the rest of these five forces?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We already calculated FRy and x, what's mg? What's the normal force?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What's the force the wall is pushing on the cart with?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Remember the acceleration is equal to zero and one thing to be very careful of is the normal force.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It may not be exactly equal to mg like it was last time.

00:00:33.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This is a tricky problem but if you get it right, very impressive. Good luck!
