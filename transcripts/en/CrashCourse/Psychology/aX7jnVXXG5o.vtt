00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.320
Ever heard a really good joke about polio?
Or made a casual reference to someone having

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.850
hepatitis? Or maybe teased your buddy by saying
he has muscular dystrophy?

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.959
Of course you have never done that, because
you are not a terrible person. You'd never

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.320
make fun of someone for having a physical
illness, but folks make all kinds of offhand

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.540
remarks about people having mental illnesses
and never give it a second thought.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.290
How often have you heard a person say that
someone's psycho, or schizo, or bipolar, or

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.200
OCD? I can pretty much guarantee that the
people who used those terms had no idea what they actually meant.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.900
We've talked about how psychological disorders
and the people who have them have often  been stigmatized.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.160
But at the same time, we tend to minimize
those disorders, using them as nicknames for

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.600
things that people do, think, or say, that
may not exactly be universal, but are still basically healthy.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.220
And we all do it, but only because we don't
really understand those conditions.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.530
But that's why we're here, because as we go
deeper into psychological disorders, we get

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.300
a clearer understanding of their symptoms,
types, causes, and the perspectives that help explain them.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.890
And some of the most common disorders have
their root in an unpleasant mental state that's

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.320
familiar to us all: anxiety.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.170
It's a part of being human, but for some people
it can develop into intense fear, and paralyzing

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.180
dread, and ultimately turn into full-fledged
anxiety disorder.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.729
Defining psychological disorders again: a
deviant, distressful, and dysfunctional pattern

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.500
of thoughts, feelings, or behaviors that interferes
with the ability to function in a healthy way.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.970
So when it comes to anxiety, that definition
is the difference between the guy you probably

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.130
called phobic because he didn't like Space
Mountain as much as you did, and the person

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.760
who truly can't leave their house for fear
of interacting with others.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.640
It's the difference between the girl who's
teased by her friends as being OCD because

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.900
she does her laundry every night and the girl who
has to wash her hands so often that they bleed.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.900
Starting today, you're going to understand
all of those terms you've been using.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.500
We commonly equate anxiety with fear, but
anxiety disorders aren't just a matter of fear itself.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.900
A key component is also what we do to get
rid of that fear.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.979
Say someone almost drowned as a kid and is
now afraid of water.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.739
A family picnic at the river may cause that
anxiety to bubble up, and to cope, they may

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.170
stay sequestered in the car, less anxious
but probably still unhappy while the rest

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.450
of the family is having fun.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.260
So, in clinical terms, anxiety disorders are
characterized not only by distressing, persistent

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.170
anxiety but also often by the dysfunctional
behaviors that reduce that anxiety.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.430
At least a fifth of all people will experience
a diagnosable anxiety disorder of some kind

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.730
at some point in their lives. That is a lot
of us.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.950
So I want to start out with a condition that
used to be categorized as an anxiety disorder

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.190
but is now considered complex enough to be
in a class by itself, Obsessive-Compulsive

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.830
Disorder or OCD.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.349
You probably know that condition is characterized
by unwanted repetitive thoughts, which become

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.629
obsessions, which are sometimes accompanied
by actions, which become compulsions.

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.900
And it is a great example of a psychological
disorder that could use some mental-health myth busting.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.819
Being neat, and orderly, and fastidious does
not make you OCD.

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.730
OCD is a debilitating condition whose sufferers
take normal behaviors like, washing your hands,

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.129
or double checking that you turned off the
stove and perform them compulsively.

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:18.000
And they often use these compulsive, even ritualistic
behaviors to relieve intense and unbearable anxiety.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.200
So, soon they're scrubbing their hands every five minutes, or constantly checking the stove,

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.200
or counting the exact number of steps they
take everywhere they go.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.209
If you're still unclear about what it means
for disorders to be deviant, distressful and

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.980
dysfunctional, OCD might help you understand.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.989
Because it is hard to keep a job, run a household,
sit still, or do much of anything if you feel

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.680
intensely compelled to run to the kitchen
twenty times an hour.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.650
And both the thoughts and behaviors associated with
OCD are often driven by a fear that is itself

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.879
obsessive, like if you don't go to the kitchen
right now your house will burn down and your

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.569
child will die which makes the condition that
much more distressing and self-reinforcing.

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.100
There are treatments that help OCD including certain
kinds of psychotherapy and some psychotropic drugs.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.970
But the key here is that it is not a description
for your roommate who cleans her bathroom

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.900
twice a week, or the guy in the cubicle next to
you, who only likes to use green felt tip pens.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.170
And even though OCD is considered its own
unique set of psychological issues, the pervasive

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.459
senses of fear, worry, and loss of control
that often accompany it, have a lot in common

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.069
with other anxiety disorders.

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:21.569
The broadest of these is Generalized Anxiety
Disorder or GAD.

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:26.860
People with this condition tend to feel continually
tense and apprehensive, experiencing unfocused,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.000
negative, and out-of-control feelings.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.319
Of course feeling this way occasionally is
common enough, but feeling it consistently

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:37.039
for over six months - the length of time required for
a formal diagnosis - is not.

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:42.069
Folks with GAD worry all the time and are
frequently agitated and on edge, but unlike

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:46.930
some other kinds of anxiety, patients often can't
identify what's causing the anxiousness, so

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.379
they don't even know what to avoid.

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:53.700
Then there's Panic Disorder, which affects about
1 in 75 people, most often teens and young adults.

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:59.270
It's calling card is Panic Attacks or sudden
episodes of intense dread or sudden fear that

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.839
come without warning.

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:06.099
Unlike the symptoms of GAD which can be hard
to pin down, Panic Attacks are brief, well-defined,

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.930
and sometimes severe bouts of elevated anxiety.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.479
And if you've ever had one, or been with someone
who has, you know that they call these attacks

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.659
for good reason.

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:19.539
They can cause chest pains and racing heartbeat,
difficulty breathing and a general sense that

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:23.069
you're going crazy or even dying. It's as
awful as it sounds.

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:27.319
We've talked a lot about the body's physiological
fight or flight response and that's definitely

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:31.270
part of what's going on here, even though
there often isn't an obvious trigger.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.430
There may be a genetic pre-disposition to
panic disorder, but persistent stress or having

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.369
experienced psychological trauma in the past
can also set you up for these attacks.

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:43.360
And because the attacks themselves can be
downright terrifying, a common trigger for

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.529
panic disorder is simply the fear of having
another panic attack.

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:48.930
How's that for a kick in the head?

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.349
Say you have a panic attack on a bus, or you
find yourself hyperventilating in front of

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:56.089
dozens of strangers with nowhere to go to
calm yourself down, that whole ordeal might

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:59.659
make you never want to be in that situation
again, so your anxiety could lead you to start

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.469
avoiding crowded or confined places.

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:07.259
At this point the initial anxiety has spun
of into a fear of anxiety which means, welcome

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:10.679
you've migrated into another realm of anxiety
disorder, Phobias.

00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:14.409
And again this is a term that's been misused
for a long time to describe people who, say,

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:18.259
they don't like cats, or are uncomfortable
on long plane trips.

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:21.990
Simply experiencing fear or discomfort doesn't
make you phobic.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.339
In clinical terms, phobias are persistent,
irrational fears of specific objects, activities,

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:31.729
or situations, that also, and this is important,
leads to avoidance behavior.

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:37.119
You hear a lot about fears of heights, or
spiders, or clowns, and those are real things.

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:40.899
They're specific phobias that focus on particular
objects or situations.

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:44.629
For example, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in
Maryland is a seven-thousand meter span that

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:49.419
crosses the Chesapeake Bay, if you want to
get to or from Eastern Maryland that's pretty

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:53.929
much the only way to do it, at least in a
car, but there are thousands of people who

00:06:53.929 --> 00:06:57.379
are so afraid of crossing that bridge that
they simply can't do it.

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:01.520
So, to accommodate this avoidance behavior,
driver services are available.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:08.000
For $25 people with Gephyrophobia, a fear of bridges,
can hire someone to drive themselves, and their kids, 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.100
and dogs, and groceries across the bridge
in their own car, while trying not to freak out.

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:18.439
But other phobias lack such specific triggers,
what we might think of as social phobia, currently

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:23.659
known as social anxiety disorder, is characterized
by anxiety related to interacting or being

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:28.110
seen by others, which could be triggered by
a phone call, or being called on in class,

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.089
or just thinking about meeting new people.

00:07:30.089 --> 00:07:34.389
So you can probably see at this point how
anxiety disorders are related and how they

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:36.449
can be difficult to tease apart.

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:39.499
The same thing can be said about what we think
causes them.

00:07:39.499 --> 00:07:44.869
Because much in the same way anxiety can show
up as both a feeling like panic, and a thought,

00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:50.100
like is my kitchen on fire, there are also two main
perspectives on how we currently view anxiety

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.900
as a function of both learning and biology.

00:07:52.969 --> 00:07:57.139
The learning perspective suggests that things
like, conditioning, and observational learning

00:07:57.139 --> 00:08:01.639
and cognition, all of which we've talked about
before best explain the source of our anxiety.

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:05.279
Remember our behaviorist friend, John B. Watson
and his conditioning experiments with poor

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:09.539
little Albert, by making a loud scary noise
every time you showed the kid a white rat,

00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:15.000
he ended up conditioning the boy to fear any
furry object, from bunnies, to dogs, to fur coats.

00:08:15.089 --> 00:08:20.500
That conditioning used two specific learning processes
to cement itself in Little Albert's young mind.

00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:26.069
Stimulus Generalization, expanded or generalized
his fear of the rat to other furry objects,

00:08:26.069 --> 00:08:29.300
the same principle holds true if you were,
like, attacked by your neighbours mean parrot

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.999
and subsequently fear all birds.

00:08:30.999 --> 00:08:36.719
But then the anxiety is solidified through
reinforcement, every time you avoid or escape

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:42.199
a feared situations, a pair of fuzzy slippers
or a robin on the street, you ease your anxiety,

00:08:42.199 --> 00:08:46.900
which might make you feel better temporarily,
but it actually reinforces your phobic behavior,

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.040
making it stronger.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.889
Cognition also influences our anxiety, whether
we interpret a strange noise outside as a

00:08:52.889 --> 00:08:58.079
hungry bear, or a robber, or merely the wind,
determines if we roll-over and keep snoring,

00:08:58.079 --> 00:08:59.819
or freak out and run for a kitchen knife.

00:08:59.819 --> 00:09:04.220
And we might also acquire anxiety from other
people through observational learning.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:08.160
A parent who's terrified of water may end
up instilling that fear in their child by

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.670
violently snatching them away from kiddie
pools or generally acting anxious around park

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.250
fountains and duck ponds.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.350
But there're also equally important biological
perspectives. Natural selection, for instance,

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:23.709
might explain why we seem to fear certain potentially
dangerous animals, like snakes, or why fears

00:09:23.709 --> 00:09:26.560
of heights or closed in spaces are relatively
common.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.509
It's probably true that our more wary ancestors
who had the sense to stay away from cliff

00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:35.509
edges and hissing serpents were more likely
to live another day and pass along their genes,

00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:40.339
so this might explain why those fears can
persist, and why even people who live in places

00:09:40.339 --> 00:09:43.149
without poisonous snakes would still fear
snakes anyway.

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:46.000
And then you got the genetics and the brain
chemistry to consider.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.980
Research has shown for example that identical
twins, those eternal test subjects, are more

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.250
likely to develop phobias even if they're
raised apart.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:58.000
Some researchers have detected seventeen different
genes that seem to be expressed with various

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.509
anxiety disorders.

00:09:59.509 --> 00:10:03.920
So it may be that some folks are just naturally
more anxious than others and they might pass

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.610
on that quality to their kids.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:10.189
And of course individual brains have a lot
to say about how they process anxiety.

00:10:10.189 --> 00:10:14.540
Physiologically, people who experience panic
attacks, generalized anxiety, or obsessive

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:19.389
compulsions show over-arousal in the areasof the brain that deal in impulse control

00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:20.689
and habitual behaviors.

00:10:20.689 --> 00:10:24.920
Now we don't know whether these irregularities
cause the disorder or are caused by it, but

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:30.100
again, it reinforces the truism that everything that
is psychological is simultaneously biological.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:34.899
And that holds true for many other psychological
disorders we'll talk about in the coming weeks,

00:10:34.899 --> 00:10:38.519
many of which have names that you've also
heard being misused in the past.

00:10:38.519 --> 00:10:43.259
Today you learned what defines an anxiety
disorder, as well as the symptoms of obsessive

00:10:43.259 --> 00:10:46.959
compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder,
panic disorder and phobias.

00:10:46.959 --> 00:10:51.800
You also learned about the two main perspectives
on the origins of anxiety disorders, the learning

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.699
perspective and the biological perspective
and hopefully you learned not to use "OCD"

00:10:56.699 --> 00:10:58.149
as a punch line from now on.
