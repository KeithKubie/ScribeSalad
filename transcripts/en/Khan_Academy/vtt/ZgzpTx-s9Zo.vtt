00:00:00.074 --> 00:00:03.491
Voiceover:Let's think about
what seven plus six is,

00:00:03.491 --> 00:00:05.044
and I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:05.044 --> 00:00:06.488
and think about it on your own.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.534
I'm assuming you've given a go at it.

00:00:09.534 --> 00:00:10.795
Let's think about it.

00:00:10.795 --> 00:00:12.734
We could do this as seven objects

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:14.555
plus six more objects,

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:17.306
and then think about how
many total objects we had.

00:00:17.306 --> 00:00:20.439
For example, we could view
it as seven, say, tomatoes,

00:00:20.826 --> 00:00:24.845
so one tomato, two tomatoes,

00:00:25.276 --> 00:00:29.003
three tomatoes, four tomatoes,

00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:35.821
five, six, and seven,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.360
and then to that,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.132
we're going to add six more objects.

00:00:39.132 --> 00:00:40.337
Let's say they're blueberries,

00:00:40.337 --> 00:00:42.591
and we care about the
total amount of fruit.

00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:55.508
So, one, two, three, four, five, and six -

00:00:55.877 --> 00:00:57.535
six blueberries.

00:00:57.535 --> 00:00:59.376
Now, how many total pieces of fruit

00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:00.650
do I have in all now?

00:01:01.988 --> 00:01:04.136
I started with seven, so that's seven.

00:01:04.136 --> 00:01:06.168
If I keep counting, this is seven

00:01:06.168 --> 00:01:07.458
so this is going to be eight,

00:01:07.458 --> 00:01:13.344
nine, 10, 11, 12 and 13.

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:17.661
I now have a total of 13 pieces of fruit -

00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:19.803
13 pieces of fruit.

00:01:19.803 --> 00:01:20.887
What are other ways

00:01:20.887 --> 00:01:22.435
that we could have thought about this?

00:01:22.604 --> 00:01:25.051
We could have also done
it on a number line.

00:01:26.451 --> 00:01:29.112
Let's draw ourselves a number line.

00:01:29.112 --> 00:01:32.753
Let me do this in a color

00:01:32.753 --> 00:01:34.706
that I haven't used yet, actually.

00:01:35.475 --> 00:01:37.574
Let's say I have a number line

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.006
just like that.

00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:44.516
I can start the number line at seven.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.609
I could start at seven,

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:48.219
and I'm going to add six more.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.260
I'm going to move six
more up the number line.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.141
This is one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:01:56.141 --> 00:01:57.222
and, of course, I could keep going.

00:01:57.222 --> 00:02:02.774
It's going to be eight,
nine, 10, 11, 12, 13.

00:02:02.774 --> 00:02:04.375
Of course, you could keep on going.

00:02:05.128 --> 00:02:07.289
Seven plus six - you could visualize this

00:02:07.642 --> 00:02:09.479
as starting at seven,

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.502
and then making six jumps
up the number line -

00:02:12.502 --> 00:02:18.034
one, two, three, four, five, six.

00:02:18.034 --> 00:02:23.805
Either way, we get to 13.

00:02:24.374 --> 00:02:27.391
Another way to think about it is,

00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:29.856
look, we started with seven.

00:02:29.856 --> 00:02:32.964
We added three to get to 10,

00:02:32.964 --> 00:02:35.145
and so we have to add another three,

00:02:35.145 --> 00:02:38.382
which gets us to 13.

00:02:38.382 --> 00:02:39.615
That really goes to the heart

00:02:39.615 --> 00:02:42.545
of what the number 13 represents.

00:02:42.545 --> 00:02:47.928
The number 13 has a one as its left digit,

00:02:47.928 --> 00:02:50.112
This digit is in the tens place,

00:02:50.342 --> 00:02:53.653
so it literally represents one 10.

00:02:53.976 --> 00:02:59.493
So, it's one 10 plus
three, plus three ones.

00:02:59.493 --> 00:03:01.664
You see that right over here.

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:03.614
When I added the pieces of fruit,

00:03:03.814 --> 00:03:07.565
this right over here is one group of 10.

00:03:07.918 --> 00:03:10.149
So, that's one group of 10.

00:03:11.318 --> 00:03:12.873
We had to add three to get

00:03:12.873 --> 00:03:14.432
to that one group of 10.

00:03:14.432 --> 00:03:17.094
We kind of filled that bucket,

00:03:17.094 --> 00:03:19.124
and then we had three more,

00:03:19.124 --> 00:03:21.256
so when you add seven plus six,

00:03:21.256 --> 00:03:24.440
you fill one whole group of 10

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.450
and then you have three ones left over.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.648
This is the three ones right over here.

00:03:30.648 --> 00:03:32.535
Another way you could think about it is

00:03:32.535 --> 00:03:34.759
seven plus six is the same thing

00:03:35.574 --> 00:03:41.383
as 10 plus three, which, of course, is 13.

00:03:41.383 --> 00:03:44.106
This is the same thing - one 10 is 10,

00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:48.812
plus three, plus three ones -

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:52.812
13 either way you look at it.
