was a time when people didn't think
 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.780
was a time when people didn't think
about what are the other options out

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
about what are the other options out
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.250
about what are the other options out
there and I think there's a lot of time

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260
there and I think there's a lot of time
 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.980
there and I think there's a lot of time
now it's spent saying what are people's

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990
now it's spent saying what are people's
 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.760
now it's spent saying what are people's
options and maybe what are their sort of

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770
options and maybe what are their sort of
 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.400
options and maybe what are their sort of
indirect options you know for example

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410
indirect options you know for example
 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.340
indirect options you know for example
you know there's a generation that used

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350
you know there's a generation that used
 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.140
you know there's a generation that used
to get up every morning and drink coffee

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150
to get up every morning and drink coffee
 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.200
to get up every morning and drink coffee
right now there's a generation that gets

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210
right now there's a generation that gets
 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.570
right now there's a generation that gets
up and drinks a carbonated soft drink

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580
up and drinks a carbonated soft drink
 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.140
up and drinks a carbonated soft drink
and never even touches a cup of coffee

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150
and never even touches a cup of coffee
 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.580
and never even touches a cup of coffee
unless occasionally they might stop off

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
unless occasionally they might stop off
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.830
unless occasionally they might stop off
at a Starbucks which is in their mix but

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840
at a Starbucks which is in their mix but
 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.110
at a Starbucks which is in their mix but
but again it's it's a dynamic that

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.120
but again it's it's a dynamic that
 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.730
but again it's it's a dynamic that
people need to think more broadly about

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740
people need to think more broadly about
 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.100
people need to think more broadly about
what are what are the other options and

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110
what are what are the other options and
 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.140
what are what are the other options and
then it becomes exciting because you

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150
then it becomes exciting because you
 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.650
then it becomes exciting because you
figure out how to make that connection

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660
figure out how to make that connection
 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.740
figure out how to make that connection
with your customer as we say really love

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750
with your customer as we say really love
 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.320
with your customer as we say really love
your customer and I just sort of say you

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330
your customer and I just sort of say you
 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.580
your customer and I just sort of say you
know ok we're going to do everything to

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
know ok we're going to do everything to
 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.259
know ok we're going to do everything to
keep them but but you really love your

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269
keep them but but you really love your
 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.250
keep them but but you really love your
customer

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260
 
 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.710
 
it's interesting to look at the ones

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720
it's interesting to look at the ones
 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.089
it's interesting to look at the ones
that have remained strong like JPMorgan

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099
that have remained strong like JPMorgan
 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.350
that have remained strong like JPMorgan
Chase which has remained strong through

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360
Chase which has remained strong through
 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.800
Chase which has remained strong through
all of this in part because I I believe

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810
all of this in part because I I believe
 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.220
all of this in part because I I believe
the JPMorgan culture and heritage is

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230
the JPMorgan culture and heritage is
 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.440
the JPMorgan culture and heritage is
something that has really sustained them

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450
something that has really sustained them
 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.780
something that has really sustained them
it was about integrity it was about

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790
it was about integrity it was about
 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.580
it was about integrity it was about
business relationships and they've used

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590
business relationships and they've used
 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.339
business relationships and they've used
that and they've behaved in that fashion

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349
that and they've behaved in that fashion
 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.180
that and they've behaved in that fashion
and so it there's been a continuity for

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190
and so it there's been a continuity for
 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.350
and so it there's been a continuity for
some that have have been absorbed in the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360
some that have have been absorbed in the
 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.630
some that have have been absorbed in the
process of this what I call economic

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640
process of this what I call economic
 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.569
process of this what I call economic
transformation I think in many ways some

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579
transformation I think in many ways some
 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.180
transformation I think in many ways some
of them sort of lost their authenticity

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190
of them sort of lost their authenticity
 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.619
of them sort of lost their authenticity
that true north where they came from and

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629
that true north where they came from and
 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.050
that true north where they came from and
I think companies look at a Wells Fargo

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060
I think companies look at a Wells Fargo
 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.750
I think companies look at a Wells Fargo
which is very strong out west I think

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760
which is very strong out west I think
 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.119
which is very strong out west I think
they're they have stayed strong and are

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129
they're they have stayed strong and are
 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.069
they're they have stayed strong and are
continuing to do things to say strong

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079
continuing to do things to say strong
 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.849
continuing to do things to say strong

even as they absorb the Wachovia vis of
 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.140
even as they absorb the Wachovia vis of
the world and one of the things that's

the world and one of the things that's
 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.089
the world and one of the things that's
going to be I think very interesting and

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099
going to be I think very interesting and
 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.180
going to be I think very interesting and
you've seen this consolidation in many

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190
you've seen this consolidation in many
 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.129
you've seen this consolidation in many
consumer packaged goods I mean I worked

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139
consumer packaged goods I mean I worked
 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.289
consumer packaged goods I mean I worked
for one I worked for General Foods if

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299
for one I worked for General Foods if
 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.400
for one I worked for General Foods if
you ask somebody today

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410
you ask somebody today
 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.830
you ask somebody today
of a certain generation with General

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840
of a certain generation with General
 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.050
of a certain generation with General
Foods they'd be clueless and one of the

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060
Foods they'd be clueless and one of the
 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.490

company which then merged with Kraft and

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660
company which then merged with Kraft and
 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.979
company which then merged with Kraft and
over time became what they called one

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989
over time became what they called one
 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.039
over time became what they called one
Kraft and so now there's a whole

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049
Kraft and so now there's a whole
 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.229
Kraft and so now there's a whole

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239
communication around building that brand
 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.199
communication around building that brand
and I think it's really sort of laying

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209
and I think it's really sort of laying
 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.870
and I think it's really sort of laying
the framework for people to understand

the framework for people to understand
almost more understand your values right

almost more understand your values right
 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.970
almost more understand your values right
because that's what people link to in

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980
because that's what people link to in
 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.229
because that's what people link to in
establishing brand relationships I

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239
establishing brand relationships I
 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.420
establishing brand relationships I

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.699
believe over the long term and you had
asked a question about loyalty it's

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709
asked a question about loyalty it's
 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.099
asked a question about loyalty it's
about what that relationship is it's not

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109
about what that relationship is it's not
 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.740
about what that relationship is it's not
