00:00:01.235 --> 00:00:03.504
Now, I'm guessing no matter who
you're supporting this November,

00:00:03.537 --> 00:00:06.173
you will agree this election
is the (bleep) worst.

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:08.041
-But...
-(laughter)

00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:11.411
luckily, the second debate,
we all got to meet Ken Bone!

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.280
-(cheering, applause)
-Ken Bone!

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:15.782
The be-sweatered, mustachioed,
undecided (bleep) machine

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:17.584
who stole the Internet's heart,

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:19.253
and then made love to it
sweetly.

00:00:19.286 --> 00:00:21.054
In honor of this civic-minded
Build-A-Bear,

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:22.689
we played the hashtag game
KenBoneFacts.

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:25.125
For instance,
did you know that if Ken Bone

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.427
unfurled his mustache,
it would dwarf the wingspan

00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:29.630
of a bald eagle--
that's a true story.

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:33.800
So... uh, we tracked down
the man himself on Skype,

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.836
uh, got to chat with Ken Bone--

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.671
he is goddamn delightful--

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.940
and we got him to choose
his favorite fact.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:42.376
Just for you,
ladies and gentlemen, Ken Bone!

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:43.810
(cheering)

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:45.712
Thanks, Chris.
It was a real thrill

00:00:45.746 --> 00:00:49.616
to see KenBoneFacts trending
on Twitter on Monday night.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.619
I loved every one of them,
but I can't pick my favorite

00:00:52.653 --> 00:00:54.488
'cause I'm undecided.

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:56.857
So I'm gonna read
a few of the best ones.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.059
"He can't attend
an ugly sweater party,

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:01.995
because they all look
so good on him."

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:05.399
-Duh.
-(laughter)

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:09.269
"The Illuminati comes to <i>him </i>
for advice on what to do."

00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:11.205
Yep, I actually got
a conference call

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:13.607
with Jay Z and BeyoncÃ©
after this.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.242
(laughter)

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:17.377
"He is the fifth Golden Girl."

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:21.215
Oh, look, and here's
one of the original cast photos.

00:01:21.248 --> 00:01:23.183
(applause, whooping)

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:28.522
"Clowns tweet
about Ken Bone sightings."

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:29.957
-(laughter, applause)
-Also true.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.692
But if I ever see one of them,

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:33.961
I'm gonna go Liam Neeson
on their ass.

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:36.263
(laughter)

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:40.033
"Ken's hugs create such
dangerous levels of euphoria,

00:01:40.067 --> 00:01:42.469
they had to be regulated
by the FDA."

00:01:42.503 --> 00:01:44.104
You know, that's actually true.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:45.973
You should not operate
heavy machinery

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:47.941
after you snuggle with me.

00:01:47.975 --> 00:01:49.376
(laughter)

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.178
Thanks so much, Chris.

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:53.046
And I just want
to encourage everybody

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.082
to get out there
and register to vote,

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.817
because in 2016--

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.719
Yes we Ken!

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:01.088
-HARDWICK: Ah, fantastic!
-(cheering, applause)

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:04.458
Ken (bleep) Bone!

00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:08.662
Oh, by the way... before
we get off the Bone train,

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:10.430
someone on Twitter sent me this,

00:02:10.464 --> 00:02:13.600
the sexy Ken Bone outfit
for Halloween.

00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:17.738
So naturally, I had to ask Ken
what he thought about it.

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:21.041
You know, Chris, I did see
the sexy Ken Bone costume,

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:22.876
and while I was
strangely aroused,

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.279
I want to point out
that there's only one

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:27.915
real sexy Ken Bone outfit
out there.

00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:30.284
-I'm wearing it.
-Yes!

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:33.520
Sexy Ken Bone!
The real sexy Ken Bone.

00:02:33.554 --> 00:02:33.620
Get out there and vote,
everyone.
