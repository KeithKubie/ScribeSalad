00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.230
Solve the absolute value of 3x
minus 9 is equal to 0 and

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.180
graph the solution
on a number line.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.380
So let me just rewrite it.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.880
We have the absolute value of
3x minus 9 is equal to 0.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.970
So if the absolute value of
something is equal to 0, what

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.550
can that something be?

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.120
Well the only thing that you
could take the absolute value

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.830
of and get 0 is 0.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.610
So that something has to be 0.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.180
So it has to be a 0 inside of
the absolute value sign.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.500
So we know that 3x minus
9 must be equal to 0.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.530
If this was any other
non-negative value, you would

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.390
have two values.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.670
If this was a positive 2, you
would say 3x minus 9 could be

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.860
positive 2 or negative 2.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.030
But when you're dealing with 0,
3x minus 9 has to equal 0.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.050
That's the only way when you
take the absolute value,

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.520
you're going to get 0.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.980
So then we just solve this.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.625
We add 9 to both sides
of this equation.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.200
You get 3x is equal to 9.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.140
Divide both sides by 3 and you
get x is equal to 9/3 or x is

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.140
equal to 3.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.090
And you're done.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.530
And then we just do
the second part.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.790
Graph the solution
on a number line.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.400
So let's graph.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.770
We have a number line here.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.730
Let me draw one.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:22.950
It's a number line.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.130
I'll put some negative values.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:32.890
Maybe we'll start negative 2,
negative 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.190
Could keep going on.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.290
But the solution is
x is equal to 3.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.720
So just graphing that on a
number line, we just put a

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.380
little dot at 3.
