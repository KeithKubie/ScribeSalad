about the world and everybody was down
 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.679
about the world and everybody was down
and you're starting to figure out well

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689
and you're starting to figure out well
 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.749
and you're starting to figure out well
hop you know how do you position

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759
hop you know how do you position
 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.310
hop you know how do you position
yourself I I think for us we ended up as

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320
yourself I I think for us we ended up as
 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.130
yourself I I think for us we ended up as
a firm having everybody focused on one

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140
a firm having everybody focused on one
 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.910
a firm having everybody focused on one
goal and that goal was we need to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920
goal and that goal was we need to
 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.640
goal and that goal was we need to
absolutely differentiate ourselves this

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650
absolutely differentiate ourselves this
 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.700
absolutely differentiate ourselves this
year from everyone else because if we

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710
year from everyone else because if we
 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.160
year from everyone else because if we
don't differentiate ourselves the firm

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170
don't differentiate ourselves the firm
 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.190
don't differentiate ourselves the firm
is going to have a number of issues and

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200
is going to have a number of issues and
 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.930
is going to have a number of issues and
I think it was having everybody focused

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940
I think it was having everybody focused
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.880
I think it was having everybody focused
as one on making sure that we could

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890
as one on making sure that we could
 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.600
as one on making sure that we could
produce I think very good returns for

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610
produce I think very good returns for
 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.609
produce I think very good returns for
people i think was it strategic i just

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619
people i think was it strategic i just
 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.380
people i think was it strategic i just
don't think we had a choice right so yes

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390
don't think we had a choice right so yes
 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.370
don't think we had a choice right so yes
it was strategic but ultimately what you

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380
it was strategic but ultimately what you
 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.810
it was strategic but ultimately what you
find with strategic issues is you've got

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
find with strategic issues is you've got
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.039
find with strategic issues is you've got
to figure out where you want your firm

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049
to figure out where you want your firm
 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.770
to figure out where you want your firm
to go and sort of the big changes that

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780
to go and sort of the big changes that
 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.359
to go and sort of the big changes that
you want to go I think the big one for

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
you want to go I think the big one for
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.389
you want to go I think the big one for
us if you don't count this year was

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399
us if you don't count this year was
 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.770
us if you don't count this year was
about sort of nine years ago we made a

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780
about sort of nine years ago we made a
 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.489
about sort of nine years ago we made a
strategic decision to go to Asia and

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499
strategic decision to go to Asia and
 

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:35.950
strategic decision to go to Asia and
sort of for us we thought that Asia

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960
sort of for us we thought that Asia
 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.849
sort of for us we thought that Asia
would be where there was going to be a

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859
would be where there was going to be a
 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:40.849
would be where there was going to be a
lot of growth I think a lot of people

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859
lot of growth I think a lot of people
 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.550
lot of growth I think a lot of people
thought that you know how did we do it

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560
thought that you know how did we do it
 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.929
thought that you know how did we do it
we ended up opening offices throughout

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939
we ended up opening offices throughout
 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.149
we ended up opening offices throughout
Asia and you know there's a real cost to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159
Asia and you know there's a real cost to
 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.249
Asia and you know there's a real cost to
doing that opening our office in New

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259
doing that opening our office in New
 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.459
doing that opening our office in New
Delhi in Bangkok in Jakarta in Beijing

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469
Delhi in Bangkok in Jakarta in Beijing
 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.629
Delhi in Bangkok in Jakarta in Beijing
and Shanghai Manila so when you sort of

00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:56.639
and Shanghai Manila so when you sort of
 

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:59.179
and Shanghai Manila so when you sort of
look at that there's there was a cost

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189
look at that there's there was a cost
 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.800
look at that there's there was a cost
that it was going to cost us a lot of

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
that it was going to cost us a lot of
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.459
that it was going to cost us a lot of
money to do it but we thought over time

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469
money to do it but we thought over time
 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.669
money to do it but we thought over time
we would be correct so strategically at

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679
we would be correct so strategically at
 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:08.870
we would be correct so strategically at
the time I think people thought we were

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880
the time I think people thought we were
 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.050
the time I think people thought we were
too early and it turned out that we were

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060
too early and it turned out that we were
 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.210
too early and it turned out that we were
right but I still think we were too

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220
right but I still think we were too
 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.750
right but I still think we were too
early here when we started 1999 we did

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760
early here when we started 1999 we did
 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.640
early here when we started 1999 we did
it right after the asian crisis and I

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650
it right after the asian crisis and I
 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.570
it right after the asian crisis and I
think people would have said you needed

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580
think people would have said you needed
 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.650
think people would have said you needed
to wait

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660
to wait
 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.650
to wait
I I think a lot of sort of strategic

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660
I I think a lot of sort of strategic
 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.690
I I think a lot of sort of strategic
decisions do you want to just focus on

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700
decisions do you want to just focus on
 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.440
decisions do you want to just focus on
the stress I think for us we made a big

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450
the stress I think for us we made a big
 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.030
the stress I think for us we made a big
decision that we thought things we're

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040
decision that we thought things we're
 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.440
decision that we thought things we're
going to get worse I think as we talked

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450
going to get worse I think as we talked
 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.100
going to get worse I think as we talked
earlier in 06 you know we were

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110
earlier in 06 you know we were
 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.600
earlier in 06 you know we were
ultimately right but we were too early

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610
ultimately right but we were too early
 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.420
ultimately right but we were too early
right so I think there's a lot of

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430
right so I think there's a lot of
 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.070
right so I think there's a lot of
fundamental things that people do the

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080
fundamental things that people do the
 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.260
fundamental things that people do the
question really ends up being do you

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270
question really ends up being do you
 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.790
question really ends up being do you
have the luxury of time to be right
