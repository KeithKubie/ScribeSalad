hi my name is Adrian Ludwig I'm on the
 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.019
hi my name is Adrian Ludwig I'm on the
Android security team here at Google and

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:05.029
Android security team here at Google and
 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.169
Android security team here at Google and
just this week we released our 2016 Year

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179
just this week we released our 2016 Year
 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.190
just this week we released our 2016 Year
in Review

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200
in Review
 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.169
in Review
and so I know that it's a long document

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179
and so I know that it's a long document
 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.940
and so I know that it's a long document
and a lot of folks won't have the

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950
and a lot of folks won't have the
 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.140
and a lot of folks won't have the
opportunity to go through the entire

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150
opportunity to go through the entire
 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.420
opportunity to go through the entire
thing so we wanted to put together a few

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430
thing so we wanted to put together a few
 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.400
thing so we wanted to put together a few
of the highlights talk through them and

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410
of the highlights talk through them and
 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.570
of the highlights talk through them and
give you a little bit of perspective on

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580
give you a little bit of perspective on
 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.670
give you a little bit of perspective on
what we've seen over the last year in

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680
what we've seen over the last year in
 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.269
what we've seen over the last year in
Android security so to begin with what's

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279
Android security so to begin with what's
 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.759
Android security so to begin with what's
incredible is the continued growth in

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769
incredible is the continued growth in
 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.070
incredible is the continued growth in
the Android ecosystem and along with the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080
the Android ecosystem and along with the
 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.510
the Android ecosystem and along with the
growth in the Android ecosystem our

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520
growth in the Android ecosystem our
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.389
growth in the Android ecosystem our
protections have grown as well in 2016

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399
protections have grown as well in 2016
 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.700
protections have grown as well in 2016
we grew to protect over 1.4 billion

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710
we grew to protect over 1.4 billion
 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.130
we grew to protect over 1.4 billion
devices out in the ecosystem across the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140
devices out in the ecosystem across the
 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.459
devices out in the ecosystem across the
entire globe we scan over 750 million

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469
entire globe we scan over 750 million
 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.100
entire globe we scan over 750 million
devices per day so an incredibly large

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110
devices per day so an incredibly large
 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.959
devices per day so an incredibly large
investment in checking what's going on

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969
investment in checking what's going on
 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.810
investment in checking what's going on
in the ecosystem and understanding both

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820
in the ecosystem and understanding both
 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.459
in the ecosystem and understanding both
the protections that we have in place

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469
the protections that we have in place
 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.290
the protections that we have in place
but also the risks that users are being

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300
but also the risks that users are being
 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.700
but also the risks that users are being
exposed to one of the most important

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710
exposed to one of the most important
 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.840
exposed to one of the most important
characteristics of the Android ecosystem

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850
characteristics of the Android ecosystem
 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.630
characteristics of the Android ecosystem
is how we've committed to being open and

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640
is how we've committed to being open and
 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.130
is how we've committed to being open and
from a security standpoint that's

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140
from a security standpoint that's
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.140
from a security standpoint that's
incredibly valuable it gives us the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150
incredibly valuable it gives us the
 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.179
incredibly valuable it gives us the
ability to tap into the collective

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189
ability to tap into the collective
 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.219
ability to tap into the collective
intelligence around the world that's

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
intelligence around the world that's
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.560
intelligence around the world that's
invested in protecting the Android

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
invested in protecting the Android
 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.750
invested in protecting the Android
ecosystem users devices and applications

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760
ecosystem users devices and applications
 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.910
ecosystem users devices and applications
so you don't have to rely just on Google

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
so you don't have to rely just on Google
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.210
so you don't have to rely just on Google
just on OMS are just on carriers you can

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220
just on OMS are just on carriers you can
 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.130
just on OMS are just on carriers you can
rely really on the entire world and its

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140
rely really on the entire world and its
 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.530
rely really on the entire world and its
commitment to protecting itself and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540
commitment to protecting itself and
 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.789
commitment to protecting itself and
that's something that's unique about the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799
that's something that's unique about the
 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.770
that's something that's unique about the
way we've designed our ecosystem is the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
way we've designed our ecosystem is the
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.090
way we've designed our ecosystem is the
ability to bring in that collective

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100
ability to bring in that collective
 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.160
ability to bring in that collective
intelligence to facilitate that

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
intelligence to facilitate that
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.260
intelligence to facilitate that
intelligence and make sure that the best

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270
intelligence and make sure that the best
 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.730
intelligence and make sure that the best
things are being done it's really

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740
things are being done it's really
 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.039
things are being done it's really
important that there be data that there

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049
important that there be data that there
 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.810
important that there be data that there
be transparency into what's happening in

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820
be transparency into what's happening in
 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.310
be transparency into what's happening in
the ecosystem the direction and the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320
the ecosystem the direction and the
 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.510
the ecosystem the direction and the
types of threats that users being

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520
types of threats that users being
 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.399
types of threats that users being
exposed to so this year in review report

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409
exposed to so this year in review report
 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.990
exposed to so this year in review report
is just one example of the type of

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000
is just one example of the type of
 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.490
is just one example of the type of
transparency that we're trying to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500
transparency that we're trying to
 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.690
transparency that we're trying to
provide and make sure it's pervasive

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700
provide and make sure it's pervasive
 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.420
provide and make sure it's pervasive
across the entire ecosystem openness

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430
across the entire ecosystem openness
 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.969
across the entire ecosystem openness
also means choice it means that you can

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979
also means choice it means that you can
 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.219
also means choice it means that you can
look at the data understand what's going

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
look at the data understand what's going
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.719
look at the data understand what's going
on in the ecosystem and make decisions

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729
on in the ecosystem and make decisions
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.730
on in the ecosystem and make decisions
about how you interact with your device

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
about how you interact with your device
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.370
about how you interact with your device
about what type of device you select

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380
about what type of device you select
 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.050
about what type of device you select
about where you install applications

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060
about where you install applications
 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.060
about where you install applications
from so all of this is designed to make

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070
from so all of this is designed to make
 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.560
from so all of this is designed to make
it possible for users to do the right

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570
it possible for users to do the right
 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.570
it possible for users to do the right
thing for themselves as they're

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580
thing for themselves as they're
 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.490
thing for themselves as they're
interacting with the rest of the world

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
interacting with the rest of the world
 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.530
interacting with the rest of the world
through the Android ecosystem

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540
 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.330
the reflection of that is the incredible

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340
the reflection of that is the incredible
 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.890
the reflection of that is the incredible
types of experiences that were being

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900
types of experiences that were being
 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.390
types of experiences that were being
built and these are experiences that

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400
built and these are experiences that
 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.699
built and these are experiences that
depend at their core on the security of

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360
made sure that users ended up in a safe
 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.320
made sure that users ended up in a safe
place so we're gonna walk through three

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330
place so we're gonna walk through three
 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.269
place so we're gonna walk through three
different primary areas the robust

00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:33.279
different primary areas the robust
 

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:36.240
different primary areas the robust
platform services and updates and talk

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250
platform services and updates and talk
 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.310
platform services and updates and talk
through the changes that happen in 2016

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320
through the changes that happen in 2016
 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.480
through the changes that happen in 2016
so here we go

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490
so here we go
 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.800
so here we go
let's take a look at the platform

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810
let's take a look at the platform
 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.600
let's take a look at the platform
at this point Android has delivered on

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610
at this point Android has delivered on
 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.030
at this point Android has delivered on
most of the major security capabilities

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040
most of the major security capabilities
 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.030
most of the major security capabilities
that are expected of any mobile platform

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.040
that are expected of any mobile platform
 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.520
that are expected of any mobile platform
we have strong integrity through

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530
we have strong integrity through
 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.260
we have strong integrity through
verified boot going up through the

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270
verified boot going up through the
 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.480
verified boot going up through the
entire stack it's tied to a hardware

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490
entire stack it's tied to a hardware
 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.310
entire stack it's tied to a hardware
root of trust encryption has been

00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.320
root of trust encryption has been
 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.960
root of trust encryption has been
enabled for two major releases and so

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:00.970
enabled for two major releases and so
 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.879
enabled for two major releases and so
we've begun to see substantial adoption

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:02.889
we've begun to see substantial adoption
 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:04.170
we've begun to see substantial adoption
of a krip ssin across the Android

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.180
of a krip ssin across the Android
 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.150
of a krip ssin across the Android
ecosystem so there are a number of

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160
ecosystem so there are a number of
 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.710
ecosystem so there are a number of
significant features that were delivered

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720
significant features that were delivered
 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.710
significant features that were delivered
in 2016 but one of the most important

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720
in 2016 but one of the most important
 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.420
in 2016 but one of the most important
characteristics of these features was

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:12.430
characteristics of these features was
 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.909
characteristics of these features was
not the technology itself but the rate

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:14.919
not the technology itself but the rate
 

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:16.830
not the technology itself but the rate
at which it was being picked up and the

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:16.840
at which it was being picked up and the
 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.480
at which it was being picked up and the
rate at which were able to deliver new

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490
rate at which were able to deliver new
 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.460
rate at which were able to deliver new
security technology into the platform so

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:20.470
security technology into the platform so
 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.470
security technology into the platform so
this is a graph that's included in the

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:22.480
this is a graph that's included in the
 

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.570
this is a graph that's included in the
report it talks about the fact that even

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:24.580
report it talks about the fact that even
 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.700
report it talks about the fact that even
though encryption of full disk

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:26.710
though encryption of full disk
 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.560
though encryption of full disk
encryption was enabled all the way

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:28.570
encryption was enabled all the way
 

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.360
encryption was enabled all the way
almost four or five years ago in the

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:30.370
almost four or five years ago in the
 

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.230
almost four or five years ago in the
Android platform prior to android 5.1

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240
Android platform prior to android 5.1
 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.450
Android platform prior to android 5.1
there was practically no adoption of it

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:36.460
there was practically no adoption of it
 

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.130
there was practically no adoption of it
it was there users just didn't turn it

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:38.140
it was there users just didn't turn it
 

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.480
it was there users just didn't turn it
on and so we saw adoption that was less

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:39.490
on and so we saw adoption that was less
 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.000
on and so we saw adoption that was less
than 1% it became required for new

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.010
than 1% it became required for new
 

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:43.890
than 1% it became required for new
devices with Android 6 oh and with

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:43.900
devices with Android 6 oh and with
 

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.420
devices with Android 6 oh and with
Android 7 oh we saw continued

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:45.430
Android 7 oh we saw continued
 

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.360
Android 7 oh we saw continued
acceleration so we went from 1% to 20 to

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:48.370
acceleration so we went from 1% to 20 to
 

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.040
acceleration so we went from 1% to 20 to
80% and we're expecting that that will

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:50.050
80% and we're expecting that that will
 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.110
80% and we're expecting that that will
continue to grow until we achieve over

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.120
continue to grow until we achieve over
 

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.030
continue to grow until we achieve over
the next couple of years nearly 100%

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:54.040
the next couple of years nearly 100%
 

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.469
the next couple of years nearly 100%
adoption of encryption across the

00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:55.479
adoption of encryption across the
 

00:07:55.479 --> 00:07:57.810
adoption of encryption across the
Android ecosystem so that I think is one

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:57.820
Android ecosystem so that I think is one
 

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.850
Android ecosystem so that I think is one
of the most important stories of 2016 in

00:07:59.850 --> 00:07:59.860
of the most important stories of 2016 in
 

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.520
of the most important stories of 2016 in
terms of features is recognizing that

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:02.530
terms of features is recognizing that
 

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.370
terms of features is recognizing that
these features are able to achieve

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:04.380
these features are able to achieve
 

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.290
these features are able to achieve
velocity and adoption very very quickly

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:07.300
velocity and adoption very very quickly
 

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.409
velocity and adoption very very quickly
which is really exciting here's another

00:08:10.409 --> 00:08:10.419
which is really exciting here's another
 

00:08:10.419 --> 00:08:12.750
which is really exciting here's another
feature this one there were changes in

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:12.760
feature this one there were changes in
 

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.360
feature this one there were changes in
how users interact with the feature but

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:15.370
how users interact with the feature but
 

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.700
how users interact with the feature but
not as substantial as one encryption so

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:17.710
not as substantial as one encryption so
 

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.529
not as substantial as one encryption so
we saw adoption of smart lock go up by

00:08:19.529 --> 00:08:19.539
we saw adoption of smart lock go up by
 

00:08:19.539 --> 00:08:22.440
we saw adoption of smart lock go up by
over 175 percent so the story here is

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:22.450
over 175 percent so the story here is
 

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:24.300
over 175 percent so the story here is
really understanding that the features

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:24.310
really understanding that the features
 

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.040
really understanding that the features
that are being released are being picked

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.050
that are being released are being picked
 

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:28.080
that are being released are being picked
up and being used very very quickly and

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:28.090
up and being used very very quickly and
 

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.880
up and being used very very quickly and
so when we look at the core platform

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:29.890
so when we look at the core platform
 

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.520
so when we look at the core platform
capabilities the fact that all of the

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:32.530
capabilities the fact that all of the
 

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.290
capabilities the fact that all of the
major features are in place and we're

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:34.300
major features are in place and we're
 

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.579
major features are in place and we're
now starting to enter a phase of

00:08:35.579 --> 00:08:35.589
now starting to enter a phase of
 

00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:37.170
now starting to enter a phase of
incrementalism in terms of the features

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:37.180
incrementalism in terms of the features
 

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.149
incrementalism in terms of the features
that are being introduced into Android I

00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:39.159
that are being introduced into Android I
 

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.350
that are being introduced into Android I
think we're actually in a really

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:40.360
think we're actually in a really
 

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.370
think we're actually in a really
exciting place for getting these

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:41.380
exciting place for getting these
 

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.690
exciting place for getting these
features out to as many users as

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:42.700
features out to as many users as
 

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.500
features out to as many users as
possible it also makes it possible for

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:46.510
possible it also makes it possible for
 

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:50.040
possible it also makes it possible for
us to focus on the details really invest

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.050
us to focus on the details really invest
 

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.990
us to focus on the details really invest
in individual security researchers

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000
in individual security researchers
 

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.420
in individual security researchers
expanding the number of people who are

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:54.430
expanding the number of people who are
 

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.220
expanding the number of people who are
finding issues and reporting on them so

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:56.230
finding issues and reporting on them so
 

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:57.150
finding issues and reporting on them so
one of the areas that we've been

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.160
one of the areas that we've been
 

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.579
one of the areas that we've been
investing a lot in 2016 is in our

investing a lot in 2016 is in our
 

00:08:59.589 --> 00:09:01.710
investing a lot in 2016 is in our
security rewards program the way this

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:01.720
security rewards program the way this
 

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.540
security rewards program the way this
program works is anybody in the world

can become a security researcher focused

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:05.560
can become a security researcher focused
 

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.290
can become a security researcher focused
on Android all they have to do is find

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:07.300
on Android all they have to do is find
 

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.990
on Android all they have to do is find
issues and report them to us one of the

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000
issues and report them to us one of the
 

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.910
issues and report them to us one of the
really fascinating characteristics that

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920
really fascinating characteristics that
 

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.220
really fascinating characteristics that
we've seen of the security rewards

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:14.230
we've seen of the security rewards
 

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.430
we've seen of the security rewards

finding and fixing security issues on
 

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.000
finding and fixing security issues on
the Android platform so that's where

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:48.010
the Android platform so that's where
 

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:49.290
the Android platform so that's where
we've been investing in the platform

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:49.300
we've been investing in the platform
 

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.240
we've been investing in the platform
itself the other area that we've been

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:51.250
itself the other area that we've been
 

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:52.949
itself the other area that we've been
investing is in comprehensive services

00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959
investing is in comprehensive services
 

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:54.990
investing is in comprehensive services
these are the services that we use to

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:55.000
these are the services that we use to
 

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.360
these are the services that we use to
help monitor the ecosystem and react in

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:57.370
help monitor the ecosystem and react in
 

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:59.430
help monitor the ecosystem and react in
near real-time to issues that might be

00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440
near real-time to issues that might be
 

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.500
near real-time to issues that might be
found so let's talk through some of

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:01.510
found so let's talk through some of
 

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:03.570
found so let's talk through some of
those capabilities as you may recall

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:03.580
those capabilities as you may recall
 

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.640
those capabilities as you may recall
from last year's Year in Review or if

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:05.650
from last year's Year in Review or if
 

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:06.900
from last year's Year in Review or if
you've been looking closely at what

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:06.910
you've been looking closely at what
 

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.490
you've been looking closely at what
we're doing in Android security there's

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:08.500
we're doing in Android security there's
 

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.630
we're doing in Android security there's
four different areas that we're

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:09.640
four different areas that we're
 

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.850
four different areas that we're
investing in services the first is

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:11.860
investing in services the first is
 

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.280
investing in services the first is
around analyzing applications I'll talk

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:14.290
around analyzing applications I'll talk
 

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:15.630
around analyzing applications I'll talk
more about that just a second we call

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.640
more about that just a second we call
 

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.120
more about that just a second we call
that verify apps the second is what we

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:18.130
that verify apps the second is what we
 

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:19.860
that verify apps the second is what we
refer to as the sensor network or

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:19.870
refer to as the sensor network or
 

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.510
refer to as the sensor network or
sometimes we talk about it as safety net

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:21.520
sometimes we talk about it as safety net
 

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.600
sometimes we talk about it as safety net
this is looking at non application based

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:24.610
this is looking at non application based
 

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:26.610
this is looking at non application based
signals on a device to try to find

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:26.620
signals on a device to try to find
 

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.410
signals on a device to try to find
potential security risks so we're

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:28.420
potential security risks so we're
 

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.390
potential security risks so we're
analyzing whether devices might be being

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:30.400
analyzing whether devices might be being
 

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.250
analyzing whether devices might be being
exploited in the browser whether they

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:32.260
exploited in the browser whether they
 

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.720
exploited in the browser whether they
might be running into network problems

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:33.730
might be running into network problems
 

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:35.940
might be running into network problems
or any other type of issue that has

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:35.950
or any other type of issue that has
 

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.090
or any other type of issue that has
security significance the third thing

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:39.100
security significance the third thing
 

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.069
security significance the third thing
that we invest in is protections for

00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:41.079
that we invest in is protections for
 

00:10:41.079 --> 00:10:44.370
that we invest in is protections for
lost or stolen devices it continues to

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:44.380
lost or stolen devices it continues to
 

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.019
lost or stolen devices it continues to
be the case that the largest threat that

00:10:46.019 --> 00:10:46.029
be the case that the largest threat that
 

00:10:46.029 --> 00:10:48.180
be the case that the largest threat that
most users face is a potential loss of

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:48.190
most users face is a potential loss of
 

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:49.829
most users face is a potential loss of
the device where not only is their data

00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:49.839
the device where not only is their data
 

00:10:49.839 --> 00:10:51.840
the device where not only is their data
exposed to risk but they also are

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:51.850
exposed to risk but they also are
 

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:53.610
exposed to risk but they also are
potentially losing the significant

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:53.620
potentially losing the significant
 

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.960
potentially losing the significant
financial investment that they've made

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:54.970
financial investment that they've made
 

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:56.699
financial investment that they've made
and what may be one of their most

00:10:56.699 --> 00:10:56.709
and what may be one of their most
 

00:10:56.709 --> 00:10:59.130
and what may be one of their most
important and valued possessions and so

00:10:59.130 --> 00:10:59.140
important and valued possessions and so
 

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.900
important and valued possessions and so
the Android device manager is designed

the Android device manager is designed
 

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.449
the Android device manager is designed
to help users lock or find a stolen or

00:11:03.449 --> 00:11:03.459
to help users lock or find a stolen or
 

00:11:03.459 --> 00:11:06.420
to help users lock or find a stolen or
lost device the fourth area that's a

Google has built these services made
them available to consumers but that

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:15.880
them available to consumers but that
 

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.310
them available to consumers but that
there are application developers that

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:17.320
there are application developers that
 

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.480
there are application developers that
might want to take advantage of them as

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:18.490
might want to take advantage of them as

well and so API is an area that we've

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:20.470
well and so API is an area that we've
 

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.980
well and so API is an area that we've
invested in significantly and the report

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:22.990
invested in significantly and the report
 

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.720
invested in significantly and the report
goes into a number of different examples

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:24.730
goes into a number of different examples
 

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.190
goes into a number of different examples
of the types of API so I'll talk about

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:26.200
of the types of API so I'll talk about
 

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.600
of the types of API so I'll talk about
just one today the application review

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:30.610
just one today the application review
 

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.300
just one today the application review
process continues to be one of the most

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:33.310

high-profile and significant services
 

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.400
high-profile and significant services
that we have available within Google

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:38.410
that we have available within Google
 

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.620

different functions the first function

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:42.670
different functions the first function
 

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.250
different functions the first function
is to make sure that any application

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:44.260
is to make sure that any application
 

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.660
is to make sure that any application
that gets uploaded to Google Play has

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:45.670
that gets uploaded to Google Play has
 

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:46.920
that gets uploaded to Google Play has
gone through a comprehensive security

Google Play so that's one function that

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:13.300
Google Play so that's one function that
 

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.360
Google Play so that's one function that
we play the other is to provide a

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:15.370
we play the other is to provide a
 

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:17.490
we play the other is to provide a
protection for applications being

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:17.500
protection for applications being
 

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.260
protection for applications being
installed outside of Google Play and

installed outside of Google Play and
 

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.210
installed outside of Google Play and
they go through exactly the same level

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:21.220
they go through exactly the same level
 

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.890
they go through exactly the same level
of scrutiny so very very detailed

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:22.900
of scrutiny so very very detailed
 

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.170
of scrutiny so very very detailed
scrutiny that in many cases can be fully

automated but in some cases ends up
going to a final manual human review so

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:29.830
going to a final manual human review so
 

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.740
going to a final manual human review so
we can categorize applications into one

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:31.750
we can categorize applications into one
 

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:34.230
we can categorize applications into one
of about 20 different categories of

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240
of about 20 different categories of
 

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.270
of about 20 different categories of
potentially harmful application or say

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:36.280
potentially harmful application or say
 

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.950
potentially harmful application or say
that it's safe and the user can go on

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:37.960
that it's safe and the user can go on
 

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.830
that it's safe and the user can go on
and install and go about their business

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:39.840
and install and go about their business
 

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.810

we constantly review these applications

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:42.820
we constantly review these applications
 

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:43.890
we constantly review these applications
to see if there's anything that's

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:43.900
to see if there's anything that's
 

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.450
to see if there's anything that's
changed if there's no data that's

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:45.460
changed if there's no data that's
 

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.790
changed if there's no data that's
available or even if maybe we made a

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:47.800
available or even if maybe we made a
 

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.350
available or even if maybe we made a
mistake in the past because these things

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360
mistake in the past because these things
 

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.580

happen when you're operating at the type
 

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:51.930
happen when you're operating at the type
of scale that we're operating at with

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:51.940
of scale that we're operating at with
 

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.880
of scale that we're operating at with
over 6 billion applications reviewed

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:53.890
over 6 billion applications reviewed
 

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:58.170
over 6 billion applications reviewed
every single day so we've got a little

00:16:37.199 --> 00:16:37.209
that I'm showing here right now that's
 

00:16:37.209 --> 00:16:39.299
that I'm showing here right now that's
described in more detail than in the

00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:39.309
described in more detail than in the

full annual report is simultaneously one

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:42.490
full annual report is simultaneously one
 

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.490
full annual report is simultaneously one
of the most boring and one of the most

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:44.500
of the most boring and one of the most
 

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.319
of the most boring and one of the most
exciting graphs and I think it's it's

00:16:46.319 --> 00:16:46.329
exciting graphs and I think it's it's
 

00:16:46.329 --> 00:16:49.559
exciting graphs and I think it's it's
boringness that is what's telling for

00:16:49.559 --> 00:16:49.569
boringness that is what's telling for
 

00:16:49.569 --> 00:16:52.259
boringness that is what's telling for
many years there's been a concern that

00:16:52.259 --> 00:16:52.269
many years there's been a concern that
 

00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:54.629
many years there's been a concern that
at any moment there could be an uptick

00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639
at any moment there could be an uptick
 

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.280
at any moment there could be an uptick
in that in the level of potentially

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:56.290
in that in the level of potentially
 

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.319
in that in the level of potentially
harmful applications that are installed

00:16:58.319 --> 00:16:58.329
harmful applications that are installed
 

00:16:58.329 --> 00:17:00.780
harmful applications that are installed
on Android devices so this graph goes

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:00.790
on Android devices so this graph goes
 

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.119
on Android devices so this graph goes
back almost three years at this point

00:17:03.119 --> 00:17:03.129
back almost three years at this point
 

00:17:03.129 --> 00:17:05.370

showing quarter by quarter how many

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:05.380
showing quarter by quarter how many
 

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:07.260
showing quarter by quarter how many
devices in the Android ecosystem had a

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:07.270
devices in the Android ecosystem had a
 

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:08.460
devices in the Android ecosystem had a
potentially harmful application

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:08.470
potentially harmful application
 

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.380
potentially harmful application
installed and what's interesting about

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:10.390
installed and what's interesting about
 

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.779
installed and what's interesting about
it is how flat it is it's how boring it

00:17:12.779 --> 00:17:12.789
it is how flat it is it's how boring it
 

00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:15.750
it is how flat it is it's how boring it
is and that speaks to the efforts that

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760
is and that speaks to the efforts that
 

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.299
is and that speaks to the efforts that
we've had in place to protect users on

00:17:18.299 --> 00:17:18.309
we've had in place to protect users on
 

00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:20.220
we've had in place to protect users on
an ongoing basis every time we see an

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:20.230
an ongoing basis every time we see an
 

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.649
an ongoing basis every time we see an
uptick in the line new protections are

00:17:22.649 --> 00:17:22.659
uptick in the line new protections are
 

00:17:22.659 --> 00:17:24.179
uptick in the line new protections are
introduced every time we see a downtick

00:17:24.179 --> 00:17:24.189
introduced every time we see a downtick
 

00:17:24.189 --> 00:17:26.130
introduced every time we see a downtick
new protections are introduced and so

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:26.140
new protections are introduced and so
 

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.329
new protections are introduced and so
we're able to keep it nice and stable

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:27.339
we're able to keep it nice and stable
 

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:28.889
we're able to keep it nice and stable
even though there's a very active

00:17:28.889 --> 00:17:28.899

that Android is facing
 

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.419
that Android is facing
and so really excited that this is

00:17:42.419 --> 00:17:42.429
and so really excited that this is

installed on them in 2016
 

00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.810
installed on them in 2016
we look both at the number of devices

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:54.820
we look both at the number of devices
 

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.100
we look both at the number of devices
that have a potentially harmful

that have a potentially harmful
 

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:58.169
that have a potentially harmful
application installed we also look at

00:17:58.169 --> 00:17:58.179
application installed we also look at
 

00:17:58.179 --> 00:18:00.240
application installed we also look at
the mechanism by which these

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:00.250
the mechanism by which these
 

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.010
the mechanism by which these
installations take place and so the

00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:02.020
installations take place and so the
 

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.289
installations take place and so the

more detail in the report provides an
 

00:18:06.429 --> 00:18:08.220
more detail in the report provides an
overview of different channels that

installing from outside of Google Play
 

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:14.310
installing from outside of Google Play
we did see a decrease in the the number

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320
we did see a decrease in the the number
 

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.200
we did see a decrease in the the number
the amount of risk that a user's exposed

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:16.210
the amount of risk that a user's exposed
 

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:19.770
the amount of risk that a user's exposed
to about 9% of installations from

harmful applications in 2015 and 2016
 

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.760
harmful applications in 2015 and 2016
we've cut that nearly in half to about

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:26.770
we've cut that nearly in half to about
 

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:30.630
we've cut that nearly in half to about
4.8% in the context of Google Play which

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640
4.8% in the context of Google Play which
 

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.820
4.8% in the context of Google Play which
is the lower line here we've also cut it

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:32.830
is the lower line here we've also cut it
 

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.890
is the lower line here we've also cut it
by about 50% but the baseline was a lot

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:34.900
by about 50% but the baseline was a lot
 

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.659
by about 50% but the baseline was a lot
lower which has gives us the ability to

00:18:36.659 --> 00:18:36.669
lower which has gives us the ability to
 

00:18:36.669 --> 00:18:38.610
lower which has gives us the ability to
make a statement that the risks of

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:38.620
make a statement that the risks of
 

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.409
make a statement that the risks of
installing from Google Play are about

00:18:40.409 --> 00:18:40.419
installing from Google Play are about
 

00:18:40.419 --> 00:18:43.200
installing from Google Play are about
1/10 the risk that a user is exposed to

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:43.210
1/10 the risk that a user is exposed to
 

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:44.340
1/10 the risk that a user is exposed to

if they're installing from outside of
 

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:45.750
if they're installing from outside of
Google Play we're going to continue

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760
Google Play we're going to continue
 

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.610
Google Play we're going to continue
investing in both of these areas to make

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:47.620
investing in both of these areas to make
 

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:48.840
investing in both of these areas to make
sure that we've have the best possible

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:48.850
sure that we've have the best possible
 

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.640
sure that we've have the best possible
protections in Google Play and the best

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:50.650
protections in Google Play and the best
 

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.140

allow for users to be safe in the face
 

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.150
allow for users to be safe in the face
of that kind of openness there's a lot

we've had over the last several years is
 

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.680
we've had over the last several years is
that just protecting from malware is not

sufficient that there are use cases at
 

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.259
sufficient that there are use cases at
an application level but also at a

we've seen is actually in the gaming
 

00:21:16.299 --> 00:21:19.110
we've seen is actually in the gaming
space where games which are in some

the Android ecosystem so I want to talk
 

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.450
the Android ecosystem so I want to talk
a little bit about what we've been doing

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:50.460
a little bit about what we've been doing
 

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.120
a little bit about what we've been doing
on terms of updating both devices at the

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:53.130
on terms of updating both devices at the
 

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:55.130
on terms of updating both devices at the
operating system level but also in terms

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.140
operating system level but also in terms
 

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.830
operating system level but also in terms
of updating applications and making it

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840
of updating applications and making it
 

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.110
of updating applications and making it
possible for developers to be responsive

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.120
possible for developers to be responsive
 

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.760
possible for developers to be responsive
to potential security risks in their

to potential security risks in their
 

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:05.330
to potential security risks in their
applications so to start let's talk

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.340
applications so to start let's talk
 

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.430
applications so to start let's talk
about devices it's been a really

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440
about devices it's been a really
 

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.430
about devices it's been a really
exciting year 2015 we introduced what

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:10.440
exciting year 2015 we introduced what
 

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.600
exciting year 2015 we introduced what
was called the security patch level

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:11.610
was called the security patch level
 

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:14.000
was called the security patch level
which made it possible to track how many

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.010
which made it possible to track how many
 

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:15.919
which made it possible to track how many
devices were being updated with security

00:23:15.919 --> 00:23:15.929
devices were being updated with security
 

00:23:15.929 --> 00:23:17.570
devices were being updated with security
updates in the past it simply wasn't

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:17.580
updates in the past it simply wasn't
 

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.280

possible the diversity of devices in the

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:19.290
possible the diversity of devices in the
 

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.830
possible the diversity of devices in the
ecosystem and the diversity of versions

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840
ecosystem and the diversity of versions
 

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.350
ecosystem and the diversity of versions
made it very challenging to do that and

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:24.360
made it very challenging to do that and
 

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.610
made it very challenging to do that and
there were actually security research

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:25.620
there were actually security research
 

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.200
there were actually security research
that was done by the University of

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:27.210
that was done by the University of
 

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:28.940
that was done by the University of
Cambridge and a few other places just to

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:28.950
Cambridge and a few other places just to
 

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.470
Cambridge and a few other places just to
understand how many devices were being

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480
understand how many devices were being
 

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.210
understand how many devices were being
updated so simply being able to

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.250
of Google Play and so here was a an area
where the protections in Google Play

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:52.260
where the protections in Google Play
 

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.880
where the protections in Google Play
were sufficient to prevent all but one

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:55.890
were sufficient to prevent all but one
 

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:57.710
were sufficient to prevent all but one

00:29:59.060 --> 00:29:59.070
humming bed family getting on to Google
 

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:00.770
humming bed family getting on to Google
Play and so most of the activity was

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:00.780
Play and so most of the activity was
 

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.620
Play and so most of the activity was
outside of Google Play the cleanup was

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:03.630
outside of Google Play the cleanup was
 

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:05.360
outside of Google Play the cleanup was
successful and at this point we're

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:05.370
successful and at this point we're
 

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:07.820
successful and at this point we're
seeing very few installations of humming

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:07.830
seeing very few installations of humming
 

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:11.570

potentially harmful applications what
 

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.690
potentially harmful applications what
we've seen consistently is early

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:17.700
we've seen consistently is early
 

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.330

headlines and media interest in them a
 

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:33.260
headlines and media interest in them a
little bit later in 2016 but that

little bit later in 2016 but that
 

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:35.090
little bit later in 2016 but that
ultimately soon after that we see those

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:35.100
ultimately soon after that we see those
 

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:36.920

that we see Android security going in

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:06.830
that we see Android security going in
 

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:09.190
that we see Android security going in
2016 and a precursor to where it'll be
