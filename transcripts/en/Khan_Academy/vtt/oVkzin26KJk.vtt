00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:02.270
Welcome back.

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.390
I will be eating turkey in a
little over an hour, and I

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.380
want to work up an appetite.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.280
So I will move forward and
continue with the SAT

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.690
problems. Today is Thanksgiving,
by the way.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.580
That's why I'm a little extra
excited about the turkey.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.210
Problem number 1.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.010
Oh, by the way, we're on
page 47, section 9, of

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.260
the-- what's it called?

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.210
The official SAT study guide.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.770
Problem number 1.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.850
There is the same number of boys
and girls on a school bus

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.360
when it departs from school.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.230
So at the beginning,
boys equals girls.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.210
I don't know if this is
going to be useful

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.990
for me to write that.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.390
At the first stop, 4 boys
get off the bus

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.390
and nobody gets on.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.570
So stop one, minus 4 boys.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.030
After the first stop, there
are twice as many girls as

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.580
boys on the bus.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:09.450
So now, girls is equal
to 2 times the boys.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.090
How many girls are
there on the bus?

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.090
So you could almost do
this by inspection.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.920
But what you could say is, well,
here the boys is equal

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.710
to the girls.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.080
Then we subtract 4
from the boys.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.360
So this b is actually
a different b.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.910
This is 2 times the new
one, b minus 4.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.160
Why does that make sense?

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.320
We start off with b boys.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.400
At the first stop, 4 get off.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.730
So now there are
b minus 4 boys.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.440
And at the end, it says that
there are twice as many girls

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.470
as there are boys now, and b
minus 4 are the number of boys

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.630
there are now.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.275
So now girls is equal to
2 times b minus 4.

00:01:50.275 --> 00:01:53.970
But we also know that girls is
equal to this initial b.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.610
So you say b is equal
to 2b minus 8.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.770
I just distributed the 2.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.070
And then if we subtract b from
both sides and add 8 to both

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.870
sides, you get 8
is equal to b.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.520
And you could have probably
thought about that.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.710
I mean, you didn't have to do
all this fancy algebra.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.720
You could have just said, well,
when 4 boys leave, I'm

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.610
left with half as many
boys, right?

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.290
Because before, I had just
as many girls as boys.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.230
Then 4 leave, and I
have half as many.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.680
Because now the number
of girls is doubled.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.830
So if I have some amount of
something and when 4 leave,

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.190
I'm left with half, then we
know we started with 8.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.010
So you could have just done
it without the algebra.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.560
But this is one way you
could make sure you

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.590
had the right answer.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.900
But it probably would've taken
you too long, so the best way

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.190
might have been just to
do it in your head.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.470
Problem number 2.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.800
And I will do it in magenta.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.260
Which of the following is the
graph of a linear function

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.000
with a negative slope and
a positive y-intercept?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.610
So I'm not even going to
look at their choices.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.160
It'll take me forever
to draw them.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.190
I'm just going to draw my own
graph that describes what

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.542
they're saying.

00:03:02.542 --> 00:03:03.540
soon.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.560
That's the x and y-axes.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.730
And so they say, graph
of a linear function.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.620
So linear function means it's
going to be a line.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.670
Negative slope.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.880
So negative slope means that it
goes from the top left to

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.830
the bottom right.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.970
Because we move to the right.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.040
Negative slope means that the
graph's going to move down.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.750
So it's going to be a negative
inclination.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.570
And a positive y-intercept, so
that means it intersects the

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.060
y-axis in the positive y area.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.330
So a suitable line would look
something like this.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.770
It would intersect here
and move down.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.020
So it would look like this.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.160
And if we look at the choices of
which ones do that, well, D

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.230
is the only one that looks
like what I just drew.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.920
So the choice is D.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.655
Problem number 3.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.690
Refer to the following price
list. So I guess for

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:01.570
problems 3 and 4.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.690
So let me draw the price list.
So number of donuts.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.600
I can never spell donuts.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.500
I always want to write
out dough.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.660
And then it says, total price.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.570
It says if I get 1 donut, it's
going to cost me $0.40.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.990
If I get 6 donuts, a box of 6,
it's going to cost me $1.89.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.020
And if I get 12 donuts, it's
going to cost me $3.59.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.330
And the question is-- question
number 3-- of the following,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.630
which is the closest
approximation of the cost per

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.620
donut when one purchases
a box of 6?

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.610
Well, a box of 6 costs $1.89.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.410
So it's literally $1.89
divided by 6. $1.89/6.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.510
And you can eyeball that.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.760
It's a little over $0.30.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.480
If it was $1.80, it
would be $0.30.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.800
And then you have to have
9 divided by 6.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.050
So it's like 31 and 1/3 cents.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.410
It's approximately $0.31.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.630
And if you look at it, they give
you very rough numbers.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.280
So it's choice B.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.840
And what they wanted you to
do is do this quickly.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.210
They don't want you to actually
divide the numbers.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.330
They want to say, well, $1.89
divided by 6 is roughly $0.30.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.580
You do that problem really,
really fast.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.620
Now, problem number 4, we use
the same price list. What

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.870
would be the least amount of
money needed to purchase

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.340
exactly 21 donuts?

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.840
Well, if we want to purchase 21
donuts, we want to get it

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.280
in kind of as big chunks
as possible.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.640
So let's see.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:44.340
If we got 12-- exactly
21 donuts.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.200
It could've been tricky.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.960
Maybe 24 donuts would've been
cheaper or something.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.910
But we want exactly 21.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.130
So we want to get one dozen of
this, because this is going to

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.450
be a little under $0.30
per donut, right?

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.710
Because $3.60 would be $0.30.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.180
And then we want to
get 1 of these.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.410
And then we want to
get-- let's see.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.186
6-- that would get us to 18.

00:06:04.186 --> 00:06:04.840
you

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.260
And then we want to
get 3 of these.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.930
Times 3.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:10.620
So let's see.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:22.220
It would be 3 times $0.40, which
is $1.20, plus $1.89,

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.060
plus $3.59.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.440
So 9 plus 9 is 18.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.780
1 plus 2 plus 8 is 11, 16.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.500
And then $6.68.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.500
And that is choice B.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.620
This is for problem number
4, not problem number 3.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.870
Let's move on.

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.190
And we'll switch colors.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.700
Number 5.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.805
I think I'm going to have
to do some drawing now.

00:06:54.805 --> 00:06:56.190
The figure above.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.970
Which of the following
is closest to h of 5?

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.800
Yeah, I'll have to
draw that one.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.320
So let me draw the
coordinate axes.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.880
That's my x-axis.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.130
This is my y-axis.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:10.830
Let's see.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:18.380
The graph does something
like this.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.560
Let me draw the markers.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:30.040
So this is 2, 4, 6, and so on.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:35.760
And this is 2, 4,
6, and so on.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.600
This is minus 2,
minus 4, so on.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.640
And the graph looks something
like this.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.620
So it's minus 6.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.190
Let me do a different color.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.275
So if we start at minus 6,
and then it crosses.

00:07:52.275 --> 00:07:57.350
It goes someplace like
there, roughly.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:01.190
Then it dips down to here.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.960
Dips down something like that.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:12.140
And then it does something--
I'm trying to be exact,

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.045
because this is actually all
dependent on the graph.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.850
It's going to be something
like that.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.080
And they want to know, after
I've drawn this graph, they

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:28.610
want to know, what is the
closest to h of 5?

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:30.890
Well, this is h of x.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:31.750
This is 5.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:37.929
So h of 5 is just going to
be this point right here.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:46.020
And if we go to the left, it
looks like right in between 2

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:46.880
and 4, right?

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.070
And what's right in
between 2 and 4?

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.040
Well, 3.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.580
And it looks even more like that
when you look at it on

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.020
the graph they drew.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.310
My graph, you could argue
it's close to 2.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.375
But when you look at the one in
the book, you can see that

00:08:58.375 --> 00:09:01.020
it's close to 3.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.280
And I have a minute
left, so I will do

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.830
that in the next video.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:07.080
