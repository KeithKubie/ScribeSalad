00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.689
Analogical reasoning allows us to look at new problems in terms of familiar

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:10.170
problems. It also allows us to transfer knowledge from familiar problems

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.240
to new problems. A hierarchy process of analogical reasoning is shown here.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.900
It consists of five major phases, retrieval, mapping, transfer,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.520
evaluation, and storage. We'll discuss all five stages, in detail.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.120
Let us compare for a moment, the process for an illogical reasoning in general,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.290
with a process for, case based reasoning, within domain and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.690
illogical reasoning that we discussed earlier. Notice that retrieval,

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.410
evaluation, and storage, are common between the two processes.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.130
In case based reasoning the target problem and this first case,

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.870
were from the same domain. They had the same kind of relationships, and

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.060
the same kind of objects. We simply had to adapt the source case to address

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.400
the target properly. An analogical reasoning in general, the target form and

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.990
the source case need not be from the same domain.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.240
When they are not from the same domain, we can't just take the source codes and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.650
adapt it. We first have to map the target problem with the source case that is,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.740
we need to address the correspondence problem. What in the target problem,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.540
corresponds to what in this source case as an example? The laser beam and

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.620
the target Duncker's radiation problem corresponds to the rebel army in

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.560
the source case. Once we have mapped the conceptual relationship in the target

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.810
problem to the conceptual relationships in the source case, then, we can try

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.250
to transfer some of the relationships in the source case to the target problem.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.449
We can first abstract those relationships and then transfer them to

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:40.072
the target problem. As an example, the Duncker's radiation problem we

00:01:40.072 --> 00:01:43.918
first did the alignment, that is, we just did the correspondence problem,

00:01:43.918 --> 00:01:47.251
what in the target [UNKNOWN] corresponds to what in the source case?

00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:52.349
Then we took the relationship, and abstructed it. The relationship in that

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:57.019
case was, take the resource and decompose it into several smaller resources, and

00:01:57.019 --> 00:02:01.535
send them to the goal at the same location. That particular relationship, that

00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:06.204
particular pattern, is what we abstracted and transferred to the target problem.

00:02:06.204 --> 00:02:09.812
Note that this is just one theory of analogical reasoning. In other theories,

00:02:09.812 --> 00:02:14.038
some of these boxes are configured differently. For example, in another theory,

00:02:14.038 --> 00:02:18.420
mapping is a part of retrieval. We do mapping in order to do retrieval.
