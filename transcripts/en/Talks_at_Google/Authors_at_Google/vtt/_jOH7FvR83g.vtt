&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Hi everyone. Has anyone
ever fumbled with using a semi-colon or question

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:12.589
mark? Struggled with whether it was more appropriate
to use 'who' or 'whom'? Further or farther?

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:20.210
Authors@Google is happy to welcome grammar
guru Mignon Fogarty. Mignon is the host of

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.920
'Grammar Girl' and founder of Quick and Dirty
Tips. 'Grammar Girl' shares quick and friendly

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:34.030
tips to improve your writing, including tips
on punctuation, style, business tips and more.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.270
Before 'Grammar Girl', Mignon has worked as
a magazine and technical writer. She has a

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:47.579
BA in English from the University of Washington
and an MS in Biology from Stanford University.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.420
With that said, let's welcome Mignon.
[applause]

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.690
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: Thank you, Nadine. [applause]
Thank you. Thank you so much for having me

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.839
here today. I, I used to live in the Bay Area
and it's, it's great to be back. Great to

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.969
be at Google. Google does not disappoint.
I'll tell you. Even your parking lot is cool.

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:09.229
[laughs]
[audience laughter]

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.180
So let's get started. We're running a little
late. So who am I? I am known on line as 'Grammar

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.180
Girl' and so far, I have three new books out.
They came out a week or two ago so now I have

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.100
six books about writing. The 'Hundred and
One Word' Series is new so '101 Misused Words

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.840
You'll Never Confuse Again'. And we'll talk
about some of those today. '101 Words Every

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.600
College Graduate Should Know'. We actually
won't talk about those today. My 'Ultimate

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.390
Writing Guide for Students' is the most comprehensive
book available from the Grammar Girl's stable

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.320
of books. And then my first book was a New
York Times Bestseller. 'The Grammar Devotional'

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.330
is my personal favorite and the poorest selling
of all my books. [laughs] It's like a tip

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.680
a day calendar in book form. I adore it. It's,
it's wonderful. It's not that popular. [laughs]

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.270
[audience laughter]
And then the first book I did is, actually

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.860
not even sure it counts. It's a one hour audio
book so is it a book? Is it not a book? I

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.099
don't know but the reason my first book was
a one hour audio book was because I actually,

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.980
whoops. I actually got my start podcasting.
So I was a science writer in the Bay Area

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.010
and I was producing a science podcast and
at the same time I was a technical writer

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.959
and editor and I found that the work I was
editing from people, people were making the

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.750
same mistakes over and over again. And I'd
fix them and sometimes they'd send them back

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.390
to me changed back to the wrong way. [audience
chuckles] And I was getting really frustrated

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.129
and I, and I was already podcasting and I
thought, 'Well, I could give people a five

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.060
minute quick tip podcast with writing tips.
Nobody wants a one hour long lesson about

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.319
grammar.' Of course you're all here today
so you prove me wrong. [laughs]

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.380
[audience laughter]
But at the time, I thought nobody wanted an

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.500
hour long lesson about grammar. So five minute,
fun friendly tips. Maybe, maybe someone will

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.459
listen. Maybe ten people I can help. And I
produced, since I was already doing the science

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.519
podcast, I had all the equipment. So I made
Grammar Girl and it was literally in a coffee

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.620
shop in Santa Cruz. Jotted ideas down on a
napkin and had the podcast up in three days.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.280
And it went to the iTunes Top 100 within three
or four weeks just based on word of mouth.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.220
And it's been there ever since. That was about
five years ago. I'm now almost up to 300 Grammar

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.130
Girl podcasts and because Grammar Girl was
so successful and I had been in Silicon Valley

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.150
working at Startups, I knew I was onto something.
So then I founded the Quick and Dirty Tips

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.230
Podcast Network which now has 14 or 15 shows.
You know we've got 'Money' and 'Public Speaking'

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.489
which I should listen to more [chuckles] and
'Productivity' and 'Investing' and all sorts

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.430
of topics. And I'm partnered with McMillan
Publishing, my publisher on the Quick and

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.610
Dirty Tips Network. So that's who I am. That's
maybe why you should care.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.930
And I'm so excited to be here because Google
is enormously helpful in my work and people

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.280
ask me questions about Google so in my e-mail
newsletter, I have covered 'Is Google a verb?

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.220
And if you use it as such, should you capitalize
it?' And people in the language world, I don't

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.500
know if you know, but in the linguistics world,
there's been a lot of blogging about Plus

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.520
One is a verb and everyone appreciated that
you put out a Style Guide telling us how to

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.870
format. [audience and feedback noise] +1'd.
+1'ing. It's actually a hot topic in the grammar

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.340
world right now.
So you give me wonderful fodder for my podcast

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:46.210
and my e-mail newsletter and then your tools
are so useful. I use Google Ngram which you

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.729
can search in Google Books to see the frequency
of word usage. And I don't remember which

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:57.729
of my books it's in but I wrote aboutñ excuse
me ñ schadenfreude and I used Google Ngram

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:04.580
to track the rise in the use of the word 'schadenfreude'
over time. It was amazing. It would have been

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.669
impossible before Google Ngram released. At
least for someone who isn't in academia would

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:16.979
have been impossible. And also there's something
people talk about. ìJohnny graduated college.î

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:23.250
That's the new way of saying someone graduated.
It's wrong. You should say, 'Johnny graduated

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.050
from college.' That's the current standard
American English way of saying it. But what

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:34.039
I didn't know, a hundred or so years ago,
you should have said, 'Johnny was graduated

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:40.170
from college'. So I was able to track the
evolution over time of how 'graduated' was

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.729
used as a verb, again using Google Ngram.
It's amazing.

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:48.979
And then finally, Google Books. Again, maybe
someone in academia would have had access

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:54.170
to this but I was able to see scans of the
original style guide that recommended the

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:59.099
serial comma and the original style guide
that had the rule against splitting infinitives.

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:05.380
And for a language geek like me[giggles],
that was so exciting to see the actual scans.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:11.790
So just big, big thank you. And I hope, I
hope today I can maybe give back a little

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.960
bit and maybe help you write better just out
of gratitude.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:23.639
So I want to convince you a little bit that
word choice, punctuation, and grammar matter.

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:29.169
Because every time I give a radio interview
or a talk, someone says, 'Why should I care?'

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:35.270
Someone in the back whose boss made them come
or something. See, you know what I mean. ëOkay.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.660
So the commas aren't in the right place. Maybe
I didn't capitalize everything properly. What

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:46.090
does it really matter?' There was a study
done that showed that if you look at identical

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.610
essays on history or economics, something
that isn't, the students weren't being graded

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:57.139
on their language and the researchers just
changed the mechanics, the punctuation and

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:02.020
the capitalization and things like that. The
students got lower grades on the essays even

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:07.720
though the ideas, the content was essentially
the same. So I think it's reasonable to expect

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.020
that in a business setting even if you have
the same ideas presented in almost exactly

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:18.520
the same way in your e-mail messages or your
annual reports or your web pages, that having

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:25.020
errors will affect how people perceive your
ideas. The value of what you're putting forth

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:33.319
on the paper. Now this was a small study but
in the UK, they found-- They surveyed hiring

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:39.599
managers and they found that, they said that
having a spelling or grammar error on a resume

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:45.629
or CV was worse than showing up late to an
interview and worse than swearing in an interview.

00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:50.410
[audience laughs lightly] I mean that blew
me away. You're all Google. Maybe you don't

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:57.119
need to worry about finding jobs. Maybe you
have a partner, a parent or a child who's

00:07:57.119 --> 00:08:02.330
out in the, out looking for a job and it's
really, really bad to have errors in your

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:08.539
resume and CV. In fact, what always amazes
me and amazes other people, sometimes I hire

00:08:08.539 --> 00:08:13.770
people for Quick and Dirty Tips, or an intern
or something and you'd think if you were applying

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:18.789
for a job with Grammar Girl [audience laughter],
you would make sure your resume doesn't have

00:08:18.789 --> 00:08:24.419
any errors. And I have seen some atrocious
cover letters, applying for a job with Grammar

00:08:24.419 --> 00:08:30.349
Girl. I mean it just seems so obvious to me
that you should get it right. Okay. Maybe

00:08:30.349 --> 00:08:35.570
it's not obvious. But I'll tell you, it is
important to [giggles] get your resumes and

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:39.970
your cover letters.
Okay. This is a bit more anecdotal. But I

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:43.290
have literally have had people come up to
me at book signings and say they broke up

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:48.540
with someone because they couldn't stand how
they used language. I'm sure it wasn't the

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.690
only problem in their relationship. But someone
said, 'You know, I just couldn't stand any

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:57.210
more that he said "irregardless". [audience
laughter] I mean, really. Someone said this.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:03.220
And even, even more important is if you're
on, using online dating sites. People send

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:10.760
me all the time ad entries from online dating
sites, descriptions with errors and in them,

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:15.060
'Can you believe this? This is so funny.'
They send them to me because the errors are

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:20.310
somehow funny. They're not just comma errors
or whatever. Some funny word that's wrong.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:27.440
And so that, that, it can, bad grammar can
keep you from love. If only you knew how to

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.970
capitalize properly, you could be as happy
as these people. [giggles] [audience laughter]

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:37.190
And finally, who's seen the movie 'Almost
Famous'. It's one of my favorites. A really

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:44.270
fun movie. This boy, he's supposed to be,
I don't know, somewhere between 14 and 16

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:48.710
and he gets an assignment with Rolling Stone
to cover a band and he goes on the road with

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:53.850
them and writes stories for the Rolling Stone.
It's a great movie. And sort of the underlying

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:59.320
theme is that they don't know how old he is
because he corresponded with them. Over the

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:03.010
phone, he used a fake voice and he sent writing
samples and they were good enough that they

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:07.740
didn't, it didn't occur to him, it didn't
occur to them that he was young. And I was

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:15.090
thinking, while I was watching the movie the
last time, it occurred to me my last intern,

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:21.540
I never talked to her on the phone. We interacted
exclusively by e-mail. And that's super common

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:26.580
these days. I mean how often are you interacting
with people and you have never met them. Maybe

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:31.650
you speak to them on the phone but a lot of
it is just back and forth by e-mail. And so

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:37.850
people are making their opinion about you,
their idea of you in their head, based entirely

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:44.990
on what you are writing. So I hope that I've
convinced you that good, good language skills

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:50.420
matter for life, work, and love.
Iím getting all excited here. [audience laughter]

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:57.690
I hate having so much adrenaline when I speak.
[audience laughter] So let's, so, today I'm

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:03.280
going to go over some of the big questions,
the errors that I see people making over and

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.290
over again that people ask me about and then
we'll have time for questions in the end.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:10.740
So the number one reason that people come
[laughter] [audience laughter], just the number

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.740
one reason people come to my website, I'm
embarrassed to tell you. I won't tell you

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:19.890
what percent of the traffic to my website
is 'affect' versus 'effect'. And it's also

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:24.680
the number one, usually the number one and
number two searched for terms in online dictionaries.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:29.540
So we're gonna spend more than a little, a
little bit significant time on 'affect' versus

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:33.560
'effect'.
So there are exceptions to this rule. [giggles]

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:39.390
And a few years ago I was on the Oprah Winfrey
Show and I talked about this and again I was

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:43.870
a little nervous and I forgot to say there
were exceptions. And I got a nasty e-mail.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:48.690
Someone wrote, 'Thank you for confusing the
whole world.' [audience laughter] So I'm always

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:53.720
really careful now to say there are exceptions.
But most people don't even know the basic

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:59.840
rule. So if you get this part right, you'll
be right like 85% of the time and that's probably

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:04.440
better than you're doing now. Some of you.
[audience chuckles] I'm sure some of you have

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:11.840
it down. But 'affect' is usually a verb and
'effect' is usually a noun. So Aardvark is

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:17.000
a character in my book. Aardvark and Squiggly
are buddies and they fish together and stuff.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:24.250
So I, I,the first memory trick I came up with
uses this sentence because it's all A's. So

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:30.810
Aardvark is our friend and it's all A's. ëThe
arrows affected Aardvark.í And 'affected'

00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:37.150
is a verb in that sentence. The arrows are
taking an action on Aardvark. They're affecting

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:44.270
him. And you can see that it's a verb by substituting
other verbs and they work in the sentence,

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:48.790
that's a little trick I often use. If I don't
know what kind of word to use, I'll substitute

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:54.420
similar words and see if it makes sense. So
the arrows affected aardvark. The arrows hit

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:59.730
Aardvark. They poked Aardvark. And they annoyed
Aardvark. Those are all verbs. So if you can

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:05.960
remember that sentence, you can compare it
to a sentence you're trying to write and see

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:11.860
if it's kinda like that sentence. And that's
one way to, to choose the right word and remember

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:16.570
that 'affected', the verb, starts with an
'A' because the arrows affected Aardvark.

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:24.480
Now a second memory trick that some people
seem to like better is 'affect' is for verbs

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:30.290
and verbs are actions. And both 'affect' and
'action' start with the letter A. And you

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:35.200
can see these kids, they're, they're affecting
the balls. They're taking action on the balls.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:42.300
They're making craziness happen to the balls.
So then 'effect' is the noun. And this is

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:49.300
the example sentence with all E's for the
noun. The effect was eye-popping. The effect,

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:54.780
the thing that happened to Aardvark, the noun,
was eye-popping. And you can see that is a

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:59.550
noun by substituting other nouns in the sentence.
So the blood was eye-popping. The holes were

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:04.760
eye-popping. And the sound, the sound Aardvark
made, was eye-popping. So those are example

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:12.380
sentences where one uses 'affect' the verb
and the other one uses 'effect' the noun.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:20.210
So another trick is that nouns can usually
take an article. So 'the effect was eye-popping'.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:26.310
'She loved the effect the light had on the
paintings.' And 'the lightning effects were

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:32.140
amazing.' So you can see, in the final one,
there's a word that comes between the article

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:36.190
and the noun. It's modifying 'effects'. It's
telling you what kind of effects they were.

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:42.120
But you can still put an article in front
of 'effect'. When, when what you want is the

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:47.370
noun, you can usually put an article in front
of it. It doesnít work at all with the verb.

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:53.101
So you can't say, 'The arrows the affected
Aardvark' [audience murmurs] 'He was the affected

00:14:53.101 --> 00:14:58.420
by the layoffs.' That doesn't make any sense.
It's not even remotely grammatical. So if

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:04.080
you can put an article like 'the' in front
of the word, then the one you want is 'effect'

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:10.740
with an E. And the way I remember it is that
'the' ends with E. And 'effect' starts with

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:15.510
E. So if you have those two E's that can butt
up against each other, then you want the word

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:21.000
that starts with the E. [pause]
And this is the memory trick that actually

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.780
works for me. It doesn't work for a lot of
people but I'll share it with you anyway.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:31.350
[laughs] To some people, some people do say,
'Oh that's my favorite one.' So, I remember

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:37.940
'affect ñ verb; effect ñ noun'. It's a mnemonic
ñ A-V-E-N. And you can make words with A-V-E-N.

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:43.410
So I always think of a raven because you can
spell raven 'R-A-V-E-N'. So if you can think

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:47.870
of that raven in your head and you try to
remember which is the verb and which is the

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:53.530
noun, then you have 'affect - verb; effect-noun'.
So just think of that black raven on the yellow

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:59.300
background and you'll have it forever.
So that was one of my early memory, early

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:04.380
tricks, one of my early tips, one of the first
things I covered. And then I realized, people

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:11.360
starting asking me about 'affective' versus
'effective'. Like it gets harder. So effective

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:16.480
is almost always the word you want. 'She's
a particularly effective leader.' 'We had

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:23.930
an effective meeting. And ëEffective immediately,
we'll have coffee at every meeting.' So really

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:30.100
almost the only time you want to use 'affective'
with an A is when you're talking about a disease.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:37.250
So, or something in psychology. So I grew
up in Seattle. So seasonal affective disorder,

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:44.290
little children with their, their chins on
window sills looking out at the rain. So seasonal

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:50.950
affective disorder is an example of when you
would use 'affective' with an A. But most

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:56.290
of the time, it's 'effective' with an E that
you want.

00:16:56.290 --> 00:17:01.190
So, so that's the end of the 'affect' versus
'effect' section. Hope I've given you some

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:07.449
memory tricks to remember. And then it sort
of leads into the next thing because 'impact',

00:17:07.449 --> 00:17:15.660
when people don't know whether to use 'affect',
they often use 'impact' and that bothers probably

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:21.880
20% of the population. Twenty, 80% of the
people have no idea about this but 20% of

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:27.180
the people, when you talk about 'impact' as
a verb, 'The weather impacted fourth quarter

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:33.130
sales', people like lose their minds. They
hate it. So it, 'impact' as a noun is okay.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:38.700
You can say 'The weather had an impact on
fourth quarter sales'. But as a verb, it's

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.810
better to avoid it. And now you know how to
use 'affect'. You can say 'The weather affected

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:48.370
fourth quarter sales.' You don't have to worry
about this. But when you say 'impact', the

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.870
sticklers, they think of 'impact' only means
to hit. So this in their mind is an impact;

00:17:51.870 --> 00:18:03.480
when they say, when you say, 'The weather
impacted Bob.' They think of like hitting

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:07.790
Bob. Or even worse. Oh I've had people call,
when I was doing radio interviews, and theyíll

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:13.610
say, 'I think of impacted teeth. Or even like
an impacted colon.' [audience laughter] You

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:17.880
do not want people thinking about that when
they're reading your writing. It's just better

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.240
to avoid it.
So that's that. Okay. And then, okay. Moving

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:27.010
on. Another common thing that you may or may
not know you do but that bothers a lot of

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:35.980
people is using 'they' or 'their' as a singular
pronoun. So, absolutely, the language is evolving.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:42.220
So that in 50 years, it won't be an issue.
You can use, people already use 'they' and

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.890
'their' as singular pronouns in speech all
the time. I bet even the sticklers and they

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:50.030
just don't even realize they're doing it.
But in print, it still bothers some people

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:58.810
so I tell people to avoid it. Last week, the
Philadelphia Tribune said my, my new book,

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:04.520
"'The Ultimate Writing Guide for Students'
is an essential book for every student regardless

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:10.800
of their age." And I posted this to Twitter
and Facebook and Google Plus and I knew within

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:16.110
20 minutes on every platform, I had a comment
with someone saying, 'Shouldn't it have been

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:24.410
"his or her age"?' So I knew it was gonna
happen. So you know every, the problem is

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:32.070
that 'every student' is a singular noun and
'their' is a plural pronoun. It's easy to

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:39.630
fix. The sticklers would say, 'If you just
wanna make a quick, somewhat awkward fix,

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:45.990
you could say "essential book for every student
regardless of his or her age". Singular, kinda

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:50.671
awkward. If you're doing formal, ñI used
to do science writing, so I would use 'his

00:19:50.671 --> 00:19:56.480
or her' because it was sort of a technical
formal type of writing. But, so it's not distracting

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.910
in that context but it probably would be for
most of the things you do.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:06.660
So usually it's really easy to rewrite, to
fix this problem. You could say, 'It's an

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:12.220
essential book for all students'. Make your
noun plural. 'Regardless of their age', then

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:17.650
it works. But sometimes it's hard. And actually
I could not think of a way to make the next

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:23.600
sentence plural. Maybe we could brainstorm
a little bit here. So 'Tell the next caller

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:31.151
that he or she is the hundredth caller and
he or she wins a car.' So we have a person

00:20:31.151 --> 00:20:38.380
of unknown sex and we need to tell someone
to tell them something. But 'them' is plural.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:44.850
You can't use 'them', technically, and I could
not, I sat and stared at the screen for, I

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:50.240
don't know, five, ten minutes trying to think
of a way to make this, to fix this sentence

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:57.530
and I couldn't. Sometimes, sometimes it's
hard. [laughs] Does anyone here, does something

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.670
jump to mind? Does anyone see how to make
it plural or fix it?

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:06.350
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: She.
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: She, you could. One of my

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:12.180
listeners called that 'whiplash grammar'.
So you could say, 'Tell the next caller that

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:15.930
he is the hundredth caller and she wins a
car.' [laughs] [audience laughter] So sometimes

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:20.950
people will do that. They'll, they'll switch
back and forth between 'he' and 'she' to try

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:26.340
to be gender-balanced and yet still use the
singular pronoun and that is kind of confusing

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:31.660
because you start to wonder, 'Are they talking
about a different person?' [laughs] And all

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:35.530
the, all the style, actually I should address,
that all the current style guides say that

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:39.990
just using 'he' is no longer acceptable. It's
considered sexist language and you shouldn't

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:43.420
use 'he' generically. Yeah?
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: What about 'they'?

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:49.030
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: 'They'. You could. Embrace
the plural be on the leading edge. I mean

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:54.770
that's probably what I would do. Yeah?
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: [inaudible]

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:59.440
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: You could definitely drop
the second 'he' or 'she'. 'Tell the next caller

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:05.840
that he or she wins , is the hundredth caller
and wins a car.' So it's not so bad because

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:10.220
you get rid of the second awkward 'he or she'
so that would be better too. Yeah.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:15.860
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: 'Tell the next caller that

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:22.020
the caller is the hundredth caller.' [laughs]
[audience laughter] 'Tell the, tell the next

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.390
person'
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: [inaudible]

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:28.060
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: 'that ñ' Yeah. I mean I
cannot think of another way to do this without

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:32.451
'they' and that is probably what I would do.
I would embrace the 'they' and

00:22:32.451 --> 00:22:39.300
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #5: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: S-SLASH-HE. S-she. And they

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:44.210
all, I mean it's a problem. English doesn't
have a pronoun that does this. It's a, it's

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:49.280
a gap in our language and that's why I think
that 'they' will fill that gap. It's an obvious

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:55.230
need that our language needs. People are already
doing it in speech. It's gonna happen whether

00:22:55.230 --> 00:23:00.130
people like it or not. But you should be aware
that you should avoid it whenever you can

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:03.160
because it does really bother people, some
people. Yeah?

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.670
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: So "they" is
OK?

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.800
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: [giggling] 'They' is okay
if you're willing to take a little bit of

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:16.030
heat. So [audience laughter] and I tell people,
I say, 'Be bold. Use "they". Fight for advancement

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:21.020
of our language.' But you have to know that
you will take criticism. I mean like I said,

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:27.620
I posted, obviously my followers are bigger
sticklers than most people. But I posted this

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:33.350
to my profiles and it, it had been commented
on in every single place within 20 minutes.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:37.940
Someone said, 'They can't use "their". It's
a singular with a plural.' So people, there

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:42.630
are a lot of people out there who notice.
So it's a, I think it's okay to use it but

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:48.500
just know that you should avoid it whenever
you can and when you do use it, it'll, it'll

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:53.510
cause some people to cringe. Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: [inaudible]

00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:58.030
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: Um hmm.
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #6: [inaudible]

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:03.890
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: [laughs] [audience laughs]
It's true. No, you're right. Some people,

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:08.700
in, in sort of trying to swing the pendulum
the other way from 'It was he' for so long

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:13.100
for the last hundred years. Now they'll use
'she' all the time except when it's negative

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.910
and then they'll think, "Well, I shouldnít
say negative things about a woman so I'll

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:21.130
say 'she' or 'he'". Actually, I find myself
doing that sometimes [chuckles] and if you're

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:26.700
going to use a singular pronoun like 'he'
or 'she', I do think it's a good idea to sort

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:30.670
of try to be democratic about it and switch
back and forth and not always use one or always

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:36.370
use the other. It's funny. You find yourself,
you're writing about something that's been

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:41.260
traditionally male, like a doctor. There's
the classic distinction is, the doctor/nurse.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:46.470
A man/woman. And every time if I'm writing
about a doctor now and I need to use the singular

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:50.950
pronoun, I'll use 'she' just because it's
sort of the opposite of what has been traditional.

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:56.490
It is a challenge. And another reason I think
'they' is eventually gonna win. It's just

00:24:56.490 --> 00:25:09.600
so much less loaded. So ,oh, what? [pause]
That's not supposed to be there. Okay. We're

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:18.110
gonna wing it. So next, we're going to talk
about apostrophes and [pause], can I get to

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:25.365
this? Where is it? I have a movie for you.
Okay. This is one of my, a clip from one of

00:25:25.365 --> 00:25:26.780
my favorite videos at YouTube.
[video]

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.500
[rap music]
&gt;&gt;Women on video: We like proper English and

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.300
we cannot lie. And YouTubers canít deny.
But illiterate kids hittiní on your hits

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.900
with ignorant, crass replies. Youíre ashamed
of your fellow man ëcause they really donít

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.510
understand. Thereís principles of writing.
ëCause their insults are unexciting. Oh,

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:43.059
baby. You YouTubers haters and slammers.
Just listen to one last thing while we still

00:25:43.059 --> 00:25:45.420
have your attention. We got one more thing
to mention.

00:25:45.420 --> 00:25:52.890
Sometimes ' your' is possessive but other
times it means you are. Put apostrophes when

00:25:52.890 --> 00:26:00.630
you need 'em and otherwise just delete 'em.
So haters, if youíre too confused of which

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:06.920
form of ëtheirí to use, go to Sista Sally's
YouTube page and learn some ways to make your

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.680
comments less whack.
[music]

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:15.330
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: So it's seems so simple.
It's your, their with the apostrophes. And

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:20.460
it's true. When you go to YouTube and you
see the comments, it's always the wrong 'its'

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:26.920
and the wrong 'you're' and 'we're' instead
of 'we areí and ëwere'. So what's the deal?

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:37.420
Why can't, why can't people get this? Let's
see if we can go back. Oh no. [pause] Ahh.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:44.670
Okay. So, and I will say I am completely guilty
of this too. It's a typo. I have to believe

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:51.380
that most people know the difference between
'you're' ñ Y-O-U- apostrophe R-E and Y-O-U-R.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:56.420
But you know we think nouns, possessive 's',
you think possessive apostrophe and when you're

00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:01.700
typing fast, it's easy to get the wrong one.
And so embarrassing. I know the difference

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:07.070
but in last week's Grammar Girl transcript,
there was an I-T apostrophe S where there

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:12.559
should not have been an apostrophe. And a
'YOUR', a Y-O-U-R when there should have been

00:27:12.559 --> 00:27:18.400
a Y-O-U-R-E. These are, I commonly make these
as typos and my editor didn't have time to

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:24.160
edit my script last week. So Grammar Girl
went out with 'it's' and 'your' errors, typos.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:32.000
So I'm not saying [pause] I can't say you're
stupid if you get it wrong; that would be

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.370
saying that Iím stupid. But it's a, itís
a common typo and it's something to watch

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:39.620
for in your writing because it's so easy to
make because you have that association in

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:45.240
your mind of apostrophes with possessives.
So one way that I've been thinking about it

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:53.240
that sort of helps me get it right most of
the time is that I noticed that we use APOSTROPHE-S

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:58.920
to make nouns possessive. But we don't to
make pronouns possessive. I think a lot of

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:05.330
people don't realize that the, that none of
the pronouns use an APOSTROPHE-S to become

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:13.590
possessive. So his, her, their, its and your
ñ those are all possessive pronouns and the

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:20.220
problem is the ones ñ part of the problem
is the ones that end with 's'. So 'its' is

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:24.470
the possessive form of it. Even though if
you were writing about the chair which is

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:32.130
an it, you would use an APOSTROPHE-S. Only
nouns take an APOSTROPHE-S to become possessive.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:37.280
And there's actually, oh, gosh, my slides
are out of order so I don't know what's next.

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:46.460
Okay. So, but one thing I did want to tell
you about apostrophes and possessives is that

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:52.950
your Spell Checker will mess you up. So children,
it does every time. So children is plural

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:57.429
and to make children possessive, you need
an APOSTROPHE-S. The 'Children's Store', the

00:28:57.429 --> 00:29:02.170
'Children's books'. It's an APOSTROPHE-S.
But every single time, spell checker will

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:07.860
mark it wrong. The same with 'men's' and 'women's'
ñ like 'men's clothes', 'women's hats'. It'll,

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:11.240
it takes an APOSTROPHE-S and your Spell Checker
will mark it wrong. So there's just something

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:14.790
to know and it's so funny and people will
write to me and they'll say, 'Well, I'm pretty

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:20.030
sure this is right but Spell Checker keeps
telling me that I'm wrong' and they keep questioning

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:27.380
themselves. Spell Checker is wrong a lot.
So just view it as something that highlights

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:31.870
things you should look at. It's not God. It's
not always right. I'm amazed how many people

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:38.260
will just accept what Spell Checker tells
them. [laughs] It's very dangerous.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:48.220
So. Boy. Okay. Serial comma. Who knows what
the serial comma is? Everyone? No. Good. Not

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:55.441
everyone. Good. [laughs] So the serial comma
is this comma before the final ëandí in

00:29:55.441 --> 00:30:01.951
a list. 'The lions COMMA tigers COMMA and
bears'. Oh my. Itís that comma before the

00:30:01.951 --> 00:30:07.321
'and'. Itís called the 'serial comma' because
you use it in a serial, a series like this.

00:30:07.321 --> 00:30:12.330
And it's also called the 'Oxford comma' because
it's used by the Oxford University Press which

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:16.140
is one of the biggest presses in the world.
And there was a big kerfuffle a couple weeks

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:21.880
ago. I don't know if anyone heard about it.
But there, so, someone on Twitter, an anonymous

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:26.640
Tweeter called 'Rantee Editor' was at the
Oxford University website and found a style

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:33.120
guide that said not to use the Oxford comma.
On the Oxford University Press Website. And

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:39.020
it, it was hard to tell from the page. It
looked as if it were a university-wide style

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:45.550
sheet. But it was actually for the PR department
when you downloaded the whole .PDF, it was

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:51.350
clear it was just for one department and the
press often use, the press, I should back

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:57.090
up. The serial comma is a style. So a lot
of people will learn either you always use

00:30:57.090 --> 00:31:00.809
it or you never use it and they think that
everyone else is wrong. But it's actually

00:31:00.809 --> 00:31:07.140
a style choice. So book publishers like Oxford
University Press and the Chicago Manual of

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:11.380
Style, they use the serial comma. But the
Associated Press doesn't. They say to leave

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:15.950
it out unless it causes confusion. So that's
why you'll see it done both ways. So the other

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:20.160
people who do it the way you donít do it
are not wrong. It's just a style choice.

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:25.250
So because it was the Oxford University Press
website and they write for newspapers and

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:30.220
newspapers tend not to use the serial comma
and that was why they had the advice not to

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:34.690
use the serial comma. But everyone freaked
out because if Oxford University didn't use

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:40.350
the Oxford comma anymore, that would be sacrilege.
And they quickly issued a statement and it

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:44.960
was fun, excitement in the grammar world,
kind of like +1'ing [giggles]. [audience laughter]

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:50.809
So, so here's an example, so people will say,
'Well, when would it ever be confusing to

00:31:50.809 --> 00:31:58.170
not have the serial comma?' So this is a hypothetical
book dedication: 'To my parents, the Pope,

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:03.320
and Jackie Kennedy.' Now that's really clear
with the commas but if you leave out that

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:08.990
second comma, you get 'To my parents, the
Pope and Jackie Kennedy.' [laughs] [audience

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:15.750
laughter] So it's a made up example but there
are instances where you need a serial comma

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:20.920
to avoid confusion and often it's when the
last things in your list could be paired in

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:25.200
some way.
We'll talk about ëlessí and ëfewerí. This

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:30.590
is a commonly, commonly confused words. So
this is Aardvark again. As I said, he likes

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:37.860
to fish. 'Less' is for things that can't be
counted. And 'fewer' is for things that can

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:45.240
be counted. So water can't be counted. I mean
a glass of water you could say 'We have fewer

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:51.890
glasses of water than we did last week.' [pause]
But water itself in a lake can't be counted

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:58.770
so that you'd say 'we have less water in the
lake'. So things that can't be counted use

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:09.710
'less'. So 'less water'. Things that can be
counted use 'fewer'. So 'I should eat fewer

00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:17.170
M &amp; M's.' 'I should leave fewer books on my
desk.' 'I should have brought fewer slides.'

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:22.350
[laughs] [audience laughter] So that, that's
the difference between 'less' and 'fewer'.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:28.679
And this was funny. I went to the Penn and
Teller show in Las Vegas last year. And Penn

00:33:28.679 --> 00:33:34.130
was very proud of his sign. It's a little
hard to read. But one of their posters is

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:39.730
'fewer audience injuries than last year'.
And I guess the marketing people had originally

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:43.841
written it as 'less audience injuries than
last year' and he made them change it to be

00:33:43.841 --> 00:33:47.549
grammatically correct. [audience laughter]
And so we took our picture together with the

00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:53.480
thumbs up on 'fewer audience injuries' because
the audience injuries are countable. [pause]

00:33:53.480 --> 00:34:01.230
Another thing I see people having trouble
with, especially in business, you see this

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:11.310
all the time in business, is improper capitalization.
So capitalizing the name of your award or,

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:15.460
I don't know if an award would be capitalized.
Your tacos aren't crunchier if you capitalize

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:20.670
the word 'taco'. So you capitalize things
that are proper nouns. You capitalize something

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:25.750
because it's the name of something. It's interesting.
A long time ago in English, all the nouns

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:30.350
used to be capitalized. If you look at the
Constitution, all the nouns are capitalized.

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:36.080
It was trendy back when our nation was founded.
But somewhere along the way, and I haven't

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.490
figured out why yet. I've been searching Google
Books actually trying to figure out the story

00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:45.050
historically. But somewhere along the way,
English changed so that we only capitalize

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:51.659
proper nouns. We only capitalize nouns that
are the name of something. So you capitalize

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:58.619
the name of historic documents like the Constitution
and the Magna Carta because those are documents

00:34:58.619 --> 00:35:02.870
that have a name. And you capitalize the names
of bills and acts like the Social Security

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:09.480
Act and the Patriot Act. You capitalize the
name of a department when it's the formal

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:18.070
name of a department. But you don't, excuse
me, you don't say, um, you don't say 'I took

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:24.270
a chemistry class Friday.' You don't capitalize
'chemistry' because it's not the name of anything.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:32.790
It's just a description of a, a topic. You
capitalize the name of a bridge. You capitalize

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:37.510
Golden Gate Bridge when you're referring to
it but you don't capitalize bridge just when

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:41.310
you use it in a sentence. You say, 'we went
across the bridge'. 'Bridge' is lower case.

00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:46.640
But if you say, 'We went across the Golden
Gate Bridge', 'Golden Gate Bridge' is capitalized.

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:52.119
That's a really common, marketing people in
particular just love to capitalize things.

00:35:52.119 --> 00:35:58.320
They think it makes it look more important
and it doesn't. It's just wrong. So [laughs].

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:05.080
Hmm. [pause]
Oh here's my run-on sentence slide. So who

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:11.010
thinks a run-on sentence is just a really
long sentence? No one will admit to it. I

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.970
know some of you think that ëcause a lot
of people think a run-on sentence is just

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:20.930
a really long sentence. But a run-on sentence
is actually when you join two main clauses

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:26.500
without proper punctuation. And they can be
hard to read. So, they can be short. They

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:32.450
can be really short. So you say, 'I like pizza
Joe went to Domino's.' 'Squiggly cried Aardvark

00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:38.020
yelled.' 'Beth went to a yoga class Ben came
along.' So these are all run-on sentences

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:45.230
even though they're really quite short. What
they need is, what they need is a something

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:50.530
to separate the two main clauses. So the one
I can reach [laughs] [audience laughter] 'Beth

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:56.760
went to a yoga class Ben came along' you could
put a period there. You could make it two

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:01.840
sentences. You could put a semi-colon. That's
what semi-colons do. A lot of people don't

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:07.830
like semi-colons anymore and I have no idea
why. But they're very useful. You use them

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:14.270
to join two main clauses when the main clauses
are conceptually related to each other, when

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:19.030
they have something to do with each other.
Ben coming along definitely has to do with

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:23.570
Beth going to yoga class. They're very related
ideas. So it would be completely valid to

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:29.109
use a semi-colon right here to fix that run-on
sentence. You can also use a comma with a

00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:35.859
conjunction. You could say, 'Beth went to
a yoga class COMMA and Ben came along.' So

00:37:35.859 --> 00:37:41.170
there are lots of ways to fix run-on sentences
but you don't want to leave them like this

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:45.420
because, I don't know if you can tell as you're
reading it but your brain just kind of wants

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:49.090
to pause somewhere. It's like it's leading
you down the wrong path and you think something's

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:54.500
missing when you get to the end. You don't
know why. They're kind of hard to read. And

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:58.800
here's an example. And you can fix them. You
can fix them all with semi-colons and I love

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:05.090
the semi-colon so I probably would.
And there's the semi-colon completely out

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:13.310
of order. [pause] There's another, where is
it? Oh here we go. This is the thing I think

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:19.940
we're running out of time but I wanna finish
with quotation marks because this is another

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:28.550
really common question and there's a reason
you are confused. So when you have a quotation.

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:32.820
People often don't know whether to put the
comma or period inside the closing quotation

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:37.641
mark. And the reason you don't know is because
they do it differently in British English.

00:38:37.641 --> 00:38:44.390
And I was looking for examples. I pulled up
the BBC website a couple of days ago while

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:48.850
I was putting together the final slides. And
I, literally I could not figure out what rules

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:52.530
they were following in British English [giggling].
Sometimes they were inside. Sometimes they

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:56.070
were outside. And sometimes it didn't seem
the same to me. I couldn't tell what they

00:38:56.070 --> 00:39:01.951
were doing. But in Britain, they follow, they
call it 'logical punctuation'. I could not

00:39:01.951 --> 00:39:07.980
determine the logic. But they call it, they
use 'logical', logical quotation marks, logical

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:13.100
punctuation, something like that. So sometimes
they're inside and sometimes they're outside

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:19.370
the closing quotation. In the United States,
the period and the comma always go inside

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:25.609
the closing quotation mark. It's called, it's
actually called, I think it's called 'printer's,

00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:32.160
printer's typography' or something like that.
It has to do with in the early printing process,

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:37.130
the period and the comma would get broken
if they were outside the quotation mark. It

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:46.530
was an artifact of printing when they used
real printing presses and little letters.

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:55.310
So this is a US-centric memory trick. So inside
the US, inside the quotation mark. [laugh]

00:39:55.310 --> 00:40:01.340
It's easy to remember. Inside; inside. And
it's different, so that's periods and quotation

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:09.240
marks. And it's different for question marks
and exclamation points. So I don't have a

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:16.580
slide but, the question mark, if the thing
inside quotations is the only question, then

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:22.080
the question mark goes inside that closing
quotation mark. If your whole sentence, including

00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:28.119
the quotation, the whole thing, if that's
a question, then you put the question outside

00:40:28.119 --> 00:40:33.330
the closing quotation mark. So you can think
of it as the question mark stays with whatever

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:38.210
part is the question. And it's the same for
exclamation points. It doesn't come up as

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:41.480
often but the periods and the commas always,
always go inside.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:47.710
And then, we'll do one more just for fun before
we take questions. So this is one of my favorites.

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:52.660
And another one of my favorite websites is
'The Blog of Unnecessary Quotation Marks'.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:56.520
Bethany is the author, I forget her last name
but she's great and she has a book out too.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:41:02.910
And the whole website is devoted to signs
and photos of people that put words in quotation

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:07.750
marks that shouldn't be. And when you put
a word in quotation, so you can put, I put

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:12.099
words in quotation marks all the time because
when you're talking about a word as a word,

00:41:12.099 --> 00:41:17.851
so I'll say, when you're using a word ëwhichí,
it's okay to drop the next clause or something

00:41:17.851 --> 00:41:21.700
like that, you put 'which' in quotation marks
or you can italicize or bold it. But you need

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:26.431
to highlight a word some way when you're using
it not for its meaning. But the more common

00:41:26.431 --> 00:41:31.440
way to use quotation marks around a word is
to, they're called 'sneer quotes', 'sneer

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:37.940
quotes', or 'scare quotes'. And it means that
you don't mean the thing that's in quotation

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:42.680
marks. Now one of my favorites is a, is a
truck, it says something like 'Bob's ìMeatî'

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:50.590
[audience laughter] and you wonder like what
is Bob actually selling out of that truck.

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:57.491
This one just says 'Fully furnished ìshort
termî lease' and her little funny comment

00:41:57.491 --> 00:42:01.930
is 'you can never leave'. [laughs] [audience
laughter] And once you start noticing this,

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:06.330
you'll see it everywhere. People who make
signs love to put things in quotation marks.

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:07.970
Yeah?
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #7: Do you have any

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:10.920
idea how that practice started?
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: I don't know how it started.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:16.460
I do know, at one of my book signings, two
ladies came up who worked at a sign shop and

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:20.690
they were so apologetic. They said, 'We try
to tell people.' [audience laughter] 'We try

00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:27.750
to make them stop. But they're our customers
and we have to do what they want. [giggles]

00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:31.230
But we try.' [laughs] They felt so bad. So
that's another, another really common error.

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:35.230
I bet, I bet if you go around Google and you
go into your kitchens and your bathrooms and

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:39.700
anywhere people post handwritten signs, you
will find signs that have things in quotation

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:44.461
marks somehow for emphasis or as if they were
underlined. But don't use quotation marks

00:42:44.461 --> 00:42:49.250
in that way because it's funny and a picture
of it might show up on Bethany's blog. So,

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:54.400
those are the main things.
Oh I did want to mention. Oh. Okay. So how

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:58.300
do you settle disputes? This is important
because people spend hours arguing about these

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.960
language issues and that's why I appreciate
it so much that you put out the Style Guide

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:06.950
for +1'ing and +1 because it keeps people
from arguing. And that's how you keep from

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:10.930
arguing. You have a style, you have a house
style guide. If you're working in a group,

00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:15.410
you decide among yourselves what style you're
gonna follow, what you're gonna do when these

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:20.530
issues come up. So I, I, I would be surprised
if you didn't have an internal style guide

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:25.880
or a recommended style guide for Google. But
if you don't, pick one in your group and decide

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:31.690
what you're gonna follow. And then I wanted
to say a lot of the pictures I used were Creative

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:37.109
Commons, images from Flickr and they're, these
are where you can find them all and itíll

00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:43.540
be in my presentation which I believe you'll
have access to. So that's my prepared talk.

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:48.260
I'm out of breath. And I'll be happy to take
questions for as long as you want and they

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:49.480
have books over there, too. I'll sign those.
Yeah.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.480
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #9: One thing Iíve
been wondering about. I see people think that

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.480
all plurals need apostrophes.
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: I'm sorry. Could you stand

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:54.520
up? I'm sorry.
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #9: People seem to

00:43:54.520 --> 00:44:06.020
think that all plurals need apostrophes. And
I have an example, a challenge for you.

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:10.030
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: Okay.
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #9: I was wearing Levis

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:12.940
and an apostrophe might look
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: Yes.

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:19.830
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #9: [inaudible] Is
an apostrophe wrong? Do you skip it when it's

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:21.970
a word like trousers or ?
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: So the question was about

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:27.609
apostrophes to make things plural. And I think
it was also about, are you wondering how you

00:44:27.609 --> 00:44:31.881
make a word that ends with 's' possessive?
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #9: No. That one I

00:44:31.881 --> 00:44:32.881
know.
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: That one you know. Okay.

00:44:32.881 --> 00:44:35.690
Well, that was one of my missing slides. So
that was something a lot of people don't know

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:40.650
actually is that it's a style choice. So if
you're talking about Levi's fourth quarter

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:46.150
earnings. You could say 'Levis'' with just
an apostrophe or you could say 'Levi's' with

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:53.640
an apostrophe-s. It's a style choice. That
one might not be because of the way it's pronounced.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:58.530
But Kansas, the Supreme Court Justices actually
argued about whether it should be "Kansas's"

00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:04.890
statute with an apostrophe-s or just an apostrophe.
And I forget what they call them, the majority

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:07.881
and the dissenting opinion. They spelled it
differently. [audience laughter] For the same

00:45:07.881 --> 00:45:15.820
case. It was a big brouhaha in law journals.
But no, you don't use an apostrophe to make

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:22.740
things plural. It's not common to see someone
use an apostrophe after something like 'Levis'

00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:29.250
to make it plural. Levis would be, I think
that is sort of like fish in that the plural

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:37.609
and the singular would be the same. You would
say, 'I have 20', you would say, 'I have 20

00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:42.170
pairs of Levis at home.'
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #10: [inaudible] twenties

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:45.010
in my pocket.
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: Right. And that's when it's

00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:51.180
much more common for people to use apostrophes
like after an abbreviation, CD's. We had 50

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:56.210
CD's in the closet. It used to be, it's kind
of, it's one of those things that's evolving.

00:45:56.210 --> 00:46:01.109
It used to be more common, commonly acceptable
to use an apostrophe to make something like

00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:06.831
that plural. The New York Times was the last
holdout. So the New York Times used an apostrophe

00:46:06.831 --> 00:46:13.430
to make acronyms, like that, initialisms,
to make them plural until just two or three

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:17.150
years ago. And people would write to me every
week to tell me the New York Times was doing

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:22.599
it wrong but it's a style, it was a style
choice. Now that the New York Times has stopped

00:46:22.599 --> 00:46:26.711
doing it, every other major style guide says
not to use apostrophes to make things like

00:46:26.711 --> 00:46:32.369
that plural. So now I say don't do it. It's
wrong. But it's, it's something that has changed

00:46:32.369 --> 00:46:39.980
over time. But how would you make Levis plural?
What's an example where you wouldn't use pairs?

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:47.859
When would you use say, 'I have 50 Levis.'
You wouldn't just say 'I have 50 Levis'.

00:46:47.859 --> 00:46:55.119
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #9: I think CD is actually
a better example. I find myself wondering

00:46:55.119 --> 00:46:56.970
should I say C-D-S?
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: Yeah. It's C-D-s with no

00:46:56.970 --> 00:47:04.400
apostrophe. Even when, even with the abbrev-,Oh
I can't remember. I, someone asked me about

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:14.250
OS, OSs. Operating systems. And I want, I'm
pretty sure, I think it's O-S-E-S to make

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:19.440
something like that plural. But if it doesn't
end with an S, just add an S. And even if

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:25.890
it's, so RBIs, Runs Brought In, itís still
RBIs. You put the S on the end even though

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:36.940
it's actually 'runs'. That's plural if you
were to spell it out. Someone over here had

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:37.940
a question.
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #11: I'm just wondering

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:38.940
what you think about camel case.
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: Camel case. I covered that

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:44.120
a while ago and it's in one of my books. I
have a cartoon about it. So if, if it's a

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:48.940
company name, then you should write it that
way. You should use it, I should tell you.

00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:53.599
Camel case is when you have an upper case
letter in the middle of a word. So PowerPoint.

00:47:53.599 --> 00:47:58.680
The P is capitalized.
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #12: McMahon?

00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.680
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: Hmm?
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #12: McMahon?

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.080
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: McMahon as for a name. I
guess that would be camel case. It comes up

00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:07.760
so much more often with the name of companies
or the band OutKast. They capitalize the K.

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:13.200
They use a K. I mean what do you expect? [giggling]
[audience laughter] Really, we're gonna hold

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:21.660
them to high standards when they spell OutKast
with a K? [laughs] I, I think it's, it's,

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:27.240
it's kind of annoying. It's better to avoid
it. It comes from, it comes from programming

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:31.531
because often you can't put spaces in variable
names and file names and things like that.

00:48:31.531 --> 00:48:36.310
So it started with programmers using capitals
in the middle of everything to differentiate

00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:41.093
word from word. And oh gosh. There was someone.
I know what it was. It was someone who had

00:48:41.093 --> 00:48:48.869
a company named NetEase wrote in and said
that he thinks the drive to use camel case

00:48:48.869 --> 00:48:52.900
so often in company names because it's hard
to find a domain name and so you have to string

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:57.930
lots of words together and then if you don't
capitalize the first part of the next word,

00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:03.670
it can look weird. Because he said his parents
always tease him that his company is KneeTease.

00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:10.099
Like your knee. Because if you didn't capitalize
the E in NetEase, it looked like KneeTease.

00:49:10.099 --> 00:49:17.650
So there's a drive. There are a lot of logical,
practical reasons to have camel case and if

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:22.130
a company writes their name that way, then
you should write it that way. I, yeah. I mean.

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:27.560
Just try to avoid it when it's unnecessary.
Yeah.

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:35.050
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #13: I have sort of
a Google question about Latin versus English.

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:36.050
Is it okay to say ëForumsí?
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: Forums? Oh. Is it fora?

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:37.050
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #13: Yeah.
&gt;.Mignon Fogarty: Yeah.

00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:38.050
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #13: It seems like
some of that stuff is disappearing.

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:40.630
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: It is.
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #13: We donít need

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:45.840
to know as much classic grammar as before.
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: Yeah. The one I was really

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:54.230
surprised about is agenda. So agenda is plural
and the singular if you want to say, you would

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:59.670
say 'What's this meeting's agendum?' [laughs]
[audience laughter] If you wanted to use classical

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:06.570
language. So a lot of that is going away and
a lot of it, in some instances there are two

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:16.650
ways to say it. So 'index', I think the Wall
Street uses 'indexes' and scientists still

00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:27.270
tend to use 'indices'. So, in some instances,
both the Americanized version and the classical

00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:35.310
version co-exist. And in other instances,
they, the, the more modern version has taken

00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:37.359
over like with 'agendas'. I would say 'Forums'.
[laughs] Yeah?

00:50:37.359 --> 00:50:40.681
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #2: I have a personal
pet peeve about try and do something. Is that,

00:50:40.681 --> 00:50:52.460
it's so common. I see it written all the time.
Is that becoming acceptable?

00:50:52.460 --> 00:51:01.210
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: It's actually one of my
pet peeves too. [laughs] So people will say,

00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:05.260
'I'm going to try and call you tomorrow.'
Well that means you're gonna do two things.

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:11.050
You're gonna try and you're gonna call. The
proper way to say it is 'I will try to call

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:16.180
you tomorrow.' The 'to' is a preposition and
the function of prepositions is often to connect

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:22.170
words together. To connect ideas together.
And so the proper phrase is 'I will try to

00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:29.480
call you tomorrow.' But you're right, the
'try and' is becoming pervasive. I don't know

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:36.150
if it's a losing battle or not. I, I don't
intend to give up on it yet. There are some

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:44.510
battles I have given up on. 'Momentarily'
is one. So 'momentarily' means for a moment.

00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:50.110
So if you say, 'The plane will land in Phoenix
momentarily', that means you've got a touch

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:55.349
and go. [laughs] [audience laughter] Traditionally
but it's become so common for 'momentarily'

00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:59.671
to mean 'in a moment' that it's just a lost
cause. We're never gonna win that battle so

00:51:59.671 --> 00:52:07.560
I give up. But I haven't given up on 'try
to' yet. Do you have a question or are you

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:08.619
leaving?
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #14: A question.

00:52:08.619 --> 00:52:10.320
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: Okay. [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: When is it appropriate

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:15.730
to use underlines in printed text versus italics?
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: Hmm. Well it depends on,

00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:19.940
when should you use underlines versus italics?
Well it kind of depends on what style guide

00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:24.690
you follow. So the Modern Language Association,
which is usually the style guide used for

00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:31.280
writing research papers, tends to favor underlining
more than other style guides. But since the

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:36.760
rise of the net, underline means a link. Underlining
has really fallen out of favor. So I prefer

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:41.790
not use underlining whenever I can avoid it.
Just because people thinks it's clickable

00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:48.800
then. Our brains have changed how we think
about underlining. But typically, an underline

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:54.820
would be, ñI don't even, I think it's from
the title of a work. Like in the MLA, you

00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:58.640
underline the title of a book maybe. I'm not
super familiar with their style.

00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:01.950
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #14: Oh. Okay.
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #15: What if you have

00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:02.950
a font that doesnít have italics?
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: If you're in a font that

00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:06.170
doesn't have italics, usually if you have
italics, you have underlining. The bigger

00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:12.650
problem is on sites like Twitter and Facebook.
I haven't checked Google Plus yet to see if

00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:17.230
they do this. But you can't make italics or
underlining on, on these social networking

00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:21.970
sites. And so then you end up putting things
in quotes but it bothers me because, if I'm

00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:27.070
putting the title of a book, titles of books
don't go in quotes in any style. But itís

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:33.110
the only way to really highlight them when
you could put underlines next to each of them

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:39.770
or asterisks. But asterisks really mean bold.
It's frustrating and in the publishing industry,

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:44.130
they write book titles in all caps. It's sort
of an inside the industry thing. It's not

00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:49.040
any acceptable style guide but it's all throughout
publishing. So then I started to maybe trying,

00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:53.849
like a couple times I've written my book titles
on Twitter and Facebook and Google Plus all

00:53:53.849 --> 00:53:58.780
caps. But then it just looks like you're screaming
and that bothers me too and I just want italics

00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:05.600
but I don't think it's gonna happen. Oh, you
have to come up. I have formally said that

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:11.369
my preferred style is all caps because it
conserves space. You're not, you've got 140

00:54:11.369 --> 00:54:16.070
characters for example. You don't want to
use two of them on quotation marks but I still

00:54:16.070 --> 00:54:28.349
don't like it. I'm not resolved to it. Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: I have a question.

00:54:28.349 --> 00:54:34.320
I'm pretty loud too. Let's say you're using
a nickname. You're putting that in quotes,

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:35.320
right?
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: Um hmm.

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.320
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #3: Say there's a
good salesperson. They call her 'The Closer'

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:37.320
or something. So in that case does the period
still go inside the quote at the end of the

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.320
sentence?
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: Yeah. The period always

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:42.020
goes inside the quotation marks. And that
actually brings up an interesting point. So

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:46.530
you capitalize nicknames but you don't capitalize
terms of endearment. And this is something

00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:54.230
people are often confused about. So if you
say 'Our salesperson, Bunny, had a great year.',

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:59.380
you capitalize Bunny if that's what everyone
calls her. But if you said, if youíre, if

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:07.119
you're coming up to say your boyfriend and
you say, 'Hey, sweetie.' Unless, unless you

00:55:07.119 --> 00:55:10.350
always call him 'sweetie' and that's what
you think of as his name, 'sweetie' is lower

00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:14.390
case because it's just a term of endearment.
And sometimes it's hard to find that, figure

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:18.579
out which is which but you capitalize nicknames
and you don't capitalize terms of endearment.

00:55:18.579 --> 00:55:20.060
Yeah?
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #16: Commas before

00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:25.480
ëbutí when itís not used as a conjunction
and when itís not used to separate independent

00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:32.400
clauses so it can that indicate a difference?
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: Um hmm. So usually you don't

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:38.420
put a comma before 'but'. So the commas are
super-tricky. They're like 25 different comma

00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:43.370
roles and one of the sort of exceptions is
that you can always use a comma when you need

00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:50.829
it to avoid confusion and you can use it to
show contrast. So you could say, 'Squiggly

00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:56.880
hid behind the tree COMMA but felt brave'
because those are in such stark contrast,

00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:02.350
the comma helps draw attention to the contrast.
And again, it's one of those style calls.

00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:08.030
Like how much contrast do you need before
you can use a comma. But, but you can in instances

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:11.510
where you're showing a contrast. Yes?
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #17: How about 'that'

00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:14.130
versus 'which'?
&gt;&gt;Mignon Fogarty: 'That' versus 'which'. Yeah.

00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:21.210
Another common one. So I have a memory trick
for that too. So the memory trick is that

00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:25.660
with apologies to Hermione Granger, you can
always throw out the ëwhichesí and no harm

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:34.640
will be done. So if you have a, so 'which'
is for non-restrictive clauses and 'that'

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:43.150
is for restrictive clauses. So what that means
is it's better with an example. So you could

00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:50.900
say, 'I like diamonds COMMA which are expensive.'
So because diamonds are always expensive,

00:56:50.900 --> 00:56:58.060
at least in my world, the 'which are expensive'
is a non-essential clause. It's sort of restating

00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:01.640
the obvious. You don't really need it. So
if you could, it doesn't really change the

00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:05.359
meaning of the sentence if you get rid of
that 'which' clause. So if you can throw out

00:57:05.359 --> 00:57:12.270
the 'whiches' and it doesn't change the meaning,
then 'which' is the right choice. Now I could

00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:21.750
say, 'Dogs that bark make me crazy.' So 'that
bark' is an essential part of that sentence.

00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:26.940
It changes the kind of dogs we're talking
about. I love dogs. It's just dogs that bark

00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:32.950
that make me crazy. So, so you can't, you
can't throw it out. And so you can't throw

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:38.020
out the 'whiches' so you need a 'that' instead.
So there's some exceptions actually to that

00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:48.910
rule but that's the basic rule. Come on. [laughs]
Someone stump me. No? Well, thank you again

00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:54.150
for having me and, and for making all the
cool Google tools that I use. I hope you learned

00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:58.971
something and I have a free Podcast at iTunes
and a free e-mail newsletter at my website

00:57:58.971 --> 00:58:03.310
which is quickanddirtytips dot com. And I'll
stick around and answer your questions and

00:58:03.310 --> 00:58:05.341
sign books and stuff. Whatever you want. So
thank you.

00:58:05.341 --> 00:58:11.749
