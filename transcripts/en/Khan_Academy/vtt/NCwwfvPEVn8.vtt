00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.950
In the last video,
we figured out

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.590
how to construct a unit
normal vector to a surface.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.800
And so now we can use that
back in our original surface

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.750
integral to try to
simplify a little bit,

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.320
or at least give us a clue how
we can calculate these things.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.820
And also, think
about different ways

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.950
to represent this type
of a surface integral.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.710
So if we just substitute what
we came up as our normal vector,

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.190
our unit normal
vector right here,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.120
we will get-- so
once again, it's

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.540
the surface integral of F dot.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.499
And F dot all of this
business right over here.

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:35.123
And I'm going to
write it all in white,

00:00:35.123 --> 00:00:36.900
just so it doesn't
take me too much time.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.930
So the partial of
r with respect to u

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.940
crossed with the partial
of r with respect

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.280
to v over the magnitude
of the same thing, partial

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.560
of r with respect to u
crossed with the partial of r

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.770
with respect to v.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.709
And now, we've
played with ds a lot.

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:55.375
We know that the other
way to write ds--

00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:56.874
and I gave the
intuition, hopefully,

00:00:56.874 --> 00:00:58.840
for that several videos
ago when we first

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.120
explored what a surface
integral was all about.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.770
We know that ds is--
it can be represented

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.420
as the magnitude of the
partial of r with respect

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.501
to u crossed with the partial
of r with respect to v du dv.

00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:17.020
And Obviously, the du dv, it
could be written as dv du.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.410
You could write it as da,
a little chunk of area

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.310
and the uv plane or
in the uv domain.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.010
And actually, since now this
integral's in terms of uv,

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.760
we're no longer taking
a surface integral.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.880
We're now taking a double
integral over the uv domain.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.150
So you could say kind
of a region in uv.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.100
So I'll say R to say that's
it's a region in the uv plane

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.550
that we're now thinking about.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.770
But there's probably a
huge-- or there should be,

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.720
or I'm guessing there's a
huge simplification that's

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.928
popping out at you right now.

00:01:44.928 --> 00:01:47.130
We're dividing by the
magnitude of the cross product

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.588
of these two vectors
and then we're

00:01:48.588 --> 00:01:52.040
multiplying by the magnitude of
the cross product of these two

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.695
vectors.

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:54.070
Those are just
scalar quantities.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.140
You divide by something
and multiply by something.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.598
Well, that's just the same
thing as multiplying or dividing

00:01:58.598 --> 00:01:59.390
by 1.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.420
So these two
characters cancel out,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.930
and our integral simplifies
to the double integral

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.250
over that region, the
corresponding region in the uv

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.200
plane, of F-- of
our vector field F

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.880
dotted with this cross product.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.130
This is going to give us
a vector right over here.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.740
That's going to
give us a vector.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.282
It gives us actually
a normal vector.

00:02:22.282 --> 00:02:24.031
And then when you
divide by its magnitude,

00:02:24.031 --> 00:02:25.520
it gives you a
unit normal vector.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.780
So this, you're going to
take the dot product of F

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.700
with r, the partial
of r with respect

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:41.170
to u crossed with the partial
of r with respect to v du dv.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.550
Let me scroll over to the
right a little bit, du dv.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.590
And we'll see in the
few videos from now

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.270
that this is essentially how we
go about actually calculating

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.860
these things.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.390
If you have a
parameterization, you

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.640
can then get everything in
terms of a double integral,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.509
in terms of uv this way.

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.800
Now, the last thing I want
to do is explore another way

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.050
that you'll see a surface
integral like this written.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.379
It all comes from,
really, writing this part

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:04.170
in a different way.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.630
But it hopefully gives you
a little bit more intuition

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.700
of what this thing
is even saying.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.240
So I'm just going to rewrite.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.570
I'm going to rewrite this
chunk right over here.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.122
I'm just going to
rewrite that chunk.

00:03:14.122 --> 00:03:16.580
And I'm going to use slightly
different notation because it

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.030
will hopefully help make
a little bit more sense.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.100
So the partial of r
with respect to u I

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.930
can write as the partial
of r with respect to u.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.600
And we're taking
the cross product.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.300
Let me make my u's a little bit
more u-like so we confuse them

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.190
with v's.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.940
And we're taking the
cross product of that

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.400
with the partial
of r with respect

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.130
to v. So very small
changes in our vector--

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.930
in our parameterization
right here,

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.100
our position vector given
a small change in v. Very

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.850
small changes in the vector
given a small change in u.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.670
And then we're multiplying
that times du dv.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.240
We're multiplying
that times du dv.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.750
Now, du and dv are
just scalar quantities.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.290
They're infinitesimally small.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.084
But for the sake
of this argument,

00:04:03.084 --> 00:04:04.750
you can just view--
they're not vectors,

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.500
they're just scalar quantities.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.730
And so you can
essentially include them--

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.530
if you have the cross product.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.470
If you have a cross b times some
scalar value-- I don't know, x,

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.610
you could rewrite this
as x times a cross b,

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.530
or you could write
this as a cross x times

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.700
b, because x is
just a scalar value.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:31.540
It's just a number.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.206
So we could do the
same thing over here.

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:35.650
We can rewrite all
of this business as--

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.630
and I'm going to group the du
where we have the partial--

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.300
or with respect to u
in the denominator.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.966
And I'll do the same
thing with the v's.

00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:48.430
And so you will get the
partial of r with respect

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.440
to u times du,
times that scalar.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.240
So that'll give us a vector.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.750
And we're going to cross that.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.530
We're going to cross that with
the partial of r with respect

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:06.650
to v dv.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.814
Now, these might
look notationally

00:05:08.814 --> 00:05:10.480
like two different
things, but that just

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.470
comes from the
necessity of when we

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.780
take partial derivatives to say,
oh, no, this vector function

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.887
is defined-- it's a function
of multiple variables

00:05:18.887 --> 00:05:20.720
and this is taking a
derivative with respect

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.010
to only one of them.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.510
So this is, how
much does our vector

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.330
change when you have a
very small change in u?

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.880
But this is also an
infinitesimally small change

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.950
in u over here, we're just using
slightly different notation.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.280
So for the sake of--
and this is a little bit

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.280
loosey-goosey mathematics,
but it will hopefully

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.860
give you the intuition
for why this thing could

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.790
be written in a different way.

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.290
These are essentially
the same quantity.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.770
So if you divide by something
and multiply by something,

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.072
you can cancel them out.

00:05:46.072 --> 00:05:48.280
If you divide by something
and multiply by something,

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.840
you can cancel them out.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.070
And all you're left
with then-- all

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.670
you're left with is
the differential of r.

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.080
And since we lost
the information

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.496
that it's in the
u-direction, I'll

00:05:58.496 --> 00:06:00.830
write here, the differential
of r in the u-direction.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.891
I don't want to get
the notation confused.

00:06:02.891 --> 00:06:04.140
This is just the differential.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.000
This is just how much r changed.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.820
This is not the partial
derivative of r with respect

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.455
to u.

00:06:09.455 --> 00:06:11.350
This right over here
is, how much does r

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.320
change given per unit change,
per small change in u?

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.190
This just says a differential
in the direction of-- I

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.530
guess as u changes, this is
how much that infinitely small

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.060
change that just r changes.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.460
This isn't change in r with
respect to change in u.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.710
And we're going to cross that.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.775
Now, we're going to cross
that with the partial of r,

00:06:31.775 --> 00:06:34.900
the partial of r
in the v-direction.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.280
Now, this right over here,
let's just conceptualize this.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.920
And this goes back to
our original visions

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.330
of what a surface
integral was all about.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.314
If we're on a surface--
and I'll draw surface.

00:06:44.314 --> 00:06:45.480
Let me draw another surface.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.970
I won't use the one that
I had already drawn on.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.077
If we draw a surface, and for
a very small change in u--

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:52.910
and we're not going to
think about the rate.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.220
We're just thinking about
kind of the change in r.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.790
You're going in that direction.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.220
So if that thing
looks like this,

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.310
this is actually kind of a
distance moved on the surface.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.060
Because remember, this
isn't the derivative.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.350
This is the differential.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.840
So it's just a small
change along the surface,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.510
that's that over there.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.710
And that this is a small
change when you change v. So

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.050
it's also a change
along the surface.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.310
When you take the cross
product of these two things,

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.430
you get a vector
that is orthogonal.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.570
You get a vector that is
normal to the surface.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:33.740
So it is normal to the
surface and its magnitude--

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.340
and we saw this when we first
learned about cross products.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.080
Its magnitude is
equal to the area that

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.680
is defined by these two vectors.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:49.302
So its magnitude
is equal to area.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:50.760
So in a lot of
ways, you can really

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.420
think of it-- you
really could think

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:57.020
of it as a unit normal
vector times ds.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.960
And so the way that we would,
I guess notationally do this,

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.470
is we can call this--
because this is kind of a ds,

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.045
but it's a vector
version of the ds.

00:08:04.045 --> 00:08:06.760
Over here, this is just
an area right over here.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.830
This is just a scalar value.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.250
But now, we have a vector
that points normally

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.930
from the surface,
but its magnitude

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.300
is the same thing as
that ds that we were just

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.340
talking about.

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:22.070
So we can call this thing right
over here, we can call this ds.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.140
And the key difference here
is this is a vector now.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.240
So we'll call it ds with
a little vector over it

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.570
to know that this thing.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.200
This isn't the scalar ds that
is just concerned with the area.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.970
But when you view
things this way,

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:39.289
we just saw that this entire
thing simplifies to ds.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:43.419
Then our whole surface
integral can be rewritten.

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:45.200
Instead of writing
it like this, we

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.480
can write it as the
integral or the surface

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.050
integral-- those integral
signs were too fancy.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:57.794
The surface integral of F dot.

00:08:57.794 --> 00:09:00.750
And instead of saying a
normal vector times the scalar

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.040
quantity, that little chunk
of area on the surface,

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.731
we can now just call that
the vector differential ds.

00:09:07.731 --> 00:09:10.230
And I want to make it clear,
these are two different things.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.280
This is a vector.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.130
This is essentially
what we're calling it.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.655
This right over here is a
scalar times a normal vector.

00:09:16.655 --> 00:09:18.030
So these are three
different ways

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.800
of really representing
the same thing.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.175
And in different contexts,
you will see different things,

00:09:22.175 --> 00:09:25.110
depending on what the author of
whoever's trying to communicate

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.820
is trying to communicate.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.990
This right over here is the one
that we'll use most frequently

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:34.192
as we actually try to calculate
these surface integrals.
