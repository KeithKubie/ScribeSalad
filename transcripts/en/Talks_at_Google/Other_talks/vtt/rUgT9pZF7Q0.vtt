RYAN GERMICK: Hello there.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.540
My name is Ryan and I lead
the Google Doodle team.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.430
And I'm here with a very
special guest at the

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.027
Googleplex, Mr. Wayne White.

00:00:10.027 --> 00:00:11.428
Give it up.

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:12.362
WAYNE WHITE: Thank you.

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:13.612
Thank you.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.230
RYAN GERMICK: I'd been a fan of
Wayne's work before I even

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.550
knew there was such a thing
as being a fan.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.690
His work entered into many
millions of American homes

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.620
with the puppet design and other
assorted creativity for

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.490
Pee Wee's Playhouse.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.670
It was years later when I first
saw one of your word

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.190
paintings, the album cover for
Lambchop's "Nixon." And then a

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.240
few years later after that I was
in a diner in LA, Fred 62,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.030
and I'm like, I know
this stuff.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.460
And then a little bit longer
after that when I saw a

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.010
beautiful book that was recently
produced called "I

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.510
Will Now Get the--"

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.210
WAYNE WHITE: Maybe now.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.480
RYAN GERMICK: Maybe now.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.450
WAYNE WHITE: "Maybe Now I'll
Get the Respect I So Richly

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.630
Deserve."

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:59.490
RYAN GERMICK: Right.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.950
WAYNE WHITE: Ey.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:01.180
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.099
I think today's the turning
point for that if I have

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.060
anything to do with it.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.950
WAYNE WHITE: Finally.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:06.650
RYAN GERMICK: Finally.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.250
WAYNE WHITE: Today's the day.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.920
RYAN GERMICK: September
10, 2012.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.260
And it all came together in a
really wonderful movie that's

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.410
coming out this fall.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.000
WAYNE WHITE: It's out now.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.740
RYAN GERMICK: Technically out.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.890
WAYNE WHITE: It premiered
September 7.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.840
And it's called "Beauty Is
Embarrassing." And it's the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.670
story of my life and times.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.860
RYAN GERMICK: Wonderful.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.830
And it's actually going to open
up in San Francisco and

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.690
many other Bay Area locations
this weekend.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.170
WAYNE WHITE: Yes.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.680
I will be in the Bay
Area this weekend.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.260
It's going to be in San
Francisco, Berkeley, San Jose,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:41.740
and Santa Cruz.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.640
You can go to
beautyisembarrassing.com for

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.910
the theaters and times.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.330
I can't remember them all.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.225
But I take it a day at a time.

00:01:50.225 --> 00:01:51.040
RYAN GERMICK: Like sevenish.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.760
7 PM, maybe.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.700
WAYNE WHITE: Yeah, probably.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.170
7 or 8.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.695
RYAN GERMICK: Evening time.

00:01:53.695 --> 00:01:54.380
WAYNE WHITE: Yeah.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.350
You can call the--

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.140
you can see the listings on
beautyisembarrassing.com and

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.910
call your theaters.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.430
But I will be back up here.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.710
I love the Bay Area.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.060
Always have a great reception
when we come up here.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.450
RYAN GERMICK: Pandering
to the local crowd.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.630
WAYNE WHITE: I love you all.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.285
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:08.000
RYAN GERMICK: And YouTube.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.050
You love YouTube.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.000
I imagine you love YouTube
and the people who

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.720
watch YouTube videos.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.170
WAYNE WHITE: Of course.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.470
Are you kidding?

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.880
I'm on YouTube every day.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.930
RYAN GERMICK: Well, you have a
lot of new stuff going on.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.410
Always moving forward.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.870
If we could-- speaking
of moving forward.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:22.790
But it's not--

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:23.720
you're not new to art.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.730
This is actually--

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.290
this is a picture of your
great grandfather?

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.650
WAYNE WHITE: No.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.040
It's me.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.192
I've been doing these paintings
since 1878.

00:02:29.192 --> 00:02:30.680
RYAN GERMICK: Ah.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.600
You aged very well.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.050
WAYNE WHITE: I am a vampire.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.720
That's how I can do so much.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.320
There's so much to talk about
just in this photograph.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.840
One is that your eyes
look really weird.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.140
Did you blink or something?

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.545
WAYNE WHITE: No.

00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:47.570
Actually, this was
done by the great

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.340
photographer Stephen Berkman.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.570
And this is his medium.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.370
He uses an original 1860s
glass-plate negative camera.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.830
It's called an ambrotype.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.590
He plays by all the 19th
century rules.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.860
Uses the same chemicals.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.880
He uses only natural light.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.850
And this particular kind of
film, the ambrotype, does not

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.390
pick up blue.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.020
It does not pick
up light blues.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.800
Blue reads as white.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.780
So that's why my eyes
have that creepy

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.150
white glow to them.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.410
Because I have light
blue eyes.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.760
RYAN GERMICK: That's
a terrific answer.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.770
Even if it's not true.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.380
WAYNE WHITE: It's true.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.000
It's true.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.520
RYAN GERMICK: I believe you.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.640
So I feel like we could talk for
the entire time just about

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.430
this image, because there's all
these other images in it.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.810
But one thing I love, and I
think this kind of sums up in

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.150
many ways your philosophy.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.610
I don't want you to spoil
all the good stuff.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.690
But the "Hoozy Thinky
Iz" image.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:36.760
Could you unpack that?

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.310
Who do think you are?

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.530
WAYNE WHITE: Yeah.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.500
That particular painting there,
"Hoozy Thinky Iz," that

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.830
is sort of--

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.750
and I think a lot of my fellow
artists, maybe, can relate to

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.330
this, and I talk about
it in the movie--

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.170
it's a feeling of, especially
in our culture, who do you

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.220
think you are getting up
there and making a

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.840
spectacle of yourself?

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.660
You must have a very high
opinion of yourself to go out

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.150
there and push your so-called
"vision" on the world, or to

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.530
be an "artiste," as people
like to call you.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.290
That's a subtle way of
putting you down.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.700
I hate that word.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.700
When so-- oh, here comes
the "artiste."

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.190
RYAN GERMICK: I use it just to
sort of make fun of the word.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.830
WAYNE WHITE: Yeah.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.410
Double back on it.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.980
But this culture does not
respect or nurture artists.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.440
Maybe the San Francisco area,
there's pockets of

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.480
culture that does.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.500
But on the whole--

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.900
especially, you can understand,
being a Midwest

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.970
boy yourself.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.150
I'm a Southern boy.

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.150
They do not respect and
nurture artists.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.650
And you grow up with this sort
of insecure feeling of, yeah,

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.920
who do I think I am
for doing this?

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.560
Because everybody looks
askance at me.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.120
And it takes a certain amount
of ego to be an artist.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.570
And our culture also sort of
looks down on the ego, as they

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.930
should, because it can
get out of control.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.560
But the artist ego is such that
you start to question it.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.070
Well, maybe I am a little out
of control with the ego.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.190
And who do I think I am?

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.450
And it's just the natural
insecurity of the human

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.430
condition to question
yourself that way.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.530
And it's amplified when you
take the artist's path.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.350
And it's amplified also
when you see people

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.590
better than you are.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.660
Well, who do I think I am?

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.890
This guy's ten times
better than me.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:22.950
I'm humbled by it.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.970
RYAN GERMICK: You mentioned
respect for artists.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.380
That's a good lead-in to-- we
have another slide, if you

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.930
want to show.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.400
Talk a little bit about
this painting.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.670
WAYNE WHITE: This is called
"Picasso's Ass Falling Off."

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.620
Now, this is a secret that I've
never revealed when I've

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.920
said this title or showed
this painting.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.800
I first heard the expression
"ass falling off" from the

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.610
artist James Rosenquist.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.620
RYAN GERMICK: Oh, yeah.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.970
He used to be a billboard
painter.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.380
Another commercial artist
turned fine artist.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.810
WAYNE WHITE: Yes.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.000
He's a very famous pop artist.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.850
Very influential
in the culture.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.640
And I happened to meet him at
a party once that I went to

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.140
with the great Red Grooms, who
I also worked for at one time

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.140
in New York City.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.950
And I was like this 24-year-old
kid straight out

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.670
of Tennessee in this room full
of these superstars of

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.820
American art.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.220
And Rosenquist was holding
court about his days as a

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.270
billboard painter.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.280
This is kind of off topic, but--
he goes, yeah, and I

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.440
went to the boss that day.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.380
I said, boss, I feel like my
ass is going to fall off.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.370
And I thought about that
term for years.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.390
And I associated it with
art and artists.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.080
And that inspired me to have
Picasso's ass falling off.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.075
And this is just sort
of a jab at the king

00:06:31.075 --> 00:06:34.460
of art, Pablo Picasso.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.380
I mean, that's a guy that
anybody who's put pencil to

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.830
paper or tried to make a
painting, that's one guy you

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.830
have to get around or
over or through.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.060
You have to pass through Picasso
Land sooner or later

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.370
if you're an artist.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.900
And this is just kind of like
throwing darts at the king.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.110
I love Picasso.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.110
All artists do.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.590
You can't help but.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:57.430
You have to pay respect.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:02.800
But at the same time, this
reflects one of my abiding

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.490
passions in art, is to bring
humor into fine art.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.550
And to poke pins in
pretensions, to

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.620
rail against the king.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.030
That's a very American thing.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:14.450
We hate kings.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.690
That's why this culture--
that's why

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.090
this country was started.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.670
To rail against monarchy.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.330
To break down class systems.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.210
And that's a big part of
what humor does, is

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:26.770
to break down walls.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.170
And to laugh at class
distinctions and everything.

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:32.780
And to bring everything to
a level playing field.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.300
We're all hairless apes.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.400
RYAN GERMICK: Well, some
more than others.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.160
So what is it about art
that is so afraid of

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.020
humor, do you think?

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.525
Is that universal, or do you
think it's historical?

00:07:47.525 --> 00:07:50.930
WAYNE WHITE: It's not
necessarily universal.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:55.420
First of all, I consider humor
an elevated form of

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.140
consciousness.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.830
I think it's one of the most
sacred, valuable qualities we

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.350
have as human beings.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.470
And so why shouldn't it be
worthy of the canon of art?

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.700
Why shouldn't it be in
museums and whatnot?

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.080
I consider stand-up comics,
especially people like Richard

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.590
Pryor, Lenny Bruce, George
Carlin to be fine artists.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:20.460
It's one of the finest
art forms there is.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:24.710
But you know, art is
famously humorless.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.780
Especially critics, curators.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.440
A certain type of class
consciousness invades art.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.600
People go to the best schools,
Ivy League schools.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.573
Ivy League people control the
art world through criticism

00:08:38.573 --> 00:08:41.230
and through curatorship.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:43.599
And through the fast track that
they're on by going to

00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:45.240
these moneyed schools.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.850
Moneyed schools do not want
to talk about humor.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.210
Humor is considered lightweight
and low.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.060
It's considered an
entertainment.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.490
And not worthy of serious
contemplation.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.110
RYAN GERMICK: Did you ever
read the book "Ways of

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.910
Seeing," by John Berger?

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.120
WAYNE WHITE: Yes.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.290
I've read all--

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:04.250
that's another thing.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.040
RYAN GERMICK: You've
read every book?

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.340
WAYNE WHITE: I've read
every book there is.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.776
No, I--

00:09:08.776 --> 00:09:10.590
RYAN GERMICK: Makes it easier
to discuss with

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:11.230
you, because I--

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.070
WAYNE WHITE: I come from
this working class,

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.310
chip-on-my-shoulder kind
of attitude, but

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.700
I've run the gamut.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.830
I've read Berger, Clement
Greenberg, all the criticisms.

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:22.880
I love fine art.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.370
I love the higher
forms of art.

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:25.520
I love seriousness.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.100
I love drama.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.280
I love the challenges
of difficult art.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.140
I'm not discounting any of it,
I'm just saying there's room

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.630
for other forms of it.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:35.790
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.900
Well, the thing that
blew my mind.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.230
I was in high school, I think,
when an art teacher gave that

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.120
book to me.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.220
And this is less about humor
but more about the value of

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.480
maybe commercial art, was he--

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.740
and I totally maybe misread
this, so someone could go back

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.870
and look this up, and this was
like 15, 16 years ago.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.700
But I remember him talking about
fine art having this

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.380
inherent classicism because it's
an art object owned by

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.520
one person.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.490
And with that rarity and
scarcity, it becomes a

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.600
situation of supply and demand
and the rich person gets it.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.040
And so I think it's
interesting--

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.160
you've had multi-faceted career
we talked about it a

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:11.500
little bit.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:16.300
But art that is not exclusive to
one person but can still be

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.310
art seems to threaten that

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:20.670
long-established supply and demand.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.040
WAYNE WHITE: And Berger, if
I'm not mistaken was a

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.620
communist , or at least
a socialist.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.120
He was.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.870
RYAN GERMICK: There seemed
to be implications, yeah.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:29.430
WAYNE WHITE: He was a
radical socialist.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:34.190
And he believed in bringing up
the thorny problem of class

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.530
within the art world.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.400
And that's a dirty secret of
the art world, is it's very

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.950
much ruled by money.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.920
And the moneyed class.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.260
And I forgot my direction.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.430
RYAN GERMICK: Can I tell you
a story why I chose in art

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:49.150
school not to go into fine
art but to go into

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.080
illustration as a major?

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.410
WAYNE WHITE: Sure.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:51.180
Please do.

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:52.520
RYAN GERMICK: So I was in--

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.620
I feel like I should be
looking at the camera.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:57.990
This is a serious moment.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:02.240
I was 18 years old.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.540
I went to Parsons School
of Design.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.600
And the fine arts department
has wonderful

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.100
students and teachers.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.020
But when I went to the
information session, when

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:11.430
they're trying to get you to
pick a major, they had free

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:15.790
pizza, which was a
big draw for me.

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:16.970
Poor student and whatnot.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:21.670
And they were going on and on
about how wonderful their

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:22.550
facilities were.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:26.730
That they had state of the art--
they had studio space

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:30.360
right in Manhattan and access to
the galleries and museums.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.570
And for people that were into
sculpture, they had just

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.350
bought a plasma cutter.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:38.670
And meanwhile, I'm trying to
get pizza off of the pie.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.630
I'm trying to pull this slice of
pizza and kind of trying to

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.900
keep it cool, but the smart alec
in me couldn't help but

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.760
blurt out, could I
use the plasma

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.005
cutter to get this pizza?

00:11:48.005 --> 00:11:49.700
WAYNE WHITE: And that went
over like a led balloon?

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.190
RYAN GERMICK: Totally
crickets.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.140
And then I was like, I don't
need these guys.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:53.590
WAYNE WHITE: Yeah.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.110
There you go.

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.550
I know.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:59.730
It's like, humor is one of my
acid tests for human beings.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.260
You know what I mean?

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.300
If somebody doesn't have a sense
of humor, it's over.

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.890
I can't relate to them.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.460
I value humor.

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.885
And paradoxically, you can't
analyze humor and put it on

00:12:11.885 --> 00:12:14.650
too high an elevation
or it kills it.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:18.500
It's this precious little flower
that has to grow in a

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.220
certain way, but why can't
it grow in a museum?

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:26.290
Why can't it be considered
worthy of--

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.120
I think it has depth.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.870
I do.

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.000
As much depth as any
other form of art.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.770
RYAN GERMICK: I agree
with you.

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.580
WAYNE WHITE: The best humor has
levels of sadness and all

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.151
the emotions.

00:12:37.151 --> 00:12:37.630
RYAN GERMICK: Right on.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.480
Can I get the next slide?

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.110
So this is somewhat of a
good transition here.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:45.180
So you grew up in Tennessee,
as you mentioned.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:45.610
WAYNE WHITE: Yes.

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:46.932
Chattanooga, Tennessee.

00:12:46.932 --> 00:12:48.420
RYAN GERMICK: Chattanooga.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:50.640
And then you moved
to New York.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.200
Kind of high-tailed--

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.730
you went to college
in Tennessee.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.260
WAYNE WHITE: I had four years
of undergraduate school at a

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.360
state university, Middle
Tennessee State University.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.860
I drifted around Nashville,
Tennessee for a half year

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.090
after I graduated.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:06.140
I saw a magazine called "Raw
Magazine" put out by Art

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.170
Spiegelman in 1981.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.920
And that inspired me to move to
New York, because I saw in

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.620
that magazine, and his spirit,
and the artists in that

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.310
magazine, the birth of a
new world, the birth

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:17.390
of a new art form.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:18.450
And I was right.

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:22.480
That magazine and that scene in
the early '80s in New York

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.210
is becoming true today in the
Renaissance of graphic novels.

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:27.270
Go to any comic book store.

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:27.960
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah,
it's everywhere.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.960
WAYNE WHITE: And it all started
back then, at least in

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.400
America, in the early '80s in
New York City down on Greene

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.100
Street in Soho in Art
Spiegelman's studio.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.280
RYAN GERMICK: When you were in
Middle Tennessee University,

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.160
you also found a community
of folks.

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.610
WAYNE WHITE: I was lucky enough,
coincidentally, to run

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:50.350
into fellow weirdo oddballs from
small towns of the South.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.530
And we were all dying to
validate each other.

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:56.010
We had all come from a
suppressed background.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:58.750
We had all been made to
feel like outsiders.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.240
And suddenly, we were together
and reinforcing each other.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.320
And I always say, your fellow
students are just as

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.910
important, or maybe more
important, to your education

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.970
than your teachers are.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:18.680
I think you can learn as much
from your peers as you can

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.700
from your instructors and your
so-called authority figures.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.120
And that's where I first came
out of my shell and first

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.460
learned about art
and art history.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.440
And just as art as a lifestyle,
as something that

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.520
can bleed out of the classroom,
into the streets,

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.420
become a part of your
everyday life.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.950
RYAN GERMICK: So it seems
clear to me--

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.080
and I had a similar experience
when I went to--

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.070
feel free to check your
email or whatever.

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:47.700
We can cut this out.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:50.940
So it seems clear to me that
that community helped as a

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.140
launching pad.

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.800
And I'm sure many of the
creative people in the

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.330
audience and watching this on
YouTube or whatever have had

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:57.800
that experience.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.500
Do you feel like now in today's
very connected world--

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.170
how do you feel technology is
helping people find weirdos

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.980
and communities that they feel
accepted and validated by?

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.160
WAYNE WHITE: I think
it's helping a lot.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.100
I think it's helping connect
people in ways

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.570
that are really positive.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:16.990
I'm not one of those guys that
rues the day before computers.

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:20.280
I'm not one of those guys that
believes in a golden age or

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.350
the good old days.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.980
Young people, please, believe
this for sure.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.430
There's no good old days.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.650
There's no golden age that
you missed out on.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.450
You're not missing
out on anything.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.530
You're alive right now.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:33.840
Now's your golden age.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.480
Don't listen to some old fart
tell you it used to be better.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.530
Because it wasn't.

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:41.300
It wasn't better.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.570
What is important is, make
this your golden age.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.460
And when you get to be my age,
don't sit around saying, boy,

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.480
back in the Google days, back
when Google first started--

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.970
don't do that.

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:55.730
Please, remember this day
when I'm telling you.

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.370
Don't turn into one
of those people.

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:58.240
Look forward.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.685
Keep believing in the future.

00:15:59.685 --> 00:16:00.935
And change.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.380
RYAN GERMICK: Next.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.710
So I want to go a
little bit back.

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:08.990
This is a still from
the movie.

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:11.200
It's one of my favorite
sections.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.090
There's a lot of talk in the
movie about your upbringing.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.780
And about your relationship with
both your family, like

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.230
your parents, but then your new
family, which is really

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:19.820
terrific, which we'll talk
about in a second.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.230
But it just goes over--
you have a line in the

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:23.820
movie that I love.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.200
And this is your sister
about to spank you.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.155
WAYNE WHITE: Yes.

00:16:27.155 --> 00:16:30.090
RYAN GERMICK: And you said
something like your sister was

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:35.090
the person who told you you were
going to die one day and

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:36.590
made sure you understood
the concept.

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.570
WAYNE WHITE: Yes.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:39.560
RYAN GERMICK: I love
that because--

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.710
WAYNE WHITE: That's what I'm--

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:43.830
that's what the V.O. is right
when this scene is happening.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:47.620
I said, and my sister was
the first bad-ass.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:51.270
She was the one that told me I
was going to die one day and

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.730
made sure I was crystal
clear on the concept.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.820
RYAN GERMICK: So we chatted
a little bit earlier and--

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:57.470
WAYNE WHITE: And it's true.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:59.000
RYAN GERMICK: --you were talking
about the old fogies

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.990
talking about the good old days,
and how that relates to

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.990
a fear of death.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.230
WAYNE WHITE: Yeah.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.860
RYAN GERMICK: In a sense.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.050
I'm kind of curious how-- if you
would unpack that for me.

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:09.640
And also, your sister-- you're
just a youngin here.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.089
WAYNE WHITE: Yeah, I'm like
four years old there.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:12.290
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah, and she's
letting-- you know, I'm

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.849
imagining at an early age,
this idea of you're an

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:18.069
infallible mortal is a pretty
heavy thing to learn.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:20.470
But it seems like you take that
lesson to heart today.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.270
WAYNE WHITE: You know what, I
can trace my first existential

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:26.470
crisis to that day when my
sister very patiently

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.119
explained to me that we
were all going to be

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:29.370
dead forever one day.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:34.260
And I remember the feeling when
it first pierced me, that

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:37.160
that was a realization.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.020
And I've had anxiety attacks
my whole life about that.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:43.310
And I think a lot of us have
the same feelings.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.490
I think a lot of us, the
mortality thing creeps up on

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:49.910
you when you least expect it,
and you are short of breath.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:55.280
And you suddenly realize, wow,
this is a limited engagement

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.195
we're all in.

00:17:56.195 --> 00:18:00.750
And I think that's a painful
realization, but I think it's

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:04.020
a realization that most
artists share.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.570
That's one of the motivators,
that's one of the engines of

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:08.760
art, is knowing that
this is a limited

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.280
engagement, that we're here.

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.130
Time is precious.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.180
And we've got to do the
best we can with it.

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.350
I think that one of the great
things about artists, is they

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.160
take advantage of that time.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:26.850
I think we all have this acute
realization that we're mortal.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:30.380
And I think art is sort
of, as they say--

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.960
the academic term
is memento mori.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.200
That's one of the big
themes of art.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.710
It's been there ever
since art began.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:42.580
Still lives from the
golden age--

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:43.970
here I go, golden age.

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:44.690
Still lives--

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.400
RYAN GERMICK: Well, as a
vampire, you have a much wider

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.680
perspective.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:50.280
WAYNE WHITE: Still lives from
the Renaissance on are

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.580
symbolic of death.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:52.840
They're called memento mori.

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.165
Fruit, flowers--

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:02.270
those are subtle symbols of
death, and reminding us of the

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:03.920
mortal coil.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.300
So the realization of mortality
is built into art.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.470
And that's what gives it its
poignancy and power.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:13.440
And that's what gives
humor its power.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:18.420
Humor is often a reaction
against a--

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:18.900
RYAN GERMICK: Release
against fear.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.970
WAYNE WHITE: --a release
against fear.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:23.900
Facing that horrible truth.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:27.060
So that's why humor should be
right up there, along with the

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.430
old masters and stuff.

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.310
Because that's what
an artist does.

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:34.660
He defies death, yet he also
comes to terms with it.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:38.360
And that's why art is in
the spiritual realm.

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.130
RYAN GERMICK: Do you want to--

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:40.360
I come from a big family.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.280
I'm the middle of five kids.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.780
And I know that my siblings
did a lot to

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.805
shape me as a person.

00:19:43.805 --> 00:19:46.370
And as a creative person.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:47.720
What about you?

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.700
From what I gather, it doesn't
seem like your sister was

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.440
particularly creative, but your
mom was pretty creative.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.580
WAYNE WHITE: My mother was
the first artist, so to

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:55.570
speak, in my life.

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:56.820
The first aesthete.

00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:01.870
Mind you, I grew
up in a very--

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:08.120
it was the '60s in the South,
which was the '50s, really.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.150
RYAN GERMICK: But it's
still 10 years above

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.055
the Midwest, I think.

00:20:10.055 --> 00:20:11.420
It's still like the
future for us.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:14.150
WAYNE WHITE: Yeah, I mean, I
grew up in a blue collar

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.920
environment.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.620
All my father's friends, my
father himself, they all work

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.350
at DuPont nylon factory.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.000
There wasn't an artist
in sight.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.410
There wasn't a gallery
in sight.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.110
There wasn't a museum.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:28.440
And so the first artist in that
kind of environment was

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.850
my mother, because she
loved antiques.

00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:33.500
She loved to decorate.

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.370
She took me to antique
stores all the time.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.970
She admired objects
for their beauty.

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.400
And her sense of interior
decorating--

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:43.180
she redecorated the house
like every month.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:44.770
So she was a designer.

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:48.920
And she was my first idea of
someone who could enjoy the

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:53.010
visual, and enjoy expressing
the visual.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:55.110
RYAN GERMICK: Wanna hit
the next slide?

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.700
So this a shot of
your family now.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.390
Or from the movie.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.570
A couple years back, I guess.

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:02.460
And everybody seems
really creative.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.480
What's it like being almost
inverted in a sense, where now

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.120
you're in a family
full of artists?

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.100
Your wife, Mimi Pond--

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.260
WAYNE WHITE: Yes, that's my
wife, Mimi Pond, my daughter

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:13.460
Lulu White, and my son, Woodrow
White, who is an art

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.610
major here in Oakland
at the California

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.070
College of the Arts.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:19.230
And of course, my wife is
a famous cartoonist.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:21.480
A lot of you are familiar
with her work.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.960
She's been on the national scene
since the late '70s.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.370
She started out here in Oakland
at the California

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:29.190
College the Arts.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:30.695
RYAN GERMICK: She wrote the
first episode of "The

00:21:30.695 --> 00:21:30.790
Simpsons."

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.800
WAYNE WHITE: She wrote the
first episode of "The

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.430
Simpsons." She started out in
the "National Lampoon" back

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.020
when it was a good magazine.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.860
Back when it was the "National
Lampoon" in the late '70s.

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:44.550
She went on to create the
Valley Girls craze.

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:46.670
She wrote the best-selling book
"Valley Girls' Guide to

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:50.000
Life." She's done five
other humor books.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.560
She's working on a 500-page opus
about her life in Oakland

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.960
in the '70s, when punks took
over from the hippies.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.100
And my daughter is a very
talented painter.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.590
And it just came to
them naturally.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:05.920
It's in the genes.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:11.220
And this is my dream come true,
to nurture artists and

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:14.900
be surrounded by artists in my
own little bubble there in Los

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:19.110
Feliz, in Los Angeles,
California.

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.100
RYAN GERMICK: Cool.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.880
So I think next--

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.040
this is a trailer
from the movie.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.300
I thought we'd just play it.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.440
Just to give people an idea.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.644
WAYNE WHITE: This is "Beauty
Is Embarrassing."

00:22:28.644 --> 00:22:31.470
WAYNE WHITE: Thank you.

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:33.435
RYAN GERMICK: I watched
it twice last week.

00:22:33.435 --> 00:22:35.810
I didn't have to, and I
liked it that much.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:37.210
WAYNE WHITE: And you're
still talking to me.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:37.720
RYAN GERMICK: Oh, yeah.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.930
I'd watch it again.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:40.780
WAYNE WHITE: You heard him.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.530
RYAN GERMICK: It's good stuff.

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:44.700
I mean, there was so much
packed in there.

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.760
And you guys should definitely
see the movie.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.190
Happy to shill for you,
it was a great movie.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:53.623
One is that you play banjo,
which you didn't bring.

00:22:53.623 --> 00:22:54.590
WAYNE WHITE: No.

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:55.300
CROWD: Aww.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.670
WAYNE WHITE: Sorry.

00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:59.260
RYAN GERMICK: Two is that you
dance, which you don't need

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:00.310
any banjo for.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:03.200
WAYNE WHITE: No.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.700
They say-- you know
that phrase "dance

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.890
like nobody's watching"?

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.930
I forgot that people
were watching.

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:12.660
RYAN GERMICK: Well, the
third is that--

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.690
I want to talk a bit
about "Pee Wee."

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:15.800
WAYNE WHITE: Sure.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:20.280
RYAN GERMICK: So "Pee
Wee" was a special

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:21.495
thing in American culture.

00:23:21.495 --> 00:23:22.520
WAYNE WHITE: It sure was.

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.130
RYAN GERMICK: It was just
so much creativity and

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:26.580
originality.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.830
And it was a huge hit.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:28.170
WAYNE WHITE: Yeah.

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:31.690
RYAN GERMICK: I mean, it was
a big deal in my childhood.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.520
And just basically, as a weird
kid in the Midwest, it felt

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.810
like a breath of fresh air.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.570
And I think Matt Groening said
it best, when he said--he was

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:43.900
referring to "Pee Wee" in the
trailer when he said, if this

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.570
could make it, there's
hope for us all.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:46.370
WAYNE WHITE: Yes.

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:47.590
RYAN GERMICK: And that's what
I took away from the movie,

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:50.540
but in particular from "Pee
Wee." That's just one of these

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:53.060
moments of, you know,
the good guys won.

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.440
WAYNE WHITE: Yeah.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.680
RYAN GERMICK: How did you
go from your New York

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.340
cartooning into that?

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.730
And I just want to hear
all about it.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.400
WAYNE WHITE: Well, like I said,
I moved to New York to

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.280
be a cartoonist.

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.560
But at the same time, I'd been
doing these crazy, wacky

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.200
puppet shows on my own.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.930
Just these do-it-yourself
homemade productions.

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:16.820
I started those back in
Tennessee at the university.

00:24:16.820 --> 00:24:20.020
When punk rock first hit, I
couldn't play a guitar, so I

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:22.260
picked up a puppet instead.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.280
And I did these things,
I called them

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.700
punk rock puppet shows.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:31.250
The first one was called "Punk
and Juicy." And the puppets

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:33.330
bled fountains of blood.

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:35.450
We would throw bowls
of Cheerios

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:36.790
and milk at the audience.

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.550
We'd set fire to the stage.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:41.030
We'd come out and choke members
of the audience and

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.460
provoke fights.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.420
It was very confrontational.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.750
It was kind of anti-puppet.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:50.580
It was the era of Andy Kaufman
and Mr. Bill and, like

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:51.605
I said, punk rock.

00:24:51.605 --> 00:24:54.610
It was all about deconstruction
and

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.070
destruction, you know?

00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:00.130
It was about kicking down the
old conventions and finding

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:02.970
something new, taking apart
the idea of show business,

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:04.330
confronting the audience.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.340
Which is not a new
idea at all.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.120
It was also my idea
of art history.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:13.160
I thought of myself as a Dadaist
in the tradition of

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:17.420
Hugo Ball and all those guys
that came out of the aftermath

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.780
of World War I.

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.500
RYAN GERMICK: Sounds like the
perfect set for children's

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:20.980
television.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.880
WAYNE WHITE: Perfect.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.110
Right up kids' alley.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:27.300
Everybody wants to know about a
dystopian future, you know?

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.110
RYAN GERMICK: Right.

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:28.780
Right.

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.540
What was that transition?

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.910
Who was the visionary that
pulled all of you crazies in?

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:34.330
WAYNE WHITE: Well, I kept
doing those puppet

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:36.320
shows on the side.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:38.230
And everybody thought I
was crazy to do it.

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:41.890
And lo and behold, that puppet
show experience got me the job

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:43.450
on "Pee Wee's Playhouse."

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:47.620
And that's another lesson I
impart to young artists, or

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:49.530
people who want to
be an artist.

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:51.570
Everybody thought I was
nuts to do that, to do

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:52.590
those puppet shows.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.150
They kept trying to give me all
this common sense advice--

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:56.370
Wayne, focus.

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:58.180
Be a graphic artist.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.080
Be an Illustrator.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.190
Go where the money is.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:01.410
Use your sense.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:03.870
Quit playing with dolls
all the time.

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:07.950
But lo and behold, what
everybody thought was a crazy

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:11.880
waste of time led to the most
money I ever made and led to

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.650
the best career I ever had.

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:16.840
That crazy, playing with doll
impulse led me to a house in

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.970
Los Angeles and raising
two kids.

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:24.660
So don't discount your secret
love that you might be a

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.390
little bit embarrassed
or ashamed to do.

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:28.480
I mean, that's part of--
the title of the

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.050
movie comes from that.

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:33.080
Often, what we love is
a guilty pleasure.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:37.110
Or we're afraid to expose our
true, vulnerable self through

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:38.460
the things we love.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:41.830
And we're embarrassed, often, by
the things we love, or the

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:44.900
things we really want to do.

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.170
But truth is beauty.

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.350
And beauty is embarrassing.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.370
Don't be embarrassed by it.

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:53.190
It's kind of like giving you
permission to wear your heart

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:54.890
on your sleeve.

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:57.140
And this culture does not want
you to wear your heart on your

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.950
sleeve, especially when
you're young.

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.250
The prototype for the young is,
be wised up and cynical

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.020
and world-weary.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.060
RYAN GERMICK: What's
up with that--

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.990
WAYNE WHITE: Don't go around so
wide-eyed, you're going to

00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.170
get the crap knocked out
of you, you know?

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:12.840
Build that shell and keep
building layers on that shell.

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.590
Wise up.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:17.380
RYAN GERMICK: So like with the
kind of hipster mentality is

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.400
sort of like a very
self-serious--

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.150
kind of the opposite
of punk, in a way.

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.480
WAYNE WHITE: The hipster
mentality is mostly full of

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.470
crap, because they don't
respect the wide-eyed

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.030
enthusiasm of the artist.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:31.230
You're supposed to be all
world-weary and depressed.

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.460
And that's supposed to be
a cool thing to do.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.920
Well, I've been depressed.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.600
There's nothing cool about
being depressed.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.790
True depression is a
shameful way to be.

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.900
And it's anti-life.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.073
But back to your question, who
pulled it all together?

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:51.250
Paul Reubens pulled
it all together.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:53.850
Paul Reubens was our champion.

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:56.500
He had just come off the movie
"Pee Wee's Big Adventure," Tim

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.040
Burton's first feature.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.790
And he was hot as a pistol.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:05.110
And he had the power that
celebrity can give you.

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:08.450
And also, he was the rare
combination of a celebrity who

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:11.020
totally understood art and
the creative spirit.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.650
And he championed us.

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:14.580
He protected us from
the network.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.830
And also, a woman named Judy
Price, who was in charge of

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:20.950
children's programming,
had the same rebel

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:22.560
spirit that he did.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.960
And they both protected
us from the network.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.700
Usually, networks kill
everything with their notes

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:31.190
and their meddling and their
worrying about making money

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:31.980
and whatnot.

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.700
But we were in our own
protective bubble.

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.550
And that's the power
of the show.

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:40.030
It was a downtown New York art
project done by people all new

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:43.160
to Hollywood, a bunch of
underground cartoonists,

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.610
painters, and sculptors.

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:47.100
And it just happened to be a New
York art project that got

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.460
on national television.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:50.690
And that's exactly its power.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:51.800
RYAN GERMICK: Awesome.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.240
Next slide.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.520
WAYNE WHITE: And, of
course, the genius

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.370
of the Pee Wee character.

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:56.740
I mean, what a great
character.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.240
He deserves to be right up there
with Buster Keaton and

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.250
all the greats.

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.280
RYAN GERMICK: So we have a
couple slides of your drawings

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.170
from the time.

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:07.135
Talk about-- where did
Randy come from?

00:29:07.135 --> 00:29:09.210
WAYNE WHITE: Well, Randy-- all
the characters were already on

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:10.340
paper when I came along.

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:14.140
I didn't invent the concepts,
but I did invent the visuals.

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:19.300
And Randy, of course, is a
classic redheaded bully.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.590
I was bullied by a redhead
in school.

00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:23.965
And I originally wanted (IN
SOUTHERN ACCENT) Randy to have

00:29:23.965 --> 00:29:26.130
a southern accent.

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:28.174
But no, they wanted to go with
this classic, (DOING CHARACTER

00:29:28.174 --> 00:29:30.670
VOICE) yeah, kind of Bowery
boys kind of thing.

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:32.550
So I went with that.

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:33.660
RYAN GERMICK: You were
also the voice--

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.728
WAYNE WHITE: I was the-- (DOING
CHARACTER VOICE) yeah,

00:29:34.728 --> 00:29:35.564
I was the voice.

00:29:35.564 --> 00:29:38.200
Yeah, smoking's cool,
boys and girls.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:45.330
And he's the classic bully that
we've all confronted.

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:48.260
I mean, one of the classic
redheaded bullies in cinema is

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:53.800
the kid from "A Christmas
Story." But I

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.840
wasn't thinking of him.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.610
I was thinking of my own
personal experience.

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:58.350
But I was delighted to see that

00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.640
particular redheaded bully.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.600
That's another cultural
icon, that kid.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.530
RYAN GERMICK: What is it about
redheads that makes them such

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:05.680
bad people?

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.505
WAYNE WHITE: Well, are there
any gingers here today?

00:30:09.505 --> 00:30:11.010
RYAN GERMICK: I'm
just kidding.

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:12.380
WAYNE WHITE: I don't know.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:13.590
It's just-- red.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:15.470
You know, seeing red.

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:19.430
Red is the flag of danger.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:20.900
Plus, they have freckles.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:25.260
And freckles on a puppet
are always fun to do.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.390
RYAN GERMICK: We look forward
to the comments on

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:27.540
the video from that.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:30.280
WAYNE WHITE: And Randy also
represents the return to a

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.380
classic puppet look that we
wanted to bring to "Pee Wee's

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:33.645
Playhouse."

00:30:33.645 --> 00:30:34.110
RYAN GERMICK: It looks--

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:35.910
Howdy Doody seems like
a reference there.

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:37.440
WAYNE WHITE: Howdy Doody,
the great Peter

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:40.230
Baird, the Jerry Mahoney--

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:42.640
hard surfaces on puppets.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.730
The Muppets had ruled the roost
for so long with that

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:49.550
plush toy, felt, and ping-pong
ball aesthetic that everybody

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:50.710
and their brother had copied.

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:51.790
I love the Muppets.

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:53.960
Jim Henson was a great genius.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:57.220
But man, they had cornered
the market on puppets.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.280
And we wanted to bring back a
more classic puppet look.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.870
And Randy was a classic
example of that.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:04.070
RYAN GERMICK: Another
character you

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:06.430
worked on was Mr. Kite.

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:07.900
WAYNE WHITE: Yes. (DOING VOICE)
Yes, and I was also the

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.060
voice of Mr. Kite.

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:12.100
Rain, Pee Wee, rain.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:17.720
And of course, at the time, I
was so ambitious and eager, I

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.420
worked harder--

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.595
That's another quality
of mine.

00:31:21.595 --> 00:31:24.070
I was a horrible student.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:25.370
I didn't listen to
the teacher.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:26.660
I cased the room.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.240
OK, who's the best
one in here?

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.510
OK, I'm going to beat you.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:33.430
It was always a competition
with me in a classroom.

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:34.535
I wanted to be the best.

00:31:34.535 --> 00:31:37.100
And I wanted to figure out how
to beat everybody else.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.350
That's what my sports background
has taught me.

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:41.170
Maybe a little too
competitive.

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:46.080
And in that spirit of
competition, I did like 50

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.090
pages of drawings
of Mr. Kites.

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:48.610
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah,
I wondered--

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:49.160
I saw the numbers.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.100
It's like 454.

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.080
Are those really sequential?

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.800
WAYNE WHITE: I would go
overboard with the drawing and

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.460
the ideas, making sure that I
was running circles around

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.320
everybody in the room.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.670
I might not have been the best
drawer or the most talent, but

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:05.830
I was damn sure going to
be the hardest worker.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:09.440
And so I drew the
hell out of--

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:11.530
and it wound up being the
simplest thing possible, of

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.940
course, after all my ideas.

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:17.730
And so this is a good example
of the design process.

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:21.590
But it's also a good example of
my over-reaching attitude.

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:24.340
And my overworking attitude.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.650
Which is a good thing to have.

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:27.310
I mean, that's another thing.

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:29.290
If you're not the most talented
in the room, make

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:31.330
sure you're the hardest
working in the room.

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:33.740
It'll get you somewhere.

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:37.510
RYAN GERMICK: Next over there is
a clip from the movie, that

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:40.260
I kind of cut up about "Pee
Wee." Let's check it out.

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:41.655
That was great.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.060
RYAN GERMICK: I would
like that DVD.

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:48.380
Of the Pee Wee Herman that no
one ever saw. "Pee Wee" show.

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.015
WAYNE WHITE: Well, hopefully
it's going to be on the extras

00:32:50.015 --> 00:32:52.180
on the DVD that comes
out in February.

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.500
For the movie.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:54.760
RYAN GERMICK: Awesome.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:57.250
So this is one of the
word paintings.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:02.500
So to summarize, I guess, you
had a really successful run in

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.950
Hollywood with "Pee Wee" and
"Beakman's World" and a bunch

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.510
of other shows.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:09.910
And then you kind
of burnt out.

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:10.410
Fair to say?

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:11.430
WAYNE WHITE: Yes.

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:13.180
The typical Hollywood story.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:15.470
I was overworked.

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:20.160
I was over-saturated with doing
kid shows and puppets.

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.520
I was typed as the wacky
kid show guy.

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:27.330
And I just needed a
break from it all.

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:29.880
That's where my depression
came in.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.480
I was exhausted physically.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.300
And, like I said, that thing
about working harder than

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:39.590
anybody in the room, it
has its liabilities.

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:42.280
And I literally worked
myself into a rut.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.050
Into a hole.

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:44.990
And I had to get out
of that hole.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:47.470
And so I thought I would
return to painting.

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:52.450
But I wanted to do a 180 from
this cartoon expressionism.

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:55.880
And I wanted to not return to
the abstract expressionism I

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:58.340
was taught in undergraduate
school.

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.620
So I taught myself traditional
painting techniques.

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:03.337
I started looking at Winslow
Homer and Thomas Eakins and

00:34:03.337 --> 00:34:05.210
the Hudson River
Valley school.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.200
I bought a book about
how to paint

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.130
traditional oil paintings.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:11.610
And I started doing these
history paintings.

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:14.300
Again, hearkening back to my
Chattanooga childhood--

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.760
the Civil War, the
Cherokee Indians.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.550
The scenic beauty
of the place.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:21.860
And I was doing these very
traditional kind of history

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:25.290
paintings with kind of
weird psychological

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:26.989
undertones to them.

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:30.580
And I was buying thrift store
paintings just for the frames.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:35.360
And the paintings started
getting a little more surreal,

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:38.000
but they were still
traditionally painted.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.659
And I thought one day,
I'm going to put

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:41.040
words into the painting.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.500
Into a landscape.

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:45.150
And I picked out one
of the thrift store

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:47.210
landscapes for the frame.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:50.560
And right before I kicked the
cheap reproduction out, I

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:53.400
thought, what about if I just
painted on the landscape that

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.100
was already in there.

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:57.878
It would save a lot of time.

00:34:57.878 --> 00:35:05.410
And so on a moment's whim,
sponta-- spontane--

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.586
I can't say words today.

00:35:07.586 --> 00:35:11.640
Spontaneously, I painted the
words into the already

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.380
pre-existing cheap landscape
reproduction.

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.670
And thus was born a series that
I call "word paintings."

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:20.200
And maybe that's how you
first knew of me.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:25.480
That's certainly my most
notorious body of work.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.400
And it's how I got into
the fine arts world.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.310
I'm still painting them today.

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:32.560
RYAN GERMICK: I want to just
give you a shout-out, because

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.186
there's some really beautiful
technical stuff going on with

00:35:35.186 --> 00:35:35.460
the paintings.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:38.250
The lighting on the letters and
the ripples in the water.

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.380
It's really well done.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:40.350
WAYNE WHITE: Thank you.

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:43.560
That was from the years of
self-study of oil painting

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.470
techniques.

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:50.330
And doing traditional type
of rendering it in paint.

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.340
These are in acrylic,
but acrylic is

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:55.870
just fake oil paint.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:58.110
And I only use landscape
reproductions.

00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.630
I don't paint on originals.

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:02.140
Originals have too much of
a human smell on them.

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:05.420
Plus, that would be an act of
defacement, because then that

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.350
original is gone forever.

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:10.140
These reproductions are just
empty commodities.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:13.180
There's thousands, maybe even
millions, of these things.

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.880
And they're like
an empty stage.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.220
There's no real art there.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:18.140
There's no human presence.

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:22.170
But they are a beautiful setting
for these words.

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:24.350
And I don't think of
them as defacement.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:27.290
I think of them as collaboration
with the artist.

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:31.200
Because I respect his color
palette, his sense of light.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.200
The environmental--

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.730
I try to get the shadows and
everything just right.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:36.790
So it's a bit of a collaboration
with these

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:40.430
long-dead masters of this
sofa art genre.

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:43.430
And of course, I discovered--

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:46.850
what began as just a jokey
gesture deepened as I started

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:48.130
to look at it.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:49.590
It references so many things--

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:54.160
Americana, the sense
of the past.

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.630
It's using these objects that
everybody can relate to.

00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:00.090
They've all seen these paintings
at granny's house or

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:01.240
in their own house.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.490
Or at the dentist's office.

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:06.110
They're a ubiquitous part of
American culture, these

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:08.230
prevalent, kitschy things.

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:10.240
So there's that reference
point.

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.330
There's art history
references.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:15.060
And of course, there's the layer
of humor I bring to it.

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:18.000
So they were very resonant in a
way that I never planned in

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.210
a million years.

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:21.590
And I think a lot of the
best discoveries and

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:24.340
ideas happen that way.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:27.480
They just kind of bubble up
from your subconscious.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:32.660
And you can't pre-plan art.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.500
It's being in the moment.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.360
The creative act is not
an act of analysis.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.400
It's just listening to some
weird gut-- or some weird

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.130
voice inside of yourself.

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:46.460
And these are a testament
to that.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:48.766
RYAN GERMICK: I think we have
a couple more to check out.

00:37:48.766 --> 00:37:49.500
WAYNE WHITE: Yes.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:53.410
This one's called "Just a
Picture/ Shunned by Scholars/

00:37:53.410 --> 00:38:00.710
Now it Costs $10,000." And
that's my tribute to the old

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:02.860
Burma-Shave signs.

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.880
I'm sure a lot of you don't--

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.160
ever heard of that.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.050
But people of a certain age--

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:09.940
I'm a little too young, even.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:13.060
But in the early '50s, there was
a series of advertisements

00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:15.500
by the side of the road,
rhyming signs--

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:18.290
like every 50 yards would to
be a sign and they rhymed.

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:21.360
And then the payoff would
be, Burma Shave!

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.930
It was a nice little piece
of sequential art by

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:24.640
the side of the road.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.810
And I always loved that.

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:28.400
And we had our own versions of
it down in Chattanooga with

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.320
tourist traps, especially the
Georgia Game Park. "See

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.120
three-headed dog." "See
blah blah blah."

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.130
But it didn't rhyme.

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:37.080
This is a direct reference to
the Burma Shave campaigns.

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:42.400
And I'm a big fan of roadside
attractions and Americana.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.430
And early motels and
advertising.

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:49.240
And anything that has to do with
roadside America, I love.

00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:52.670
And it's, of course, a sly
dig at the pretensions of

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:55.810
high and low art.

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:58.740
I don't know if it's
sly or not.

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.240
RYAN GERMICK: This one--

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.250
WAYNE WHITE: This is a series
of works I did where I would

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:09.550
pour paint on the picture, let
it puddle and dry, and then I

00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:10.280
would look at it.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.170
Then I would tell you
what it looks like.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:16.780
To me, that looked like the
profile of Norman Rockwell.

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:17.680
RYAN GERMICK: I can see that.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.250
The long neck, kind of
like turtle head.

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:19.860
WAYNE WHITE: Yeah.

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:22.650
You know, we've all seen those
pictures of him leaning over

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:24.650
with a pipe in his
mouth painting.

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:28.140
See the nose and the
big cranium.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.120
And I did five or
six of those.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.320
Didn't sell a one.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.060
Nobody liked these.

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:33.750
I love them.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:37.670
Again, it's commenting on the
pretensions of art and how

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:39.220
people really look at art.

00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:40.830
None of us--

00:39:40.830 --> 00:39:42.200
come on, admit it.

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.020
You look at an abstract painting
and after a while,

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.401
you start going, hey, that
looks like a dog.

00:39:47.401 --> 00:39:49.800
And it's about cloud gazing.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.470
We all love to find shapes.

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:54.960
We all love to impose our
meaning on the world, a world

00:39:54.960 --> 00:40:00.020
that's really scientifically
chaotic, indifferent, and

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:01.710
couldn't care if we
lived or died.

00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:05.640
Yet, we want to impose our human
qualities on that world.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.750
We're constantly trying to find
narrative and meaning in

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:11.500
accidents and chaos
and in nature.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:16.100
And that's what that's
reflective on, both our

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.610
instinctive view of
the world and the

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:20.230
pretensions of high art.

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:21.500
And it's funny, I think.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.860
WAYNE WHITE: Yes. "The Most
Expensive Painting in the

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:30.540
World." Hyperbole is funny.

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.440
That painting, too,
is about that big.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:36.080
RYAN GERMICK: It should
be encased behind

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:36.590
like six inches of--

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:37.720
WAYNE WHITE: Yes, like
the Mona Lisa.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.340
RYAN GERMICK: --bullet-proof
glass.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:39.760
WAYNE WHITE: Absolutely.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.460
So that's, again, just
a pot shot at the

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.910
pretensions of the world.

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:47.190
The insane economy of art.

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:50.880
The insane way things
accrue value.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:51.920
You know.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:52.245
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah.

00:40:52.245 --> 00:40:54.930
I mean, back to my
plasma-cutting pizza

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:56.080
experience.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.320
It also became clear to me
pretty early on living in New

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:03.920
York as a Midwestern teenager
that the gallery art system is

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:07.010
no less ridiculous than
shlubbing to the Village Voice

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:09.250
to drop off your editorial
illustration portfolio.

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:10.120
WAYNE WHITE: Yes.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.280
And again, it's all
about being--

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.770
the art world is fashion.

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:17.450
And we all know how
absurd fashion is.

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:19.470
I mean, if you look to "The
New York Times" fashion

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:22.190
supplement magazine, it's
the most ridiculous

00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:23.250
thing in the world.

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:25.150
Who wears those fashions?

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:25.770
Nobody does.

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:27.630
I don't understand fashion.

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:33.660
These men strutting down the
catwalk wearing, like, Speedos

00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.240
with a fur jacket.

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.670
And they're taking
it seriously.

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:38.840
It's all done with
a straight face.

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:43.330
And it's so offensive to human
nature, fashion is.

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:45.490
I have another painting, it's
called "Good-looking People

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:48.530
Having Fun Without You." That's
the number one message

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:49.960
of the media.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.880
That's the number one message
of the media.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.300
Look what you missed.

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.360
Look what you are missing
out on, loser.

00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:59.110
You better buy this watch or
these shoes or this jacket to

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:01.430
get in on the party that
you're missing out on.

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:03.680
And you never find that
party your whole life.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.780
Even the people at the party
aren't at that party.

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:13.130
There's this mythic,
unattainable, super sexy,

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:17.280
super cool ideal that capitalist
culture creates and

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.530
drives us forward by our nose.

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:21.280
And it's bullshit.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.810
And we live our lives with this

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:26.350
insecurity because of that.

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:31.750
And I think that's a sacred
mission, is to knock down

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:33.080
those false idols.

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:35.790
The emperor's new clothes
kind of thing.

00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:38.600
To break through that and unite
us in the fact that

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:42.410
we're all just these vulnerable
creatures.

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:47.760
And that's just crap just to get
you to spend your money.

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.210
RYAN GERMICK: I am with you.

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:51.800
But I saw the show that was at
the San Francisco de Young

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.490
Museum recently for Jean
Paul Gaultier.

00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:55.850
That guy's pretty on point.

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:58.250
WAYNE WHITE: Well, you know what
There's geniuses in the

00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:58.870
fashion world.

00:42:58.870 --> 00:43:02.180
Again, I take these polemical
points and it sounds--

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:04.770
I do that for the rhetoric
and the passion.

00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:07.950
And to reach out on an
emotional level.

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:10.430
But everything is super
complicated.

00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:12.590
I can't hit on all the points.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:14.750
I just have rhetoric.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:22.980
But fashion is an ingenious,
fascinating visual form.

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:26.690
And there's elegance
and beauty to it.

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:27.700
RYAN GERMICK: And even
humor sometimes.

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:28.450
WAYNE WHITE: And humor.

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:28.780
There's everything there.

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:30.310
RYAN GERMICK: But most of the
time it's pretty ridiculous.

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:34.120
WAYNE WHITE: But it's really in
the hands of money makers.

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.960
I'm not belittling any fashion
designer or anybody who's

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.640
interested in it, but it gets
in the hands of the money

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:40.900
makers and they ruin it.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:44.390
Money makers always
ruin everything.

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:46.140
But we all gotta
make money too.

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.290
Again, another, like--

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:52.040
you can't take any position in
this world without it having a

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.440
direct opposite.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.820
I'm finding that out as I go
around and become more of a

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:57.730
public speaker.

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:00.410
I'm often caught up in the heat
of my rhetoric, and I'm

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:03.320
thinking, you know, somebody
could debate me down to the

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:04.350
ground on this.

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:07.560
But I'm trying to hit these
emotional points that we all

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:08.690
can relate to.

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:09.866
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah.

00:44:09.866 --> 00:44:11.600
What do we got-- what's
our next one?

00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.040
So it looks like--

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:13.785
WAYNE WHITE: It got crazy.

00:44:13.785 --> 00:44:14.670
RYAN GERMICK: It got crazy.

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:15.150
WAYNE WHITE: Yeah.

00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:18.070
I got tired of the straight
ahead text.

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:21.325
I simply wanted to do
variations, and see how far I

00:44:21.325 --> 00:44:22.160
could push it.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:26.320
These are words made out of
a cartoon Western town.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:29.380
You know, why not?

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:32.790
And it literally says, "all
an act." There's an A

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:34.340
laying on its side.

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:38.550
There's an L, another L, an A,
the C reaching up into the

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:41.320
buggy, and then the last T.

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:44.020
And I was literally trying to
push the idea of typography as

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:45.250
far as I could go.

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:48.960
And take the street, a Western
cartoon-like tourist town

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.690
street that you'd see, you
know, in a comic book.

00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:56.340
And use those as the post and
lintels of typography.

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:57.176
RYAN GERMICK: Yeah.

00:44:57.176 --> 00:44:58.430
Cool.

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:02.300
So I just keep trying to
push the limits and the

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:03.940
possibilities of typography.

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:07.110
I think typography is
a great art form.

00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:09.710
And worthy of--

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:10.820
I'm sure a lot of you--

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:12.780
of course, Google is
built on the--

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:15.440
a lot of the Google image
is about typography.

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.353
It's an incredible topic,
inexhaustible.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:26.060
RYAN GERMICK: This is now
actually a physical object.

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:27.560
WAYNE WHITE: It's an
aluminum cut-out.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:31.670
Laser-cut aluminum that
floats about two

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:32.740
inches from the wall.

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:36.170
It says, "let's have a smirking
contest." That's

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:38.850
another condition of society.

00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:41.800
You were talking about earlier
with hipsters.

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.500
It seems like the default
position of our

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:47.130
society is the smirk.

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:50.130
If you're smirking,
you're cool, man.

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:52.030
You're ready for all comers.

00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:53.910
You got your guard up.

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:55.960
Everything's bullshit.

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.560
I'm going to smirk
about everything.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.040
I'm cool.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.560
I'm too cool to believe
in anything.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.870
Nihilism seems to be the
default position of our

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:05.640
society in so many ways.

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:09.030
And the intellectual challenges
seem to be who can

00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.980
be the smirkiest.

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:12.230
Or who can be the most
disbelieving.

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:14.360
Who can cut each
other the most.

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:20.400
It's a cruel world.

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.076
And why?

00:46:23.076 --> 00:46:26.040
Why?

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:29.460
But it's also funny too. "Let's
have a smirk--" that

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:31.230
seems to boil it all down.

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:36.140
When two hipsters meet, it's
a smirking contest.

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:39.730
But on a technical, visual
level, this reflects my love

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:42.040
of sculpture and objecthood.

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:45.920
And literally taking the words
out of the context and making

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.110
them a sculptural object.

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:49.430
And I love painted metal.

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:50.990
This is like painted aluminum.

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:52.310
Acrylic on aluminum.

00:46:52.310 --> 00:46:52.960
RYAN GERMICK: So I
think we have--

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.810
next is one more clip, where it
kind of brings it home back

00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:58.150
to Tennessee with one of
your good friends--

00:46:58.150 --> 00:47:00.340
so we'll watch this--

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:03.212
and a project that
you did with him.

00:47:03.212 --> 00:47:05.116
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:05.116 --> 00:47:06.544
WAYNE WHITE: Thank you.

00:47:06.544 --> 00:47:08.620
RYAN GERMICK: Well, I just want
to thank you so much for

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:11.210
bringing so many of your
ideas to life.

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:13.220
And letting them come alive and
sharing with them with us

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:14.460
and sharing them
with the world.

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:15.080
WAYNE WHITE: My pleasure.

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:17.170
It's great to be
here at Google.

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:18.270
RYAN GERMICK: It's been
great to talk to you.

00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:23.200
And if anybody has questions,
there's a mic in the center.

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:26.560
And you can ask Wayne whatever's
on your mind.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:27.020
WAYNE WHITE: Come on up.

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:28.010
Please.

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:29.856
Make me look good.

00:47:29.856 --> 00:47:30.750
RYAN GERMICK: What do you got?

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:31.702
What do you got?

00:47:31.702 --> 00:47:32.998
WAYNE WHITE: No?

00:47:32.998 --> 00:47:34.292
RYAN GERMICK: Can't tell if
they're leaving or if they're

00:47:34.292 --> 00:47:35.352
going to come up.

00:47:35.352 --> 00:47:37.170
Oh, here we go.

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:38.420
JULIE: Hi.

00:47:38.420 --> 00:47:39.070
I'm Julie.

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:39.960
WAYNE WHITE: Hi, Julie.

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:44.140
JULIE: And I want to know, how
did Neil find you or decide to

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:46.520
make a documentary about you?

00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:48.900
WAYNE WHITE: Well, I met Neil
12 years ago, when he was a

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.230
young punk right out
of Oklahoma.

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:54.570
He was an unpaid intern at this
design company where I

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:55.730
was working.

00:47:55.730 --> 00:48:00.450
And I paid no attention
to him at all.

00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:02.060
I just thought, please,
get away--

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:04.040
give me a sandwich, you know?

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.430
And 12 years later, he
owns that company.

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:08.390
That's his company now.

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:11.610
That's the kind of
guy Neil is.

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:14.870
But three years ago, when my
book came out, that was edited

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:19.700
and produced by Todd Oldham,
he got together with me and

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.320
said, hey, you're hot
property now, man.

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:22.520
You've got this book.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:24.270
You're in Esquire magazine.

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:25.900
Let's do a short film.

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:30.250
And that short film grew
into a feature film.

00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:32.780
And here we are three
years later.

00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:35.370
So that's how I met Neil.

00:48:35.370 --> 00:48:38.570
And three years ago, I really
didn't know him still.

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:40.810
I thought of him as that young
kid from Oklahoma.

00:48:40.810 --> 00:48:43.260
And our friendship grew
as this movie grew.

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:46.060
And the movie grew organically
out of our friendship.

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:48.420
I think that's one of the
powers of the movie.

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:50.080
There was no set agenda.

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:53.210
There was no M.O. There was
no outline, no script--

00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:53.890
nothing.

00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:55.740
We just kind of played
it by ear.

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:58.980
And it reflects our growing
familiarity with each other.

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.830
And his discovery of me.

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:06.550
Plus, like a lot of people in
their '30s, my work had a big

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:08.670
influence on him , through
"Pee Wee's Playhouse,"

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:10.797
"Beakman's World," the Smashing
Pumpkins video, et

00:49:10.797 --> 00:49:12.170
cetera, et cetera.

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:15.480
So he was naturally curious
because I had this famous

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:18.190
stuff I did, but our
friendship was

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:19.540
reflected in that.

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.594
And my personal life came
out through him.

00:49:21.594 --> 00:49:23.470
JULIE: That's awesome.

00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:26.540
Elaine, his sister, is one
of my best friends.

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:28.750
So she wanted me to tell you
that she says you have

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:29.800
beautiful eyes.

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.590
Which you do.

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:33.270
RYAN GERMICK: Too beautiful
to be captured on

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:34.780
film by some cameras.

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:36.030
JULIE: Exactly.

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:38.960
Thank you.

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.390
WAYNE WHITE: Thank
you very much.

00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:44.540
I don't why Elaine couldn't
tell me that in person.

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:47.220
JULIE: We were on the phone on
Friday and she was going to--

00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:49.460
I was trying to talk her
into flying here.

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:51.990
And she was about ready to
buy her ticket and come.

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:53.170
WAYNE WHITE: Oh, well
that's very nice.

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:54.875
Thanks for relating
that information.

00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:58.430
Yeah.

00:49:58.430 --> 00:49:59.410
Thank you.

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:00.660
Come up.

00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:04.180
CHRIS: My name's Chris.

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:05.942
WAYNE WHITE: Hi, Chris.

00:50:05.942 --> 00:50:09.070
CHRIS: I'm just curious where
you think you might be headed

00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:11.810
next in terms of creative
endeavors.

00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:14.860
I know you're still working on
the paintings, I'm guessing.

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:15.510
WAYNE WHITE: Yes.

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:18.150
The paintings are an ongoing
project of mine that

00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:19.710
I see no end to.

00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:23.560
But the thing that I really am
interested in is big museum

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:27.050
installations, bigger
scaled things.

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:28.120
Did we see the--

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.110
yeah, there was a large George
Jones puppet head

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:32.240
laying on its side.

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.260
That's the kind of commissions
and the kind of projects I'm

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:36.760
continuing to work on.

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.620
I just did a big thing
down in Virginia

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:40.180
at the Taubman Museum.

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:42.910
I'm negotiating with my hometown
of Chattanooga to do

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:45.570
a large public work
of the words in an

00:50:45.570 --> 00:50:47.510
actual Tennessee landscape.

00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:48.640
So I want to scale--

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.710
and, as you saw,
the big puppet.

00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:51.930
I'm going to be doing
some of those in

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:54.190
Orange County next year.

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:57.900
Yeah, I want to scale it up and
work on a larger scale.

00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:01.845
And work on the museum
level kind of things.

00:51:01.845 --> 00:51:02.250
CHRIS: Awesome.

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:02.630
Thank you.

00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:04.082
WAYNE WHITE: Thank you.

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:08.390
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:09.420
WAYNE WHITE: Hi.

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:10.530
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:12.850
Smashing Pumpkins video.

00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:16.670
How did you decide on the
creative direction for that?

00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:18.760
WAYNE WHITE: Well, the concept
again, just like "Pee Wee,"

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:21.250
was already on paper
when I came along.

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:24.050
They had that new album,
"Melancholy and the Infinite

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:28.000
Sadness." And the graphics on
the album were very Victorian

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.050
and antique.

00:51:29.050 --> 00:51:32.860
So they wanted something
appropriately antique and 19th

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:34.580
century for the look.

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:38.320
And they hit upon the idea of
George Melies' film "A Trip to

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:41.380
the Moon." So that was
already on paper.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:45.100
And the directors, Jonathan
Dayton and Valerie Faris.

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:46.630
Were friends of mine.

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:48.210
We'd always wanted
to work together.

00:51:48.210 --> 00:51:50.220
And they were familiar with the
history paintings I had

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:51.110
been doing.

00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:53.260
I hadn't really started the
word paintings yet.

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:58.570
So they knew I had a love of
19th century techniques and

00:51:58.570 --> 00:52:02.490
that whole antiquated
kind of look.

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:07.550
And I love history, I'm a
big student of history.

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:08.730
And I loved Melies.

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:11.670
I already had a big picture book
of his that I pored over

00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:12.620
constantly.

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:14.880
So it was a happy coincidence
that I could get

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:17.490
together and do that.

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:20.070
Again, and then I went crazy
on the concept and did a

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:23.270
million versions
of every scene.

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:25.120
So that's how that was born.

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:26.560
AUDIENCE: Were you helping
to actually build the

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:27.530
props and the sets?

00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:29.840
WAYNE WHITE: I did build a
few of the actual props--

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.843
the moon ship that I'm holding
in the scene where I break it

00:52:32.843 --> 00:52:34.200
and it falls apart.

00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:36.960
I built that and a couple
of the smaller puppets.

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:38.540
But mainly, I did these

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:40.250
elaborate production paintings.

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:42.650
And I gave them to set builders
and they built the

00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:45.200
sets from those.

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:45.935
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:45.935 --> 00:52:48.210
WAYNE WHITE: You're welcome.

00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:49.490
We're losing them.

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:50.250
RYAN GERMICK: All right.

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:51.770
WAYNE WHITE: All right,
anyone else?

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:54.360
RYAN GERMICK: Going
once, going twice.

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:56.190
Wayne, it was awesome
to have you here.

00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:57.240
WAYNE WHITE: It was
great to be here.

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.200
RYAN GERMICK: Come
back any time.

00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:58.524
WAYNE WHITE: Thanks
for having me.

00:52:58.524 --> 00:52:59.110
Thank you very much.

00:52:59.110 --> 00:53:00.487
RYAN GERMICK: Check
out the movie.

00:53:00.487 --> 00:53:03.700
WAYNE WHITE: Thank you.

00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.110
A couple of quick things.

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:07.710
There's a brand new app out
right now called "Words with

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:10.270
Wayne." You can take
your photograph,

00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:11.950
type in your phrase.

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:14.570
It'll come up as giant,
monumental block letters in

00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:15.670
the landscape.

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:17.160
It's a lot of fun to use.

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.830
A lot of fun to play
around with.

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:23.390
Go to beautyisembarrassing.com
for a complete list of all the

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:25.940
theaters that "Beauty Is
Embarrassing" is going to play

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:27.780
at all through the fall.

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:30.380
And the ones that I'm going to
be making an appearance at.

00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:33.580
Especially in Berkeley,
San Francisco, San

00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:36.540
Jose, and Santa Cruz.

00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:39.270
That's coming up this weekend.

00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:40.980
Go to waynewhite.com.

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:43.730
There's all kinds of great
merchandising stuff there.

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:46.510
And there's only 200 of my
books left in the world.

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:48.380
So that's one of the last
places you can get them.

00:53:48.380 --> 00:53:49.610
You can buy one there.

00:53:49.610 --> 00:53:50.510
I'll sign it to you.

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:53.430
I'll do a drawing in the book.

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:54.010
RYAN GERMICK: There
you go, being the

00:53:54.010 --> 00:53:55.770
hardest working guy again.

00:53:55.770 --> 00:53:56.150
WAYNE WHITE: Yeah.

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:58.270
I'm going doodle-doodle-doo.

00:53:58.270 --> 00:54:00.550
Yeah, and please check
out the movie.

00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:02.500
I know you're all
creative people.

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:03.790
And it speaks to you.

00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:08.710
It's a story about the ups
and-- a little bit of the

00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:11.990
downs, but mostly the ups
about the creative life.

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.100
And.

00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:13.970
I think you're really
identify with it.

00:54:13.970 --> 00:54:16.840
I think it'll give you a shot in
the arm to watch the movie.

00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:18.800
It's my gift to creative
people.

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.380
So enjoy.

00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:23.180
Thank you very much
for having me.

00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:24.430
RYAN GERMICK: Thanks.
