PAUL NEWSON: You want to build
the next wildly popular app.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.045
But there's a bunch
of different places

00:00:04.045 --> 00:00:05.260
to store data in the Cloud.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.700
You're probably asking yourself,
where should I store my stuff?

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.600
Well, that depends.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.380
What does your stuff look like?

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.140
If it kind of
looks like a table,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.040
then Cloud Datastore
is the right fit.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.850
If it looks more like these
unstructured bags of bytes,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.960
the Cloud Storage is
where it should go.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.720
Most apps have
both types of data

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.530
and we use both of
these storage systems.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.980
Both give you
massive scalability

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.180
and zero administration.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.020
Both can be used by code running
on App Engine, Compute Engine,

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.460
or on your clients.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.710
With Cloud Datastore, you
get queries and transactions

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.060
without having to
find a scam upfront.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.050
Cloud Storage lets you
store as many blobs

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.252
as you want of practically
unlimited size.

00:00:40.252 --> 00:00:42.210
This combination does
most of what you'll need.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.920
So if you're writing
code from scratch,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.350
this is the place to start.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.050
Now, while the combination of
Cloud Datastore pulse Cloud

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.080
Storage is awesome,
and covers most needs,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.270
sometimes you'll need or want
something more specialized.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.240
Cloud Datastore is able to
provide massive scalability

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.030
by using a data model that is
different from the traditional

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.590
relational database model.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.990
This is sometimes
called a NoSQL database.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.450
If you need or want a
fully relational database,

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.510
Cloud SQL has you covered, with
a fully managed MySQL solution.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.630
If you need to perform ad hoc
analysis of massive data sets

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.887
with absolutely
jaw-dropping speed,

00:01:17.887 --> 00:01:19.970
you could load your data
from other Cloud products

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:20.970
into BigQuery.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.910
You owe it to yourself to
take BigQuery for a spin.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.570
You'll be amazed
at what it can do.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.760
It's built on the same
technology we use here

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.900
at Google to query
our data, which

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.890
is about as big
as big data gets.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.795
Maybe you're already
using a storage solution

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:35.545
you're happy with.

00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:38.090
In that case, it'll run
great on Compute Engine,

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.900
and can store it's data
on persistent disk.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.680
If you want to build an app
that interacts with user data

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.600
stored in Google Drive or
has awesome collaboration

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.810
features like you've
seen in Google Apps,

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.180
then you should check
out the Google Drive API.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.350
So where should you
store your stuff?

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.550
Start with Cloud Datastore
for structured data and Cloud

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.190
Storage for unstructured data.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.600
Then layer in the other storage
technologies as you need them.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.740
Need relational data?

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.590
Cloud SQL.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.540
Need analysis?

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:06.530
BigQuery.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.770
Already have a storage
solution you like?

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.280
Run it on Compute Engine
with persistent disk.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.960
Want collaborative editing?

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.840
Check out Google Drive.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.170
Now you know where
to store your stuff,

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.770
go build something great.
