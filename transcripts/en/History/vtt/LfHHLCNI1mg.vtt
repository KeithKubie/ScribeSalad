00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:03.002
KEVIN: Let's go find

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:05.922
Look at that.
That's like a ladder statue.

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:08.883
ROLI: Ladder art.

00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:10.385
On the right.

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:11.261
What is that?

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:12.554
KEVIN: It's a Rambler.

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:14.472
Yeah, that one, I
think we've seen.

00:00:14.472 --> 00:00:16.808
[music playing]

00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:19.602
That's kinda cool.

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:21.354
MAN: It has to be,
like, 50, right?

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:22.230
Like, mid 50s.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.773
KEVIN: Yeah, mid 50s.

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:25.066
Well, let's go check it out.

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.318
[music playing]

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:32.741
Hey, it has plates on it.

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:35.201
Maybe the truck drives.
You never know.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:36.578
KEVIN: You never know.

00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:38.163
It's in pretty good
shape though, I think.

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:40.623
[knocking]

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:42.333
How you doing?

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.334
ROLI: How you doing, man.

00:00:43.334 --> 00:00:45.128
I'm Kevin and this is Roli.

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:46.921
We were just looking
at that truck.

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:48.047
And see if it's for sale.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:02.729
Wow.

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:08.067
Did you say 40?

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:09.903
BOTH: 40,000?

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.571
Wow.

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.532
Roli and I are looking at
this awesome 1956 Ford truck.

00:01:14.532 --> 00:01:16.993
It's got a steep price tag,
but it might be worth it

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:17.786
if it's in great shape.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.749
Yeah?
- Ford tractor?

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.501
Nice.

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:28.087
NARRATOR: The 1956 Ford F 100
trucks are truly one of a kind.

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:30.548
That year, the body style
got some great upgrades,

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:33.134
including a new grill and
a wrap around windshield.

00:01:33.134 --> 00:01:35.470
The interior also saw some
great safety upgrades,

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.555
like seat belts and the new
Lifeguard steering wheel,

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:39.516
designed to put more
space between the driver

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.059
and the dash.

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:42.936
But this body style was
only produced for one year,

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:45.939
making these trucks
extremely hard to find.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.357
I don't know if I
can open this thing.

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:48.107
Let's see if I can get it.

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:53.655
Why don't you try
it right there.

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:55.657
This thing's real heavy.

00:01:55.657 --> 00:01:56.950
There you go.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.992
There it is.

00:01:57.992 --> 00:01:59.327
MAN: Look at that tractor motor.

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:01.788
ROLI: Straight six
tractor engine.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:02.539
Originally it's a V8.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.498
MAN: It was.

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:04.290
ROLI: It says it on there.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.708
MAN: It was a V8.

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:07.335
My grandfather blew it
up in his construction

00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:09.879
business driving up
to his mining claims

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.214
up in the mountains.

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:12.757
ROLI: But then this
one gave him power.

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:14.425
MAN: Well, this thing
climbs like a mountain goat.

00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:16.928
KEVIN: Yeah.
MAN: This one out climbs the V8.

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:17.971
It's just not as fast.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.138
But here's the important thing.

00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:20.181
You might want to
take come check

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:22.308
it out on this side over here.

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.936
We're not quite
sure of the stories,

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:25.979
but that's something that--

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.355
ROLI: That looks like a bullet.

00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:28.898
MAN: Yeah.

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:30.358
ROLI: It looks like someone
was aiming the driver.

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:31.693
MAN: Somebody was
shooting at grandpa.

00:02:31.693 --> 00:02:32.944
Yeah.

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:33.987
MAN: He had a lot
of enemies and he

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:34.821
took care of a lot of people.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:35.947
But this is strong.

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:37.782
Dad's looking to sell it.

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:39.534
ROLI: It's solid.

00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:41.703
MAN: It is solid and it doesn't
have any rust that I can tell.

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.121
I wouldn't lower it.

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.789
I wouldn't do anything
and putting crazy on it.

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.332
I would just paint it.

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.667
ROLI: Or just put
clear coat on it.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.043
Actually you could
just clear coat it.

00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:50.253
MAN: Yeah, I love
this look, myself.

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:51.671
ROLI: Yeah.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:52.505
KEVIN: You know, I'm a
just take quick pick.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:53.298
What was your name?

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:54.299
My name's Loren.

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.466
KEVIN: Thanks again, Loren.

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:56.342
We appreciate your
time, brother.

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:57.844
ROLI: Nice to meet you.

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:59.888
KEVIN: Man, this truck
has a really cool history.

00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:02.056
And I know it's very
special to the family.

00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:04.893
And I think that's why Loren's
dad has it priced so high.

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:08.605
But at $40,000, I don't know
how the shop can make a profit.

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:10.356
Danny would want
to keep this one.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.942
I think Roli and I will just
keep this one on the down low.

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:15.320
That's the first time I see
a bullet hole on a vehicle.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.321
I kind of like it, actually.
