00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.420
To help solidify our understanding
of how this process works,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.120
let's do an example.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.333
I want you to use the fast Fourier
transform to evaluate the polynomial

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:16.400
1+0x +x squared-x cubed at
the 4th roots of unity.
