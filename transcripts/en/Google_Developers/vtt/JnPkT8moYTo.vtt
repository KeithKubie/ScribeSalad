MARTIN OMANDER: Hi, welcome to
Root Access, the show on GDL

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.550
about startups.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.510
My name is Martin Omander,
and I work for

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.950
Google Developer Relations.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.070
And today, I'm joined by none
other than Don Dodge--

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.420
fellow Googler, longtime

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.220
investor, and startup advocate.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.830
Today, we'll handle
viewer questions.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.610
And thank you for all your
comments coming in on YouTube,

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.050
by the way.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.790
Keep them coming.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.640
We love them.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.190
Don, in our show about the
trends from the demo days,

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.840
recently for Y Combinator and
500 startups, you talked a

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.430
little about how investors
think.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.640
You said something like, it
doesn't matter if you lose $3

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.920
million or $8 million.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.440
And that sure got us a lot
of viewer comments.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.280
One viewer commented that this
reasoning is very troubling

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.610
and like that of a
gambling addict.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.200
Is that so?

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.900
DON DODGE: Well, yes, venture
capital investors

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.060
are gamblers by nature.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.040
But let's put the question
in context.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.840
The question was, if you invest
$100,000, does it

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.000
matter that the valuation is
5 million or 8 million?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.130
And my answer to that was no,
it really doesn't matter.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.920
Let me give you a
couple examples.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.050
Let's say you invest $100,000
in a startup, and the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.160
valuation is 5 million, and you
invest another $100,000 in

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.830
a startup that the valuation
is 8 million.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.740
Both startups go out
of business.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.300
You lose all of your money.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.520
Does it matter that the first
startup you invested the

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.320
100,000 in was 5 million
valuation versus 8?

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.420
No, because you lost
all of your money,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.670
so it doesn't matter.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.140
Conversely, let's say you
invested 100,000 in a startup

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.585
at 5 million and 8 million,
and it goes to a billion

00:01:47.585 --> 00:01:49.320
dollar valuation.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.835
Does it matter that you invested
one at 5 million and

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:55.840
one 8 million when the exit
value was a billion?

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.210
On the margins, maybe,
but generally, no.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.690
So it's counterintuitive, but
valuation is a very small

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.810
factor in your investment
decision.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.325
So that was the point
of the question.

00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:14.240
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, so owning
100% of zero or owning 50% of

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.630
zero, it's still zero.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.460
DON DODGE: That's right.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.580
MARTIN OMANDER: Got it.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.730
Another viewer, [? Hejaneh ?]

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.790
[? Moolay ?]--

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.490
and I'm sorry if I butchered
your name, there-- commented

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.920
that investors are like
racing goers.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.890
They go to the race.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.900
They see all these race horses
that are the startups, and

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.280
they place their bets and lose
many of the bets and hope to

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.470
win once or twice.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.260
Is that a good analogy?

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.410
DON DODGE: Yeah, I
think that works.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.650
Venture capital investing
is very risky,

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.710
and it is like gambling.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.840
And investors tend to
place multiple bets.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.780
Rather than go all in on one
company, they'll place bets on

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.360
multiple companies, or in this
case, multiple horses.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.320
And you know that you're going
to lose all of your money on

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.170
some of them, but the
expectation is that you'll

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.220
make 10 times your money or 100
times your money on one or

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.990
two of them and come out
very, very well.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.940
So yes, venture capital
investors tend to take big

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.660
risks and maybe be
like gamblers.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.100
As opposed to bankers, who when
you get a loan from a

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.770
bank, they're loaning against
assets, and they expect to

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.480
make 3% or 5% on their money.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.800
It's a totally different mindset
of a venture capital

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.010
investor who expects to make
300% or 500% on their money.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.550
So it's a different mindset, a
different risk profile, and

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.030
you need to take big risks in
order to make big money.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.760
So it's just a very different
approach.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.500
And gambling on race horses is
probably a good analogy.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.140
MARTIN OMANDER: So what you're
saying is I shouldn't take my

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.150
retirement savings and put
it all into one startup.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.640
DON DODGE: No, no, no, no.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.080
And you shouldn't take your
venture money and put it all

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.680
into one startup either.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.020
You should spread your risks.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.010
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, very
good, very good.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.750
Another viewer, [? Andreas ?]

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.115
[? Felipe ?]

00:04:05.115 --> 00:04:08.320
[? Diaz ?], commented on our
episode about how to get

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.140
funding, that we talked a lot
about how to get funding and

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.649
to what to put in a pitch, but
not how to get that meeting

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:17.870
with the investor.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.120
That is a barrier, I think,
to many startups.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.060
How do you get a meeting with
an investor, and how do

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.610
venture capitalists think
about who they talk to?

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.000
DON DODGE: Well, first of all,
go to where the money is.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.690
So go to--

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.580
I was just a TechCruch Disrupt
yesterday for three days.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.470
That's where hundreds and
hundreds of investors and

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.960
startups and press all get
together and present

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.650
new ideas on stage.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:51.760
So go to conferences, go to
meetups, go to networking

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.840
events where investors and
entrepreneurs and startups

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.070
tend to congregate.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.670
That's how you get access
to startups, to money.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.090
Sending an email sometimes
works, but rarely.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.260
But if you see the same person
in person at an event, you

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.870
develop an instant rapport and
can probably make more

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.200
progress that way.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.480
It's like networking
with anything else.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.710
If you're trying to hire some
engineers, the first thing you

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.045
do is network with other
engineers that you know,

00:05:26.045 --> 00:05:28.170
because they have friends
who are engineers.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.320
Same thing with investment.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.040
When you're looking for angel
investors or VC investors, go

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.500
to an investor that
you know, because

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.790
they know other investors.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.040
If you don't know any investors,
go to a startup

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.470
entrepreneur that you know
or someone who works at a

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.360
startup, because they have
investors, and they may

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.640
introduce you to their
investors.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.100
And when you get that first
meeting with an investor, they

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.080
are likely to introduce you
to other investors.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.850
So it's a social networking
kind of thing.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.080
MARTIN OMANDER: So it sounds
like for hires, for

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.910
investment, for all kinds of
things, you need to be a good

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.720
networker to be a successful
startup.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.940
DON DODGE: Absolutely.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.060
Entrepreneurs need
to be extroverts.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.090
And I've seen many, many
entrepreneurs who are

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.840
naturally introverts who, over
time, convert to extroverts.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.940
Because you have to, to talk
to investors, and to hire

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.170
employees, and talk to
the press, and get

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.910
customers and users.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.000
By nature, you're going to have
to go out there and talk

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.980
to them, so you develop into
more of an extrovert.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:27.890
MARTIN OMANDER: So
there is hope.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:28.900
It can be done.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.220
DON DODGE: It can.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.030
MARTIN OMANDER: All right.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.400
Thank you very much, Don.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.090
And thank you all
for watching.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.720
Please continue to leave your
comments and questions you'd

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.830
like us to bring up
in future episodes

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.720
in the YouTube comments.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.870
And finally, I am also a
developer, and I've written

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.800
many apps myself on the
Google Cloud Platform.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.810
I think it's a great platform.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.490
And that we have a special offer
for Root Access viewers.
