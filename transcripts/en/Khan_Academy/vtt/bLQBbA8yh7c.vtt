00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.530
One thing I probably
should make clear

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.210
is that this idea of
getting a 2% management fee

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.830
and then participating in
the profits at around 20%,

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.040
getting this 20%
carried interest,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.710
this isn't unique
to hedge funds.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.140
This is actually the same
compensation structure

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.120
that you'll normally
have at a venture capital

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.849
fund or a private equity fund.

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:22.390
And just to be clear,
venture capital

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.110
really is a form
of private equity.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.070
But normally when someone
says private equity,

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.740
they're not talking about
venture capital in particular.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.350
In all of these situations, the
managers will get roughly 2%

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.780
for managing the fund and
they'll get 20% of the profits.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.610
The only difference really, in
terms of how it's structured,

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.060
in a venture capital
or private equity fund

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.050
will still have kind of
a limited partnership

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.130
for the actual fund.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.005
And then they would have
a management company

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:52.220
that gets the management
fees and the profits.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.940
The only difference is because
a hedge fund, for the most part,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.530
is probably going to invest
in public securities,

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.820
it could get the money
right from the get-go

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.240
and put that money to
work because it tends

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.720
to invest in fairly
liquid assets.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.990
So this is fairly liquid
assets that they can just

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.870
go out and buy.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.720
So a hedge fund will normally
just take as much money

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.190
as it needs to invest
right from the beginning.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.060
A venture capital firm
or a private equity firm,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.140
what they'll do is
they'll say, look,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.839
I'm going to raise
$100 million fund,

00:01:21.839 --> 00:01:24.380
but I'm not going to be able to
just go out the door tomorrow

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.980
and invest $100 million.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.732
In the case of a
venture capital firm,

00:01:27.732 --> 00:01:29.690
they're going to have to
look at business plans

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.150
and entrepreneurs and
do their due diligence.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.692
Same thing for a
private equity firm.

00:01:33.692 --> 00:01:35.900
They're going to have to
look for companies that they

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.370
might want to buy
private equity.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.770
You're normally talking
about more mature companies

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.230
that maybe this firm thinks that
they can buy and turn around.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.830
Maybe more mature
companies that need

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.570
some money to grow really fast.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.610
Venture capital
tends to be investing

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.780
in some guys and a
business plan or maybe

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.050
these smaller kind
of more, I guess

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.324
we should call it,
more risky companies.

00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:57.740
But in either of
these situations,

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.390
they won't just
find them tomorrow.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.265
So what they do is they
go to their investors

00:02:01.265 --> 00:02:04.090
and they get their investors
to commit a certain amount

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.780
of money, to say
commit $100 million.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.500
And they'll get
the management fee

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.490
on what those investors commit.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.746
But they won't take the
money right then and there.

00:02:13.746 --> 00:02:15.370
They'll take the
money as they need it.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.786
They'll do what's called a
capital call to their investors

00:02:17.786 --> 00:02:21.040
saying, hey, I just found a
good $5 million investment.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.060
I now need this percentage of
what you committed to so that I

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.670
can go out and make the
investment in the hedge fund.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.810
That's not the case.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.270
All of it is up front.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.250
But it really is the
same compensation scheme.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.960
And that's why if you go to
any fancy business school,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.820
you'll find these are
kind of the careers

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.210
that, at least the people
who are interested in-- I

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.264
don't want to give them any kind
of characteristics-- there's

00:02:46.264 --> 00:02:48.680
a bunch of reasons why people
would want to go into these.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.790
But these are definitely
sought after careers

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.620
at a lot of fancy
business schools.
