00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.170
Social Anxiety Disorder affects over 15 million
Americans.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.180
New research suggests that maybe you should
give any SAD-suffering friends a big hug,

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.120
though don’t be surprised if they’re stunned
to receive one.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.910
Hey folks!

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.540
I’m Matt Lieberman filling in for DNews.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.750
Social Anxiety Disorder, at its core, is the
extreme fear of judgment and ridicule from

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.750
others.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.240
This makes it intensely difficult for sufferers
of the disorder to develop friendships.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.480
To make matters worse, they operate under
the assumption that the friendships that they

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.540
can make are not of a high quality.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.560
However, new research suggests that this perception
may not in fact be true.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.060
This feeling is actually still the disorder
at work.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.340
It’s a painful cycle of isolation, where
the sufferer assumes that they are not worthy

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.140
of friendship, finally makes a connection,
and then assumes that they are not worthy

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.960
of the friendship that they just made!

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.920
Thomas Rodebaugh of Washington University
in St. Louis pioneered a small study, where

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.540
112 participants, half suffering from Social
Anxiety Disorder, half not, each brought in

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.540
a friend.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.910
Both participant and friend were interviewed
about their relationship with the other.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.610
At the end of the day, the remarkable thing
was how starkly different sufferers and their

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.800
friends viewed their relationship.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.470
Sufferers assumed that the quality of their
relationship was poor due to their own failings,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.310
but friends largely disagreed.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.720
They deemed their relationships “different,
but not worse”.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.110
So what’s to be done?

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.369
The good news is that Social Anxiety Disorder
is treatable, and that the majority of treatments

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.090
are based around showing the sufferer that
he or she doesn’t come off as badly as they

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.299
assume that they do.

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.650
Evidence like the results of this study, especially
when replicated on a larger scale, can do

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.740
a lot to assuage the doubts of society’s
greatest self-doubters.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.409
With any luck, we can all feel a little less
alone in the days to come.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.520
So does social anxiety make someone a more
difficult friend, or is that perception in

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.520
their mind?

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.280
