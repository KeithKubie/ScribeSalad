00:00:00.472 --> 00:00:02.993
- [Voiceover] Many videos ago,
we first looked at the idea

00:00:02.993 --> 00:00:05.141
of representing a periodic function

00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:08.391
as a set of weighted cosines and sines,

00:00:09.558 --> 00:00:10.464
as a sum,

00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:14.922
as the infinite sum of
weighted cosines and sines,

00:00:14.922 --> 00:00:17.847
and then we did some work in order to

00:00:17.847 --> 00:00:21.691
get some basics in terms
of some of these integrals

00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:25.261
which we then started to
use to derive formulas

00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:27.246
for the various coefficients,

00:00:27.246 --> 00:00:28.587
and we are almost there.

00:00:28.587 --> 00:00:31.135
We have figured out a
formula for a sub zero.

00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:34.601
We've figured out a coefficient
in general for any of the

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.534
coefficients on the cosines,

00:00:36.534 --> 00:00:39.657
and now, let's figure
out a way to figure out

00:00:39.657 --> 00:00:42.737
the coefficients on the sines.

00:00:42.737 --> 00:00:44.835
So, how can we do that?

00:00:44.835 --> 00:00:46.675
Well, we're going to use
a very similar technique

00:00:46.675 --> 00:00:49.936
that we did to figure out
the formula for a sub n.

00:00:49.936 --> 00:00:53.148
What we're going to do is multiply

00:00:53.148 --> 00:00:57.128
both sides of this
equation right over here

00:00:57.128 --> 00:00:58.295
by sine of nt.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.996
So let's do that.

00:01:00.996 --> 00:01:02.246
So, sine of nt,

00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:07.190
and so, if we multiply the
right-hand side by sine of nt,

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.525
that means we're going
to multiply every one of

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:10.894
the infinite terms by sine of nt,

00:01:10.894 --> 00:01:12.061
so sine of nt,

00:01:14.946 --> 00:01:15.863
sine of nt,

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:19.262
I think you,

00:01:19.262 --> 00:01:21.557
well, this is always a
little time consuming,

00:01:21.557 --> 00:01:22.390
but I'll get there,

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.307
sine of nt,

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.427
sine of nt,

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:28.959
sine of nt,

00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:32.018
sine of nt,

00:01:34.953 --> 00:01:35.870
sine of nt,

00:01:36.725 --> 00:01:38.159
and of course there is
these dot, dot, dot's,

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.551
so we're just showing in general,

00:01:39.551 --> 00:01:40.865
we're taking each of the,

00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:43.117
each of these terms and
multiplying them by sine of nt.

00:01:43.117 --> 00:01:44.284
We'll do it for all of the terms.

00:01:44.284 --> 00:01:46.560
We'll keep on doing
this, on and on forever,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.746
for an infinite number of terms.

00:01:48.746 --> 00:01:51.071
Well, now let's take the
integral of both sides

00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:51.914
of this equation,

00:01:51.914 --> 00:01:54.438
the definite integral from zero to 2 pi,

00:01:54.438 --> 00:01:57.247
and once again, I'm picking
that interval because 2 pi

00:01:57.247 --> 00:02:00.592
is the period of the periodic
function that we care about,

00:02:00.592 --> 00:02:02.009
and everything else that I've been doing

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.797
has been over that interval of 2 pi,

00:02:03.797 --> 00:02:05.881
so I'll just keep focusing in on that,

00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:07.881
so from zero to 2 pi dt,

00:02:08.782 --> 00:02:11.785
and I could say the integral
of this whole thing,

00:02:11.785 --> 00:02:14.171
but we know that the integral
of a sum of a bunch of things

00:02:14.171 --> 00:02:16.446
is also the same thing as
the sum of the integrals

00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:19.738
and we also know that we can
take these constant multipliers

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:21.442
of expressions outside of integrals

00:02:21.442 --> 00:02:22.980
and so this is going to be equal to,

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.879
if I take the integral
of the right-hand side,

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.740
the definite integral is
going to be from zero to 2 pi,

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.837
dt.

00:02:30.837 --> 00:02:32.254
Zero to 2 pi, dt.

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:35.371
Zero to 2 pi, dt.

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.876
Zero to 2 pi, dt.

00:02:41.748 --> 00:02:42.689
We're almost there.

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.106
Zero to 2 pi, dt.

00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:47.788
Zero to 2 pi, dt.

00:02:50.185 --> 00:02:53.894
And zero to 2 pi, dt,
and I would be doing this

00:02:53.894 --> 00:02:57.311
for every term in this Fourier expansion.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.587
Now, this is where some
of that integration work

00:03:00.587 --> 00:03:01.911
is going to be valuable.

00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:05.671
We've already shown that
sine of the definite integral

00:03:05.671 --> 00:03:08.737
from zero to 2 pi of sine of nt, dt

00:03:08.737 --> 00:03:12.232
is going to be equal to zero for n being

00:03:12.232 --> 00:03:13.514
any integer.

00:03:13.514 --> 00:03:15.220
So we saw that,

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.358
we saw that right over there,

00:03:17.358 --> 00:03:18.691
so that tells us

00:03:20.226 --> 00:03:22.867
that that term is going to be zero,

00:03:22.867 --> 00:03:25.437
so that's going to be equal to zero

00:03:25.437 --> 00:03:29.961
and we also know that when
we take a cosine of something

00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:30.802
times t,

00:03:30.802 --> 00:03:32.989
times the sine of something times t,

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.558
where these are integers,

00:03:34.558 --> 00:03:35.621
and we take that definite integral,

00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:37.766
we know that that's going to be zero,

00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:39.903
so all of those are going to be zero,

00:03:39.903 --> 00:03:42.378
and we also know that
when you take the sine

00:03:42.378 --> 00:03:43.962
of two different non,

00:03:43.962 --> 00:03:45.587
two different coefficients right over,

00:03:45.587 --> 00:03:48.343
or sine of some integer
coefficient times t

00:03:48.343 --> 00:03:51.787
times sine of some other
integer coefficient times t,

00:03:51.787 --> 00:03:55.131
that these are also going
to be equal to zero.

00:03:55.131 --> 00:03:56.516
We saw that,

00:03:56.516 --> 00:03:58.195
we saw that right over here.

00:03:58.195 --> 00:04:00.042
That is this property

00:04:00.042 --> 00:04:02.543
and so, really, all you're left with,

00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:05.225
the only one that does not become zero

00:04:05.225 --> 00:04:06.834
is this term right over here,

00:04:06.834 --> 00:04:10.084
where it's sine of nt times sine of nt,

00:04:11.223 --> 00:04:13.179
and what is that going to be equal to?

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:15.871
Well, this, inside of the integral,

00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:16.726
that's the same thing.

00:04:16.726 --> 00:04:18.157
Let me do this in a different
color, since I'm using orange

00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:21.137
to cross out everything
that ends up becoming zero,

00:04:21.137 --> 00:04:22.925
so that is the same thing
as the definite integral

00:04:22.925 --> 00:04:24.504
from zero to 2 pi of

00:04:24.504 --> 00:04:26.421
sine-squared of nt, dt,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.993
and I'll do the,

00:04:29.993 --> 00:04:31.898
or the dt is still there
so I'm just replacing

00:04:31.898 --> 00:04:34.811
the blue stuff with
the sine-squared of nt,

00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:37.378
and we know what that's going to be.

00:04:37.378 --> 00:04:41.060
We know that when the coefficient on the t

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.999
is a non-zero integer,

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:45.639
that this is going to result in pi.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:46.889
So we know that

00:04:48.212 --> 00:04:50.238
all of this stuff right over here,

00:04:50.238 --> 00:04:51.869
we'll do that in a different color,

00:04:51.869 --> 00:04:52.702
all of,

00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:58.305
we know that all of this
stuff is going to evaluate,

00:04:58.305 --> 00:05:00.170
or actually we should
say, all of this stuff

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.254
is going to become pi,

00:05:02.254 --> 00:05:06.591
so we know that b sub n times
pi is going to be equal to

00:05:06.591 --> 00:05:08.030
this definite integral.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.151
Or, we could write,

00:05:09.151 --> 00:05:10.364
let me write it this way,

00:05:10.364 --> 00:05:12.781
b sub n times pi is equal to,

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.034
'cause everything else
ends up becoming zero,

00:05:17.034 --> 00:05:18.954
is going to be equal to zero,

00:05:18.954 --> 00:05:20.819
the definite integral from zero to 2 pi.

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:22.664
I'll put my dt out here,

00:05:22.664 --> 00:05:23.497
of f of t,

00:05:25.056 --> 00:05:27.056
f of t times sine of nt,

00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:29.398
sine of nt,

00:05:32.034 --> 00:05:36.065
dt, and so we can then
divide both sides by,

00:05:36.065 --> 00:05:38.032
divide both sides by pi

00:05:38.032 --> 00:05:39.937
and we get a little bit of a drum roll,

00:05:39.937 --> 00:05:41.209
we get b sub n,

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:42.846
actually, I could write that,

00:05:42.846 --> 00:05:44.789
I'll write that in that same blue color,

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.039
we get b sub n,

00:05:46.921 --> 00:05:48.539
I'll do it actually right here,

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.228
b sub n is going to be equal to

00:05:51.228 --> 00:05:54.821
1 over pi times the definite integral

00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:56.689
from zero to 2 pi,

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.507
zero to 2 pi,

00:05:58.507 --> 00:06:00.005
we have our dt here,

00:06:00.005 --> 00:06:02.172
you have your f of t here,

00:06:03.034 --> 00:06:05.350
and then you have your sine,

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.183
sine nt,

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:10.610
so once again, that was pretty
straight forward now that

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:11.882
we knew these,

00:06:11.882 --> 00:06:13.292
these properties of integrals

00:06:13.292 --> 00:06:14.847
so we knew how to evaluate these integrals

00:06:14.847 --> 00:06:15.680
that are,

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.548
definite integrals that
are taking a cosine or sine

00:06:17.548 --> 00:06:20.694
or products of cosines and sines.

00:06:20.694 --> 00:06:22.946
And using these three formulas,

00:06:22.946 --> 00:06:27.004
we can now attempt to find
the Fourier expansion,

00:06:27.004 --> 00:06:27.868
the Fourier series,

00:06:27.868 --> 00:06:31.368
find the coefficients for our square wave.
