00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
You know the internet. We use it for almost literally everything.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.120
Food. Transportation. Entertainment. Education.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.320
But in the U.S., there’s still areas without internet access.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.140
We're somewhere at the bottom of the list when you look at leading developed nations

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.700
in terms of broadband penetration, broadband speeds and broadband prices.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.820
In fact, 10% of Americans don’t have broadband internet,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.860
which means they can’t even stream this video you’re watching right now.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.220
It's not a question of just lacking access to the internet.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.260
It's more like lacking the full capacity to use the internet in the way that it's being used.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.760
The difficulty of getting online is a really big deal for the almost 5 million American households

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.700
with school-age children. 
Why? Because that’s a lot of students who may

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.820
be unable to complete their digital assignments.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.820
Lack of internet access is such a concern, some school districts have equipped

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.140
school buses with routers so students can get online.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.560
The discussion about internet access is really about this: Is access to the internet a human right?

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.460
Hey fam, I’m Imaeyen, and this Sunday on AJ+ we’re exploring what it’s like to

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.480
live in a digitally connected nation and yet have limited or no internet access.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.860
Maybe you’ve already heard about the United States’ digital divide. There are a

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.520
lot of Americans with limited or no access to the internet. In rural America,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.460
39% of Americans lack broadband access. But what's surprising is how many people

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.760
in big cities like Detroit and Miami lack access to broadband.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.420
And what we mean by lacking access is having a broadband connection slower than 25 megabits

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.899
per second for downloads, and 3 megabits per second for uploads.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.649
With that connection speed, a family of four would be unable to independently stream

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.420
four HD movies simultaneously. An estimated 4% of urban homes

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.289
are underserved when it comes to internet access. And it’s forced people like

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.320
small business owner Atreese Watkins to come up with workarounds to get online.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.960
Sometimes you can do stuff like go to a cafe. But again, it’s like how many

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.860
$4 lattes are you paying for in order to administer your business like three or four days a week?

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.440
Watkins’ limited internet access extends to her work and home.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.480
For her, getting online is cost-prohibitive.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.160
It would cost about like 90 bucks with most standard service providers.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.940
Her struggle isn’t unique. Broadband is expensive, and the cost makes it unaffordable for many.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.960
Nearly half of Americans with household incomes below $30,000 a year have no home broadband at all.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.140
And low-income homes with children are four times more

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.980
likely to lack broadband as middle- or high-income families.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.300
What’s even more stunning is how the price of the broadband in the U.S.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.140
compares with other countries. I’ll let communications professor Victor Pickard explain.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.340
Compared to other leading democracies around the world, the U.S.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.880
typically has lower speeds, poorer services and much more expensive services, in comparison.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.220
An analysis of internet prices in the U.S. and France

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.250
found the costs in the United States were as much as three and a half times

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.720
higher than those in France for similar service. And it’s not like the U.S. is

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.859
getting more for all that extra money. The nation only ranks 10th in the world,

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.020
behind places like South Korea, Norway and Sweden, when it comes to broadband.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.000
So not only are customers in the United States paying more, they’re also

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.540
getting fewer choices with slower speeds. But the connectivity issue is about more than affordability.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.680
It disproportionately affects communities of color, poor communities,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.120
rural communities, so it's still very much a major social problem in the United States today.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.780
Even low-income-area residents who can afford

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.480
home internet often have to deal with very slow speeds. This year, three African-American

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.700
low-income residents of Cleveland, Ohio, filed a complaint with the FCC.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.420
The women claim AT&amp;T has withheld high-speed infrastructure from

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.460
the overwhelming majority of census blocks with individual poverty rates above 35%. It’s a

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.599
practice some call digital redlining. In their complaint, they accused AT&amp;T of

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.090
“unjust and unreasonable discrimination.” Which, if true, would be a violation of

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:29.520
the Communications Act. Or at least it was. But that was before FCC Chairman Ajit Pai

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.000
garnered enough votes to overturn the regulation. By the way, that's the same

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.340
ruling that killed net neutrality. Pai has also suggested

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.460
lowering the goalpost for what constitutes acceptable speeds for broadband.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.599
And that could affect how much funding is available to expand broadband networks into rural

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:52.280
or low-income areas. So people who are underserved might be deemed

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.900
to have acceptable internet speeds. Ajit Pai is also the man who suggested a smartphone

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.460
can be your primary vehicle to get online. Which is curious, because

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.920
he’s also the guy who began scaling back internet and phone subsidies for low-income families.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.640
Even if you accept using a smartphone as a primary source for internet

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.440
access as reasonable, realize that 23% of all smartphone owners

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.920
have had to cancel service at some point because of costs.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.740
Low-income smartphone owners are even more likely to drop the service because of price. And that's

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.940
a problem in a world where we do so much online.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.500
Access to broadband is no longer a luxury. It's a necessity. For everything ranging from education,

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.160
to health, to livelihood, not to mention entertainment, or just getting information,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.480
communicating with our loved ones, we have to have access to broadband services.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.200
You also need broadband to make it easier to run your small business.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.160
As Atreese Watkins has discovered, not having it can cost you.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.280
It was really difficult for me to start accepting credit card payments.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.600
There were people who stopped wanting to do business with me because I wouldn't.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.400
And if I’m at a venue where I have bad cell signal and there's no wi-fi,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.500
I can't make sure I got paid. I can't make sure my payment processed.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.340
We use the internet daily, just like water or, say, electricity.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.860
Can you imagine the nation having the same debate we’re having about internet access about electricity?

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.220
Oh wait, you don’t have to, because we already did.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.320
In 1932, only about 10% of rural America had electricity,

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.660
and about half of those people had to buy their own power plants.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:40.680
You had very similar discussions about whether electricity should be seen as a necessity or a luxury.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.760
It parallels many of the discussions we're having today around broadband access.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:50.760
Should the internet be seen as a necessity? Is it even a human right, as some would argue?

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.560
We don't go in and tell people that they can have more or less water pressure

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.320
based on how much they pay their water bill. We don't tell people whether they can

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.620
have dim or bright lights based on how much they pay.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:07.020
Today, we don’t consider electricity a luxury. It’s a utility.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:12.200
Harvard law professor Susan Crawford says high-speed internet access has the potential to affect

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:18.140
the U.S.’s economic growth the way electricity did. So should we regulate internet accessibility

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:22.520
in the same way we do electricity? That’s not on Pai’s to-do list.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.819
He believes the FCC is “restoring internet freedom” by

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.940
by deregulating and “eliminating burdensome and unnecessary requirements.”

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:36.520
He claims that’ll free up ISPs like Comcast and AT&amp;T to invest in the necessary infrastructure

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:42.400
to improve connectivity for underserved Americans. But Pickard doesn’t believe that’s true.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.920
He says Pai’s actions are less deregulation and more reregulation,

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:52.260
as Pai’s FCC is basically restructuring the industry to serve corporate interests.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.440
He says there’s little incentive for ISPs to provide consumers with a better service.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.620
Over the internet’s lifetime, the ISP market has consolidated to the point where

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.540
there are just two companies providing access.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.560
In some parts of the country, there’s only one, which is effectively a monopoly.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.860
And it gets more problematic. Millions are actually forced to choose a company

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.540
that's blocked certain applications.

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:18.380
One option for improving access for Americans is municipally owned internet service providers.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.500
It’s what Chattanooga, Tennessee, has done. Its citywide fiber internet network

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.020
is among the fastest and most affordable internet in the country.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.560
And it's even got a nickname: the Gig. And the city built it itself.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:36.180
Comcast and AT&amp;T didn’t like that, and they sued four times. But Chattanooga won.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.560
Here’s what happened next. An independent study published by University of Tennessee

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:47.640
found the network could be directly tied to the creation of between 2,800 and 5,200 new jobs.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:54.380
It also said the economic benefits for the city have been roughly $1 billion over the course of the last five years.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.840
But Chattanooga’s success poses a great challenge to the telecom industry,

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.880
which has lobbied states across the country to ban or limit similar experiments.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:10.480
Many states, about 20 as a matter of fact, have passed laws that make this very difficult.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.200
Basically, they have succumbed to telecommunication industry lobbying

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.300
and passed laws that give internet service providers the first right of refusal,

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:27.340
so that municipalities aren't even allowed by law to try to create these community broadband networks.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.860
Because of lobbyists, there’s a Tennessee law that makes it illegal for Chattanooga’s

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.620
network to expand out into surrounding areas.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.940
And they’re forbidden from offering internet to customers at rates

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.040
that are less than the actual cost of providing the service.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.540
If we turn accessing the technology itself into the market,

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:49.820
that's a whole other market we have to go through in order to just be viable.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:54.760
And like I said, if you're not on certain platforms, you don't exist online,

00:09:54.760 --> 00:10:03.340
so it literally gives those providers the power to tax folks out of existence.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.120
Hey guys, thanks so much for watching. Don’t forget to like, share and subscribe.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.400
And what I want to know is if any of you, or people you know, have trouble getting online.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:18.520
