Western culture is going to collapse
okay it won't take much just single

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730
okay it won't take much just single
 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.390
okay it won't take much just single
point so silly because we are so

the solar flares work so back in this

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370
the solar flares work so back in this
 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.400
the solar flares work so back in this
happens about once every century so back

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410
happens about once every century so back
 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.530
happens about once every century so back
about 1880 and I don't remember the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540
about 1880 and I don't remember the
 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.480
about 1880 and I don't remember the
exact year there was a significant

exact year there was a significant
 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.400
exact year there was a significant
enough solar flare so that produces an

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410
enough solar flare so that produces an
 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.440
enough solar flare so that produces an
electromagnetic pulse like a hydrogen

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450
electromagnetic pulse like a hydrogen
 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.330
electromagnetic pulse like a hydrogen
bomb because the Sun is a hydrogen bomb

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340
bomb because the Sun is a hydrogen bomb
 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.970
bomb because the Sun is a hydrogen bomb
an electromagnetic pulse will emerge

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980
an electromagnetic pulse will emerge
 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.040
an electromagnetic pulse will emerge
from the Sun and wave across the earth

from the Sun and wave across the earth
 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.750
from the Sun and wave across the earth
and it produces huge spikes in

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760
and it produces huge spikes in
 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.060
and it produces huge spikes in
electrical electrical current along

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070

out the whole Northeast Corridor and so

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030
out the whole Northeast Corridor and so
 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.610
out the whole Northeast Corridor and so
they figure those things are about one

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620
they figure those things are about one
 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.130
they figure those things are about one
in a century event but those single why

the houses and have the men go out and
 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.870
the houses and have the men go out and
do all the dirty work that's what's

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880
do all the dirty work that's what's
 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.550
do all the dirty work that's what's
going to happen again only men will

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560
going to happen again only men will
 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.970
going to happen again only men will
bring civilization back again
