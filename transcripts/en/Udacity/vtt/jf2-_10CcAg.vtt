The internet has been around
for longer than the web.

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:05.639
While computers
already had something

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:09.059
to communicate with over the
internet, like email or FTP,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.100
there was no common
and publicly available

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.679
way to publish and
access documents.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.629
This is where Tim
Berners-Lee comes in.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.760
He wanted an open
mechanism for researchers

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.480
to publish, read, and comment
on papers through the internet.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.429
He wanted a mesh of
linked documents that were

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.679
called hypertext documents.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.809
Berners-Lee chose
a subset of SGML

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:31.529
and called it HTML, the
Hypertext Markup Language.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.980
Then he designed HTTP, the
Hypertext Transfer Protocol,

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:38.069
to transfer these
HTML documents.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.409
Hypertext sounds all
futuristic and complicated.

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:42.839
But it simply means that
the text in that document

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.360
can have references
to other documents.

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:47.820
These references
are called links.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.329
By getting a document, the user
can not only read that document

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.879
but they can navigate to related
documents through these links.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.520
Especially in a
scientific context

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.410
for which Berners-Lee
designed it,

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.164
this feature turned out
to be incredibly useful.

00:01:01.164 --> 00:01:03.450
Hypertext can refer to
more than text, though.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.060
Files can link to images,
code, styles, or anything else.
