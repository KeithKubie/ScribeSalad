[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.650
ZACHARY SENZER: Hey, everyone.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.915
I'm so glad that you can
make it today to our session,

00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:13.350
and I hope that you're having
a really awesome Google I/O.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.320
My name is Zachary Senzer,
and I am a product manager

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.094
on the Actions on Google
and Google Assistant teams.

00:00:19.094 --> 00:00:20.760
BARRIE LEVINSON: And
I'm Barrie, and I'm

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.010
a program manager for Google
Assistant focused on discovery.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.100
We really want people
to find your content

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.310
and use it on Google Assistant.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.470
And today, we're here to talk
about how your content can

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.590
reach millions of devices
on Google Assistant

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.510
really without much
work at all for you.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.850
So by day two of I/O, this
may be a refresher, but just

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.650
a quick overview of
the opportunity that

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.460
presents itself to you
with Google Assistant.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.680
Assistant really helps
people get things done

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.930
with over one million Actions.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.300
Actions is the word that
we use to describe things

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.220
that Assistant can do.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.040
And Assistant is
ready to help wherever

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.570
users are with over 500
million voice-activated devices

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.030
like Google Home,
eligible mobile phones,

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.980
and other devices with screens
where Google Assistant works.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.950
Assistant's available across the
globe in more than 25 locales

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.850
and by the end of this year, in
80 countries and 30 languages.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.340
So that's a lot of devices
and a lot of Actions

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.700
that Assistant can do and
a lot of potential users

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.750
for your content.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.730
So how can you bring your site's
content into this ecosystem?

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.630
Google's presented ways for you
to optimize content for Search

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.120
since what my kids
would call the 1900's.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.610
For sites with content in
popular areas like news,

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.640
podcasts, and recipes,
the same kinds

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.330
of optimizations that you have
likely made already for Search

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.450
will also help your
content become discoverable

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.610
in Google Assistant.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.060
So we'll be explaining how
to use structured data in AMP

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.530
in your content to
help drive traffic

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.740
to your site for both
Assistant and for Search

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.800
at the same time with the
same work on your part.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.420
So our research shows that
users are accessing information

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.910
in new ways with different
kinds of use cases

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.950
throughout the day.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.060
We know that users are
accessing media and news

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.690
content in their morning and
in their commute routines.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.810
And then in the evening
around meal preparation,

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.600
recipe content
becomes interesting.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.300
Google's put a lot
of thought into how

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.340
to be there for the
user throughout the day

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.975
in these different
kinds of use cases.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.350
So as a user, I can
be in conversation

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.720
with Google Assistant
throughout the day

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.270
to get things done in my world.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.310
Let's take, for example, Zach
at the center of his world.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.780
Let's say Zach missed
the latest episode

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.640
of his favorite podcast.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.610
He can just ask his
Assistant to play it.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.820
Or if he's not sure what
he wants to listen to,

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.700
he can explore a
different podcast to try.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.710
At dinner time, when
Zach is hungry for ideas

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.330
and isn't sure what to make, he
asks his Assistant for recipes.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.580
Assistant on mobile
presents a carousel

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.300
of recipes that are easy
to browse and load quickly.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.270
And with a single tap, he can
choose a Food Network recipe

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.220
to send straight
to his Google Home

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.610
so Zach doesn't have
to worry about handling

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.730
his phone in the kitchen
when he might be busy

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.530
using his hands to
cook whatever it

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.770
is that he's making for dinner.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.840
And Google Assistant is
there throughout the day

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.700
to help with lots
of other use cases

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.780
too, like reading the
news, translations, getting

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.990
directions, sorting
through photos, and more.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.740
So let's have a look at how
some providers are getting

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.096
content to users like Zach and
many others throughout the day.

00:04:09.096 --> 00:04:10.095
Here are three examples.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.990
So structured data markup can
produce carousels and rich

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.390
results in Google Assistant.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.660
By asking a voice-activated
device to hear the news,

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.750
or listen to a podcast,
or find a recipe,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.170
a user is connected
to content right away.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.490
On the left, a user is asking
for top stories in business

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.970
and right away gets a carousel
of the latest headlines

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.550
rendered quickly
with nice imagery

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.660
from the source site of
"The New York Times."

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.910
In the middle, a
user is asking for

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.370
and gets recipes
from Food Network--

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.190
easy to browse and select
a recipe to send straight

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.180
to Google Home.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.610
And then on the
right, another user

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.750
asks her Google Assistant
to play "Planet Money."

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.810
And immediately, she starts
hearing the latest episode

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:03.355
from NPR.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.320
So this is the
Actions directory.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.560
You might know that the
Actions directory has

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.930
a listing for each
and every Action

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.720
that users can do on Assistant.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.010
When recipe, podcast, and news
providers optimize your content

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.950
using structured
data, you become

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.180
eligible for an auto-generated
page listed in the Actions

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.890
directory.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.640
The Actions directory is
organized both by category,

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.570
like food and drink, and
it's also organized by things

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.380
that users are trying to
do, like find food recipes

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.060
or play a podcast.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.300
So that means that your
Action, your content

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.810
could be presented in multiple
places in the directory

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.750
depending on what
users are trying to do.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.700
We built the Actions
directory to be

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.090
accessible with a single
tap from Google Assistant,

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.520
like you see here on mobile.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.390
And there's also a version for
web available on the desktop

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.000
and also for mobile browsers.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.470
And each page is shareable.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.270
So you could
promote your Action,

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.150
or your current users could
share it with their friends

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.200
or with their followers.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.420
So there are three
things that you

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.750
can choose to do to get
your content best integrated

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.510
with Assistant.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.140
Structured data in AMP
are key to optimizing

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.030
for Search and for Assistant
with the same work to do both.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.070
When you invest in
structured data,

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.860
you enable more
discovery on more devices

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.670
and help users get things
done throughout their day.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.910
Also, implementing best
practices with structured data

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.840
can make your content eligible
for carousels and rich results

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.460
like you just saw and for a
page on the Actions directory.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.550
When you further enhance
your content using AMP,

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:01.190
it helps your mobile pages
to load quickly and take

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.380
advantage of Google AMP cache.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.820
We'll also talk
about how you can

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.760
take things further and
claim your Actions directory

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.280
page to make it your
own and participate

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.490
in additional features,
like user reviews.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.710
And you can consider
going further

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.040
to build your own custom Action
using the Actions on Google

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.490
Developer platform.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.080
We'll cover all
three in the talk.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.000
So I've mentioned
structured data

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.480
markup up in AMP a few times
already, and let's just

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.050
make sure we're all on
the same page about that.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:38.050
AMP stands for
Accelerated Mobile Pages,

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.480
and the AMP icon is
an indication to users

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:45.280
that this mobile page will
load quickly and smoothly.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.620
When a user selects
an AMP mobile page,

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.050
Search retrieves it
from Google AMP cache,

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.560
which enables a variety
of load optimizations.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.420
Google uses
structured data markup

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.600
on the web to best understand
the content on each

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.190
and every page.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.920
Structured data markup
is a standardized format

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.980
for specifying information
about a page and classifying it.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.940
So if I have a recipe page, what
are the ingredients, the cook

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:13.900
time, nutrition
information, and so on.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.060
You help Google
Search understand

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.940
content on your pages by
giving explicit clues that

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.030
come when you conform to the
standards with structured data

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:23.180
markup.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.990
There are really well-documented
standards for structured data

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:29.350
that vary by content
type, and the standards

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.230
are consistent with open
standards for schema.org.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.039
So we're going to look at
examples for news, podcasts,

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.049
and recipes today.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.600
There are a few different ways
to specify your structured data

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.130
for web pages.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:51.360
JSON-LD, or JavaScript Open
Notation with Linked Data,

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.440
is encoding that's used by
Google's Knowledge Graph.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.140
JSON-LD shows up like
a big blob of code

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.090
near the head of each page.

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.260
And it starts with a script
tag that says, hey, browser.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.190
Calling the JavaScript
that contains some JSON-LD.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.470
So this really simple
snippet of markup

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.880
says, this is a WebSite type.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.790
I'm using the vocabulary
from schema.org.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.050
And the website has this URL.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.360
Another implementation
of markup would

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.720
be with HTML extensions that
places different syntaxes

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.690
throughout the page
with tagged attributes

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.790
that name the
properties and expose

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.780
the structured data in both the
head and the body of the pages.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.660
But we're going to focus on
JSON-LD as a preferred method

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.060
to use wherever possible.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.660
And you can also use
Google's examples

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.706
to create your
JSON-LD markup rather

00:09:46.706 --> 00:09:47.830
than starting from scratch.

00:09:52.624 --> 00:09:54.040
So in order to
bring this to life,

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.340
we're going to use a case study
example of a family recipe

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.720
site.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.140
Structured data markup in AMP
works for large publishers,

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:05.260
like Food Network or "The New
York Times," as you've seen.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:09.760
And it also works for anyone,
including a small family recipe

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.890
site.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.840
And in fact, this is not just
any small family recipe site.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.710
This is my own
family's recipe site.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.800
Recently, my husband and I
optimized our existing family

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.570
recipe site using structured
data markup in AMP.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.390
So there are a few
characters in the story

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.470
so you can follow along the
plot that I'll introduce first.

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.870
First, the stroopwafel.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.430
You might know
that a stroopwafel

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.500
is a Dutch cookie with some
caramel inside of some waffles.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.550
And it'll show up in pictures.

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.740
And then Sander's
Dutch stroopwafels--

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:44.230
Sander is my 12-year-old son.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:47.440
And Coert Vonk is the site
owner, and he's my husband.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.790
And he's also Dutch.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.810
So our site features a lot
of Dutch family recipes,

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.450
like the ones that you
see here in the carousel,

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:59.080
including Sander's
Dutch stroopwafels.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.260
This rich carousel of search
results from our recipe site

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.575
appears when you ask Google
Assistant "find recipes

00:11:05.575 --> 00:11:07.540
from Coert Vonk."

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.740
And then you can choose one and
send it to your Google Home.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.770
So here's the before and
after with our recipe site.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.080
Before we made the changes
for structured data,

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.870
a page like on the
left would show up

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.660
in Search for a specific
query, like "Sander's

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.660
Dutch stroopwafel recipe."

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.000
You can see there's a
pretty ordinary search

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.530
result with a blue link
and some unremarkable text.

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:39.230
After we optimized it
with structured data--

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.760
on the other side--

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:44.420
we started to participate in
rich results and carousels

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.070
for the same query.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:49.130
And you can spot a
few more differences.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:50.690
Because of structured
data markup,

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:52.940
Search is so much
smarter about the data

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.910
that it finds on our
site and on this page.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:58.100
The generic blue link is gone.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:01.040
You can see a row of chips
to select relevant content

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.050
under the title "Recipes."

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.720
Search better understands our
recipe content, of course,

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.000
from the way the data
is passed in the markup.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.460
With structured data
markup for recipes,

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.380
we were able to
increase discovery

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.340
for Search and for Google
Assistant at the same time

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.580
with exactly the same work.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:25.270
And true story, at the end
of April, we got an email--

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.650
so it's like last week--

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.770
from Google Assistant saying
that our site traffic,

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:34.420
although still pretty small,
had increased more than 300%

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:39.992
in the month of April with
72% of user acquisition coming

00:12:39.992 --> 00:12:40.950
through organic search.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:48.070
So after our site was indexed
and successfully converted

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:52.510
to structured data, we noticed
a page in the Actions directory.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.180
Earlier, you saw the
Actions directory page

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.590
for Food Network.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.090
And this is the
Actions directory

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:02.005
page for our family site
rendered on web browser,

00:13:02.005 --> 00:13:03.370
or a desktop.

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.800
The other one was
obviously on mobile.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.770
Later on, we'll see how
this page can be claimed.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:11.980
And we can go on to customize
it with our own images

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:12.880
and information.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.800
So for a closer look
at what it takes

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.610
to use structured data markup
in AMP, let's look at the code.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.950
And we'll continue to
use the family recipe

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:25.135
site as an example.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:32.550
So first, the generic JSON-LD
structured data snippet

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.120
for type Recipe.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.760
In addition to the general
structured data guidelines,

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.890
you'll need to follow
the specific guidelines

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.590
for the structured data
type that you have in order

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:45.350
to be eligible in
rich results displays

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.540
in both Search and Assistant.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:51.360
So most Search structured data
uses open standard schema.org

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.420
vocabulary, as I've mentioned.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.460
Although, what Google
Search might require

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.850
could differ a little bit as
what's required by schema.org.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.720
So Google is able
to read JSON-LD data

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.640
when it's dynamically injected
into a page's contents.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.020
And that's what we're doing
in the family recipe site

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.440
architecture.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.660
Here, the server-side PHP helps
generate an AMP recipe page

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.770
with markup using recipe data
details that are pulled out

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.140
of the MySQL database.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.440
When a recipe page is
requested by the web browser,

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.190
PHP responds by consulting
the database for the recipe

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.580
details, then marks
it up as HTML,

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.000
and returns the
dynamic page results.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.960
This also inserts
the structured data

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:44.880
we added as JSON-LD inside the
script in the page in its head.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.980
So the highlighted
part on the slide

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.907
is the essence of what
is new after optimizing

00:14:49.907 --> 00:14:51.240
with the structured data markup.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:55.710
Obviously, for a
recipe collection,

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:59.260
the type of structured data
we used was the recipe's type.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.880
So let's have a
closer look at that.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.610
This is the first
section of markup

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:08.870
for the page
recipe, specifically

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.800
Sander's Dutch stroopwafels.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.920
Each page carries markup
that's specific to it.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.960
So we see the result
of where the recipe

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.650
information from the database
is pulled to generate markup.

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.450
Going down the
page, you can easily

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:26.890
parse the resulting markup
and see the name, description,

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:31.360
author, recipe yield,
prep time, and cook time.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.020
The format is always expressed
as a set of attribute value

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.080
pairs.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:40.110
So name-- Sander's
Dutch stroopwafels.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.930
You use recipe property
markup for a single recipe

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:47.430
at a time, not a category
of recipes or a whole list.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.820
And there are 15 total
recipe properties

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.835
that are recommended, although
only name is actually required.

00:15:56.490 --> 00:15:59.380
Going into this, we didn't
have an image for every recipe

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.160
in the collection.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.090
So that's something
we're working on.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:07.390
But you can see the highlighted
URL is the block of markup

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:09.970
for a photo that would
be for the big stack

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:11.350
of gooey stroopwafels.

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:19.510
So continuing the markup
for the same recipe page,

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.340
we have ratings.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.920
Inspired by structured
data, we added ratings

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.750
to the site, which
isn't something

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.390
that had been a feature before.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:30.340
You can see here the
markup for ratings

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.800
that includes data
for the rating value,

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.255
a count of reviews, and the best
and worst rating for the recipe

00:16:36.255 --> 00:16:36.755
page.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.480
And now on the right,
you can see how ratings

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.340
will render in search results.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.460
And this is the direct result
of adding the structured data

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:51.430
markup for ratings on the page.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:53.590
You see the stars in
the rating, et cetera.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.450
And now the last
part of the markup--

00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.800
still for the same recipe--

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.110
shows the rest of the format
truncated a little bit

00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:03.590
to fit on the slide.

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.220
Here, we tagged the
recipe ingredients

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.470
and pull the recipe
instructions.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.030
And finally, the
nutrition information.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.880
So for us, nutrition
information was

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.800
something we had
in the database,

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.810
but many of the
fields were empty.

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:20.290
And so adding more data has
been a good enhancement here.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:23.500
And then at the end, you
see we close the script.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.500
And now you've seen the full
format for structured data

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.245
for the type Recipe.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.360
The Structured Data
Testing Tool helps

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.440
you to format your data correct
to standards for whatever type

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.730
you're using.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:43.110
Structured Data Testing
Tool is really easy to use.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.730
It's open.

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.250
You can find it easily
on Google Search.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:52.730
And so running the page
URL through the tool

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.640
shows any anomalies as
compared to the standards

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.620
for the type that I'm testing.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:01.730
So you can see here that I
have an error where the cook

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.610
time was formatted in some
way that I might just type it

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.530
as a person as compared
to the ISO format

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.860
that structured data requires.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:13.710
It's easy to go through and
fix errors one at a time.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.430
And it would be recommended
to do this really

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.740
after just you have a few
pages to check the format.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:25.620
So to summarize, our family
recipe site optimization

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.690
process with structured data--

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.490
we followed the
structured data guidelines

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:33.220
to create the markup
using JSON-LD.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:36.100
And remember, you can follow
well-documented examples rather

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:38.020
than starting from scratch.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.960
We then validate our code using
the Structured Data Testing

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.530
Tool, which is probably going
to be an iterative process where

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.750
you find and fix errors.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:50.800
Make sure to unblock robots.txt,
noindex, or any access

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.200
controls which might keep
the crawlers from getting

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.940
to your markup.

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.580
And you're going to fix and
monitor errors and re-index

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.790
the site as you change it.

00:19:02.504 --> 00:19:03.920
So there are a few
things that are

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:08.150
special about using structured
data markup in AMP to optimize

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:09.261
for news content.

00:19:09.261 --> 00:19:10.010
Let's have a look.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.530
There's a special
type, NewsArticle,

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.900
with just two properties
that are recommended

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.300
in the case of non-AMP pages.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.930
The headline and the
image is highlighted.

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:26.690
For NewsArticles, when
you are optimizing

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.480
with AMP mobile pages,
additional properties

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.840
are required.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:35.540
And those include the
publisher name, the logo, URL,

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.870
date published, date modified--
here and on the next slide.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:45.100
AMP pages that have
structured data

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.710
can appear in a carousel
of stories, like the ones

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.620
that you saw from "The
New York Times" earlier.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.890
Without the structured data,
AMP pages can load fast,

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:55.450
but they won't have
that formatting.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:20:00.290
They would show up as standard
blue links in Search results.

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:04.280
Also for news content, if you
offer subscription-based access

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.420
to your website or if users
need to register for access,

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.910
there's a guideline that's
specific to implementing

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:15.050
structured data for subscription
and pay-walled content.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:17.840
If your site is marked up
with structured data in AMP,

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.660
following the standards
for the type NewsArticle,

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.960
and also follows the Google
News index guidelines,

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.792
you could apply to be
included in Google News.

00:20:27.792 --> 00:20:29.250
So now I'm going
to hand it to Zach

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.190
to talk to you about how to
leverage structured data markup

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:33.285
for your podcast content.

00:20:37.227 --> 00:20:38.310
ZACHARY SENZER: All right.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:41.930
So let's walk
through an example.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.660
This is how NPR'S
"Planet Money" podcast

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.360
appears in the Actions
directory and Google

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:51.140
Search, which was all generated
with some simple markup.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.240
By structuring your
podcast content,

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.340
you can enable your
podcast to appear in Google

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.800
Search results along
with individual episode

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.080
descriptions and even
an embedded player

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.110
for each episode.

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.750
Additionally, your content
may be automatically turned

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.480
into an Action on the Google
Assistant with a dedicated

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.030
page in the Actions directory.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.640
In order for your podcast
to be properly indexed,

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.820
you'll need to first expose a
valid RSS feed that conforms

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.520
to RSS 2.0 specifications.

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.030
Second, ensure that your feed
has at least one episode.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.940
And third, have a dedicated
home page for your podcast

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.190
that points to your RSS feed.

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:30.670
We'll now cover the essential
podcast level, episode level,

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.410
and home page
markup requirements

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:37.130
to make sure that your
content is set up for success.

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.200
This code shows the
podcast level tags

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.650
that need to get configured
for your podcast's RSS feed.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:45.800
This example takes us to the
markup for NPR'S "Planet Money"

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.120
podcast.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.920
First, make sure that
you have a tag that

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.690
defines your podcast title.

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:53.210
Here, this is "Planet Money."

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.890
The only two other
requirements are

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:57.440
tags that define your
podcast home page along

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.620
with episode tags,
which we'll cover next.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.330
Optionally, you
can also add tags

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:05.900
that state the author,
description, image, category,

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.650
and language for your podcast.

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:12.500
These are the episode-level
tags in your podcast's RSS feed

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:14.540
that would then need
to get configured.

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.520
The only two requirements
here are the title

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.130
of the episode and
an enclosure tag,

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:22.490
which points to the URL of
the episode's audio file.

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:24.110
Optionally, you
can also configure

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:27.170
a description, publication
date, duration,

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:31.210
and more for each episode.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:33.700
The last step is to make
sure that your podcast has

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.800
a home page that very
clearly describes

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.570
what the podcast is about.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.570
NPR'S page for "Planet
Money" is shown here.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:42.550
Make sure that this page
has a link that points

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:44.620
to your podcast's RSS URL.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.840
And then once that's all
set up, you're on your way

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.630
towards being optimized for
both Google Search and Google

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:55.160
Assistant just by
configuring a few RSS tags.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.350
So we just reviewed
structured data markup.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:01.330
Now, the next big opportunity
is to then claim your page.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:04.090
Claiming your Action will
unlock three key capabilities

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:05.110
for you--

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:08.530
first, the ability to modify
your directory listing;

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.530
second, the ability to view
analytics on your Actions

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:14.950
performance; and then third,
the opportunity for improved

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:18.877
ranking and discovery.

00:23:18.877 --> 00:23:21.460
Here's the directory page that
was created for Barrie's recipe

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.100
content using structured markup.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.860
Once a directory page is
created for your content,

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.020
you'll be able to
claim the Action simply

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:30.700
by creating a project
on the Actions

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:32.510
on Google Developer
Console, which

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.680
is the hub for creating,
managing, and optimizing

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.480
your Actions.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.000
Shown here, the Actions on
Google Developer Console

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.460
is the place where you'll be
able to manage your Actions

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:44.844
after you claim them.

00:23:44.844 --> 00:23:46.510
Once you claim, you'll
notice that there

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:49.370
is a dedicated section for
you to modify your directory

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:50.720
information.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.790
You can use the Console
to change up your images

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.920
and descriptions to
more accurately reflect

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.465
your Actions and its content.

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.240
Additionally, once your
Actions are claimed,

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:04.039
you'll even be able to view
these analytics in the Console.

00:24:04.039 --> 00:24:05.830
The Console can help
you to quickly monitor

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:08.920
your Action's star ratings over
time along with directory page

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.670
views.

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:14.340
For claimed Actions, users
will have the ability to rate

00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:16.950
and submit written
reviews for your content.

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:20.140
This is all accessed using
the Actions directory.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.200
So, for example, this is
how ratings and reviews

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.408
will appear on the directory
page for Barrie's recipe

00:24:24.408 --> 00:24:25.500
content.

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.930
User reviews are one of
many quality indicators

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:30.210
that are used to impact ranking.

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:32.190
Most importantly, though,
ratings and reviews

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.590
are benchmarks that
users depend on when

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:37.410
looking for authentic
and relevant feedback.

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:40.170
All of this functionality
is accessible simply

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:41.990
by using structured data markup.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:47.380
Now that we just covered
claiming your Action,

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:50.040
let's discuss by how creating
a custom conversational

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.830
Action you can take
advantage of the best

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:55.470
that both Actions on Google
and the Google Assistant

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:58.630
have to offer.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:01.360
So you can either use markup
to optimize your existing

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.940
content for a more
assistive experience,

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:07.000
or you can decide to build
custom Actions with a much more

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.520
conversational and AI focus.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.950
To take full advantage
of the Google Assistant,

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:16.000
the best path is to build a
custom conversational Action.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.640
We'll now discuss the
thought process, rationale,

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.910
and overview of creating
these custom Actions.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:23.560
To start, you will
most likely need

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.240
to revisit your
content's identity

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.010
for the AI-first world.

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:29.560
Your Action will need
more than just graphics.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.750
It will need a fully
developed personality.

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:36.010
So, for example, is your
content funny or serious?

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:38.025
What voice will
represent your content?

00:25:38.025 --> 00:25:39.820
And how can you
tailor the personality

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:44.050
of your Action to stand out in
a conversational environment?

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:47.080
Users are not just looking
to access your website

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.010
in an audio form.

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.034
The more rich your
conversational interaction,

00:25:53.034 --> 00:25:54.700
the more we can then
suggest your Action

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.590
to increase discovery.

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.350
The Assistant learns from the
directory and other information

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:01.480
about which Actions may
be best for assisting

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.370
the user with their needs.

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.800
So rather than needing to
include your brand's name,

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.510
your content may be
recommended to the user.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:10.300
Our goal is to
recommend Actions that

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.670
provide users with a really
high-quality end-user

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:13.800
experience.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.910
And the best way to
create this more tailored,

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:19.210
branded experience is to visit
the Actions on Google Developer

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:22.990
Console and create a
custom Action from scratch.

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:25.520
Many providers, both
large and small,

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.747
have elected to go the
custom Action route.

00:26:27.747 --> 00:26:29.830
We've been working with
partners like Food Network

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:32.500
to enhance their user
experience with custom Actions.

00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:42.289
So as you see here, Food
Network's custom Action

00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:43.080
is being triggered.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.121
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Hi, I
can help you find recipes

00:26:45.121 --> 00:26:46.590
by name, ingredient, or chef.

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:47.940
What would you like?

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.707
ZACHARY SENZER: What's on now?

00:26:50.707 --> 00:26:52.540
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Right
now on Food Network,

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:55.810
we've just started an episode
of "The Pioneer Woman."

00:26:55.810 --> 00:27:00.220
"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives" is
coming up at 11:00 AM Pacific.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:03.470
You can ask for episode
details or for recipes.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:04.395
Which would you like?

00:27:04.395 --> 00:27:06.353
ZACHARY SENZER: How about
some episode recipes?

00:27:08.586 --> 00:27:10.710
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Recipes
from "The Pioneer Woman,"

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:11.850
the middles.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:13.100
ZACHARY SENZER: The first one.

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:17.742
GOOGLE ASSISTANT:
Bow-tie skillet Alfredo.

00:27:17.742 --> 00:27:19.450
ZACHARY SENZER: Email
it to me for later.

00:27:22.045 --> 00:27:22.920
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: OK.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.940
I've just sent this recipe
to your email address.

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:26.730
"Dee-lish."

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:27.980
What else can I help you with?

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:33.680
ZACHARY SENZER: Food Network's
custom conversational Action,

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.740
which you just experienced,
helps users find inspiration

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.830
in the kitchen across
devices with both displays

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:43.010
and eyes-free surfaces
such as Google Home.

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.590
Not only can users find recipes
from their favorite chefs

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.680
and shows, but they can
also send recipes via email

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.750
and see upcoming show times.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.520
Food Network optimizes
their content

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.460
for the conversational world and
creates several opportunities

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.020
for reengagement.

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.959
First, users can ask when
their show is on air.

00:27:59.959 --> 00:28:02.000
Then, they can ask for
the recipe currently being

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.350
prepared on the show.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.120
And then finally,
they'll have the ability

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:09.200
to share the recipe outside
of Assistant to enjoy later.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.030
In natural language,
all elements

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.890
of a conversational
flow are usually

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:16.460
woven together in a coherent
thread that includes context.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:19.550
Food Network helps guide
users to relevant information

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:21.200
and anticipates their behavior.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.860
This is the new Actions on
Google Developer Console, which

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.960
makes it easier than
ever to create custom

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.414
Actions for your content.

00:28:31.414 --> 00:28:32.830
When you create a
project, you can

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:36.230
choose from several categories
that will tailor your workflow.

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:38.140
So whether you're a
podcast provider trying

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.990
to allow new users to
discover your content

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:44.290
or a news provider attempting
to reengage with your followers,

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:45.940
the Actions on Google
Developer Console

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:49.900
is the place to get started.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.370
The Console's
workflow glides you

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:53.750
through the different
stages of development.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:55.600
First, set up some
initial information

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:57.790
about how you would
like to be discovered.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:59.260
Build Actions that
will help users

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.060
get things done
with the information

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:03.340
that they both want and need.

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.620
Then test your Actions,
either on devices

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:07.270
or by using our
new web simulator

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:09.400
to run through user flows.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.740
Then deploy your Actions
either to production

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.620
or to limited alpha
and beta audiences.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.510
Then finally,
measure the success

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:20.170
of your Actions with additional
rich analytics on usage,

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:22.470
errors, and discovery channels.

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:28.810
It's as simple as set up, build,
test, deploy, and measure.

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:30.310
There are numerous
surfaces that you

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:32.240
could target with
your custom Actions,

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.060
including those
with audio output

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.350
and those with screen output.

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:37.790
Building custom
Actions will allow

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:41.150
you to tailor the experience
based on the device being used.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:44.180
For devices with screens,
including phones, televisions,

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.540
or smart displays, you can craft
special responses that really

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.650
take advantage of the screen.

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.470
If you're a podcast
provider, consider

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:52.970
showing video clips
and images that

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:55.070
can play alongside the audio.

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:57.470
News and recipe providers
can render rich graphics

00:29:57.470 --> 00:30:01.680
to add even more meaning
to a story or recipe.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.770
However, don't forget
to also optimize

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:05.840
for the eyes and
hands-free experiences

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.702
that speakers have to offer.

00:30:07.702 --> 00:30:09.410
Whether it's getting
ready in the morning

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:11.930
or running out the door to
commute to and from work,

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:13.550
users won't always
have the ability

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.710
to interact with the display.

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:17.900
Users won't have the
time to browse a website

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:20.420
for information if they need
to keep their eyes on something

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:24.480
else or if their hands are full.

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.272
These are critical opportunities
throughout a user's day

00:30:27.272 --> 00:30:29.730
that you'll be able to present
some really key information,

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:31.830
such as news stories
or a brand-new episode

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.972
of your podcast, for example.

00:30:33.972 --> 00:30:36.180
We built the Assistant
leveraging the latest advances

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:40.020
in machine learning, AI, and
natural language processing

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.880
along with Google's
technology stack

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.550
to create a really advanced
assistive experience.

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:46.410
And you too can
leverage this power

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:51.020
while creating your Actions
in a multitude of ways.

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:55.040
To start, Actions are full
of endless opportunities.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.840
You can use our
vast array of cards

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:59.180
to display substantial
onscreen information

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:03.840
in the form of text, hyperlinks,
and images for your content.

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.530
You can also leverage speech
synthesis markup language,

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:11.060
or SSML, to make your
responses even more lifelike.

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.710
Then, play around
with our brand theme

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:16.010
customizations to control your
content's visual appearance,

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:20.840
especially in some of our
beautiful new smart displays.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.300
So here's an example of what
Barrie's custom Action could

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:25.310
look like running
on a smart display

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:27.260
by leveraging theme
customizations that

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.500
were configured in the Actions
on Google Developer console.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.670
This is an awesome
opportunity for Barrie

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:34.970
to show off a nice big
photo of stroopwafels

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:36.560
along with a link
to the full recipe

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:40.390
to truly help her
content stand out.

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:42.940
Actions are personal.

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:44.740
Custom conversational
Actions allow

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.410
you to use Google Assistant's
location and context

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:50.770
awareness alongside account
linking and user storage

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:53.260
to tailor your experiences
for individual users

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:54.850
of your Actions.

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:57.220
If you're a content provider,
the Google Assistant

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.050
presents a special
opportunity for you

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:01.030
to interact with your users.

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.560
The signed-in
nature of Assistant

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.190
will allow you to provide
personalized podcast, recipe,

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:08.590
and news story recommendations.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:11.050
You can also use the Assistant
to augment the content

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:12.820
consumption experience.

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:16.030
For podcast providers, you can
give additional information

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:19.660
about guests and stories being
discussed on a given episode.

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:21.880
If you're a news provider,
use Google Assistant

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.410
to help guide users
and provide them

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:26.170
with augmenting information
about people and places being

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:29.720
discussed along with
relevant recommendations,

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:33.040
such as articles
and news stories.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.840
Barrie can also
leverage personalization

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.900
for the custom Actions
for her recipe content.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.400
So there might be
conversations that

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:43.210
would benefit from knowing
a user's name or location.

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:45.125
Suppose Barrie wants
to suggest to her users

00:32:45.125 --> 00:32:47.500
where they can find and purchase
ingredients and supplies

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.000
for a recipe.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.710
She can also suggest
common ingredients

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:53.740
that might appear in a recipe
or pairing drinks and sides that

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.660
would go well with a recipe.

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:57.190
Barrie could then
use localization

00:32:57.190 --> 00:33:02.600
to provide recipes to her users
in a wide variety of languages.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.240
Actions are reengaging.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.310
With custom
conversational Actions,

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:08.780
you can use Action
links to share

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:12.620
a URL that will deep link users
directly into your Action.

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:15.980
For your content, you can
also implement our updates API

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:19.310
to inform users about
upcoming shows, stories,

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:22.580
and special events using
push notifications.

00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:25.760
The updates API can also allow
Barrie to send daily recipe

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.975
recommendations to her users.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:33.750
Custom conversational Actions
are even transactional.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:35.520
By taking advantage
of our transactions

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.910
API along with account linking,
you can leverage transactions

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:40.890
to allow users to
seamlessly purchase

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:44.610
premium content, merchandise,
and other physical or digital

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:45.917
goods.

00:33:45.917 --> 00:33:48.000
This was just an overview
of the few of the things

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.490
that you could do by
creating custom Actions,

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:52.980
and there is much, much more.

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.870
Even when you're
at best, there's

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:57.805
always room to grow with
custom conversational Actions.

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:02.910
In conclusion,
structured markup in AMP

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:05.220
allows you to take your
existing web content

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:09.090
and optimize it for both Google
Search and Google Assistant.

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:11.730
You will also be eligible for
having a page in the Actions

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:12.940
directory.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.940
In fact, many of
you have already

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:19.520
completed the necessary
markup for your content.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.340
If so, you'll notice
that there is already

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:24.730
a page in the directory for
you to then claim your Action.

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:27.580
Claiming will allow you to
modify your directory listing,

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:30.250
view analytics, and
receive ratings and written

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:33.409
reviews for your content.

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:37.610
However, to go above and beyond
the limitations of markup,

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:40.010
visit the Actions on
Google Developer Console

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:42.800
to create a custom
conversational Action.

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.830
Doing so will allow you to use
many exciting personalization,

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:49.760
reengagement, and transactional
features and APIs as you

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.010
build out your custom Actions.

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:54.961
The opportunities for what you
can create for your content

00:34:54.961 --> 00:34:55.710
are truly endless.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.570
We cannot wait to see what
you can build with custom

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:04.570
conversational Actions to
leverage the full power of both

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:07.180
Actions on Google and
the Google Assistant.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:09.340
And if you haven't
done so already,

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.710
you've also seen how to get
started with structured data

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:14.290
markup and reach Google
Assistant users looking

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:15.760
for answers and
help getting things

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.530
done throughout their day.

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:19.390
To see some really
awesome demos,

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:21.640
go ahead and check out
our Assistant Sandbox

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.460
and attend our office hours
to have one-on-one assistance

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:26.045
with any of your questions.

00:35:26.045 --> 00:35:27.670
Thank you, and we
hope you all continue

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:29.640
to have a really
great Google I/O.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:30.140
