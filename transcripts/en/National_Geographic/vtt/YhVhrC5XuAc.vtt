&gt;&gt; ALBERTO NAVA: I mean, you're always looking
for something new to discover, but we

00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:11.340
didn't know what we were going to find when
we started on that day.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.350
Most of our dives are pretty routine, you
know, you just keep finding more tunnels and

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.410
more tunnels.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.070
But every so often you get lucky and you run
into these discoveries that have been trapped

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.820
there for thousands of years.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.990
We just pop up into this huge void.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.790
It's like if you entered the Grand Canyon
from the side at night.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.460
Everywhere you point your light, there were
animal remains, there were

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.460
human remains.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.780
It was just a pretty good day.

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.300
Eventually my friend points his light toward
this cranium, and all of a sudden we discover

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.580
the most complete and the oldest human remains
found in the Americas.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.400
Imagine the pressure if somebody says, "Okay,
you go pick up the cranium of the oldest human

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.040
remains in America." Your hands start shaking.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.430
You know, what happens if you drop it?

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.970
You know, you're underwater and you're
looking at this cranium and you see these

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.409
dark eye sockets.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:38.220
I have this feeling these eyes have not seen
anything since thousands of years ago.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.010
You're kind of traveling back in time.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.110
In the case of Naia, we have most of her skeleton.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.509
The more amazing thing is that you still have
intact DNA that researchers can extract from.

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.229
So that helps you figure out the migration
history from humans into the Americas.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.240
When we go into this cave, we think that we're
doing this great exploration, but in reality,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.290
the original explorers of this cave were Naia
and her people.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.580
When I have a bad day, either in the jungle
or at home, I compare it with what they struggle.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.970
. . to go and find water, and food, and shelter,
every day.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.010
And they have to fight animals.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.210
You know, they have the saber-toothed cat.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.350
So for me it's easyâ€”if I have a problem,
I just think about them and I'm like, oh,

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.080
my problem, it's not very big.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.900
[laughs]

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.720
Hoyo Negro and Naia are the stars of this
project, and we all work to bring their stories

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.300
light so we understand a little bit better
about where do we come from.
