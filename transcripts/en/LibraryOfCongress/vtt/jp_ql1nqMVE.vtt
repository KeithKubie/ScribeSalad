00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.490
This is the beginning of our
sixth year of the series.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.640
It's been a wonderful
partnership with the summit

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.070

wonderful support of Mary-Jane
Deeb, the chief of this division.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.000

of the great authors we've had come
through here and connect to us,

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.240

from the continent --

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.860
that we want to support and want to
sort of get greater knowledge of.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.670
Big thanks to Mary-Jane
Deeb for doing that.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.920

Mbye Cham.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.190
[ Applause ]

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.490
&gt;&gt; Mbye Cham: Thank you Mary-Jane.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.830
Good afternoon.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.790
It's a distinct pleasure
to be a partner

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.360
in this very important series.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.660
My name is Mbye Cham.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.340
I'm a faculty member at Howard
University in the Department

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.470
of African Studies and
I'm also the Director

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:28.920
of the Title Six National Resource
Center for African Studies,

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:34.940
which is one of 10 Africa
area studies -- Title Six --

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.620
funded by the Department
of Education --

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.550
US Department of Education.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:47.110
It's my distinct honor to
introduce Miss Antjie Krog.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.620
And it is where Antjie
Krog's iconic status,

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.830
as well as South Africa's most
popular critically acclaimed

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:00.370
and politically courageous
poets, began when she was 18

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:06.250
with her first collection entitled,
"Daughter of Jephta," 1970.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.580
Within the next two years she
published a second collection

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.500
entitled, " Januarie-Suite."

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:21.030
Since then she has published
more than 10 volumes of poetry,

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:27.150
much of which has dealt with
love, apatite, the role of women,

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:32.680
and politics of gender and has been
translated into several languages,

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.480
including English and Dutch.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:43.520
Krog started publishing prose in
the 1990s, developing a unique form

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.510
of autobiographical writing,
which combines factual

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.910
and fictional analytical elements.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:55.550
The best known of these is her
account of reporting on the Truth

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.180
and Reconciliation
Commission, entitled,

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.710
"Country of My Skull," 1998.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.480
Some of you may have
seen the film version

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.000
of that, with Samuel Jackson.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.260
It was here first work to
be published in English

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:13.360
and brought her international
recognition.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:19.610
She has also written a play and I'm
going to take a stab at this here

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.210
in Afrikaans; [foreign language].

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.850
How did I do?

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.750
[laughter] I'm sure she
will probably provide a

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.110
translation there.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.080
And this play was performed

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:35.140
at the Arts Festival in
South Africa in 1999.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:46.030
Antjie Krog has also been a
journalist and edited many years --

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.490

independent African journal,

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:57.060
"Die Suid-Afrikaan," cofounded
with Hermann Giliomee in 1984.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.220
She also joined the South African
Broadcasting Corporation, SABC.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:06.120
And for two years contributed
to the radio program, "AM Live,"

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:14.770 position:56%
which she reported on South Africa's
Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:18.420
She's also an academic,
having joined the Arts Faculty

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.850
at the University of
Western Cape in 2004.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.300
Krog's many works,
both poetry and prose,

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:32.210 position:56%
have received almost every award
available in her country for poetry,

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.820
translation, and non-fiction.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.810
Among them, the esteemed
Hertzog Prize for "Lady Anne,"

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:43.080
1989 and for "Synapse," 2014.

The Oliver Shreiner prize for,
"Country of My Skull," 1998.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:55.860
And the Vita Poetry Award for,
"Down to My Last Skin," in 2000.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.690
Internationally she has also
been awarded this second award

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:04.250
from the Hiroshima Foundation
for Peace and Culture as well

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:08.240
as the Open Society Prize from
the Central European University,

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.320
previous winners of which were
Yogen Harbormast [phonetic]

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.400
and Vaklav Havelo.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:18.730
[phonetic] Since 2004 Antjie Krog
has been an extraordinary professor

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:23.690
of literature and philosophy at
the University of the Western Cape.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:27.400
Bucknell University Press
is proud to be the publisher

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.040
of the first English
translation of Antjie Krog's

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.050
"Lady Anne: A Chronical in Verse."

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.930
It's a distinct pleasure
to welcome her to here,

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.600
Library of Congress,
and to this series.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.900
Thank you.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.700
Welcome.

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:56.370
[ Applause ]

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:01.650
&gt;&gt; Antjie Krog: Pero,
[assumed spelling] I feel I lie

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:08.270
because I blatantly indulge
in words and uses Eros.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:15.810
In the face of so much
injustice if poetry perseveres

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.770
as luxury it also becomes a lie.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:25.960 position:56%
I live on the other side of
injustice, therefore I have the time

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:30.370
to tune chords precisely
around the private gland.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:31.770
And why not?

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:35.590
This country has already
been ruined.

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.290
Then the order comes.

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:42.130
"Words should be AK47s,
should always fight.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:47.680
Poetry should be useable, DEET,
relate the struggle, take sides.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.670
Weeds are mightier than roses."

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:55.490
Tortured poetry grows
wild in phonetic rain.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:12:02.920
How can I safeguard this poem
against the stupidity of politics?

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.890
Distressed I stand,
looked upon with suspicion,

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.410
my most ordinary words refused.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:17.990
But I'm ashamed by the
poet's unheard of poetry,

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:21.560
which screams on the
other side of all breath.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:28.160
There, will your eyes stop
now gravel road spasa?

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.490
[phonetic] Someone may have
disappeared before dawn.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:36.240
The wind moves as if in war.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.360
Children kick a ball in the
townships where three quarters

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:46.710
of the world lives and waits,
rightly so, for equality.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:52.320
Shy like you, brave or
stupid, or perhaps all

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.620
of really lazy and corrupt like us.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:01.460
From the hands hangs
this treacherous carpet

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:06.430
of hope and hunger and dream.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:11.110
But the poet stands aside.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:16.400
He hears of the petitions;
Moses, motions of injustice.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.660
He has stopped writing poems.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.240
No poetry.

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:27.600
The thoughtful poet stands
smoke blue with cold.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.770
Barely audible she
repeats her arrest.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.710
Her sentences melt from her tongue.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.460
Not in print.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.530
Not in photographs.

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:41.910
Not in statistics.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.850
Every fear it is damp.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:52.170
Rumors of disappearances,
torture, and anonymous deaths.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:57.850
The struggle filters through
with inaudible fierce noises,

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:05.130
into the shady suburbs and we
have become a country of rumors.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:11.430
If my senses cannot wean the
cries from the leaves or the blood

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:15.200
from the barricades of
grossities or pick up murder

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.520
from the blockades near my desk I
will die hardened in the crossfire

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:26.080
of pencil and paper, which
always fight back to the truth.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.100
All the writers are
dead aren't' they?

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:34.440
They can't write about
or of the oppressed.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:39.570
And the oppressed writer
is drowning in anger.

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.560
This is what's being said.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.330
Aesthetics is the only ethic.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:53.730
They say as well, "But the demands
do not tolerate neutral ground."

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:58.670
Between evils I choose nothing.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:04.460
I was born of a guilt
of greed and scorn

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:09.030
where I felt myself at times apart.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:18.420
A hedge between myself and
them, myself and the slaughter,

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:26.550
nothing ever prepared me for hunger
and homelessness, lanklessness.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:31.650
I tried to find a bridge,
but everything is burning

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:35.220
and I'm looking for a guide.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.180
Beware of propaganda,
rhetoric, coarse change of words

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:43.650
under the whip of lies without
even the charm of consciousness.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.170
Is aesthetics ever useful?

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:52.020
I never stopped studying survival.

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.320
With this fragile,

00:15:54.320 --> 00:16:00.380
most light-hearted category I
diligently investigate every

00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.340
relation to breathe.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:07.610
Yes, to breathe.

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:16.910
The language has never been
useless or fake, but only --

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:22.760
although the poet may desire
indulgence and the procreation

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:28.320
of political words,
the injustice is real.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.790
And whatever I write,
which will survive,

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:40.970
sprouts from this very futile
clash between luddite and lie.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:50.230
So to find the bridge I
tried to find a metaphor

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:54.890
in terms of Lady Anne Lindsay.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:17:02.680
In 1797 Lady Anne's husband, Andrew
Barnard, was sent to the Cape

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.300
of Good Hope as secretary
to Lord Macartney,

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:10.400
the first British Governor
of the Cape Colony.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:13.420
Barnard was given this post
by the Secretary of War

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.840
in Colonies, Henry Dundas.

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.730 position:56%
Lady Anne was well connected to
both Dundas and the Prince of Wales,

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:25.680
accompanied her husband and became
the First Lady of the Colony

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.750
in the absence of Lord
Macartney's wife.

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:32.460
Her letters and diaries are
filled with acute observations

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:36.700
and assessments of the situations
and people she came across in

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.280
and around the Cape
during her period

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:45.120
of residence from 1797 to 1802.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.640
She also produced hundreds
of drawings and paintings,

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.330
of which most are in
Balcarres House,

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:55.420
her ancestral home in Scotland.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:18:05.090
So the volume opens with her
on ship on her way to Cape town

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:08.110
and it's a letter to Henry Dundas.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:13.950
Who is it that bloody-well
sends me downwards

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.490
to the south to foreign soils?

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:20.970
And above all, why?

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:24.140
Fabricated from an
abundance of stains

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:30.280
and knobs my highland
origin always matters to me.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:35.450
Stony gators and mist,
an intimacy there

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:41.130
where water lists the
only reflection.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:46.260
Like you sir, I was
purified for castles.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:51.980
On deck, under my blanket,
my senses sting.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:57.610
I am suspended grim swine in
the rigging of sound and salt.

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:04.860
My fingers fondle blocks of amber,
carmine and new cinnabar marked

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:11.990
down by Newman's in London to pound
this retched life of yours and mine

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:20.410
into dignity, into blains
of poetry and paint.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:25.130
Suddenly, out of the sea,
slightly to one side,

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:33.210
a parasol of crystal
shimmering over skin of a whale.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.900
My husband fires his gun, a jet

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:41.080
of bubbles vibrates
thunderously from a spout.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.260
Will this whale surface sheariously
[phonetic] beneath the ship

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:51.320
so that we tumble, sucked into a
vortex with blank-eyed animals,

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:56.180
sails billowing under
water, wobbling deck,

00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:01.260
cannon snouts pointing upwards
under fleeces of hair --

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:06.740
mine a blond, combless
fern of fin in a ring

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:12.890
of roses slowly sinking
to the dregs.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:23.010
But of course I find her
quite useless as a guide.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:30.280
I wanted to live a second life
through you, Lady Anne Barnard,

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:34.540
show it is possible to
hone truth with the pain,

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:42.150
to live an honorable life within
so much privilege, weave a language

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:47.380
of revolution and conspiracies,
liberate slaves,

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.380
clinically plunder royalty,
and with your expedition

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:56.000
through the interior, cleave
the Boors to the bone.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.280
But from your letters you
immerge, hand on the hip,

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:04.280
talented but a frivolous fool.

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:11.040
Then in crafty ink, snob, naive
liberal, being swayed away

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:16.240
from your principles by your
useless husband's pampering.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.960
You never had real pluck and now

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:24.220
that your whole puerile life has
arrived on my desk I go berserk.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.950
As metaphor my lady, you
are not worth a fuck!

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.960
An inscription in her
journal, from --

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.360
she lived in the castle of the
Good Hope and when ships came

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.880
in they brought letters from
families and newspapers, etcetera

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.540
and you can send something
back to your families.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:59.870
From the ship anchoring to the
side I hastily prepare parcels

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:01.290
and letters.

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:06.350
The coming and going of ships,
high ranking officers movements lie

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:10.010
like an umbilical cord
to the castle.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:17.060 position:56%
Sweeping my eye across Table Bay has
become second nature and the thrill

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:22.120
of locking my door and
slowly, mouthful by mouthful,

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:28.660
tasting the post, the latest
in newspapers, letters,

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:34.630
the written word the only
harbor of the travelling heart.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:39.800
But then the smell hits us.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:47.070
Unearthly, so putrid, it seems
the most primordial of stenches.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:52.250
"It's coming from the
bay," says the cook.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:58.550
But by midday everyone knows, a
slave ship is unlawfully looking

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:03.720
to put to land 609 Congolese.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.340
My husband suspects
the hold is underwater.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.820
A few have drowned.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:17.760 position:56%
Rice, nuts, manioc is finished and
the obviously greedy upstart captain

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:23.300
of the ship implies that
Governor Young planned it all,

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:28.990
while he apparently hissed, "Did
you have to hang this maggots nest

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:32.340
for all and sundry
at the Cape to see?"

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:38.800
But why does it smell so?

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:44.170
"Annie, in the ship," this
is my stalwart husband,

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:49.260
"they are lying row
upon row, packed,

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:56.810
shackled to form full three
strings, shelf upon shelf.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:03.170
The doctor does not dare go down
because of diarrhea, heat, stench,

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:08.060
and the deck, slippery
from mucus and blood."

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:20.080
I turn the dessert spoon over and
over on the tablecloth, silver,

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:28.010
expensively heavy, and catch myself
for days staring from every window

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:31.100
at the doomed ship in the bay.

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:38.340
At dusk a lament drifts towards
the castle, a kind of howl,

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:44.790
subbing from that abdomen of
that pleading cargo of misery.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:52.210
Through my telescope I see on the
deck shackled groups swaying to

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:58.250
and fro in a macabre
treaty against death.

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:05.020
A shoal of fins circling the
ship, waiting for the stiff tussle

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:10.180
of bodies cut loose every
morning and thrown overboard.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:20.970
After I had seen that for many days
my brain rushed forth with a dim

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:28.260
and determined sense of
unknown modes of suffering.

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:35.410
In my thoughts was a darkness, call
it solitude, a blank desertion,

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:39.760
know familiar shapes of
trees, of sea or sky,

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:47.530
no colors of green fields, but huge
and mighty forms that do not live

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:53.130
like living men move slowly
through my mind by day

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:58.210
and were the trouble of my dreams.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:02.940
Haunt me. Haunt me like a fever.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:22.130
This poem's about the first state
of emergency in South Africa,

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:25.260
not the second state of
emergency in South Africa.

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:33.400
So the bard that writes about Lady
Anne has to account in her own way

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:39.770
for the things that are
happening in her own life.

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:42.270
And how do you write?

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:46.280
How do you hold yourself as a poet

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:52.830
and as a privileged white
person accountable in that time?

00:26:53.950 --> 00:27:05.820
So Lady Anne then goes back
to the -- just a second.

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:14.940
Sorry, I'm just trying
to get the right poem.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:22.060
She goes -- they go back to England
and then her husband gets a job

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:24.010
to come back to Cape Town.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.930
She is very anxious because
they don't have money

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:29.790
that she can go back with him.

00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:32.930
So he has to go alone.

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:37.250
But I want to conclude
the bard's story

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:41.970
with a poem about the soul fish.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:47.300
And the soul fish is a -- in
Afrikaans we call it a tongue fish,

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.360
but the soul is born like this.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:55.450
It moves down to the bottom
because it gets eaten.

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:59.470
So to escape being
eaten it moves down.

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:03.200 position:56%
The one part becomes the other part.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:07.630
The one eye moves from the
one side to the upper side.

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:09.350
The mouth changes.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:14.180 position:56%
The upper side then becomes darkened
and so that fish then survives

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:19.220
on the bottom because
it has adapted.

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:25.700
So I have written a poem about
my children and this image

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:29.560
of the soul fish which Lady Anne

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:34.010
for the first time describes
in one of her diaries.

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:38.760
The light over my desk
streams into darkness.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:42.410
I await my visitors on paper.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:48.200
My four children, finely
balanced between anal and dorsal,

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:54.360
tiny fins at the throat,
constantly stirring,

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.690
their eyes uncommonly soft.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.640
In the shallow, brackish
water your mother treads,

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.280
playing with the metaphors.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:08.100
Come here across dictionaries
and blank pages.

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:14.160
How I love this delicate little
school, these fish of mine

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:19.110
in their four strong
flotilla lured so close now.

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:23.560
What should I feed you?

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:28.830
Dear child of the lean
flank, yield to the seabed.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:34.480
Yes, the stretching makes you
ache, but mother holds you to her.

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.190
Mother is here.

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:43.240
The eye beneath, like father's
wondrous blue, migrates cautiously

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:47.670
with a complex bunching
of nerve and muscle

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:52.170
until it's up beside the other.

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:56.530
Pert little mouth, almost
pulled out of shape,

00:29:56.530 --> 00:30:01.220
with time the tongue will
settle in its groove.

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:04.190
Pigment of the upper
flank begin to darken.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:12.470
And up to the surf between sand and
stone you lie, meshed with bedrock

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:18.190
and never again to
pray or take flight.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:23.190
I press my mouth against
each distended face.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:27.710
Mother knows you will
survive the tide.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:41.450
Lady Anne lets her husband then go
alone and she worries about him.

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:43.050
She writes a letter from London.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:45.650
Where will this letter
find you, best beloved?

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:50.950
If I could choose again I would not
have you return you to the Cape.

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:55.660
May fair winds attend you
and blow you back soon.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:59.740
I travel everywhere with a
small picture of your face.

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:02.750
At times your eyes look saddened.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:07.960
And I think about you in the warm
Cape and memories of that mountain,

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.030
that seven foot percolate up,

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:15.220
and how I took all the
wrong tubes of watercolor.

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:21.200
Oh, how I -- misjudged that
brutal and blissful light.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.500
Look after yourself.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.930
I miss you.

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:29.580
My days are ailing without you.

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.280
He writes back.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.590
I shudder when I think what
space there is between us.

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:38.890
Pray for me sometimes dearest love.

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:42.770
I never fail to do so for you.

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:44.590
Andrew Barnard.

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:55.470
And then of course he dies
there and she gets the message.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:32:01.780
The six walnut trees in pots and my
hands dirty when the message came.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:04.060
But how could it be?

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.510
I had a letter yesterday.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:06.810
How can it be?

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:11.970
How can it be that that day passed
over me as if it was any other day

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:14.010
that I sleep, have tea, laugh,

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:18.970
add water while half
of me is already dead.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:28.680
The slave brought me a handful
of relics that they found

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:33.840
with your body; a locket
with my hair,

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:39.140
the green purse I knitted
for you, your medicine.

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:43.620
You died of fever says the
slave, near Sternenbosh.

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:46.970
[phonetic] The doctor from
the Cape was too late.

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.440
There was no one with you.

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.960
You were buried on the
road to Green Point,

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.970
a small funeral and
wind from the sea.

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:08.630
Tonight everything speaks
through the dead towards me.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:16.830
Your brittle bundle of bones, my
longest loved beloved lies lonely

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:25.660
and longingly cradled
somewhere lost and [inaudible].

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:29.730
I'm overwhelming awake tonight.

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:35.340
Of me so little has become.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:42.670
You are all I had in this
world, beloved deathling.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:47.110 position:56%
Alone and cold it is behind my ribs.

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:52.500
Africa had me giving up all.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:53.860
It is so dark.

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.950
It is so bleak.

00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:04.840
Soft beloved torture, of
me so little has become.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:08.900
I'm down to my last skin.

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:20.050
[ Applause ]

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:21.590
&gt;&gt; Laverne Page: My
name is Laverne Page.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:27.220
I'm an area specialist here in the
African Middle Eastern Division.

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:32.140
And I work with the Southern
African countries and it's my honor

00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:39.920 position:56%
to be here today to converse with --

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.930
I've been practicing
[foreign language].

00:34:42.930 --> 00:34:50.200 position:56%
[laughing] I studied Afrikaans for
a while years and years ago, oh yes.

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:56.810
So for those of you who don't know
much about the library I would just

00:34:56.810 --> 00:35:01.780 position:56%
like to tell you that we have a
vast collection of research material

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:05.410
about and from the
African Continent.

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:10.200
And within that there's an amazing
amount from and about South Africa

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:15.830
in all formats -- so newspapers,
government publications, films --

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:22.050 position:56%
all topics -- education development,
literature, poetry, drama --

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:27.950
and in the nine official
languages of South Africa --

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:32.790
such as Afrikaans, so the
first language of our speaker.

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:38.960
We have quite a bit of her
work in our collections.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:43.160
If you search our online
catalogue by keyword there are

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:50.870
at least 54 hits of -- for
monograph records -- about her.

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:56.160
So to start off our question
and answer period I'll only ask

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:59.840
for questions because I
know that you have questions

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:01.970
and I want to offer you my time.

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:04.980
So I'll ask four questions --

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:11.860 position:56%
two we always ask and then the other
two I'll start off asking about

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:16.020
"Lady Anne," which was
first published in 1989

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:20.710
and was recently republished
by Bucknell University Press,

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:25.930
the first time a complete volume of
poetry of yours has been translated

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:27.860
from Afrikaans into English.

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:32.800
So I'm wondering if you could
tell us how you used Lady Anne

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:39.080
as a metaphor to talk about
social issues of the 1980s

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:44.390
and how do you the present English
poems speak to continuing issues

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:48.470
of power, class, privilege,
and racial injustice

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:50.060
that disfigure our world?

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.350
--

00:36:52.350 --> 00:37:00.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Antjie Krog: Thank you for such
an honor [inaudible] African writers

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:01.640
that [inaudible].

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:08.750
Lady -- at the end of the 80s --

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:12.790
that was before the [inaudible]
of Nelson Mandela [inaudible].

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:19.470
The issue was the discrepancy,
the difference, between white

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:21.020
and black, rich and poor.

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:25.150
And it was the whites were
[inaudible] the black or whatever.

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:30.200
So the volume is obsessed
with; how do you deal

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:34.500
with the whites standing
of privilege?

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:41.730
So I'm trying to use her I think
to deal with that and I abused her.

00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:49.910
There are -- I appropriate
her, which if she was black

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:56.200
or if she was not white and
royalty would have been a problem,

00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.300
but since the British kills her
maybe [inaudible] I can't feel

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.600
too bad.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.900
[inaudible] Yes, that
is how I [inaudible].

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:15.270
Then Nelson Mandela happened and
I was a bit ashamed of this poem

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:18.920
because it was talking
about these top issues

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:24.910
and here was this unbelievably
wonderful, forgiving period.

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:31.250
And -- but when I retranslate --
when I translated them now yeah,

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:33.160
I realize; no, it was just a poem.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:37.000
It was a wonderful poem.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.460
[inaudible] that we
are still at that point

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.270
and that issue will
now be fought out.

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:47.890
&gt;&gt; Laverne Page: Okay, thank you.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:51.100
I'd like to ask you
something about language,

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:55.900
which is a very sensitive
issue everywhere.

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:59.850
I was told that you are
passionately committed

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:02.280
to the indigenous languages.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:05.150
So I'm wondering what that means.

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:09.910 position:56%
South Africa has nine official
languages and most, it appears to me

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:12.320
in written form, are not thriving.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.610
So are they endangered?

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:22.080
At one point our division had to be
quite selective in what we acquired

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.680
in Afrikaans because
there was really

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.060
so much material that was coming.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:31.930
Now it's less and less.

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:35.260
And I'm wondering if it
appears that way to you too,

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:38.730
that there's less Afrikaans
literature that's being produced?

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:44.670
So my question is; is
Afrikaans endangered?

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:46.550
&gt;&gt; Antjie Krog: Afrikaans
literature?

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:49.110
Is it endangered?

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:51.070
Okay, maybe just divert

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:56.140
to the [inaudible] poem [inaudible]
then I'll come to the second poem.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:40:00.200 position:56%
[laughing] The University of Western
[inaudible] seeing a large project

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:06.490
that's received by the National
Institute of Humanities Research.

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:14.180
To translate classical text from
indigenous languages into English

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:18.320
and the classical text has
been identified by scholars

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:24.860
in those areas of languages.

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:31.200
And so two novels from closer
variety [inaudible] famous

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.790
[inaudible] constantly are
quoted from, but 90 percent

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:43.090
of the people -- you know
even people who speak situtu,

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:46.650
[phonetic] are -- don't
necessarily [inaudible].

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:50.550
So those two novels
are being translated.

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:55.380
There's two novels in Zulu, also
a classical one by [inaudible]

00:40:55.380 --> 00:41:00.350
and then another one that is
more current, about the fight

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:02.610
between the [inaudible],
they are wonderful,

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:07.500
wonderful thriller of
a novel [inaudible].

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:14.750 position:56%
And another novel in Situtu -- a
play in Situtu and then an anthology

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:19.200
of poems from those languages.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.860
And what all those texts have
in common is wideness either

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:26.390
in the back of it or
it's encroaching

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:34.240
or it is already eroding.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:40.710
So it's -- African intellectuals
who are educated, could write well,

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:48.080
were read and they were
responding, I want to say,

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.980
to the black era of that language.

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:55.330
You see it was a strange time in
South Africa where you could feel

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:58.500
that people were writing
for the white era.

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:03.370
Mainly explanations and
mainly -- and this is --

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:06.330
it's absolutely fantastic
text and I'm not sure

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:08.240
if it's this what they [inaudible]
[laughter] Afrikaans is --

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:14.500
was for many years already
in language with English.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.230
It had a [inaudible]
who supports English.

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:21.090
You know English is
supported by the world.

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:25.900
So you don't -- a government
need not support English.

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:31.110
So the apatite [inaudible]
supported Afrikaans,

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:35.150
dictionaries were excellent.

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:42.160
You know we had our own
newspapers, we have two

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.040
or three publishing houses.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:53.170
We have our own universities,
etcetera.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:43:01.270
Now that has changed after
1994 because the table now has

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:05.640
to be shared with the
non-indigenous languages

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.470
and that has had several
consequences.

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:15.640
Well, maybe we publish less, but
I think art that is being written

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:19.590
in Afrikaans is very,
very interesting.

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:21.810
It's -- there are voices
-- because Afrikaans --

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:32.610
60 percent of Afrikaans
speakers are not white, hey?

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:39.430
It's -- in South Africa they
would be termed "colored."

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:42.500
Here we -- I'm not sure, but
-- so they speak Afrikaans,

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:44.520
they're not white,
and they are derived

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:47.670
from other areas --
from another background.

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:48.970
And [inaudible] coming from that.

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:50.270
&gt;&gt; Laverne Page: Okay.

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:51.570
Okay, thank you.

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:52.870
To get to the two questions that
relate to African literature

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:54.170
in general, I would like know

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:55.470
who your favorite new South
African poets and writers are.

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:57.770
And what do you think makes
their work distinctly African?

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:06.010
&gt;&gt; Antjie Krog: [inaudible] let
me just start with [inaudible].

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:12.040
There's a young poet takes us
between old [inaudible] poet.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:18.890
[inaudible] She performed
[inaudible] But some effectively --

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:23.310
and such -- had built up such a
fan-base and she didn't even mind

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:24.680
that she was not published
or whatever.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:28.880
And then one day someone had
heard her and contacted her

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.670
and said, "Anyone published you?"

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:33.620
"No." And so he has published her.

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:38.650 position:56%
It's a small, tiny print and gave
money to publish [inaudible] poetry.

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:47.080
And before the book came out
there were already 2,000 orders.

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.660
&gt;&gt; Laverne Page: And that press is?

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:49.960
&gt;&gt; Antjie Krog: June.

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.260
[assumed spelling]

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.560
&gt;&gt; Laverne Page: That's okay.

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.860
&gt;&gt; Antjie Krog: That's okay.

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:56.180
Her name is Kolega Putuma.

00:44:56.180 --> 00:45:00.990 position:56%
[phonetic] And she is an oror
[phonetic] before who also writer --

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:10.880
of course [inaudible] She is
bringing a non-easy remembering

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.920
of the past.

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:15.940 position:56%
So it's not always that the past was
perfect or the past was just bad.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:18.740
That's a very complex situation.

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:23.760
Then we have wonderful writers.

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:30.140
And in our language and in English
our rappers and poets of the word

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.770
on one side, on the
other side are poets

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:34.670
of the page and poets of the stage.

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:36.740
It's a very big division.

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:43.150
But in Afrikaans we've managed
to keep everybody impressed.

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:48.490
And so there are some
wonderful rappers in Afrikaans.

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:50.800
It's a wonderful [inaudible].

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:58.140
He's a tall guy and he just -- it
just thumps out under [inaudible].

00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:01.280
Yes. We have -- and yes.

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:07.980
[inaudible] a wonderful, young
black students who now are

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:12.660
at top universities are
writing their experience

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:16.980
of being trapped in
this also privilege.

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:19.280
And you know it.

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:25.920
And don't feel easy about it.

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:30.440 position:56%
Feel in one way they earn it and in
another way they can't live with it.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.160
&gt;&gt; Laverne Page: Oh, thank you.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:37.170
Right. Okay, lastly; what
do you think is the future

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:39.640
for African literary writers?

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:42.890
Both diasporic and
from the continent?

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:46.640
And what steps need to be
taken to bring more recognition

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:48.970
from the international community?

00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:54.390
&gt;&gt; Antjie Krog: I once
asked them [inaudible]

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:55.690
Who is English language spies?

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:56.990
Who goes out and says,
"This book needs

00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:59.480
to be translated into English"?

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:09.090
And they looked at me and
said, "They will find us.

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:10.390
They will find us."

00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:13.870
As if suggesting that good books
were being translated into English,

00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:17.300
it's not necessary to go
out there and find them.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:23.350
I think that's one of the
problems that people who buy books

00:47:23.350 --> 00:47:25.250
or who advertise books or whatever,

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:28.340
they don't go out to
look what is available

00:47:28.340 --> 00:47:31.840
in indigenous languages
as well as English.

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:36.130
And at least these texts
that are now being translated

00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:39.770 position:56%
that I think there are so many other
books from South Africa like Shocka,

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:41.780
[phonetic] or Thomas
Bufulmu [phonetic],

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:46.140 position:56%
the lynch man from Peter Malensbook.

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:49.140
[phonetic] The two -- the only
two books that have been written

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:51.620
in an indigenous language
that have been classed

00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:55.250
as the top 100 books written by
Africans in the twentieth century.

00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:58.110
That is actually a fantastic list.

00:47:58.110 --> 00:48:05.510
And one most successful books
have in common I think is

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:07.960
to -- is another anthology.

00:48:11.330 --> 00:48:13.200
The world is bankrupt, hey?

00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:20.210
And the whole issue of humanity
is bankrupt, mostly in the world.

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:22.550
And from that continent comes text

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:27.960
that provides an alternative
to that.

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:30.980
It's not necessarily respected

00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:39.020
because in many ways the world
kneels down to individualism

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:42.390
to [inaudible] and to a
richness and all of that.

00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:49.680 position:56%
And here is another completely other
way of looking at life and at nature

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.980
and at the cosmos that I think --

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.340
People are starving for.

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:06.520
Laverne Page: Well --
[laughter] Thank you.

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:08.950
I've had my turn.

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:14.860
Now would you like
to ask a question?

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:17.160
Okay.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:28.510
&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you very
much for your readings.

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:32.720
I'm curious about the
writings that is done

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.090
in Afrikaans by the author Kans.

00:49:34.090 --> 00:49:37.210
[assumed spelling] Does
it reflect some kind

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:43.630
of [inaudible] Does it embrace
the presence or is it used

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:54.160
by the African artist as a
resistance to the present?

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:58.380
&gt;&gt; Antjie Krog: Oh, that's
such a good question.

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:00.180
And [inaudible] And [inaudible]
What I'd say now is for Afrikaans,

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:08.880
as well as for English, we
also [inaudible] So he writes

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.180
about [inaudible] So
most people write

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:17.120
about the parts they are
being resistant to the parts

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:21.640
because that's a part of
South Africa they think,

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:25.040
"Oh, I understand well."

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:37.040
So I -- everyone can be
-- everyone understands.

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:45.730
There's one Afrikaans writer
that writes about now.

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:51.490
He has [inaudible] and he does a
[inaudible] And he is [inaudible]

00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:54.830
And he writes [inaudible]
I think he's [inaudible]

00:50:54.830 --> 00:51:02.500
And that is the closest
you might come to one

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:10.200
of these [inaudible] There's no
other [inaudible] Sometimes people

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:17.040
will imagine a place where
[inaudible] doesn't work it just --

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:20.800
if you write [inaudible]
it's actually white people

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:28.150
but just black scenes, which then
creates another kind of a problem.

00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:34.180 position:56%
Or, what I found [inaudible] most
famous South African [inaudible] was

00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:37.190
a futuristic hope taking
place in South Africa,

00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:44.130
but because he took a jump
of 14 years he could bring

00:51:44.130 --> 00:51:50.210
in black people, colored
people, white people,

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:58.070
bring it all in under a crisis with
a past that they could [inaudible]

00:51:58.070 --> 00:52:14.330 position:56%
And that's the only remarkable
effort that has come from about now.

00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:17.830
Another thing is [inaudible]

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:32.370
&gt;&gt; I have so many questions.

00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:35.520
I also want to say that [inaudible]

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.820
&gt;&gt; Antjie Krog: Yes.

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.340
&gt;&gt; And [inaudible]

00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:39.640
&gt;&gt; Antjie Krog: I'm very sorry.

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:40.940
[laughter]

00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:45.350
&gt;&gt; But I wanted to ask you about
-- not to get too personal --

00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:49.550
but I wanted to ask you
about the idea of translation

00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:52.150
as being perhaps a
negative political act

00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:54.930
if it were rushing the
[inaudible] into English.

00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:57.850 position:56%
Are we losing their original intent?

00:52:57.850 --> 00:53:00.880
Are we losing the indigenous
languages?

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:03.890
I'd love to hear your
thoughts on that.

00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:08.210
It just seems as though
there's more being published

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:09.800
in these indigenous languages
and it's such an exciting thing.

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.100
Should those be translated
for our consumption?

00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:18.680
&gt;&gt; Antjie Krog: -- My personal
obsession with translation is

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:24.170
when I close my eyes and
when I listen to the South --

00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:27.320 position:56%
what I call the South African sound.

00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:32.790
This is all the literature,
all the poems, all of it.

00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:38.530
Then there's this absence of work
done in the indigenous languages.

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:41.320
Afrikaans is there
and why are we there?

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:43.860
Because we are being translated.

00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:48.880 position:56%
And no one was interested in
translating Afrikaans during apatite

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:51.020
because you had [inaudible].

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:54.770
Since 1994 Afrikaans writers care.

00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:56.790
The publishers are not interested

00:53:56.790 --> 00:54:02.090
in having published every single
writer, pay someone to publish her

00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:05.590
or him into English
and you become part.

00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:09.120
That's how you end it and
now you are part of the sound

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:13.870
of the imagery, of the
stories, of the South African.

00:54:13.870 --> 00:54:18.400
But all night I've been aware
that initially just poetry,

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:24.700
but the older I got about novels
that exist in these languages

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:26.930
that you can't buy
anymore because they're

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:29.250
out of print, no one reads them.

00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:31.170
There's also another
problem that most

00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:34.610
of these indigenous
novels have been written

00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:38.900
in what is called classical post
novel, classical [inaudible].

00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:43.300
And now the African can't read it.

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:45.890
There's also many of the
young black students that go

00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:50.510
to modern city schools where
they learn no indigenous language

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:53.110
and can't read that.

00:54:53.110 --> 00:54:58.860
But this -- so these translations
would bring those voices back

00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:03.730
and maybe create real attention
that, "Okay, let's go there

00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:07.210
and see how badly this
is translated."

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:13.830
You know? Or how truthfully
this is being translated.

00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:17.800
So I -- for me translation
is the act of reconciliation.

00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:21.300 position:56%
It's a way of reaching each other --

00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:26.170
because we have to
have advanced language,

00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:30.360
write a book in which we
can imagine each other.

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:35.050
We can't now because
there's these absences.

00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:39.980
And what I love actually most is
that there's a lot of suspicion

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:44.410
against these early black
intellectuals that they sold out,

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:49.220
that they were under the influence
of missionaries, that all kinds

00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:54.400
of them you don't really
need to know what they say

00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:55.700
because they are tainted.

00:55:55.700 --> 00:56:00.710
You -- and when you read
these -- it's not so bad.

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:03.760
The quality of [inaudible]
is just unbelievable.

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:10.560
The kinds of descriptions and
things [inaudible] So I'm --

00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:15.290
yeah, so it's an important
issue for me and I think maybe

00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:18.780 position:56%
that is the saving grace of English.

00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:24.030
So many other worlds enter it.

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:31.080
And if a country decides not to buy
books translated from Chinese or --

00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:34.980
I don't read books from the East.

00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:36.280
Sometimes I feel [inaudible]

00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.420
in my lifetime is more
than enough, you know?

00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:42.980
I can't accommodate that, you know?

00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:45.270
You -- yeah, and it's wrong, right?

00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:50.960
It's wrong and it's -- you
need to take it all up -- in.

00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:02.320
&gt;&gt; I read that [inaudible] is
kind of the way [inaudible].

00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:05.650
Has any [inaudible] [laughter]

00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:12.230
&gt;&gt; Antjie Krog: Yes, you know
sometimes I feel I could have died

00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:15.260
at 18 because actually I
would have died [inaudible]

00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:21.830
And it's difficult now
there's a scandal [inaudible]

00:57:21.830 --> 00:57:26.480
Because we know what other kinds

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:31.560
of scandals [inaudible] did
survive [inaudible] volume

00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:34.330
on the 18 female body.

00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:42.500
And I was asking a [inaudible]
do you know of any photograph

00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:49.330
of an old woman's body
that is not disgusting?

00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:51.910
And he said to me, "No."

00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:58.530
He can't get older
women to pose for him.

00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:00.460
So I said, "Okay, I have a friend.

00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:01.760
I will ask her."

00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.060
And she lets him.

00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:09.440
And so they go over where they
took an unbelievably beautiful --

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:11.490
and it's not a photo shopping.

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:16.540
It's all the moss, all
the [inaudible] old woman.

00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:22.230 position:56%
So that was on the cover of that
volume, [inaudible] Oh, my goodness.

00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:26.700
The shops didn't want to
put it on the shelves.

00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:32.840
Someone said to me, "How can
I give a volume with this

00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:35.280
on the front cover for my father?"

00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:37.510
Someone else said to me,
"[inaudible] I was too ashamed

00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:39.540
to read it on the plane."

00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:41.710
[laughter] You know?

00:58:41.710 --> 00:58:45.530
Because it's also a
wise old woman's body.

00:58:45.530 --> 00:58:46.830
So now you know.

00:58:46.830 --> 00:58:52.780
I think maybe if it was a black old
woman's body people would feel it's

00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:55.140
a political act [inaudible].

00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:59.860
Now no one cares about
the old woman's body.

00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:03.410
[laughter] So I can --
it also didn't sell well.

00:59:03.410 --> 00:59:10.190 position:56%
Although it's very [inaudible] Which
for me meant a lot that it created

00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:15.260
such -- that people realize how
actually discriminating one is

00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:19.220
to once the older body.

00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:23.740
I may [inaudible] website,
sex between old people,

00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:26.510
and that is truly disgusting.

00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:37.420
[ Laughter ]

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:43.670
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] I noticed that
I happened to be [inaudible]

00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:49.680
And I noticed that Lost
-- I noticed that lots

00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:54.330
of books were [inaudible]
published in South African

00:59:54.330 --> 00:59:57.700
and Afrikaans and English.

00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:05.340
So it's not -- and then I don't
know whether original is Afrikaans

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.660
or in English, you know?

01:00:07.660 --> 01:00:16.820
And so that is, to me,
Afrikaans is not dying.

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.820
It's still there.

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:24.900
And also, one thing
is that I [inaudible]

01:00:24.900 --> 01:00:32.450
and accidentally I ordered
a book that is in Afrikaans.

01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:37.470
So it was translated from
English to Afrikaans.

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:47.160
So that means that still a
lot of people read Afrikaans.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.460
&gt;&gt; Antjie Krog: Yeah.

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:51.370
No, there's a lot of readers
[inaudible] buy the Afrikaans

01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:55.630
speaking book.

01:00:55.630 --> 01:00:58.040
Initially [inaudible] South Africa.

01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.940
[inaudible] 94 was
politically [inaudible]

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:05.360
And in the end I voted back because
they say Afrikaan speakers come in

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:10.510
and are looking for their
books in their language,

01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:17.600
but they most often they find
other books or order English books.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:23.980
But they don't come to your
shop if you don't have a shelf.

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:26.040
So that was it.

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:30.000
The reason why Afrikaans
is under threat

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.020
at this stage is there
was one University left

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:38.750
who taught an Afrikaans [inaudible]
you know you could do anything

01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:40.050
in Afrikaans.

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:43.590
And they decided to step away
from that, that they want

01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:46.550 position:56%
to be more South African University.

01:01:46.550 --> 01:01:49.810
That they want -- yeah,
an English --

01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:51.960
they want to appoint
lectures to someone

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.070
that speaks English and so on.

01:01:54.070 --> 01:01:57.110
And that -- it means that
the third tier function

01:01:57.110 --> 01:02:02.300
of that language is now completely
under threat because people go,

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:08.480
"Why would you go to a
high school in Afrikaans

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:14.640 position:56%
if all universities are in English?"

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:18.920
[inaudible] I want to say
that it has become so strange,

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:24.310
this translation between -- that
some people have written books

01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:27.730
in English and then the
publishing house will say,

01:02:27.730 --> 01:02:32.630
"But this is actually
an Afrikaans story."

01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:40.230
Later it's translated in
Afrikaans because they sell more.

01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:52.880
So because Afrikaan
speakers buy that

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:58.020
and it's [inaudible]
English speakers.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:10.090
So there are some [inaudible] one
famous that was written in English,

01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:21.100
but it was such a free state
book that it was translated

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:33.120
into Afrikaans by the [inaudible].

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:38.820
&gt;&gt; I have [inaudible]
actually [inaudible]

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:44.520
that you did [inaudible] I think
it was on [inaudible] of desire.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:52.690
Where you were making a
statement of [inaudible] Some kind

01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:55.080
of [inaudible] story was
about crime, fear for whites,

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:59.180 position:56%
[inaudible] stories that [inaudible]
promotionally very successful

01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:04.290
[inaudible] So I was wondering
[inaudible] or if you see

01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:11.600
that as a trend [inaudible] writing

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:17.860 position:56%
in South Africa [inaudible] Afrikaan
community [inaudible] interested

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:25.190 position:56%
in film and your [inaudible] what is
your relationship with [inaudible]?

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:38.230
&gt;&gt; Antjie Krog: There's a
[inaudible] before 1994 the writing

01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:42.360
was [inaudible] I have
to say, it's --

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:52.890
since 1990 the decision with
people like Nelson Mandela

01:04:52.890 --> 01:05:02.340
and his first cabinet, people
were [inaudible] were turning

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:12.000
to the bank, turning to their
[inaudible] to find black heritage

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.900
that means something for them.

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:25.320
And there's a [inaudible]
I think you put it, of --

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:33.150
a wave of literature about some
black man or some good person

01:05:33.150 --> 01:05:37.010
in the past who has affected
-- he wasn't even being --

01:05:37.010 --> 01:05:40.460
white children have been
brought up by black women.

01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:46.250
And so there is a whole new
movement of trying to find her.

01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:51.170
You already knew her
white name, where is she?

01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:54.280
And so they found the children

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:57.550
of that person [inaudible]
find photographs.

01:05:57.550 --> 01:06:01.660
There's a website where you
can post photographs of you

01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:02.960
and your black [inaudible]

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.910
and ask whether anyone
knows anything about them.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:18.090
So it's -- I think there's a
desire to redefine one's self

01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:23.420
and redefine one's self as a
profoundly South African person

01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:27.970
and not as a European subject.

01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:44.960
Yeah. And the problem is with
things going so bad [inaudible]

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:52.660
so there are these texts that sell

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:55.610
out [inaudible] Africa
[inaudible] to be resurrected.

01:06:55.610 --> 01:07:02.120
I have no [inaudible] although
Afrikaan [inaudible] There are

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:09.420
mostly all black [laughter]
[inaudible] This is an industry

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:14.090
that creates a lot of jobs.

01:07:14.090 --> 01:07:21.400
It's [inaudible] that
is in Afrikaans.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:29.640
And all of it must include --
if I want to look at it now,

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:37.770
if I want to find something
now it's on television.

01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:47.900
Completely, you know bizarre
but [inaudible] And so on.

01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:50.800
So you find that on TV.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.740
[inaudible] You also
find individual art

01:07:53.740 --> 01:08:03.100
and in music there's a lot
of cross fraternization.

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:11.740
&gt;&gt; Laverne Page: We
should wrap things up now.

01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:15.170
Thank you so much for coming.

01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:16.940
Thank you for coming.

01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:25.670
It has been a very, I think
intriguing session here today.

01:08:25.670 --> 01:08:29.590
Things I've never thought
about, never knew.

01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:35.100
I just think that this was
very good for all of us.

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:37.840
Quite informative.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.090
