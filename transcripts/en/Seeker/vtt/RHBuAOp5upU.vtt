00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.750
I love going to the zoo, you get to see monkeys,
and lions and tigers and bears oh my!

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.840
But are they really such a great thing?

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.430
Hey animal lovers, Julia here for DNews

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.019
I’ve loved zoos my whole life.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.019
Really.

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.160
There was one I remember that made me wanna
want to share how awesome animals are!

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.050
Fast forward a few years and well here I am.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.160
Making videos about science and animals on
the internet.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.510
But now, I’m older, wiser and really ambivalent
about zoos.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.300
Zoos have changed a lot since their conception.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.020
Environments used to be basic, easy to build
and didn’t provide animals with the opportunity

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.720
to interact with their surroundings, which
was detrimental to their health.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.070
Think of classic zoos, animals in a small
cage with nothing but concrete and bars.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.010
Zoos today have changed this practice into
providing “enriched environments” which

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.210
include increasing space, adding natural sound,
and introducing elements of their natural

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.210
environments.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.190
But most of the time changing the cage in
which an animal is held isn’t enough since

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.050
what the animal may find stressful is hard
to assess.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.800
When these stresses go unnoticed the results
can be really bad.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.750
For example the most recent loss was an entire
stingray population at the Chicago Zoo because

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.790
of low oxygen levels in their tanks.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.300
In this case it was a malfunction of the habitats
“life support system” that caused the

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.420
death of four southern stingrays and 50 cownose
rays.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.920
This is the second incident that has taken
place at the Chicago Zoo, in 2008 they lost

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.100
19 stingrays to a heating malfunction and
they have decided to close the exhibit for

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.100
good.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.320
Light and sound also have negative effects
on animals held in captivity.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.150
According to a study published in Applied
Animal Behaviour Science noise levels measured

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.570
in two Northern California zoos had sounds
ranging from 62 to 72 decibels compared to

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.409
the noise levels of a rainforest, which can
average about 27 db.

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.150
Light levels are also higher than they’re
supposed to be, maintaining a low light situation

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.650
keeps animals less aggressive but if you don’t
have any lighting how are you supposed to

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.750
see the animals?

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.400
When it comes to feeding nothing seems easier
than to have your food delivered and served

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.470
but when it comes to lions and other carnivorous
animals getting served zoo slop can actually

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.830
put them in danger.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.020
Researchers at the San Diego Zoo studied cheetahs
and their eating habits while in captivity.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.560
They gave one group the regular zoo cuisine
of ground horse meat with a mix of vitamins

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.850
and minerals but gave a second group thawed
bovine fetus or half of a large carcass.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.470
They noticed the group eating the carcasses
took more time chewing and smelling their

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.850
food than the first group.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.630
Pretty much they acted as they would normally
in the wild, besides the hunting part.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.010
Researchers discovered that processed foods
lack a “hassle factor” which cheetahs

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.830
need to dull down their their molars and is
critical for good dental hygiene.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.390
The treatment of elephants are at the forefront
of the debate against zoos.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.770
Elephants are used to living in huge matriarchal
families and are innately social creatures,

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.770
by being held in captivity with only one other
elephant, that they may not even be compatible

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.740
with, causes stress and shortens their lifespan.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.840
Elephants in captivity only live half as long
as those who live in natural wildlife preserves.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.681
African elephants can expect to live to 36
years old in Kenya’s Amboseli National Park

00:02:47.681 --> 00:02:50.630
compared to zoo elephants who live to be about
17 years old.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.349
Although some accredited zoos, like the Bronx
Zoo and the San Diego zoo are able to extend

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.099
the lives of their elephants, the San Diego
boasts some of their elephants live to be

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.099
40 years old.

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.680
But not all zoos have the money to keep their
parks running.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.300
Most zoos struggle with financing all of the
needs of their animals, employees and maintenance

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.450
of their parks.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.190
Some zoos apply for accreditation through
the Association of Zoos and Aquariums but

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.950
only 10% of the 2,800 zoos in the U.S. actually
get it this also distinguishes zoos from “roadside

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.239
zoos” which are known for animal endangerment
and mismanagement.

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.250
In order to be part of AZA each zoo must go
through a process where experts examine the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.120
zoos to make sure they are up to code and
have employees who are qualified to work in

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.800
those environments.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.610
Accreditation matters because it makes these
zoos eligible for grants, able to breed and

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.379
loan animals with other zoos and hire the
best workers in the business.

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.530
But before you go rally and protest your nearest
zoo, it’s not all bad news bears.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.360
I cannot overstate the great educational value
of zoos.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.870
Zoos are a great place to learn about animals
for young and old alike.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.430
It’s a place to literally come face to face
with some of the rarest animals in the world.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.290
Zoos introduce people to what the animal populations
are like around the world and educate people

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.849
about conservation efforts.

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.720
Visiting a zoo might even get you to donate
to these efforts.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.340
Meeting a Mountain Gorilla in person might
make you want to save this endangered animal.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.580
And zoos want to save endangered species too.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.190
Dozens of zoos in North America actively participate
in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums Species

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.750
Survival Plan Program (SSP), which concentrates
on finding dwindling populations, bring them

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.409
into captivity and growing them until they
are ready to be released into their natural

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:19.409
habitat.

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:24.039
SSP related programs have bolstered populations
such as black-footed ferrets, California condors

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.039
and red wolves.

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.300
Zoos also provide health care and services
to animals who need it.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.889
Many animals held in captivity were found
in the wild wounded or stranded.

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.270
Zoos give these animals a second chance at
life, one they wouldn’t of gotten had they

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:36.599
been left in the wild.

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:40.499
When it comes to pros vs cons, as long as
they are well managed and accredited and they

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:44.469
work on creating more natural habitats for
their animals, zoos bring people closer to

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:48.830
nature and might help save some of the most
imperiled species on the planet.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.830
What do you think?

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:50.830
How do you feel about zoos?

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.909
Do you have a favorite zoo?
