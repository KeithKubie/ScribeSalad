00:00:00.206 --> 00:00:02.167
- [Voiceover] In the
last video, we were given

00:00:02.167 --> 00:00:03.850
a multi variable function,

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.510
and asked to find and classify
all of its critical points.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.544
So critical points,
just means finding where

00:00:09.544 --> 00:00:11.799
the gradient is equal to zero,

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:13.985
and we found four
different points for that.

00:00:13.985 --> 00:00:15.285
I have them down here.

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:16.928
They were zero zero, zero negative two,

00:00:16.928 --> 00:00:18.411
square root of three and one,

00:00:18.411 --> 00:00:20.458
and negative square root of three and one.

00:00:20.458 --> 00:00:23.681
So then the next step
is to classify those.

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:26.475
And that requires the second
partial derivative test.

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:28.116
So what I'm gonna go ahead and do,

00:00:28.116 --> 00:00:30.917
is copy down the partial derivatives.

00:00:30.917 --> 00:00:33.557
Since we already computed those.

00:00:33.557 --> 00:00:37.664
Copy, and then just kind
of paste them down here.

00:00:37.664 --> 00:00:40.594
Where we can start to use them for

00:00:40.594 --> 00:00:43.567
the second partial derivatives.

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:46.110
So I'm gonna clean things up a little bit,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.843
and we don't need this
simplification of it.

00:00:49.843 --> 00:00:51.568
So we've got our partial derivatives.

00:00:51.568 --> 00:00:52.971
Now since we know we want to apply

00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:54.702
the second partial derivative test.

00:00:54.702 --> 00:00:56.796
We've got to first just
compute all of the different

00:00:56.796 --> 00:00:58.869
second partial derivatives
of our function.

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:00.787
That's just kind of the first thing to do.

00:01:00.787 --> 00:01:02.380
So let's go ahead and do it.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.621
The second partial
derivative of the function

00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:06.975
with respect to x twice in a row.

00:01:06.975 --> 00:01:09.560
Will take the partial
derivative with respect to x,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.698
and then do it with respect to x again.

00:01:11.698 --> 00:01:13.953
So this first term looks
like six times a variable

00:01:13.953 --> 00:01:16.785
times a constant, so it'll just be

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:19.434
six times that constant.

00:01:19.434 --> 00:01:20.833
And then the second term.

00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:24.836
The derivative of negative
six x, is just negative six.

00:01:24.836 --> 00:01:26.073
Moving right along.

00:01:26.073 --> 00:01:28.113
When we do the second partial derivative

00:01:28.113 --> 00:01:31.029
with respect to y twice in a row.

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:33.168
We take the partial
derivative with respect to y,

00:01:33.168 --> 00:01:34.381
and then do it again.

00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:36.207
So this x squared term looks like nothing.

00:01:36.207 --> 00:01:38.388
It looks like a constant
as far as y is concerned

00:01:38.388 --> 00:01:39.436
so we ignore it.

00:01:39.436 --> 00:01:41.622
The derivative of negative three y squared

00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:43.622
is negative six times y,

00:01:44.623 --> 00:01:46.925
and then the derivative of negative six y

00:01:46.925 --> 00:01:49.051
is just negative six.

00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:51.122
And then we can't forget
that last crucially important

00:01:51.122 --> 00:01:53.345
mixed partial derivative term.

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:56.661
Which is the partial derivative of f.

00:01:56.661 --> 00:01:58.694
Where first we do it with respect to x,

00:01:58.694 --> 00:02:00.184
and then with respect to y.

00:02:00.184 --> 00:02:01.806
The order doesn't really
matter in this case

00:02:01.806 --> 00:02:04.734
since it's a perfectly
ordinary polynomial function.

00:02:04.734 --> 00:02:06.119
So we could do it either way,

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.052
but I'm just gonna choose
to take a look at this guy

00:02:08.052 --> 00:02:10.514
and differentiate it with respect to y.

00:02:10.514 --> 00:02:12.556
So the derivative of the
first term with respect to y

00:02:12.556 --> 00:02:13.889
is six x, six x.

00:02:15.891 --> 00:02:17.613
And then that second term
looks like a constant

00:02:17.613 --> 00:02:21.568
with respect to y, so that's all we have.

00:02:21.568 --> 00:02:23.323
So now what we're gonna do is plug in

00:02:23.323 --> 00:02:25.444
each of the critical points to the special

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:27.826
second partial derivative test expression.

00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:30.555
And to remind you of what that is.

00:02:30.555 --> 00:02:33.982
That expression is we take
the second partial derivative

00:02:33.982 --> 00:02:35.619
with respect to x twice.

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:37.461
And I'll just write it with a kind of

00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:39.190
shorter notation using subscripts.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.510
Then we multiply that by the
second partial derivative

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.906
with respect to x, and
then we subtract off.

00:02:44.906 --> 00:02:49.682
Subtract off the mixed partial
derivative term squared.

00:02:49.682 --> 00:02:51.607
So let's go ahead and do
that for each of our points.

00:02:51.607 --> 00:02:54.077
So when we do this at the point zero zero.

00:02:54.077 --> 00:02:57.688
Zero zero, what we end up getting.

00:02:57.688 --> 00:02:59.387
Plugging that into the partial derivative

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:00.808
with respect to x twice.

00:03:00.808 --> 00:03:03.406
Six times zero is zero, so
that's just negative six.

00:03:03.406 --> 00:03:07.257
So that gives us negative
six multiplied by.

00:03:07.257 --> 00:03:09.925
When we plug it into
this partial derivative

00:03:09.925 --> 00:03:11.297
with respect to y squared.

00:03:11.297 --> 00:03:12.713
Again, that y goes to zero.

00:03:12.713 --> 00:03:15.739
So we're left with just negative six.

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.289
And then we subtract off the
mixed partial derivative term.

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:20.591
Which in this case is zero.

00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:23.243
Cause when we plug in x
equals zero, we get zero.

00:03:23.243 --> 00:03:25.815
So we're subtracting off zero squared.

00:03:25.815 --> 00:03:27.946
And that entire thing equals negative six

00:03:27.946 --> 00:03:30.363
times negative six is 36, 36.

00:03:32.203 --> 00:03:33.656
And we'll get to analyzing what it means

00:03:33.656 --> 00:03:35.317
that that's positive in just a moment,

00:03:35.317 --> 00:03:37.199
but let's just kind of get
all of them on the board

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.613
so we can kind of start
doing this with all of them.

00:03:39.613 --> 00:03:42.027
If we do this with zero and negative two.

00:03:42.027 --> 00:03:43.860
Zero and negative two.

00:03:44.788 --> 00:03:48.383
Then once we plug in y equals negative two

00:03:48.383 --> 00:03:49.796
to this expression.

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:51.650
This time I'll write it out.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.440
Six times negative two minus six,

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.471
so that's negative 12 minus six.

00:03:55.471 --> 00:03:58.388
We'll get negative 18, negative 18.

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:02.414
Then when we plug it into
the partial derivative of f

00:04:02.414 --> 00:04:04.367
with respect to y squared.

00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:05.797
Again, I'll kinda write it out.

00:04:05.797 --> 00:04:07.453
We have negative six times y

00:04:07.453 --> 00:04:10.370
is equal to negative two minus six.

00:04:11.646 --> 00:04:13.970
So now we have negative
six times negative two,

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.700
so that's positive 12 minus six.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.164
So that will be a positive
six that we plug in here.

00:04:20.164 --> 00:04:22.093
And then for the mixed partial derivative.

00:04:22.093 --> 00:04:23.506
Again, x is equal to zero.

00:04:23.506 --> 00:04:25.638
So the mixed partial
derivative is just gonna look

00:04:25.638 --> 00:04:27.517
like zero when we do this.

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:29.907
So we're subtracting off zero squared

00:04:29.907 --> 00:04:33.265
and we get negative 18 times six.

00:04:33.265 --> 00:04:34.842
And geez what's 18 times six.

00:04:34.842 --> 00:04:37.144
So that's gonna be 36 times three.

00:04:37.144 --> 00:04:38.751
So that's the same as 90.

00:04:38.751 --> 00:04:41.307
Plus 18, so I think that's 108.

00:04:41.307 --> 00:04:45.474
Negative 108, and the specific
magnitude won't matter.

00:04:46.535 --> 00:04:47.965
It's gonna be the sign that's important.

00:04:47.965 --> 00:04:50.518
And this is definitely negative.

00:04:50.518 --> 00:04:52.088
So now kind of moving right along.

00:04:52.088 --> 00:04:54.917
These examples can take quite a while.

00:04:54.917 --> 00:04:58.167
If we plug in square root of three one.

00:04:59.256 --> 00:05:02.423
Square root of three one, what we get.

00:05:06.385 --> 00:05:08.581
Now instead of plugging
in y equals negative two.

00:05:08.581 --> 00:05:10.517
We're plugging in y equals one.

00:05:10.517 --> 00:05:13.328
So that'll be six times one minus six.

00:05:13.328 --> 00:05:15.777
So the whole thing is just zero.

00:05:15.777 --> 00:05:17.125
And then for the partial derivative

00:05:17.125 --> 00:05:18.573
with respect to y squared.

00:05:18.573 --> 00:05:20.600
Instead of plugging in negative two.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.533
Now we're plugging in y equals one.

00:05:22.533 --> 00:05:25.667
So we have negative
six times one minus six

00:05:25.667 --> 00:05:27.831
so the whole thing is negative 12.

00:05:27.831 --> 00:05:30.904
So negative 12, and now for the

00:05:30.904 --> 00:05:32.947
mixed partial derivative term.

00:05:32.947 --> 00:05:34.613
Which is six x.

00:05:34.613 --> 00:05:36.525
X is equal to the square root of three.

00:05:36.525 --> 00:05:39.536
So now we're subtracting
off the square root

00:05:39.536 --> 00:05:41.426
of three squared.

00:05:41.426 --> 00:05:42.719
So what that equals is,

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:44.462
this first part is just entirely zero,

00:05:44.462 --> 00:05:45.961
and we're subtracting off three.

00:05:45.961 --> 00:05:48.311
So that's negative three.

00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:51.454
And then we have square root of three.

00:05:51.454 --> 00:05:53.265
No, no we don't, that's what we just did.

00:05:53.265 --> 00:05:56.033
Now we have negative
square root of three one.

00:05:56.033 --> 00:05:58.946
And this will be very similar
'cause this first term

00:05:58.946 --> 00:06:00.870
just had a y and we plugged in a y.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.505
So it's also gonna be zero.

00:06:02.505 --> 00:06:04.948
For totally the same reasons,
and same deal over here.

00:06:04.948 --> 00:06:06.563
The value of y didn't change.

00:06:06.563 --> 00:06:08.364
So that's also gonna be negative 12.

00:06:08.364 --> 00:06:09.384
Doesn't really matter cause we're

00:06:09.384 --> 00:06:11.223
multiplying it by zero, right?

00:06:11.223 --> 00:06:12.820
And then over here, now we're plugging in

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.778
negative square root of three,

00:06:15.778 --> 00:06:17.602
and that's gonna have the same square.

00:06:17.602 --> 00:06:21.311
So again we're just subtracting off three.

00:06:21.311 --> 00:06:24.313
So what does the second partial
derivative test tell us?

00:06:24.313 --> 00:06:25.976
Once we express this term.

00:06:25.976 --> 00:06:27.612
If it's greater than zero.

00:06:27.612 --> 00:06:29.392
We have a max or a min.

00:06:29.392 --> 00:06:31.837
That's what the test tells us.

00:06:31.837 --> 00:06:33.459
And then if it's less than zero.

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:36.613
If it's less than zero
we have a saddle point.

00:06:36.613 --> 00:06:40.189
So in this case, the only
term that's greater than zero

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.065
is this first one, is this first one.

00:06:43.065 --> 00:06:45.460
And to analyse whether it's
a maximum or a minimum.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.440
Notice that the partial derivative

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.381
with respect to x twice in a row,

00:06:49.381 --> 00:06:52.140
or with respect to y twice
in a row was negative.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.692
Which indicates a sort
of negative concavity.

00:06:54.692 --> 00:06:57.022
Meaning this corresponds to a maximum.

00:06:57.022 --> 00:07:00.605
So this guy corresponds
to a local maximum.

00:07:03.034 --> 00:07:05.701
Now all of the other three
gave us negative numbers.

00:07:05.701 --> 00:07:09.868
So all of these other three
give us saddle points.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.537
Saddle points.

00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:17.816
So the answer to the question.

00:07:17.816 --> 00:07:22.154
The original find and
classify such and such points

00:07:22.154 --> 00:07:26.869
is that we found four
different critical points.

00:07:26.869 --> 00:07:28.278
Four different critical points.

00:07:28.278 --> 00:07:30.450
Zero zero, zero negative two,
square root of three one,

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.293
and negative square root of three one.

00:07:32.293 --> 00:07:34.673
And all of them are saddle
points except for zero zero.

00:07:34.673 --> 00:07:36.391
Which is a local maximum.

00:07:36.391 --> 00:07:38.236
And all of that is
something that we can tell

00:07:38.236 --> 00:07:40.902
without even looking at
the graph of the function.

00:07:40.902 --> 00:07:42.027
And with that I will see you next video.
