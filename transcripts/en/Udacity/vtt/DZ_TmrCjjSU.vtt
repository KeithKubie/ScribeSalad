00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.349
I'm excited. Let's get some DNA out of this guy.

00:00:02.349 --> 00:00:05.930
&gt;&gt; Well hold on Lauren before we actually get

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.430
DNA from Matt, we need to take a couple

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.100
of other steps. And the key thing is before

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.620
we proceed and get DNA from Matt, he needs to

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.230
make sure he's comfortable with how his DNA and

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.060
genetic information will be used by 23andMe. So you

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.615
can read the terms of service, and understand how

00:00:22.615 --> 00:00:25.650
that information will be used, and make that decision on

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.880
his own.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.770
&gt;&gt; Well, this sounds like I also probably at some

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.600
point need to provide some consent for other services as well.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.870
&gt;&gt; Well, that's true because in all

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.060
research, a really important component is informed

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.110
consent, where the person who's involved in

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.960
it understands the risks and benefits of participation.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.040
&gt;&gt; So yes, Matt you like all 23andMe

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.120
customers, will get to choose whether you want to

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.660
take part in research, and have your genetic information

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.020
be used for research, and your other personal information.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.920
And so you get to decide whether you're going to consent use of your information

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.960
&gt;&gt; Well I know that informed consent is a

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.090
very important aspect of medicine and research today. So, if

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.790
you're interested in learning more about it. You can

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.240
visit the American Medical Association and search for Informed Consent.
