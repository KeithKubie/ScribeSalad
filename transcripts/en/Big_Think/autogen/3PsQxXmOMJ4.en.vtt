coming out of your mouth well what is it

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:50.999
coming out of your mouth well what is it
 

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:53.389
coming out of your mouth well what is it
well it encodes the identity of life and

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399
well it encodes the identity of life and
 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.370

it's in the shape of a double helix so

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380
it's in the shape of a double helix so
 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.830
it's in the shape of a double helix so
fortunately double helix that that's a

word and there's nothing else really

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670
word and there's nothing else really
 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.519
word and there's nothing else really
that's a double helix so that's kind of

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:01.529
that's a double helix so that's kind of
 

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:04.480
that's a double helix so that's kind of

overtime at 15 minutes to kill before my
movie came on I said that I sit there

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640
movie came on I said that I sit there
 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.120
movie came on I said that I sit there
and watch this overtime period and I'm

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130
and watch this overtime period and I'm
 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.740
and watch this overtime period and I'm
watching it and there's the requisite

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750
watching it and there's the requisite

into sudden death overtime so they get

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760
into sudden death overtime so they get
 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.700
into sudden death overtime so they get
it to within 50 yards of the goalpost

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710
it to within 50 yards of the goalpost
 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.920
it to within 50 yards of the goalpost
and so they decide to kick a field goal

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930
and so they decide to kick a field goal
 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.950
and so they decide to kick a field goal
for the win and so I'm watching this all

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960
for the win and so I'm watching this all
 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.990
for the win and so I'm watching this all
this it's exciting right so then the

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000
this it's exciting right so then the
 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.380
this it's exciting right so then the
ball gets hiked to kick the ball tumbles

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390
ball gets hiked to kick the ball tumbles
 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.820
ball gets hiked to kick the ball tumbles
and it heads towards the left upright

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830

careens off the left post and in for the

careens off the left post and in for the
 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.790
careens off the left post and in for the
win and I said wait a minute who we have

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800
win and I said wait a minute who we have
 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.110

a round ball on a cylindrical thing so

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120
a round ball on a cylindrical thing so
 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.970
a round ball on a cylindrical thing so
fractions of an inch matter

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980

which way this will bounce off of a post
so I said let me check this out so I

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380
so I said let me check this out so I
 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.020
so I said let me check this out so I
check the orientation of the stadium the

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030
check the orientation of the stadium the
 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.810
check the orientation of the stadium the

ever hear come out of my mouth I don't

I'm not worried about that because if

I'm not worried about that because if

I'm not worried about that because if
you get interested enough in the field

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:25.280
you get interested enough in the field
 

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.500
you get interested enough in the field
you'll dig up that information on your

you'll dig up that information on your
 

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:29.150
you'll dig up that information on your
own and you would have crossed the

thresholds of curiosity will you become

thresholds of curiosity will you become

plenty of ways for science literacy to
