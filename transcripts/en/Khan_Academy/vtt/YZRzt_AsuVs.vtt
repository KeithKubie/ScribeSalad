00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.460
We're asked to adjust the angle
in radius of the orange plotted

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.220
complex number-- so that's
this right over here--

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.980
to match the blue plotted
complex number negative 3.5

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.990
plus 6.06i.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.490
So this is this one
right over here.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.100
So just to get our bearings,
this vertical axis,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.650
this is the imaginary axis.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.240
This horizontal axis
is the real axis.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.320
The real part of this
number is negative 3.5,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.880
and so we've plotted that on
the real axis-- negative 1,

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.630
negative 2, negative 3.5.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.440
And then the imaginary
part is 6.06.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.150
So we go up 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, and then a very little bit

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.910
to get to 6.06.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.970
So they've plotted it like that.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.670
And now they want
us to think about it

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.370
in kind of the polar form is
one way of thinking about it.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.560
And so they tell us that we
can adjust the angle, which

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.590
is often called the argument
when you're plotting up

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.300
a complex number in this form,
and the radius, which is often

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.470
called the modulus.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.030
So let's change that.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.507
So let's see, if we
increase the radius,

00:01:10.507 --> 00:01:12.590
so then the thing is going
to go out a little bit.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.590
If we increase the
angle, that's pi over 3.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.330
This is pi over 2.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.920
So we increase the
angle to 2 pi over 3.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.830
And this seems to be
the right direction,

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.570
and we just have to increase
the radius a little bit.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.550
So there we have a radius
of 7, an angle of 2/3 pi.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.160
Now, let's verify for ourselves
that this complex number

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.620
and this complex number
really are the same thing.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.090
We've already seen it right over
here in this actual diagram.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.590
We've plotted it
both in I guess you

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.780
could say, rectangular
form and polar form,

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.170
although this is a complex
axis, and this is a real axis.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.490
So let me copy and paste the
information that we have here.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.430
So let me just copy
and paste all of that.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.796
And then I can put it on
my little scratch pad.

00:02:01.796 --> 00:02:03.830
So let me throw it
right over there,

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.600
and let's actually verify that.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.460
So here we have an argument, or
an angle I guess I could say.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.490
So this angle, often
referred to as phi

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.490
when you're dealing
in the complex plane,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.210
this is equal to 2/3 pi.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.480
And this is, of
course, in radians.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.500
And the modulus, which
is really the distance

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.650
from the origin to the complex
number, this right over here,

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.050
by just manipulating that little
tool, we saw that to be 7.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.240
So let's verify that this is
really the same complex number

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.310
as negative 3.5 plus 6.06i.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.170
Well, we can
represent this as 7--

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.450
this is the modulus,
or the radius.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:59.600
7 times e to the 2/3 pi i, which
we know from Euler's identity

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.852
is the exact same thing.

00:03:00.852 --> 00:03:03.060
This is equal to-- and this
is one of really the most

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.230
mind-blowing things
in all of mathematics.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.580
This is the same thing as
7 times cosine of 2/3 pi

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.990
plus i sine of 2/3 pi.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.200
And they already wrote that
down for us right over there.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.920
Now let's verify what
cosine of 2/3 pi is

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.270
and what sine of 2/3 pi is.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.090
So if this is 2/3 as
an angle-- and now

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.040
you can almost even
think of the unit circle.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.110
So this is 2/3 pi.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.356
So actually, just let me just
draw a unit circle like this

00:03:37.356 --> 00:03:38.980
because I don't want
us to confuse just

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.730
our traditional
rectangular coordinates

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.920
with what we're doing
on the polar axis.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.000
So this isn't a
polar-- we're not

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.300
graphing imaginary
numbers right over here.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.360
This is just the
traditional unit circle.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.100
This is our x-axis
this is our y-axis.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.670
2/3 pi is the same
thing as 120 degrees.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.980
So it looks just like what
we did over here, so 2/3 pi.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.090
So let me draw it as neatly as
I can, which isn't that neatly.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.130
So that angle is 2/3 pi.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.530
Our cosine of 2/3 pi is going
to be our x-coordinate here.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.470
And sine of 2/3 pi is going to
be our y-coordinates over here.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.920
So what's our x-coordinate?

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.370
Well, if this right over
here is 120 degrees,

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.740
then this is 60 degrees.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.540
This is a 30-60-90 triangle.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.130
And we know this
is a unit circle.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.740
The radius is 1.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.780
So the 30-degree side
will have length 1/2.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.370
So this coordinate
right over here

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.660
is going to be negative 1/2.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.500
And then the side opposite
the 60-degree side

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.030
is square root of
3 times the 1/2.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.740
So this right over here is going
to be square root of 3 over 2.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.270
And you could verify that on
a calculator, if you like.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.750
So cosine of 2/3
pi is negative 1/2.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.780
So this is going to be equal
to 7 times negative 1/2.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.390
That's cosine of 2/3 pi
plus i times the square root

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.700
of 3 over 2.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.200
So let's verify
that that's actually

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.330
the same thing as
that over there.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.410
Well, 7 times negative 1/2
is negative 3.5 plus i.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.960
I'll just write it lik e7
square root of 3 over 2i.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.720
So we already see that the real
parts are definitely the same.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.364
It's negative 3.5.

00:05:25.364 --> 00:05:26.780
And I'll just get
a calculator out

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.270
to evaluate this and see
if it is roughly 6.06.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.120
So let me get my
trusty TI-85 out.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.180
And then I want to evaluate
7 times the square root of 3,

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.020
and then that divided
by 2 is indeed 6.06,

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.420
if we round to the
nearest hundredths.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:54.180
So this is approximately equal
to negative 3.5 plus 6.06i,

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:00.170
which is exactly the complex
number that we started with.
