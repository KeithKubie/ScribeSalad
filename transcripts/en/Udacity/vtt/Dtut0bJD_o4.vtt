Now we're ready for the final step of parsing our map data. We want to keep

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:07.810
track of each tile set that our map loads. So we need to keep an array of

00:00:07.822 --> 00:00:11.856
available tile sets in our tile map class. Now what you need to do is while we

00:00:11.868 --> 00:00:15.910
are parsing our tile sets, create a new object and populate the array we just

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:20.138
showed you containing all the attributes or our tile set from our data file. For

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.134
example, first GID, image, image width, et cetera. Finally we'll need push this

00:00:24.146 --> 00:00:25.933
object into our array of tile sets.
