00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.500
This is Ajax, and

2
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:18.000
I've trained him to help me find kea nests

3
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:22.250
He's the only kea dog in the country

4
00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:24.250
and I guess that means the world

5
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:31.499
People are really shocked when you tell them

6
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.000
that there are less kea then there are kiwis

7
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:40.750
I've been training Ajax since he was a pup

8
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.750
he walks around the forest all day with me

9
00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:44.750
he hops in helicopters,

10
00:00:45.251 --> 00:00:46.500
he comes on boats

11
00:00:46.751 --> 00:00:48.000
he's been caving

12
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.000
Yeah he comes everywhere with me

13
00:00:59.501 --> 00:01:01.250
He's got a good keen nose, and

14
00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:04.000
he's able to let me know if there's a kea close by or

15
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:06.000
if there's one still in the hole

16
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:08.000
he'll indicate by standing there quite awkwardly

17
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.000
with his nose directly in the hole

18
00:01:21.251 --> 00:01:24.500
It's really sad when you come across a kea nest

19
00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.000
that you've been monitoring

20
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:28.500
and watching the chicks grow

21
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:30.500
and all of a sudden you get there and theyâ€™re gone

22
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:31.850
and you know they haven't fledged

23
00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:33.250
because it's too early

24
00:01:33.251 --> 00:01:36.000
and you know they've been predated by some pest

25
00:01:44.751 --> 00:01:46.250
Yeah it gets you down, because

26
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:48.000
you think about that happening

27
00:01:48.001 --> 00:01:50.250
in hundreds of kea nests every year

28
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:52.000
all across the South Island

29
00:01:54.501 --> 00:01:55.750
It does make you think

30
00:01:55.751 --> 00:01:57.500
can we win this battle?

31
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:18.000
Good boy, good boy!

32
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:26.250
That's a perfect indication, that's the best you've done!

33
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:31.000
I want people to look at keas

34
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:33.700
as an important species that we have here

35
00:02:33.701 --> 00:02:35.500
in the South Island of New Zealand

36
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:38.250
And I want stories like this

37
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:39.500
about me and Ajax

38
00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:41.000
to make people aware

39
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:43.500
of how neat and special they are

40
00:02:50.701 --> 00:02:53.500
Working to conserve an endangered species

41
00:02:53.501 --> 00:02:54.750
is really rewarding

42
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:56.000
every day's an adventure

43
00:02:57.751 --> 00:02:59.250
And it's helping the world 

44
00:02:59.251 --> 00:03:01.500
in my little corner of the globe
