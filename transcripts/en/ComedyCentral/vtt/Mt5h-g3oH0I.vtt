00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:02.235
(typewriter typing)

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:03.770
- Since @Midnight's in the
Big Apple, we decided to go

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.905
to our local Craigslist to
see what depraved perverts

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:08.108 align:start size:97% position:3%
are looking to hook up with,
and to help us read it,

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:10.577 align:start size:97% position:3%
we needed the most depraved
pervert we could find.

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:13.313
So please welcome to the
stage, Gilbert Gottfried.

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:17.484 align:start size:84% position:16%
(audience cheers)
(pulsing groovy music)

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:25.625
(audience and guests
applaud and cheer)

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:32.399
- Thank you, Gilbert.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.400
- Thank you.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.171
(audience laughs and whoops)

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:39.105
Yes!

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.674
(audience laughs)

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:45.011
It is true that I am
a depraved pervert.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.014
(audience laughs)

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:50.583
But I'm also crushingly lonely.

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:53.887
(audience laughs)

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:56.990 align:start size:84% position:16%
Are any of you ladies
getting wet now?

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.892
(audience laughs)

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.594
(Bridget whoops)

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.763
- Yeah.

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:06.366
(audience cheers)

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.268
That actually just
made my nose run.

00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:11.938
(Gilbert, Bridget,
and audience laugh)

00:01:11.938 --> 00:01:13.006
- I'll take it!

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:16.676
(audience laughs and claps)

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:24.150
Every time I try to
get close to someone,

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.986
I end up smothering them.

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:31.724 align:start size:94% position:6%
And by someone I mean
disenfranchised runaways.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:34.561
(audience laughs)

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:41.634 align:start position:0%
And by smothering I mean
literally smother them to death.

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:46.840
(audience laughs and claps)

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:51.978
Sometimes I smother
them with a pillow.

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:53.246
(audience laughs)

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:56.683
Other times, slowly
with a piano wire.

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:59.519
(audience laughs)

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:02.989 align:start size:81% position:19%
But that's neither
here nor there.

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:03.923
- Sure, yeah.

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:06.426
That's not, really, we'll just.

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:10.830
- I am known to
peruse Craigslist

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:14.767
in my neverending pursuit

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:17.036
to find vintage end tables.

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:19.706
(audience laughs)

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:23.209
Or reasonably priced,
anonymous hand-jobs.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:28.715
(audience laughs and whoops)

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:34.988
I found this post entitled,
Dragon Invades Chinatown.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.324
- Oh?

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.193
What's it say?

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:41.094
- It reads,

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:43.796
"Sup, sup.

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:47.467
(Chris and audience laughs)

00:02:50.737 --> 00:02:51.571
"Sup, sup.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.741
"This is Dragon,

00:02:56.142 --> 00:02:59.946 align:start size:97% position:3%
"and I will invade Chinatown
like I did yesterday.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.551 align:start size:88% position:13%
"IDK like the Asian
culture and Asian women.

00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:08.788
(audience laughs)

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:10.290
"Only downside is,

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:13.927
"I'm a picky ass eater."

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:18.097 align:start size:84% position:16%
(Chris, guests,
and audience laugh)

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.940
Just for the record, I'm also
a picky ass eater, all right?

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:32.412 align:start size:88% position:13%
(Chris, guests, and
audience laugh and clap)

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:36.583 align:start position:0%
I will not eat a girl's asshole
unless it's gluten-free.

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:38.818
- Oh, sure.

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:42.589
(audience laughs and cheers)

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:46.059 align:start size:81% position:19%
Gilbert Gottfried.
- Yup, yup!

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.993
- Yup, yup.

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:49.229
Gilbert Gottfried, everyone.
