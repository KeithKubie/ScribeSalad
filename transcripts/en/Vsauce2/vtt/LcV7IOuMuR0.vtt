00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.220
Vsauce!

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.220
Kevin here.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.819
Chewing gum is banned in Singapore.

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.751
No gum is allowed to be bought or sold unless
it’s prescribed by a doctor and the ban

00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:14.590
was instituted due to vandals sticking chewed
gum on the door sensors of public transit

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.590
trains.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.400
As well as floors, sidewalks, elevator buttons
and inside keyholes.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.679
So no more gum!

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:26.310
In 2011, the French government reformed school
and university cafeterias by banning ketchup.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.390
In order to preserve the tradition of French
cuisine they no longer wanted the French youth

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.730
masking the flavor of their food with the
American condiment.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.840
However, there is still one one food they're
allowed to use ketchup on…french fries.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.450
Beech Grove, Indiana has a law against eating
watermelon in the park.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.190
It’s one of those unenforced old laws still
on the books but the ordinance was originally

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.390
enacted because watermelon rinds were puncturing
garbage bags and creating a mess.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.480
So they banned watermelon eating entirely.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.480
In parks.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.040
New York City tried to ban large soft drinks
so Mississippi responded by banning bans on

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.620
large soft drinks.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.860
The Governor signed the bill in 2013 stating
…”its not the role of government to micro-regulate

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.350
citizens dietary decisions.”

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.850
Meanwhile, Mississippi has the highest obesity
rate in the United States.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:19.850
Horse meat.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.160
Horses are considered pets, companions and
workers in the U.S., U.K. and many english-speaking

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.070
countries so eating them is taboo.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.260
But countries like China, Mexico and Italy
eat a lot of horse meat.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.159
Dog food manufacturers in the US stopped using
horse meat in the 70s and although it’s

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.640
commonly thought that gelatin is made from
horse hooves it’s mostly made from pigskin.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.170
Which is pretty gross!

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.820
The Salmon Act of 1986 in the U.K. deals with
handling salmon in suspicious circumstances.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.520
And a Welsh pub owner was charged for doing
just that in 2009 when wild salmon was found

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.520
in her freezer.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.580
At which point she told inspectors she said
salmon from an unidentified man.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.920
Thereby handling salmon in suspicious circumstances.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.420
Sassafras was used for flavoring traditional
root beer until the FDA determined it might

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.720
cause cancer.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.130
Safrole, which is extracted from the root-bark
is regarded as a weak carcinogen in rats so

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.500
artificial flavors were invented to replace
it in root beer.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.970
However you can find some root beers in which
the safrole is removed but the oil from the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.010
sassafras roots is still used for flavor.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.540
Finally, the UK government is trying to get
the US to overturn its import ban on traditional

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.560
Scottish haggis.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.700
The problem is that the US currently doesn’t
allow one its key ingredients in food products

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.470
- sheep lungs.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.530
And as always - thanks for watching!
