00:00:00.954 --> 00:00:03.655
- [Voiceover] Now I wanna
introduce a new idea,

00:00:03.655 --> 00:00:05.572
and that is the idea of

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:11.423
voltage or current, some electrical signal

00:00:11.423 --> 00:00:14.200
being a function of time,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.700
cosine of omega t.

00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:21.219
So here what we're doing
is we're introducing time

00:00:21.219 --> 00:00:23.552
as the argument to a cosine.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.410
And time is that stuff
that always goes up,

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.716
this is a number that increases forever.

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:35.024
And we have another variable
in here called omega,

00:00:35.024 --> 00:00:38.143
this is the Greek lowercase omega,

00:00:38.143 --> 00:00:41.566
and omega has an important job in this.

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:45.733
The argument to cosine,
whatever is inside the cosine,

00:00:46.971 --> 00:00:51.074
this has to be dimensionless,
this has to have no units.

00:00:51.074 --> 00:00:55.843
And so if we put in a unit
of seconds, that means omega

00:00:55.843 --> 00:00:58.592
is something that has the
units of one over seconds,

00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:00.389
or one over time.

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:02.556
So omega is one over time.

00:01:06.537 --> 00:01:08.387
And when we multiply those
two numbers together,

00:01:08.387 --> 00:01:10.861
we get something that has no
units, and then we can take

00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:12.751
the cosine of it.

00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:16.204
So, this is referred to as a frequency.

00:01:16.204 --> 00:01:20.371
Something that has units of
one over time is a frequency.

00:01:23.203 --> 00:01:25.372
This is a constant number,
this is some number,

00:01:25.372 --> 00:01:28.021
this is a number, time is
a number that increases

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:29.303
all the time,

00:01:29.303 --> 00:01:32.154
and so when we have that cosine,

00:01:32.154 --> 00:01:35.306
we now have something we call
a cosine wave or a sine wave,

00:01:35.306 --> 00:01:37.018
or a sinusoid.

00:01:37.018 --> 00:01:39.268
And that sine wave goes on.

00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:44.240
As time increases, it keeps
going and going and going.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.516
So now we've turned our
trigonometric cosine function,

00:01:48.516 --> 00:01:50.446
which is right here, which
is something that was

00:01:50.446 --> 00:01:54.660
well defined between
zero and two pi radians.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.820
Notice that I've changed the
axis, the axis is now in time

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.891
over here, and now we're
counting off time in seconds,

00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:03.347
there's two seconds, three, four, five,

00:02:03.347 --> 00:02:06.412
and that dot there, that's at pi seconds,

00:02:06.412 --> 00:02:09.312
and this is at two pi seconds,

00:02:09.312 --> 00:02:11.450
right at that dot right there.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.617
And you can see that that is
the full cycle of one cosine

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.865
before it starts repeating again,

00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:21.540
so that's 6.28 seconds.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.652
So for this image here,
omega has the value of one.

00:02:25.652 --> 00:02:28.819
So when time t reaches two pi seconds,

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.148
we've gone through one full cycle.

00:02:33.148 --> 00:02:37.298
So this idea of this continuously changing

00:02:37.298 --> 00:02:39.731
cosine or sine wave going on forever,

00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:42.564
that gives us the term sine waves,

00:02:43.422 --> 00:02:45.384
and sine waves are a good
model for a lot of things

00:02:45.384 --> 00:02:46.582
that happen in nature.

00:02:46.582 --> 00:02:50.317
If you ever hear a pure
tone or a pure note,

00:02:50.317 --> 00:02:53.070
a bell being rang or a whistle,

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.146
or if you sing a note,
the shape of those tones

00:02:56.146 --> 00:02:59.068
looks like a sine wave or a cosine wave.

00:02:59.068 --> 00:03:00.840
And these are often the
things that come into

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.007
our electronic systems and
we wanna do things with them.

00:03:06.025 --> 00:03:09.043
So now I wanna talk a little
bit more about the details

00:03:09.043 --> 00:03:11.710
of this kind of a sinusoid wave.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.360
We're gonna learn some new words for this.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.640
So one important concept is the idea of

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.655
any repeating waveform,
any repeating signal,

00:03:23.655 --> 00:03:25.140
is the idea of a period.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.403
Let's just do the zero crossings here.

00:03:27.403 --> 00:03:31.236
If I take the time change
from there to there,

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.025
this is the repeating
interval of this function,

00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:41.337
and I'm gonna call that,
that distance right there,

00:03:41.337 --> 00:03:42.837
this is the period

00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:48.355
of this sine function.

00:03:48.355 --> 00:03:50.257
This is actually a cosine wave.

00:03:50.257 --> 00:03:54.121
The period of this sine is this
distance in time right here,

00:03:54.121 --> 00:03:57.628
and the symbol we use
is typically a capital T

00:03:57.628 --> 00:03:59.545
to indicate the period.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.465
So let's look at this
cosine wave, this sinusoid,

00:04:07.465 --> 00:04:09.859
and identify what its period is.

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.026
I can do it easily if I go right here.

00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:17.293
It looks like it repeats on
this interval right here.

00:04:17.293 --> 00:04:20.424
Every time we hit one of those points,

00:04:20.424 --> 00:04:23.219
so this would be, if
this is time zero here,

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:27.170
this is time big T, this is time two T,

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.594
on and on like that.

00:04:28.594 --> 00:04:30.904
And I read off this graph,
and what I see right here

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:32.487
is that the time is

00:04:34.444 --> 00:04:36.277
T equals 0.02 seconds.

00:04:41.473 --> 00:04:43.506
So that's how you find out what
the period of something is.

00:04:43.506 --> 00:04:44.604
You can take any two points.

00:04:44.604 --> 00:04:46.731
We could actually go right here

00:04:46.731 --> 00:04:48.887
and then go through one cycle,

00:04:48.887 --> 00:04:51.217
and go to right here

00:04:51.217 --> 00:04:54.169
and I can read off that
period there, there's T,

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.013
and that's the same value
as that T right over there.

00:04:58.013 --> 00:05:01.763
So the time T, we can
also call that a cycle.

00:05:03.546 --> 00:05:05.804
That's the time it takes
to go through one period,

00:05:05.804 --> 00:05:07.221
that's one cycle.

00:05:09.052 --> 00:05:11.561
So one of the questions I can
ask about this waveform is,

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:14.679
how many cycles fit in one second?

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:18.617
How many cycles per second,
is another way to say that.

00:05:18.617 --> 00:05:20.950
So we can say that one cycle

00:05:22.525 --> 00:05:24.525
happens every T seconds,

00:05:28.934 --> 00:05:32.434
and in our particular case, it's one cycle

00:05:33.698 --> 00:05:35.115
per 0.02 seconds,

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.284
and if take the reciprocal of 0.02,

00:05:43.284 --> 00:05:46.015
we get the answer to be,

00:05:46.015 --> 00:05:46.848
that's 50

00:05:48.004 --> 00:05:49.504
cycles per second.

00:05:55.258 --> 00:05:58.590
That's the speed, that's
the repetition rate

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.805
of this sinusoid, 50 cycles per second.

00:06:01.805 --> 00:06:05.278
And this has another name,
it's named in honor of

00:06:05.278 --> 00:06:09.195
a German scientist, and
this is called a Hertz.

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:14.886
Heinrich Hertz is the first
person to send a radio wave

00:06:14.886 --> 00:06:19.126
and receive it on purpose,
he knew what he was doing.

00:06:19.126 --> 00:06:21.983
We named the unit cycles
per second in his honor,

00:06:21.983 --> 00:06:24.316
and that's called the Hertz.

00:06:26.948 --> 00:06:28.695
So now we have two ways
to measure frequency.

00:06:28.695 --> 00:06:29.528
One is

00:06:30.365 --> 00:06:34.532
f, which is frequency,
which is measured in Hertz,

00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:37.868
and that's cycles per second.

00:06:43.442 --> 00:06:44.525
And one cycle

00:06:45.962 --> 00:06:47.045
equals two pi

00:06:49.154 --> 00:06:50.737
radians per second.

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:58.206
So the two measures are cycles per second

00:06:58.206 --> 00:07:00.316
and radians per second, and
we'll flip back and forth

00:07:00.316 --> 00:07:01.483
between those.

00:07:03.385 --> 00:07:07.552
Okay, and radians per second,
or the variable is omega,

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:11.553
and that's called angular frequency,

00:07:16.004 --> 00:07:17.671
or radian frequency,

00:07:22.125 --> 00:07:25.763
and you'll sometimes see the word rad

00:07:25.763 --> 00:07:28.526
used to indicate that
we're talking about angular

00:07:28.526 --> 00:07:32.443
or radian frequency, and
the variable is omega.

00:07:33.406 --> 00:07:35.938
So let's work out what,
the relationship between

00:07:35.938 --> 00:07:37.766
f and omega.

00:07:37.766 --> 00:07:40.064
It's actually sitting right here, okay.

00:07:40.064 --> 00:07:41.897
So if I give you an f,

00:07:43.334 --> 00:07:44.167
given f,

00:07:47.615 --> 00:07:48.782
what is omega?

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.537
So I write down a number f,
and it's in cycles per second,

00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:03.681
and I'm gonna multiply
that by a conversion factor

00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:07.252
that I'm gonna make up, so
we're gonna multiply that by

00:08:07.252 --> 00:08:08.085
two pi

00:08:10.972 --> 00:08:12.472
radians per second

00:08:15.152 --> 00:08:18.152
is the same as one cycle per second.

00:08:28.796 --> 00:08:30.224
And that equals,

00:08:30.224 --> 00:08:33.298
cycles per second cancels
with cycles per second,

00:08:33.298 --> 00:08:34.465
so that equals

00:08:35.584 --> 00:08:36.417
two pi f

00:08:41.418 --> 00:08:43.001
radians per second.

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.946
So the conversion factor is

00:08:47.946 --> 00:08:49.779
omega equals two pi f,

00:08:55.255 --> 00:08:57.672
and that's worth remembering.

00:08:59.748 --> 00:09:04.120
So if I have a sine wave, a
voltage sine wave, for instance,

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:04.953
v of t

00:09:06.237 --> 00:09:07.070
equals

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.510
cosine omega t,

00:09:12.126 --> 00:09:13.969
I can write that equivalently as

00:09:13.969 --> 00:09:14.802
v of t

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.023
equals cosine

00:09:20.305 --> 00:09:21.722
two pi f times t.

00:09:28.848 --> 00:09:32.587
So one of the frequencies, this
one is in cycles per second,

00:09:32.587 --> 00:09:35.419
and this one is in radians per second,

00:09:35.419 --> 00:09:37.567
and we can interchange 'em that way

00:09:37.567 --> 00:09:39.984
using this conversion factor.

00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:43.708
So if we take the example
from earlier in the video,

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:48.471
we had a signal that was 50
Hertz, or 50 cycles per second,

00:09:48.471 --> 00:09:50.892
so we would write that here like this.

00:09:50.892 --> 00:09:52.142
We'd say v of t

00:09:53.381 --> 00:09:54.464
equals cosine

00:09:57.707 --> 00:09:59.540
two pi f, and f is 50,

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.453
times t,

00:10:08.638 --> 00:10:11.210
and that's the same as

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.793
cosine of 100 pi t.

00:10:19.724 --> 00:10:24.262
So this number right here,
100 pi, that's omega,

00:10:24.262 --> 00:10:26.863
and this number right here

00:10:26.863 --> 00:10:27.696
is f.

00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:32.519
So that does it for our
review of trigonometry,

00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:34.664
and we've introduced
the idea of a sine wave

00:10:34.664 --> 00:10:37.174
where t is the argument
to the trig function.
