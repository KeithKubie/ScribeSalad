00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.454
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:03.454 --> 00:00:04.870
ADAM NASH: Well,
thanks, everyone.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.940
Thanks for showing
up this afternoon.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.470
This is a big delight for me.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.470
My name is Adam Nash.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.010
I'm the chief operating
officer at Wealthfront.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.400
I've been at a lot of technology
companies-- Apple, EBay,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.499
LinkedIn.

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:19.540
It's a particular delight
for me to have ended up

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.540
at a company, a great
software company, at least one

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.030
we're trying to build, where
it's actually part of my job

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.820
description to get to
work with world class

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.560
financial experts like
Burt and Charlie here.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.820
So hopefully you'll
feel the same

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.655
after we go through
these questions.

00:00:34.655 --> 00:00:36.280
I know that you have
a lot you probably

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.920
want to hear from them.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.420
We've tried to solicit
from some folks

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.710
good questions to cover
some basic material.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.660
And then we'll have time at the
end for additional questions,

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.700
if that make sense.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.505
So anyway, Wealthfront
is a startup,

00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:55.530
but we're the largest and
fastest-growing software-based

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.000
financial advisor.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.050
Probably the first
question for both of you

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.740
is pretty simple,
which is, I mean,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.300
you've both had
such amazing careers

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.330
defining financial
expertise for the industry.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.790
Why the involvement
at Wealthfront

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.540
at this point, maybe
just a retrospective?

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.100
BURTON MALKIEL: Well,
from my standpoint,

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.100
it was largely because
I think most people get

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.400
just terrible financial
advice, and it's too expensive.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.910
Most financial advisers charge
a very high fee themselves.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.850
And they are
conflicted in that when

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.550
they suggest that you buy this
or that mutual fund, what's

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.420
sort of little known
is that they usually

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.570
get a payment from that
mutual fund company

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.750
to put you in that mutual fund.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.260
They're high-cost funds.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.920
And I've spent my life
studying the fact,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.620
as the introduction said,
that over time, very

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.460
high-cost mutual funds don't
beat the market-- rather,

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.300
they underperform the market--
and that they underperform

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.240
the market by at least the
amount of their excess cost.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.420
So you've got costs
of the adviser.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.980
You've got high-priced funds
and what the adviser recommends.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.740
The advisor is
typically conflicted.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.480
And here, you have
something where,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.630
with the advantage of
doing this with software

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.850
and doing this
electronically, that you

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.540
can give unconflicted advice.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.570
And we use the funds that I
have recommended all my life,

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.630
low-cost index funds that
competition has now driven down

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.860
to have very close to zero fees.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.750
So we can provide
this electronically.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.180
It's inexpensive.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.810
I think it's as good advice
as any high-priced investment

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.810
adviser will give you.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.980
And we can then,
particularly for funds

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.930
that are over
$100,000, do things

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.270
like tax loss harvesting.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.920
None of us can control what
the stock market's going to do,

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.060
but the one thing
we can control is

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.490
the things that
are controllable.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.030
And one of them is costs,
and one of them is taxes,

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.800
and this we can do very
inexpensively electronically.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.040
And I'm actually
very, very proud to be

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.090
a part of an
organization that I think

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.119
is doing a great job for people.

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.910
ADAM NASH: Charley?

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.240
CHARLEY ELLIS: We differ.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.290
Burt would say it's low cost
and a much better product,

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.290
and I would say it's much
better product and low cost.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.260
ADAM NASH: [LAUGHS]

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.830
CHARLEY ELLIS: Seriously, if
you look back over the last 50

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.450
years, I think both of us
would be truly aggravated

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.270
by the crowd we know best not
doing anything like a really

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.691
good job, and candidly,
charging quite large amounts.

00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:16.899
There are a lot of different
ways of looking at that,

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.649
and we can come back
to it if you want to.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:22.240
But it is very unsettling
to have the crowd

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.610
that you're part charging a
lot and delivering a little.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.070
So you're looking all the time.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.460
And when I heard
from Burt that he

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.260
was involved with
Wealthfront, seemed to me

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.170
like a great deal of sense.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.780
ADAM NASH: Well, I mean,
I'm glad you mentioned that.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.220
You two have known each
other for a long time now.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.261
CHARLEY ELLIS: We were
born in the same hospital,

00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:43.234
so it goes back quite a ways.

00:04:43.234 --> 00:04:45.900
ADAM NASH: Do you want to tell a
bit about how you two first met

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.110
and worked together?

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.750
I'm sure people would
love to hear it.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.680
CHARLEY ELLIS: Do you remember?

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.590
BURTON MALKIEL: Well, I think
we have been-- of course,

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.140
the first index fund was founded
by a company called Vanguard,

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.410
and Vanguard now is the
biggest index fund provider.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.260
And they also provide
ETFs, which are basically

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.130
funds that trade as stocks.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.770
And they're basically--
the ones that Vanguard

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.300
has are index funds.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.190
And Charley and I, for
a long period of time,

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.250
sat next to each other
on the Vanguard board.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.000
And I think one of
the reasons that we

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.789
got to really like
each other is that--

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.080
CHARLEY ELLIS: Oh, it's agreed.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.590
[LAUGHS]

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.381
BURTON MALKIEL: Yeah,
that was the problem.

00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:34.130
We would all make a point,
and somehow or other,

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.710
you and I always agreed.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.890
And we sat next to each other.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.300
And if we didn't even talk,
we would just sort of nod.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.290
So that was how it all started.

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.520
And my god, I don't want to
count the number of years,

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.830
but it was long number of years.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.280
And we became friends
and became co-authors,

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.310
because the little book
that's been featured

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.040
is our attempt to
put down everything

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.850
we know in a book that would
take an hour and a half

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:11.930
to read.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.984
And we had a lot of
fun doing it together.

00:06:13.984 --> 00:06:15.900
CHARLEY ELLIS: That's
if you're a slow reader.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.740
BURTON MALKIEL: If you're
a slow reader, right.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.630
ADAM NASH: [LAUGHS]
That's great.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.090
I mean, Burt, this
isn't the first time

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.780
I think you've been at Google.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.436
In 2004, I remember
when Google went public.

00:06:30.436 --> 00:06:32.310
It was the big IPO at
the time, because there

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.070
hadn't been a lot of
big IPOs in a few years.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.070
I thought Google did
something fairly unique

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.130
given its dedication
to its employees

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.830
and their financial health, is
that you were invited here--

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.120
not here in the New York
office, but in Mountain View,

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.990
in California-- to
talk to the employee

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.130
base about the markets,
and help prepare them

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.030
for what it meant to have
wealth in the market.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.410
What was it like
speaking to Google 2004?

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.180
BURTON MALKIEL: Actually, you
know, my first time at Google,

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.516
I had two main impressions.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:15.110
First of all, I've been an
academic most of my life,

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.870
but started my investment
career as an investment

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.560
banker in New York.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:28.100
And as I got into
this business, we

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.640
had a training program of
about a half a dozen guys.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:37.310
And we were going to be given
a lecture by the senior partner

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.760
of the firm, and
the air conditioning

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.390
broke in the building.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.430
Actually, it was the
building 20 Broad Street,

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.290
right next to the New
York Stock Exchange.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.020
So we were all coat
and tie, obviously,

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:57.090
and the other trainees
took their coats off.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.280
The senior partner then
started to address us,

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:07.620
and said, "it's OK when the air
conditioning breaks that you

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.850
can take your jackets
off," but then

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.010
looked at one of
the trainees who

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.740
had a short-sleeved shirt
on-- "but never, never,

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.080
never take your
coat off if you've

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.260
got a short-sleeved shirt on."

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.920
So this is how I came
into the business world.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.590
So you can imagine
my first impression

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:31.140
of going to Google of what
an informal place this was.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:35.230
People had t-shirts,
shorts, flip-flops.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:41.059
People were throwing
Frisbees inside the building.

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:43.260
There were dogs running around.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.510
And I couldn't
help but think back

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.370
to the beginning of
my business career.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.810
And I say, oh my god.

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.670
I knew the West Coast was
always less formal than the East

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.050
Coast, but what a
difference this is.

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:57.340
And I also visited at the
time-- because I had known him,

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.930
I'd been on a couple
of panels with him--

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:04.220
Eric Schmidt, who was then the
CEO, was a Princeton trustee.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:08.720
And here was Eric Schmidt
in this little tiny office.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.880
And I was thinking of
the partners' offices

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.270
in the investment banks.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.470
And so the first
impression was, my god,

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.940
what a different world
this was from the world

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.880
that I grew up in.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.270
I think the second
impression that I had,

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.760
when you go into the
Google headquarters,

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.140
there's this huge map of
the world with lights.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.860
And every time
somebody does a search,

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.390
in whatever part of the world
it is, a light goes off.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.370
So you're looking at this
sort of map of the world,

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.580
and lights are blaring at you.

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.579
It's like a Christmas tree.

00:09:47.579 --> 00:09:49.120
And everywhere-- I
mean, it must have

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.400
been three o'clock in
the morning in Tokyo,

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.110
but Japan was all lit up.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.800
And you know, it occurred to
me, what a worldwide phenomenon,

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.820
and what an amazing
company this is,

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.690
and what a worldwide
company it is.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.500
And also, as kind
of an economist who

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.970
is interested in
economic development,

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:16.950
I thought, what a way of showing
the parts of the world that

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.380
are undeveloped, because as
you looked at the map, the only

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:27.900
dark part was between sub-Sahara
Africa and southern Africa.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.470
And there were no
lights going on there.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:36.860
And you realize, how could
you build a better show where

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:41.420
the world is the economically
developed and where it isn't?

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.852
So those were kind of my
first two impressions.

00:10:45.852 --> 00:10:48.875
It was an absolutely
wonderful experience.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.550
We were giving out parts
of my "Random Walk" book.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:00.990
And at lunch, Mario
Batali was there,

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.150
and he was cooking
for all the Googlers,

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.900
and I traded books with him.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.360
And it was one of
my-- you think of

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.720
the unforgettable
experiences in your life,

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.884
and that was one of them,
my first visit to Google.

00:11:12.884 --> 00:11:13.550
ADAM NASH: Yeah.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:17.150
Well, it's fascinating,
because Google came public,

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:21.010
like I said, a few years
after the first big market

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.630
crash, the kind
of 2000 to 2001--

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.900
at least the big market
crash in recent memory.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.090
And then just a few years
later, of course, in 2008,

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:34.320
we had the massive
financial dislocation.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:37.020
And this is a question
for both of you, but how

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.880
do you feel that affects the
advice that you give people

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.590
or how they receive it, now that
they've been through not one,

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.089
but two of these big events?

00:11:46.089 --> 00:11:47.755
CHARLEY ELLIS: It
gathers the attention.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:54.780
It depends on your
own perspective.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.180
We're both of us in
an age cohort where

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.800
we've been around long enough
so you can't help but think

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.890
about times way back
and stuff like that.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:06.190
Markets go up and down.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.067
Mr. Morgan was one
asked, what do you

00:12:08.067 --> 00:12:09.150
think of the stock market?

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:10.340
He said, it will fluctuate.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.550
And sure enough, still does.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:17.360
Sometimes it fluctuates
like a punch in the face,

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.920
and sometimes it's like a
beautiful woman's soft touch,

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.349
just everything is
working out perfectly.

00:12:23.349 --> 00:12:25.890
But most the time, it's to sort
of wobbling around out there.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:29.300
And I think it's
dreadfully dangerous,

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.690
because it attracts
your attention.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:35.040
And candidly, the best
line ever, ever given

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.080
about the market was "frankly,
madam, I do not give a damn."

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.500
None of us should be paying
attention to the stock market

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.630
nearly as much as we pay
attention to ourselves.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:50.670
If you know who you are, where
you are, where you want to go,

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.190
you will do more good
for yourself than if

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:59.160
all about the stock market,
partly because it'll disappear,

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.890
because markets are
very temporary and gone.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:06.290
But you really are important,
and the rest of it is details.

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:09.410
And the specificity and the
intensity and excitement

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:12.210
of the details can
attract attention.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:15.930
But if you didn't know a
thing about what was going on,

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:17.480
you could still
find your pathway

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.180
through what's going to be
going on in the long run.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.230
I assume you've read Nate
Silver's wonderful book

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:24.760
about "The Signal
and the Noise."

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.780
It's a terrific book, and
a terrifically smart guy

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.910
who's put together an awful lot
of insight and understanding.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.190
He's right.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:35.470
The signal and the noise--
pay attention to the signal.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.440
Don't worry about the noise.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.050
And if the signal tunes in
for you in a particular way,

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:42.960
or you can tune in
with it, you can

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.960
do some important value
adding decision making.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.505
All the other things
are best ignored.

00:13:50.505 --> 00:13:51.880
BURTON MALKIEL:
And in fact, they

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.540
ought to be ignored, because
to the extent that they affect

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:59.030
you, they make you
do the wrong thing.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.225
One of the things--

00:14:00.225 --> 00:14:01.850
CHARLEY ELLIS: If
you're a human being.

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.230
BURTON MALKIEL: And that's
where this new field

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.990
of the behavioral
finance comes in.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.450
We have very good data
on the flow of money

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:16.880
into equity mutual funds.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.320
And what we know
is that money flows

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.550
in when everyone's optimistic.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:27.690
More money flowed into
equity mutual funds

00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.330
in the first
quarter of 2000 that

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.910
happened to be the top of
the internet bubble than ever

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.080
before.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:38.350
And then at the market bottom
in about the third quarter

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:43.530
of 2002, the money went out,
then the money came back in.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:46.460
And more money
came out than ever

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:50.820
before in the third
quarter of 2008,

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.870
at the height-- or
the depth, if you

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:57.110
wish-- of the financial
crisis, when everyone

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.640
thought the world
was going to end.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.600
So the problem with
looking at the noise

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.400
is it makes you do
the wrong thing.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.710
You're selling when, if
anything, you should be buying.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:12.240
And you're buying when
everyone is very optimistic,

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.950
and if anything, you
should be careful.

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:20.470
And that's the real
problem of letting

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:28.510
the noise effect you,
rather than simply if you're

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:33.830
saving for trying to build
up a big retirement nest egg,

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:40.650
of just doing it to
evenly over time,

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:43.030
take advantage of
the opportunities

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:48.538
when the market's down, not
sell, but keep a study course.

00:15:48.538 --> 00:15:50.121
ADAM NASH: You know,
it's-- oh, sorry.

00:15:50.121 --> 00:15:50.360
Go ahead.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.110
CHARLEY ELLIS: All
three of us went

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:52.000
to Harvard Business School.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.170
It was a great place to go.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.269
You can learn a lot.

00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:56.310
You can take the course
on investment management.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:57.360
You can learn a lot.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.870
You'd learn more if you
could just take five years

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:05.310
and be a parent of
a teenage child.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.560
You realize, it's very exciting.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.570
It's very interesting.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:10.885
It really gets you excited
positively sometimes,

00:16:10.885 --> 00:16:13.300
and it gets you very excited
negatively sometimes.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.510
And it doesn't matter.

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:18.460
They grow up to be
wonderful, long run.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.740
ADAM NASH: My teenage
years weren't so exciting,

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.596
but I may have done it wrong.

00:16:23.596 --> 00:16:24.620
[LAUGHS]

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.580
CHARLEY ELLIS: Depends--
exciting to you,

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:27.746
or exciting to your parents?

00:16:27.746 --> 00:16:29.580
ADAM NASH: I'm sure it
was exciting to them.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.037
CHARLEY ELLIS: I
would have thought

00:16:31.037 --> 00:16:32.786
they'd have been
really deeply afraid.

00:16:32.786 --> 00:16:34.160
ADAM NASH: [LAUGHS]
They're still

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.500
trying to figure out how
their son ended up in a career

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.333
where he doesn't have
to dress up every day.

00:16:38.333 --> 00:16:39.650
CHARLEY ELLIS: Right.

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.290
ADAM NASH: Actually,
I like this focus

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:42.645
on long term and investing.

00:16:42.645 --> 00:16:43.520
I see a big parallel.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.050
But great technology
companies have always

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:49.900
been the ones that got out of
the day-to-day quarter focus,

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.360
even when public, and focused
on initiatives three, five,

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.400
10 years out.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.180
I mean, Larry's done
that here at Google.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.460
I think Jeff has done that
fantastically well at Amazon.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.950
I think that it's rare.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:02.630
But the great
technology companies

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:07.210
know that technology reinvents
the rules every few years,

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.200
but it's fairly predictable
that scale will increase,

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.361
speed will increase,
and what's now possible.

00:17:14.361 --> 00:17:15.819
So a lot of the
folks in this room,

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:17.040
their first job may
have been at Google,

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.500
or they may have been
other technology companies.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.450
You were both
involved with Vanguard

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:24.054
in the very earliest of days.

00:17:24.054 --> 00:17:25.720
And for most of the
people in this room,

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.820
Vanguard is a huge fact of
the financial industry--

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.480
trillions in
assets, index funds.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.870
It's a staple of what
people think is available,

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:36.260
but that wasn't always true.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.770
Vanguard was effectively
a startup as well.

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:40.685
Do you guys want to comment on--

00:17:40.685 --> 00:17:42.460
CHARLEY ELLIS: Well,
we differed on that.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:46.650
Burt wisely said, "I
think this could work,"

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:49.580
and worked with Jack
Bogle to make it go.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:54.510
And I unwisely went to
Jack and said, "Jack, you

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:55.850
made a terrible mistake.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:58.350
You're in a short,
dead-end street.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.857
It's not going to work out.

00:17:59.857 --> 00:18:01.440
All of your friends
know you've really

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.800
screwed up making
this commitment.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.490
If you just stop now and come
back into the normal world,

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.790
you'll be OK."

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:13.127
Forgiveness is a part of the
investment management world.

00:18:13.127 --> 00:18:15.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:18.332
CHARLEY ELLIS: On the
whole, Burt was dead right.

00:18:18.332 --> 00:18:20.730
On the whole, I was dead wrong.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.700
BURTON MALKIEL: But
you know, the fact is,

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.570
when I first wrote my
"Random Walk" book, which

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.110
is in all of these editions--
it was actually 1973--

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.610
and it recommended
that people would

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:34.940
be better off with index funds.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:38.920
And I had a market
professional review my book

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.750
in "Business Week," as it was
the worst review I ever got.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.980
They said this is the
biggest piece of garbage

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.430
that they had ever seen.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.070
And when Jack started
the first index fund,

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.390
it was called Bogle's Folly.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:55.460
And in fact, I sometimes like
to think that Jack and I were

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.580
the only to investors
in the index fund.

00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:59.410
It was very slow to start.

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:02.330
It wasn't that this just
took off right away.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:04.470
It didn't.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:10.760
It was years and years before
it had any significant assets.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.060
And again, that just shows
you the importance of,

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:14.790
it was right.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.670
People say, well, who
wants to be mediocre?

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:23.080
It's not mediocre.

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:30.730
It's being above average,
being in a low-cost index fund.

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:34.710
And after a while, it
did start to take off.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:38.960
But believe me, it
was very, very slow.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:44.020
And people thought this was the
stupidest idea in the world.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:46.260
CHARLEY ELLIS: There were
advertisements taken out

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.750
in a trade magazine.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:53.110
"Index funds are un-American."

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.880
And it was run over and
over and over again,

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.390
because it got the
laughs, but it also

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:00.510
was what people really
felt emotionally.

00:20:03.362 --> 00:20:05.570
ADAM NASH: I think it's
seductive to believe that you

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.285
can outsmart the market or
figure these things out.

00:20:08.285 --> 00:20:10.160
CHARLEY ELLIS: Well,
can I interrupt you just

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:10.460
for a second?

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:10.950
ADAM NASH: Oh, yeah.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:13.241
CHARLEY ELLIS: If you're
trying to outsmart the market,

00:20:13.241 --> 00:20:15.840
that's self deception.

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.030
It's not as though the
market is out there

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:20.460
doing whatever markets do.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:23.110
There's a smart son of a
bitch on the other side

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.470
of every trade.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:26.650
And when we were
children and just getting

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:33.800
started in investment management
50 years ago, 92%, 94%, 95%

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.500
was done by
individual investors.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.750
What's an individual investor?

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.324
Well, he makes a trade
every year and a half.

00:20:40.324 --> 00:20:41.240
Every year and a half?

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.550
One trade?

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:44.230
Why does he buy or sell?

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:48.199
Well, he buys because he got
a bonus of a thousand dollars,

00:20:48.199 --> 00:20:50.240
or he sells because he
wants to help his daughter

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.439
pay for college.

00:20:51.439 --> 00:20:53.230
It has nothing to do
with the stock market.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:56.120
He doesn't do any
comparison shopping.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.560
Half of them bought AT&amp;T,
and then half of the rest

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.645
bought the company
they worked for,

00:21:02.645 --> 00:21:05.000
and the rest bought some
company they'd heard about,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.990
that must be a good company
because one of their friends

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.490
told them about it.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:13.040
Honest to goodness, it's
not hard to beat people

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.040
who have no access to
information or research,

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.160
have no comparison
value, aren't doing it

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.186
with anything like
rigor analysis.

00:21:21.186 --> 00:21:22.686
They just kind,
well, I've got some.

00:21:22.686 --> 00:21:25.470
Why don't I buy some.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:29.900
Today, it's not 95%
done by individuals.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:33.790
It's 96% done by experts.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:39.930
48 of the 96 are done by the 50
largest, most active investors.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.150
These are people
that really care.

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:43.920
And they've got
terrific equipment.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.330
They've all got it-- at
least a couple Bloombergs,

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:49.050
usually have one at
home, one at the office.

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:52.050
They've got tremendous access
to factual information.

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.190
Everybody gives
them the first call.

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:56.480
Everybody wants to do
business with them.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.360
They are so actively in the
market so much of the time,

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.350
and they've spent years
mastering the industry

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:04.900
that they're working in.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:09.956
And when they get you
in the crosshairs--

00:22:09.956 --> 00:22:11.830
it was all well and good
when George Plimpton

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.522
would go out and play
against the NFL team.

00:22:14.522 --> 00:22:17.160
But personally, if
I were to go out,

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.750
that would be the
way I would be.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:22.151
I'd be absolute bait
for destruction.

00:22:22.151 --> 00:22:23.900
And the same thing is
in the stock market.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.890
If you take on these
guys, they're really good.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.030
And they're killers.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:29.922
ADAM NASH: It's ironic
that a good, low-cost,

00:22:29.922 --> 00:22:30.880
diversified portfolio--

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.160
CHARLEY ELLIS: Wait a minute.

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.240
Let me give you the punch line.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.531
You don't have to take them on.

00:22:33.531 --> 00:22:37.970
You can let them do all
the work, all the work,

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:39.370
and the rest is on automatic.

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:42.130
And that's basically what
index funds are all about.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.505
After they've figured out
what the prices ought to be--

00:22:44.505 --> 00:22:46.380
and there's a lot of
work on price discovery,

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.546
and they get really good
at discovering the prices--

00:22:48.546 --> 00:22:50.796
once they've figured
it out, say fine.

00:22:50.796 --> 00:22:51.920
I'll take what they've got.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.590
I'll have what she's having.

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.200
ADAM NASH: Well,
you know, what's

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.730
fascinated me is Wealthfront,
our average customer right now

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:00.400
is in their 30s.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.270
A lot of twentysomethings,
thirtysomethings,

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:06.800
fortysomethings, they
tend to be more technical.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.190
And they've been through
these two market crashes,

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:11.560
so the thing that I
hear over and over again

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.310
from folks-- I like
to talk to customers--

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.300
is that they don't
think they're going

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.090
to make their money
by beating the market.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:19.298
They think they're going to
make their money by being

00:23:19.298 --> 00:23:22.870
a great engineer or a great
designer or building a company.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.890
They just want to have
their money soundly invested

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:27.700
in a low-cost way.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.345
When you folks talk
to young people

00:23:29.345 --> 00:23:30.720
now-- I know you're
both involved

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.910
a lot with different groups
and teaching-- how do you give

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:38.760
advice to folks in Gen Y,
Gen X, young people who

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.780
are at early stages
in their career?

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:45.500
BURTON MALKIEL:
Well, I generally

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:52.980
tell them to put money
into their investments

00:23:52.980 --> 00:24:00.560
regularly over time, no matter
what is happening, and don't

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:04.860
worry if the stock
market goes down.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:10.040
There's probably one
of these professionals

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.710
that Charley's talking about,
and maybe the best investor

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.970
that we've got in the
country, is Warren Buffett.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:24.560
And he has a wonderful
essay which says,

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:29.130
suppose you love
hamburgers, and that you're

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:33.300
going to be eating
hamburgers all your life,

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.460
and you're not a cattle rancher.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.790
Would you like the
price of hamburgers

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.267
to go up or down in the future?

00:24:40.267 --> 00:24:42.475
You say, well, OK, I'm going
to be buying hamburgers.

00:24:42.475 --> 00:24:46.220
Let's just assume the
hamburgers I buy next week

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:47.935
and next year are lower.

00:24:47.935 --> 00:24:49.990
You say OK, you
got that one right.

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:53.016
OK, here's the second
part of the quiz.

00:24:53.016 --> 00:24:54.890
Suppose you're going to
be buying automobiles

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:58.340
all your life, and you're not
an automobile manufacturer.

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:03.010
Do you want the price of
automobiles to go up or down?

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:06.990
You say, well, I'd just assume
the next auto I buy is actually

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:09.200
cheaper than the
one I just bought.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.610
And Buffet says, good.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:12.670
You got that one right too.

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:16.180
Now, for the final
exam, suppose you're

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:20.030
going to be investing
all your life.

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:27.550
You're going to be putting
money aside all your life.

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:30.070
Do you want the stock
market to go up or down?

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:32.910
And Buffett says this is
where people generally

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:36.280
flunk the final exam.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.490
It's only if you're in
retirement and taking money out

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.350
that you want the stock
prices to be high.

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:44.947
It's as if you're asking that
the hamburgers that you're

00:25:44.947 --> 00:25:47.530
going to be buying and the cars
that you're going to be buying

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:49.250
are going to go up in price.

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:55.070
In fact, through something
that's-- actually,

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:58.860
the technical term for it
is dollar cost averaging--

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:02.050
if, in fact, the
price goes down,

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:03.660
your money goes even further.

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.960
You can buy more shares.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:10.150
And you can put a
little example down

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:14.380
of how even when the
market is very volatile

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:18.370
and doesn't go up at
all, you can make money

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:23.300
because you bought more shares
when the market was down.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:25.930
And one of the
simulations that I've done

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:31.430
is take a decade-- the first
decade of the 2000s, which

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.770
has been called by investors
"the lost decade," because

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:38.880
in general, if you put
money in the S&amp;P 500

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:43.440
on January 1 of 2000
and looked at what

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.250
it was worth on
December 31 of 2009,

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:49.290
you didn't make any money.

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:51.660
The second decade's
been pretty good,

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.870
but the first
decade was terrible.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:58.050
But if you put money in
every quarter, regularly,

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.500
you actually made a
pretty good rate of return

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.500
even during the lost decade.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:07.940
So what I try to tell
people is, generally,

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:12.020
put the money in steadily.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.690
Nobody can time the market.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:16.530
Professionals can't do it.

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:18.990
Look, I've been in
this game for 50 years.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:21.640
I've never known anyone
who can time the market.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.260
I've never known
anyone who knows

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.330
anyone who can time the market.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.740
It's not that the efficient
market hypothesis means

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.640
that prices are always
right, and that's

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.300
how some people
poo-poo the idea.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.820
Prices are not always right.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.040
They're always wrong.

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.410
The problem is, no
one knows for sure

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:42.744
whether they're too
high or too low.

00:27:42.744 --> 00:27:44.410
ADAM NASH: What I
love about that advice

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:48.463
is it highlights actually
good financial fundamentals.

00:27:48.463 --> 00:27:50.462
It turns out the most
important for young people

00:27:50.462 --> 00:27:52.920
is just to be saving, they
save regularly, and put

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:53.930
in the market.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:57.060
It's actually better for them
if the market has up and down,

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.050
because they'll get
some of the downs.

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.300
True, you get some of the
ups, but the long-term trend

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:03.840
is obviously their friend.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.564
Sorry, go ahead.

00:28:04.564 --> 00:28:06.980
CHARLEY ELLIS: You just said
it, but saving is number one.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:07.972
ADAM NASH: Yes.

00:28:07.972 --> 00:28:09.430
CHARLEY ELLIS: Not
getting excited,

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:14.150
either at the top or the
bottom, is number two.

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:18.050
And then regular
investing, ho-hum,

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:20.740
steady, steady,
steady-- number three.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.450
And it works out fabulously.

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.236
But it takes some
self discipline when

00:28:26.236 --> 00:28:28.110
the excitement around
you, and all the people

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:30.100
are talking in the
newspapers and magazines

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.850
and television programs
are talking about,

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:33.740
this may be the last
chance to get in

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.930
on a wonderful opportunity.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.660
It's very hard not to
get deeply concerned when

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.640
you see the whole
economy's falling apart,

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.830
Asia's going wrong,
Europe's going wrong,

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:45.810
the president's having
a terrible time,

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:48.810
the president's wife
is unhappy with him,

00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:51.430
your wife is unhappy with
you, and your friends are all

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:53.960
deeply concerned, and the
food doesn't taste good.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.942
It's pretty hard not
to get depressed.

00:28:55.942 --> 00:28:57.900
But you've got to hang
in there, because that's

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.470
the time of your best
chance of your lifetime.

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:04.990
BURTON MALKIEL: And control the
things that you can control.

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:08.260
You can't control the ups
and downs of the market.

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:10.970
You can control your costs.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:16.700
You can control your
taxes that you pay.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:21.580
And you can use the best friend
you've got for reducing risk,

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.750
and that's diversifying.

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:28.560
So diversify, control the
things that you can control,

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:32.190
and as much as the
market might fluctuate,

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:33.690
don't worry about it.

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:34.952
You'll come out OK.

00:29:34.952 --> 00:29:37.967
ADAM NASH: You know, I
think it's such good advice.

00:29:37.967 --> 00:29:39.550
Ironically I think
in some ways, we've

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:43.440
made it harder on ourselves
in this generation.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.090
We all have smartphones
in our pockets.

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:46.200
They buzz all the time.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.710
We're checking our feeds,
whether it's Google+ Facebook

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:50.210
or Twitter.

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:52.990
There's this stuff
happening all the time.

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:55.971
So learning that
basic fact that,

00:29:55.971 --> 00:29:57.720
that there are some
things you can control

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.240
and some things you
can't, is really

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.240
important with investing.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.660
CHARLEY ELLIS: One thing,
just an easy metric on this,

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.940
is don't never do
nothing that you're not

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:11.860
prepared to hold onto for at
least 10 years, whatever it is.

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.940
ADAM NASH: 10 years.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.780
I mean, actually
it's a good segue.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:20.510
You did an interview, I
think, recently, with--

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:21.677
was it "Investor News," or--

00:30:21.677 --> 00:30:23.343
CHARLEY ELLIS:
"Institutional Investor."

00:30:23.343 --> 00:30:25.170
ADAM NASH:
"Institutional Investor."

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:29.000
I think of the title the
article was "Is Alpha Dead?"

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.260
And I mean, compared
to 40 years ago,

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.207
do you feel like-- is it the
same as it's always been,

00:30:35.207 --> 00:30:38.994
or has it got even harder
to beat the market?

00:30:38.994 --> 00:30:40.910
CHARLEY ELLIS: 50 years
ago, it was relatively

00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:44.140
easy to do better than
the market rate of return,

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:47.840
because the competition
wasn't very good.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:52.450
Today, the competition
is just marvelous.

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.280
Every time you buy,
you buy from somebody

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.910
who knows a hell
of a lot about it.

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:57.451
Every time you sell
something, you're

00:30:57.451 --> 00:31:00.090
selling it to somebody who
knows a hell of a lot about it.

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:02.820
They may make mistakes,
but how smart are you

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:05.300
that you won't have made at
least about the same the number

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:10.610
of mistakes, plus the cost of
being there in the activity?

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:13.320
It's just, the
world has changed.

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.670
And McCain said, one
wonderful sentence,

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:18.880
"When the facts change,
I change my mind.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.990
What do you do about yours?"

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:22.680
And it's worth thinking about.

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.530
And the world of
investing has changed.

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.570
And so what would be
sensible 50 years ago

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:31.600
could now be not
at all sensible.

00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.240
All the evidence
is that it doesn't

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:37.490
work to do what would
have worked 50 years ago.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:39.290
Fine.

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:44.430
ADAM NASH: Well, I think
it's magical in some ways

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.330
that we've evolved the industry
to the point where you can own

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:50.240
the entire US stock market for
such an incredibly cheap rate.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:54.214
I mean, five basis points
is kind of amazing.

00:31:54.214 --> 00:31:56.380
It's good to know that even
in this arms race that's

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.296
going on amongst the
professional investor set

00:31:58.296 --> 00:32:00.790
that you can do better
than most of them

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:04.270
just by buying the
simple index funds.

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:07.790
Let me segue a bit, some
kind of topical news.

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:11.860
The Federal Reserve has been
in the news a lot lately.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:15.850
Both of you have had careers--
you worked with Alan Greenspan

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:20.940
at one point, Ben Bernanke,
I think even Janet Yellen,

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.900
we were talking about.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:27.430
Any comments about
what the differences

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:32.260
are, what it takes to be a
great Federal Reserve chairman?

00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.105
I mean, it's something you
going to really look over

00:32:35.105 --> 00:32:35.990
over decades.

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:38.110
It's not something you
can really understand just

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:40.085
looking at the most
recent candidates.

00:32:40.085 --> 00:32:40.730
CHARLEY ELLIS: Oh,
I think there's

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:41.910
some things you could say.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:46.450
Number one, Federal Reserve
governance is a team sport.

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:49.760
So if you are not really good
at working with other people,

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.510
you've got a real problem.

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:53.260
Secondly, I think
you could easily

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.450
say we have been really
fortunate to have

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:58.260
some extraordinary
people serving

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:02.522
in the governorship, but
particularly the chairman.

00:33:02.522 --> 00:33:03.980
You should talk
about Ben Bernanke,

00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.771
because you really
worked closely with him.

00:33:05.771 --> 00:33:11.550
I knew him, but-- I knew Janet
Yellen quite closely at Yale.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:13.640
These are extraordinary
people who

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.410
have studied and studied and
studied the field in which they

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:18.010
are then put to test.

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:22.290
Everything that they live
with is new, difficult,

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:26.040
fast moving, and the
data is not available.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.330
So it's a really tough job.

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:30.880
But if you wanted
to pick people who

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.290
are wonderfully
well-suited to that,

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:35.650
out of all the people
that might be chosen,

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:38.210
we've been very, very
fortune as a nation.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:41.380
And what's wonderful is
that the rest of the world

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:44.461
has very talented people in
their central banks also,

00:33:44.461 --> 00:33:46.710
but that these people talk
to each other all the time.

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:48.140
And the factual
information that's

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.710
accessible to the
bankers is terrific.

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:51.430
Is it perfect?

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:52.490
Certainly not.

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:53.310
Is it a hard job?

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:54.560
You bet.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.970
An unwinding of this massive
purchase of mortgages

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:00.780
is going to be an
unbelievably challenging--

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:01.950
when do you do it?

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:02.990
How do you do it?

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:04.690
How do you communicate about it?

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.281
It's going to be hard.

00:34:06.281 --> 00:34:08.239
BURTON MALKIEL: I would
agree with you, surely,

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:11.770
that the consensus
building is so important.

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:20.510
And Ben came from my university,
and so I've seen Ben in action.

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:25.540
Herding a group of
prima donna faculty

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:31.389
around is not one of the
easiest things in the world,

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:34.940
and Ben was a brilliant
department chairman.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.480
And I think Ben
was quite brilliant

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.389
as the leader of
the Federal Reserve.

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:42.530
And I think one
of the things that

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:46.190
is very likely to be the
case for Janet Yellen

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:49.030
is that she has some
of the same qualities.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:59.620
So I agree with you that we've
got a big enough government

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:05.690
portfolio that there are really
some questions about whether we

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:10.920
have done something
to hurt the market.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:14.030
Unwinding this,
which is certainly

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:15.900
something that
needs to be done, is

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.370
going to be very, very tricky.

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:24.732
But I think we've got the
right people on board to do it.

00:35:24.732 --> 00:35:26.940
ADAM NASH: That's good to
hear. [LAUGHS] A little bit

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:28.820
of good news.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:31.557
Before we open it
up to questions,

00:35:31.557 --> 00:35:33.390
because I know people
must have quite a few,

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:36.290
I wanted to make sure to
ask a fundamental one.

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:41.470
You've both been a part of some
very fundamental improvements

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:45.770
in the structure of the
industry-- what clients deserve

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:50.580
from their advisors, index
funds, passive investing-- I

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:53.410
mean, just a wide
range of advocacy

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:57.360
for making investing
better for individuals.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.070
How do you think
about your legacy,

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:03.334
or what you want to make
sure continues going forward,

00:36:03.334 --> 00:36:04.750
given the progress
that we've been

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:06.790
able to make over
the last few decades?

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:08.415
BURTON MALKIEL: Well,
one of the things

00:36:08.415 --> 00:36:12.390
that I have the
worked on recently

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:18.110
is to try to see if we could get
the whole industry to sign onto

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:21.640
something that's called
the fiduciary standard.

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.380
And it's sort of very simple--
that you don't do anything

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:30.470
for your client that
you're not absolutely 100%

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:34.240
convinced is in your
client's interest.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.190
And that's basically
what I think

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:40.370
is the fundamental
problem with the industry,

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:45.390
that there is this severe
conflict of interest.

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:47.010
I mean, this is one
of the things that

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:50.220
happened in the
financial crisis.

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:57.710
If you are making a
lot of money selling

00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:00.890
mortgage-backed
securities, well, we're

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:05.090
not going to worry what kind
of toxic stuff is in there.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:07.750
If people want to buy
it, let them buy it.

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:12.790
That was basically
what the industry did.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:17.870
And I think what
is the answer is,

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:21.800
what informs every decision
you make is not whether it's

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:29.630
good for me, whether it's going
to be good for my bottom line,

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:33.030
but whether it is good for
the bottom line of the people

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:33.880
we're serving.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:39.190
And if I had a
legacy that I wanted

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:43.970
to leave on my tombstone,
that would be it.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:45.619
ADAM NASH: Charley?

00:37:45.619 --> 00:37:47.327
CHARLEY ELLIS: I don't
believe in legacy.

00:37:47.327 --> 00:37:51.025
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:51.025 --> 00:37:52.525
CHARLEY ELLIS: I
would just say read

00:37:52.525 --> 00:37:53.940
what Burt wrote
on his tombstone.

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:54.620
That'd do fine.

00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:00.280
It's a cultural problem.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.570
If we get enough
misbehaving, we'll

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:05.260
get enough correctives
so that the culture will

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.720
move towards doing the
right sorts of things.

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.500
But once you separate
the professional value

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.430
from the economics
of the business,

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:16.250
the business economics are
going to take off and get

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:17.130
to be dominant.

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:19.370
And it will attract
people who say, well, you

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:21.411
get pretty good pay over there.

00:38:21.411 --> 00:38:23.160
It doesn't look like
all that boring work,

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.510
so I'd like to do it,
and that recreates.

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:31.180
If you go back and read
economic history in the '30s,

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:34.490
there were some marvelous
hearings in Washington

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:37.670
where one banker after another
was embarrassed something

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:41.080
unbelievable to be asked
a series of questions--

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.330
the Pujo hearings.

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:45.360
And it's kind of fun
to read back over that.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:50.290
It's just so similar
to what we did.

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:57.100
In the last round-- 2008,
and the break in the market--

00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:00.310
you can trace an
unfortunately large fraction

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:02.250
of the really
severe difficulties

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:07.480
to very specific
individuals who misbehaved.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.760
And it wasn't the
people down the line

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.910
that did the worst of it.

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:14.070
It was the people at the
top of those organizations

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:21.220
that did the worst of
it, and that's a shame.

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:23.995
ADAM NASH: Well, I think
I have more questions.

00:39:23.995 --> 00:39:25.870
But I want to make sure,
just given the time,

00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:26.240
and also that we--

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.110
CHARLEY ELLIS: I have one
that I want to squeeze in,

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:29.568
because I'm all
excited about this.

00:39:29.568 --> 00:39:30.890
ADAM NASH: Sure, yeah.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:32.390
CHARLEY ELLIS: As
you've heard, I've

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:34.370
been around for a long time.

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:36.410
I'm sitting in an investment
committee meeting,

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:39.260
and we're getting a review by
the manager of why it didn't

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:41.750
happen to be their
particular kind of market,

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:44.600
and it just happened to be
that instead of doing better

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:47.060
than the market, they happened
to do slightly less well,

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:49.260
but they've done some
wonderful things to improve,

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:52.770
and they're going to be able to
do to terrific in the future.

00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:57.960
And I'm looking at the numbers,
and I realized-- never actually

00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:01.700
realized it after
40 some odd years,

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:07.300
48 years-- I hadn't
realized what the fees are.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:08.720
Now, most of us
in this room would

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.770
be able to say,
oh, fees are small.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:13.450
Fees are really small.

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:16.530
It's usually a four-letter
word and a single number.

00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:20.810
"Only" is the four-letter word,
and 1% is the single number.

00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:22.860
Well, the 1% is not accurate.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:28.210
Mutual funds typically
run closer to 1 and 1/4%

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:30.249
of the assets.

00:40:30.249 --> 00:40:32.290
But then I would turn to
Burt and say, "but Burt,

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:34.630
you've already got the assets."

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:39.227
So the fee isn't what you're
paying for what you're getting,

00:40:39.227 --> 00:40:40.810
because you've already
got the assets.

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:41.910
What are you getting?

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:44.410
Oh, Charley, we're
getting a return.

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:45.690
Great.

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:48.100
Normal expectation
of returns here,

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:50.990
given the market's gone up a
fair amount, going forward,

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:54.720
might be 7% or 8%,
on average, with lots

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.530
of ups and downs in between.

00:40:56.530 --> 00:41:00.490
So that 1%, or a little
over 1%-- as a percent,

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:03.126
not of assets, but a
percent of the returns--

00:41:03.126 --> 00:41:04.250
what's that work out to be?

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:06.480
Oh, let me do the math.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.919
Well, call it 15%.

00:41:08.919 --> 00:41:10.210
That doesn't sound like "only."

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:11.000
I guess not.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.490
I guess that's really
actually pretty high.

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:16.510
And then when I was in
school studying economics,

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:20.300
we all were taught everything
is comparative price.

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:23.350
So what's the commodity product
and the commodity price?

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:26.180
And then what's the custom
product and the custom price?

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:29.060
The commodity product
is an index fund.

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:31.660
It gets you the market
rate of return every day,

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:35.780
every week, every month, every
year, same old, same old market

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:39.080
rate of return, at no more,
no less than the market

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.609
level or riskiness.

00:41:41.609 --> 00:41:43.400
OK, that's a pretty
good commodity product.

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.680
What's it cost?

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.260
One-tenth of one percent.

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:50.110
Now, you can get a
custom-tailored product,

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:53.160
and what does it cost?

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:57.850
Well, it costs-- if it's
10 basis points for one,

00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:00.600
it's 120 basis
points for the other.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:04.674
So incremental cost
is 110 basis points.

00:42:04.674 --> 00:42:07.090
Gee, I must get a pretty good
return in exchange for that,

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:07.630
don't I?

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:08.510
No, Charley.

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:10.250
I'm sorry, but you don't.

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:12.032
Actually, you get more risk.

00:42:12.032 --> 00:42:13.990
You get a lot of uncertainty,
because you never

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:15.948
know when something's
really going to go wrong.

00:42:15.948 --> 00:42:18.360
But leave that
aside-- more risk,

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:23.890
and on average, 3/4 of the
funds that are actively

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:25.740
managed-- maybe it's
80% of the funds,

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:28.580
somewhere in there--
underperform the benchmark

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:30.790
that they said they
were going to match.

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:32.680
And you never can
figure out who's

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:36.274
going to underperform--
most-- and you could never

00:42:36.274 --> 00:42:37.815
figure out who's
going to outperform.

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.290
There's no way of doing it.

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:44.930
So what you're doing when you
get a custom-tailored product

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:47.780
is you're paying
a much higher fee

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:52.460
for less quality
and a lower return.

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:54.320
And it is just
amazing that that's

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:58.220
something that continues
year after year after year.

00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.639
And it can't last for long,
but really smart people

00:43:00.639 --> 00:43:03.180
are going to figure it out and
say, I'm not going to do that.

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.790
I'm going to take the
commodity product because it's

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:11.540
cheaper and better return,
and I've got better things

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:14.320
to do with my time than chewing
my nails over whether I'm

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.131
going to be OK or not OK.

00:43:16.131 --> 00:43:18.630
BURTON MALKIEL: Let me just put
a footnote on this, Charley,

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:23.190
because I've just done
some work on 401(k) plans.

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:28.430
And in general, the cost
is more like 2% than 1%,

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:32.400
because then there's a rep fee
around the high-priced mutual

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.030
funds that are in there.

00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:39.760
And so you might say, instead
of getting a 7% return,

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.920
you get only a 5% return.

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:45.630
So your way of looking
at it is, it's not 2%.

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:50.370
It's really 2/7 is
what you're paying.

00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:56.360
But it's even worse than that,
because these costs compound.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:02.520
If you think of putting
money in at 7% for 40 years

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:06.330
or putting money in
at 5% for 40 years,

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:11.580
that difference at the
end isn't even 2/7.

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:14.240
You're getting about half
the amount at the end,

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:17.720
because the tyranny of the
compounding of the costs

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:18.580
gets you.

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:23.220
So again, it is
just so important,

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:26.670
if you got something for
it, fine, but you don't.

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:30.350
The evidence is
unmistakable that you don't.

00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:33.700
It's getting tougher and
tougher all the time.

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:37.440
The market's not
always right, but there

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:38.760
are few Warren Buffetts.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.460
I sometimes say if
when I wrote my book,

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:45.270
I knew that Warren Buffett was
going to be Warren Buffett,

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:47.252
I wouldn't have said
"buy an index fund."

00:44:47.252 --> 00:44:49.460
I would have said, "go buy
Berkshire Hathaway," which

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:51.790
is Warren Buffett's
investment company.

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:54.880
And you know what, there
will be Warren Buffetts

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.150
over the next 40 years.

00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:59.660
There'll be maybe
five or six of them.

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.300
It could very well be.

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:03.344
But as you said, I
don't know who they are.

00:45:03.344 --> 00:45:04.510
You don't know who they are.

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:06.380
And when you try to
go for them, you're

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:09.250
much more likely to be
on the negative side

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:12.850
of the distribution, and
you're going to be a loser.

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:22.360
So index investing
isn't mediocre.

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:23.840
It isn't average.

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.752
It's way above average.

00:45:25.752 --> 00:45:27.960
CHARLEY ELLIS: One place
that I would differ slightly

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.270
from you, Burt--
same conclusion.

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:32.220
You say you would
only get half as

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:36.591
much if you went active
as opposed to index.

00:45:36.591 --> 00:45:38.840
I'd just like to turn it
around and say the other way,

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.310
you get twice as much
at the end of the run--

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:42.820
I won't argue with you at all.

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:43.755
CHARLEY ELLIS: If you
do index instead of--

00:45:43.755 --> 00:45:45.670
BURTON MALKIEL: Won't argue
with you at all, Charley.

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:47.170
ADAM NASH: Well,
I'll tell you guys,

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:50.000
this is great, because my
background is in software

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.500
as an engineer, and I focused
on human computer interaction.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:55.330
But I'll tell you, after joining
Wealthfront, finding ways

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:57.920
to explain to
people that 1% to 2%

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:01.399
is actually a really big number
is one of the hardest problems

00:46:01.399 --> 00:46:02.190
that I've run into.

00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:03.898
CHARLEY ELLIS: Say
that to a balloon that

00:46:03.898 --> 00:46:08.490
meets a pin-- beautiful big
balloon, one tiny little pin.

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:10.030
BURTON MALKIEL:
Albert Einstein said

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:16.210
that compounding is the
greatest force in the world.

00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:20.684
Well, the cost compound too,
and that's what gets you.

00:46:20.684 --> 00:46:22.100
CHARLEY ELLIS:
Before we leave it,

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:24.190
could we just all agree
that nobody should ever

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:26.199
use credit card debt?

00:46:26.199 --> 00:46:28.240
Because not only is that
a big interest, but boy,

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.741
when that compounds,
it really goes.

00:46:29.741 --> 00:46:30.406
ADAM NASH: Yeah.

00:46:30.406 --> 00:46:33.040
When people find out that debt
compounds just the same way

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.280
with much bigger interest rates,
it's usually real depressing.

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.977
CHARLEY ELLIS:
They say ooh, wow.

00:46:38.977 --> 00:46:39.810
ADAM NASH: So great.

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:41.130
So I think in terms
of time, we wanted

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:43.046
to leave some time for
folks to ask questions.

00:46:43.046 --> 00:46:44.890
We have microphones
set up for the folks

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:48.400
who are watching remotely.

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.240
Feel free, and I'll
just call on folks.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.710
Yeah, maybe your name and
who the question's for.

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:54.654
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:46:54.654 --> 00:46:55.320
My name's David.

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.403
A question about for Burt.

00:46:56.403 --> 00:46:59.500
So you said earlier you can
control the taxes that you pay.

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:02.090
I'd love to know how.

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:06.510
BURTON MALKIEL: Basically,
you can control the taxes

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:12.250
by something that's called
tax loss harvesting.

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:15.140
If you have a
portfolio-- let's say

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:21.430
that you just have a
portfolio of US stocks,

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:28.480
or even US technology
stocks, and it's an index.

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:32.080
There are always going to be
a few of those stocks that

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.200
have gone down.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.910
You've got Google,
that's gone up.

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:43.820
You have Groupon,
that went down.

00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:48.070
So what you do in
tax loss harvesting

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:54.110
is that you sell the loser
and put an equivalent one in.

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:57.020
And we can do this
with index funds.

00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:01.700
We have a diversified
portfolio of US stocks,

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:05.420
of international stocks,
of developed countries,

00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:09.360
of emerging market
stocks, of foreign bonds.

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.660
In other words, we've got a
whole bunch of asset classes.

00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:17.820
So in a period such as this
past year, where the US stock

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:21.970
market has gone way up, but
emerging markets have actually

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:25.640
gone down-- emerging markets
have been weak this year--

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:30.650
you sell one emerging market
index fund and buy another.

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:36.720
So you keep the exposure,
but you recognize a loss,

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:40.460
and that loss is
deductible from your taxes

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:42.870
up to a certain
amount, or could be

00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:45.880
used to offset
other capital gains.

00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:50.960
So it's the harvesting
of the losses that

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:55.750
is a way of
controlling your taxes.

00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:57.640
And again, up to
a certain amount,

00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.220
even if you had no
other capital gains,

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:03.441
you could deduct this on
your 1040 for the year.

00:49:03.441 --> 00:49:04.940
ADAM NASH: This is
one of the things

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:09.270
that humans can do-- if
you're really on top of it,

00:49:09.270 --> 00:49:12.840
you'll see advisers do once
a year-- you always see

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.290
the articles and
papers about harvesting

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:16.940
some losses in the
end of November,

00:49:16.940 --> 00:49:20.530
somewhere between Thanksgiving
and that 30-day window.

00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:22.310
Wealthfront, because
we did in software,

00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:24.700
we can actually look for
those opportunities every day.

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:27.590
It just turns out that
the computers never sleep.

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:29.130
But yeah, it's a
great technique.

00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:31.490
There's no question.

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:32.210
Go ahead.

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:33.250
AUDIENCE: So hi, there.

00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:34.160
My name is Doug.

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:36.550
And by the way, I'm
from the Yale school

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:43.290
of management, class
of 2013, so very nice.

00:49:43.290 --> 00:49:47.560
By the way, the same
thing is taught at Yale,

00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:52.160
so also, double
thumbs up on that.

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:55.530
My question is about
diversification.

00:49:55.530 --> 00:50:00.620
So I somehow can't believe
the answer is invest only

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:01.590
in index funds.

00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:06.200
It seems like-- I mean, index
fund, by its definition,

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:12.140
is diverse, because it invests
in many different things-- it's

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:14.920
as if you don't
diversify your risk.

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:20.050
And my question is, what
would you say to that?

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.230
BURTON MALKIEL: Well, you
are diversifying your risk

00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:24.720
using index funds.

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:27.250
A lot of people will tell
me, because I believe

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:30.120
in buying index funds
for emerging markets,

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:32.790
and a lot of people make
the following argument.

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:36.380
Look, emerging markets
are very inefficient.

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:40.880
Information isn't, in fact,
as available for each stock

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:45.450
as it is in, let's say,
the United States market.

00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:47.390
And that's absolutely correct.

00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:49.960
But when you look
at the data, you

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:53.170
look at the data over
the last 10 years,

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:56.420
and it's not 2/3
over that period who

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:58.710
were worse than the index.

00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:04.990
It was basically over 90% of
active emerging market managers

00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:09.230
were worse than an
emerging market index,

00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:15.020
and it was in part almost
because of the inefficiency.

00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:18.430
The trading markets are
very inefficient in emerging

00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:18.960
markets.

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:21.230
There are big bid-ask spreads.

00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:27.590
So if you trade, you're paying
a big gap, because you're always

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:31.110
a buying at the ask price
and selling at the bid price.

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:33.950
There are stamp taxes
in emerging markets,

00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:38.990
so that there's an extra
tax when you trade.

00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:42.580
When there are so-called
market impact costs,

00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:44.690
there's so little liquidity.

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:47.710
So it's not like buying
500 shares of Google

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:49.470
and you don't move the market.

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:52.480
You move the price against you.

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:59.690
And so even in markets
that seem less efficient,

00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:01.000
the markets are going to move.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Different markets are
going to move differently.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.480
Emerging markets
are very unpopular.

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:09.930
During that lost decade, when
the US market did nothing,

00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:12.600
emerging markets did 10% a year.

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:18.666
During the last year, the
US market is up 15% plus,

00:52:18.666 --> 00:52:21.610
and emerging markets
were down 4% or 5%.

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:25.620
So there is the opportunity
for tax loss harvesting,

00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:28.970
there is the opportunity
for diversification,

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:33.080
and I don't see why you have
to go to individual stocks

00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:34.470
to get those opportunities.

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:37.740
I think they're still
there with index funds,

00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:40.650
as long as you're in
different markets that

00:52:40.650 --> 00:52:42.875
react to different
economic realities.

00:52:47.014 --> 00:52:47.680
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:49.410
My name is Jeff.

00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:54.830
You talk about dollar cost
averaging and investing

00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:58.250
slowly over the course of
one's life-- excellent advice,

00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:00.980
but it's sort of
one-dimensional.

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:03.720
And so suppose that over
the course of an investment

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:08.000
lifetime, I have
several different index

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.500
funds-- US indices,
emerging market, whatever--

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:17.320
and over time, I say,
well, maybe this index here

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:20.180
isn't really the
best one to have,

00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:22.280
or I don't think it's
got the best future,

00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:26.360
and I'd like to shifts my focus.

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:30.180
And I'm curious how you see
that sort of reallocation.

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:33.320
Like, what's the right
way to reallocate, or even

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:36.640
to do it at all, because
there's this element of,

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.210
well, you shouldn't
think about that.

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:39.930
You should just keep
plodding forward.

00:53:39.930 --> 00:53:42.221
CHARLEY ELLIS: Well, I think
you should think about it.

00:53:42.221 --> 00:53:45.940
And this actually
gets to another thing

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:47.990
that we do at
Wealthfront that I think

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:56.070
is extremely valuable-- tactical
asset allocation, which is,

00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:59.460
gee, I don't like China now.

00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:02.140
I think I ought to be in Brazil.

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:04.680
Or, I don't like
emerging markets.

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:07.130
I think I ought to
be in the US market.

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:08.540
I think that doesn't work.

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:11.750
I've seen many
professionals try to do it.

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:15.290
I think it simply
cannot be done.

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:20.960
But what you can
do is rebalance.

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:25.110
And what rebalancing
does is it simply says,

00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:27.640
let's say you thought
your portfolio ought

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:36.740
to be, let's say 50% US,
25% developed foreign,

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:38.210
25% emerging.

00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:40.470
I'm just making up the numbers.

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:44.230
And then what you do is
at least once a year,

00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:46.350
you re-balance to that.

00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:49.450
And what that makes
you do is it makes

00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:53.270
you take some money off the
table on the market that

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:57.270
did particularly well, and
makes you put the money back

00:54:57.270 --> 00:55:03.140
into the market that
did relatively poorly.

00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:06.510
If you want, it's the
opposite of what people do,

00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:08.830
because what people
actually do is

00:55:08.830 --> 00:55:11.880
they put more money into
the market that did well

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:14.740
and take the money out of
the market that did poorly.

00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:21.060
And my own work suggests that
rebalancing over the last 15

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:26.390
years-- and just once a year,
very simply-- added between one

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:30.010
and two percentage
points to your return

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:32.680
of a diversified portfolio.

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:35.980
And that's one of the other
services of Wealthfront

00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:40.990
is that we do a
systematic rebalancing.

00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:44.080
I understand the argument
"couldn't we do it tactically?"

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:46.600
And I just don't think
anybody knows how to do it.

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.370
I don't know, Charley,
what your view is.

00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:50.870
CHARLEY ELLIS: Well, there are
people who know how to do it,

00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:51.850
but only briefly.

00:55:51.850 --> 00:55:53.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:56.230
BURTON MALKIEL: Right,
not consistently.

00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:58.030
I mean, there will
always be people

00:55:58.030 --> 00:56:00.234
who get it right
once in a while.

00:56:00.234 --> 00:56:01.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:01.600
Thanks.

00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:03.019
ADAM NASH: Thank you.

00:56:03.019 --> 00:56:03.560
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:04.270
My name is Tom.

00:56:04.270 --> 00:56:06.510
I was wondering, as more
and more people seem

00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:10.240
to take your advice and use
sort of a passive approach

00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:11.770
and stop picking
winners and losers,

00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:14.490
does there ever become a
tipping point in the future

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:16.490
where it sort of
becomes the 1950s again,

00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:19.150
and since no one is
paying attention at all,

00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:22.337
it actually becomes possible
to pick winners and losers?

00:56:22.337 --> 00:56:23.170
CHARLEY ELLIS: Yeah.

00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:27.060
There is a point at which
it becomes, once again,

00:56:27.060 --> 00:56:28.850
a terrific opportunity.

00:56:28.850 --> 00:56:31.410
It's that time when
people say, I'm

00:56:31.410 --> 00:56:33.630
not going to be an
investment manager.

00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:35.150
There's no point in it.

00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:38.820
The pay have gone down so badly.

00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:42.180
You can get much better
jobs doing something else.

00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:45.840
It's going to come at a time
when the securities firms don't

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.720
have analysts that
are pumping out

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:50.394
a tremendous amount of
factual information,

00:56:50.394 --> 00:56:51.852
when Mike Bloomberg
says, you know,

00:56:51.852 --> 00:56:54.352
we're going to pull back all
those machines because nobody's

00:56:54.352 --> 00:56:55.360
subscribing anymore.

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.340
We're going to junk them.

00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:58.850
There is a point.

00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:01.326
But walk through
the mathematics.

00:57:01.326 --> 00:57:06.660
A typical index fund will
have turnover of about 5%.

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:09.680
The market as a whole has
turnover of about 100%,

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.630
120%, somewhere in that range.

00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:17.910
So if you move 50% of
the assets into indexing,

00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:20.862
what fraction of the
market will that be?

00:57:20.862 --> 00:57:22.400
It's about 3%.

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:28.040
If you move 80% into indexing,
a fraction of the total market

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:30.160
activity, you're
starting to get close.

00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:34.320
When you get to 95% of
the money is now indexed,

00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:38.440
the amount of opportunity
off indexing would be high.

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:40.360
But by then, all
those sad things

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.660
I was talking about
earlier, people saying,

00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:45.210
this business is over,
I can't get a job.

00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:46.630
I can't get any equipment.

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:48.620
I can't get any services.

00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:49.780
To hell with it.

00:57:49.780 --> 00:57:51.920
Then, we'll be back
with grass growing

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:53.670
through the streets
of New York, and we'll

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:55.590
have all kinds of
opportunities for people

00:57:55.590 --> 00:57:58.110
to get into active
investment management.

00:57:58.110 --> 00:58:00.800
But they'll be
alone, and they won't

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.470
be able to get the
services and help,

00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:04.170
and so it won't work
for them anyway.

00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:07.810
I mean, this is one of those
marvelous mythical questions

00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:12.000
that I love your asking
it, because it's a setup.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000
In the reality,
the math, it just

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.040
doesn't work that
there will come

00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.350
a time there's so much
index that somebody ought

00:58:18.350 --> 00:58:22.552
to be really out there
doing active investing.

00:58:22.552 --> 00:58:24.010
BURTON MALKIEL:
Indexing has grown.

00:58:24.010 --> 00:58:31.460
I mean, it is getting close
to 25% of individual money,

00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:37.780
and probably close to a third of
institutional money is indexed.

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:40.050
And when it gets to
be 95%, I'm going

00:58:40.050 --> 00:58:41.360
to worry about that question.

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:44.480
But I'm with Charley.

00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:45.942
It's a good
theoretical question,

00:58:45.942 --> 00:58:47.775
but I don't think it's
ever going to happen.

00:58:47.775 --> 00:58:49.358
CHARLEY ELLIS: You
know that old poem?

00:58:49.358 --> 00:58:52.360
"Breathes there a man, with soul
so dead, who never to himself

00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:54.980
hath said, this is mine
own, my native land?"

00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:57.550
Well, it's the same thing
with active investing.

00:58:57.550 --> 00:59:00.230
We all believe we can do better.

00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:02.240
We all know from all
the other experiences

00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:05.550
that we have in our lives
that you can do better.

00:59:05.550 --> 00:59:07.980
It just happens in
this particular one,

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:10.400
if you're trying to
do better, you're

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:13.030
up against an invisible
competition that

00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:16.970
is so damn good that it doesn't
make sense to be doing it.

00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:18.770
And I'm back to George
Plimpton going out

00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:20.770
and playing in the NFL.

00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:24.240
Nice guy, reasonably
strong, reasonably healthy,

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:27.390
was six foot tall, but you
could get killed out there

00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:30.540
in the line playing against
a guy who weighs 300 pounds

00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:33.250
and does the 10-yard dash.

00:59:33.250 --> 00:59:34.220
Who wants to do that?

00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:35.427
Same problem.

00:59:35.427 --> 00:59:37.260
ADAM NASH: We have a
bunch of questions in--

00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:37.910
CHARLEY ELLIS:
Wonderful question.

00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:39.284
ADAM NASH: It's
a great question.

00:59:39.284 --> 00:59:41.650
We have a bunch of questions
in from remote viewers.

00:59:41.650 --> 00:59:43.550
So you can see them
ranked by popularity,

00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:46.080
so I'll just read
a couple of these.

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:48.280
The first one is
actually a great one.

00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:50.700
It says, "Bonds are scary
because interest rates are

00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:53.340
low," and "Stocks are scary
because the economy has

00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:56.600
high unemployment and
profits are an all-time high

00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:59.240
due to a lot of cost cutting."

00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.864
Peter asks what should
he do with his cash.

01:00:02.864 --> 01:00:04.780
BURTON MALKIEL: Well, I
think bonds are scary,

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:10.560
because I think when you look
at our dysfunctional government,

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:17.810
and when you look at how hard it
is for us to rein in our budget

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:22.450
deficit and do something about
our long-run budget deficit,

01:00:22.450 --> 01:00:30.860
you realize that we've got a
very high debt-to-GDP ratio,

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.480
and the government's got
to do something about it.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:36.960
Well, what the
government is doing

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:41.550
is something that goes under
the name financial repression.

01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:45.280
We are keeping interest
rates very, very low.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:47.750
The last time the
10-year treasury

01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:52.640
yielded about 2 and 1/2%, which
it yields now-- it's actually

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:57.190
up to 2.7% right now, but
it's somewhere around that--

01:00:57.190 --> 01:01:00.160
was in 1946.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:06.370
In 1946, we have a
debt-to-GDP ratio of 133%,

01:01:06.370 --> 01:01:08.670
much higher than it is now.

01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:11.370
And we were trying to
finance that deficit,

01:01:11.370 --> 01:01:17.450
and keeping interest
rates very, very low.

01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:22.030
Well, we actually had interest
rates pegged into the 1950s,

01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:27.500
and then we let them rise very,
very gradually until 1980.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:34.240
And what happened in 1980,
we had a moderate inflation.

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:37.020
It was a little
bigger, and there

01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:40.110
was an oil and food
shock in the '70s.

01:01:40.110 --> 01:01:43.100
But in general, it was
a moderate inflation.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:48.790
And the debt-to-GDP ratio of the
United States in 1980 was 30%.

01:01:48.790 --> 01:01:52.750
So what this financial
repression does

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:56.920
is it's a way of getting
rid of your debt,

01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:00.350
of letting inflation
inflate it away,

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:03.470
and you do it on the
backs of the bondholders.

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:06.910
And I am very
worried about that.

01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:12.900
And we at Wealthfront
have, I think,

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:17.160
some very interesting strategies
in our asset allocation.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:22.640
For one thing, we use for part
of what might be the safer bond

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.850
portfolio-- which is
still needed for people,

01:02:25.850 --> 01:02:30.400
particularly those who
worry about volatility--

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:34.290
is we use an equity
substitution strategy.

01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:38.550
And by that, I mean we
try to use very safe,

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:43.920
high-dividend growth stocks
to substitute for the bond

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:44.630
portfolio.

01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:49.500
Just to give you an
example, AT&amp;T's stock

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.840
yields something over 5%.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:56.320
And the dividend on AT&amp;T has
been growing at 5% a year.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:59.710
My guess is, it won't throw it
quite that rate in the future,

01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:01.570
but it's likely to grow.

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:05.070
AT&amp;T 10-year bond's yield 4%.

01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:07.210
Now, I can't believe
that you won't

01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:12.750
be better off as an
investor with AT&amp;T stock.

01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:15.100
I think you'll get a
higher rate of return.

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:19.250
And there was a time when
bond prices and yields were

01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:22.220
adjusting in the
1970s when bonds

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:24.240
were more volatile than stocks.

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:25.680
So that's some part of it.

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:29.410
Another part of it is to look
at some foreign countries

01:03:29.410 --> 01:03:33.390
with budget deficits
under control,

01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:37.930
and with debt-to-GDP ratios
low, that have higher yields.

01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:42.970
So we're very conscious of that,
and have adjusted the asset

01:03:42.970 --> 01:03:48.050
allocation to take
advantage with of that.

01:03:48.050 --> 01:03:49.770
Stocks are scary.

01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:51.130
They're always scary.

01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:54.410
Profits are at an all-time high.

01:03:54.410 --> 01:04:00.550
On the other hand, because
we have high unemployment

01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:04.810
I don't think is a reason
to be negative on stocks.

01:04:04.810 --> 01:04:07.670
It means we've got a
lot of excess capacity,

01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:10.130
and we could in fact
grow as a nation

01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:11.970
at a much faster
rate in the future.

01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:14.380
In fact, my own
economic forecast

01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:16.680
is, we've been
growing at 2% a year.

01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:21.170
I think we're very likely to
see in 2014 a growth rate that's

01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:22.200
over 3%.

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:26.060
So I think that's actually
an argument for stocks,

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:32.160
because I think you're going to
see more growth in the future

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:35.490
than you have in the past.

01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:41.210
And in general, our portfolio's
particularly for young people,

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:46.100
are very much
equity-oriented, and we've

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:49.870
been very careful about the
bonds with some of the ideas

01:04:49.870 --> 01:04:51.452
that I gave you earlier.

01:04:51.452 --> 01:04:52.910
CHARLEY ELLIS: Can
I add onto that?

01:04:52.910 --> 01:04:54.730
Because it's really
worth thinking about.

01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:00.780
Being young is the best
competitive advantage

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:03.680
you could possibly
have as an investor,

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:06.252
because you've got time.

01:05:06.252 --> 01:05:07.710
The big problem is
you haven't been

01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:09.126
around long enough
to realize what

01:05:09.126 --> 01:05:11.582
a terrific thing
it is to be young.

01:05:11.582 --> 01:05:13.290
BURTON MALKIEL: It's
wasted on the young?

01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:14.815
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:14.815 --> 01:05:16.440
CHARLEY ELLIS: You
can read Burt's book

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.410
and that'll catch you up,
but that's a huge advantage

01:05:19.410 --> 01:05:21.940
to have time on your side.

01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:24.600
And most of the
people here are going

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:28.400
to be investing, and buying
securities, and buying houses,

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:31.590
and buying art, and
investing and accumulating

01:05:31.590 --> 01:05:35.200
for the next 30, 40 years.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.270
Most of you will work until 75.

01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:40.770
You'll enjoy the work so
much you won't want to stop.

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:43.100
Then we'll move
retirement ages out.

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:47.220
So 75 is a reasonable bet.

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:51.930
Most of you are under 40,
so you've got a long shot.

01:05:51.930 --> 01:05:54.110
Even when you
retire, you're going

01:05:54.110 --> 01:05:57.650
to live for another 20
or 25 years after that.

01:05:57.650 --> 01:06:00.090
So your average length
of time between now

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:03.030
and when you sell them to
pay for your way of living,

01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:04.310
it's not 35 years.

01:06:04.310 --> 01:06:07.870
It's 45 years.

01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:12.540
Nobody who's got 45 years would
say, ooh, let's buy bonds,

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:15.940
unless they're anxious about
ups and downs in the market.

01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:18.450
If you just keep your
vision on the long distance

01:06:18.450 --> 01:06:21.150
and don't worry about the
ups and downs in the market,

01:06:21.150 --> 01:06:22.930
that's a calm under pressure.

01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:24.990
It's a tremendous advantage.

01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:28.140
Let me try one more
dimension of this.

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:30.889
Everybody in this
room has got a job.

01:06:30.889 --> 01:06:32.930
Everybody in all the other
rooms that are tied in

01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:35.670
has got a job, with
a damn good company.

01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:39.800
Interesting place to work,
probably all are super smart,

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.240
and know that they could
easily walk across the street

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.440
and get a terrific job at
another really interesting

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.150
company any time they wanted to.

01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:49.230
So security with
regard to earned income

01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:51.250
is very, very high.

01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:53.930
The only thing you don't
know is how rapidly you

01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:55.710
will rise in net earned income.

01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:57.400
You know in five
years from now, it's

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.662
not going to be
less than it is now,

01:06:59.662 --> 01:07:01.370
unless you happen to
shoot the lights out

01:07:01.370 --> 01:07:04.460
with some spectacular bonus,
so once in a lifetime.

01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:05.560
Leave that aside.

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:10.670
Salary, and regular bonuses,
whatever, compensation,

01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:13.660
is going to go clunkity
clunkity clunkity clunk.

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:19.060
That's essentially an income
that is fixed-- on a slope,

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:20.800
but it's fixed.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:24.180
Think of that as being
a bond equivalent.

01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:26.120
5%'s a reasonable interest rate.

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:29.002
OK, multiply your salary by 20.

01:07:29.002 --> 01:07:31.210
That's how much you've got
in fixed income right now.

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:37.170
That is such a big fraction
of your total wealth compared

01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:39.630
to what you've got in
securities investment.

01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:41.880
Look at the whole picture.

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:46.240
I believe you will say, I want
to reconsider how much I have

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.340
in stocks versus bonds,
because now that I realize

01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:54.290
I've got a fixed
income that is huge,

01:07:54.290 --> 01:07:57.280
I'm way behind on what I
ought to do in the stock area.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:01.280
I think most people who
are in their 30s and 40s

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:04.740
should be thinking seriously
how much emotional stability

01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:07.960
they've got up to that level
that they can live with.

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:09.790
They should be piling
everything they've

01:08:09.790 --> 01:08:13.910
got into equity type investing,
rather than into fixed income

01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:17.140
investing, because their
biggest thing they've got,

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:20.380
their biggest value, is
their intellectual property,

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:23.590
the ability come into an outfit
like Google and say, I'm here,

01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:25.170
and I'm willing
to work with you.

01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:28.550
What a fabulous sentence that
is to be able to say out loud.

01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:32.939
Recognize the reality.

01:08:32.939 --> 01:08:37.510
Your intellectual property
value is very large

01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:39.870
ADAM NASH: People in general
underestimate the value

01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:41.640
of that human capital asset.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.990
A lot of people in the
room, technology industry,

01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:46.870
we spend so much time keeping
our skills up to date.

01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:48.060
We learn the new languages.

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:49.500
We learn the new platforms.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:52.740
We learn new solutions
to old problems.

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:54.950
But that doesn't
always factor in to how

01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:56.259
people think about money.

01:08:56.259 --> 01:08:57.800
I want to be careful,
because we have

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.460
a couple more
questions, on time.

01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:01.370
There's one that I see
highlighted in blue.

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:03.979
I'm assuming that means
I'm supposed to read it.

01:09:03.979 --> 01:09:05.979
I assume blue is good.

01:09:05.979 --> 01:09:08.490
We talked about this
briefly, but for folks

01:09:08.490 --> 01:09:10.740
in the audience who
may have a lump sum

01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:13.330
or have been out of the
market in some way, what

01:09:13.330 --> 01:09:16.010
are your opinions about lump
sum investing versus dollar cost

01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:16.510
averaging?

01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:18.176
CHARLEY ELLIS: I think
it's a great idea

01:09:18.176 --> 01:09:20.720
to put everything you've
got on the number that's

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:23.390
going to work out
really, really well.

01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:26.470
When you're gambling, that's
exactly what you should do.

01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:29.020
And in investing, if you
just have the ability

01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:32.344
to time the market, you
should definitely do it.

01:09:32.344 --> 01:09:34.760
If, on the other hand, you're
like all those boring people

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:38.910
that Burt and I know, real
human beings who could easily be

01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:44.060
misled and would rather
settle for normal,

01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:48.640
break it up into parts and
spread it out over some time.

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.810
Don't try to be too
cute and clever.

01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:53.660
All you do is hurt yourself.

01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:56.890
If, for God's sake, you're
right, you'll then think,

01:09:56.890 --> 01:10:00.240
hey, you know, Burt,
I'm really good at this.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:01.420
I think I'll do it again.

01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:02.960
And you get at that time.

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:05.492
Worse than that, you're
right the second time.

01:10:05.492 --> 01:10:07.950
Now, you're really in trouble,
because you'll honest-to-god

01:10:07.950 --> 01:10:10.030
believe you can do it.

01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:10.925
It will get you.

01:10:10.925 --> 01:10:12.430
ADAM NASH: You don't get
good at coin flipping?

01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:13.263
That doesn't happen?

01:10:13.263 --> 01:10:15.660
No?

01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:17.080
Burt, do you have
anything to add?

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:17.871
BURTON MALKIEL: No.

01:10:17.871 --> 01:10:19.850
I think that says it very well.

01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:22.610
And as I suggested
to you, there's

01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:27.300
a little example that I
give of a market that's

01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:31.020
very volatile over five periods
and ends up exactly where

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:34.230
it is, but goes down
first, and another market

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:38.280
that goes up consistently.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:43.130
And you're actually
better off with the market

01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:48.640
that was very volatile, and
can make even more money.

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:49.954
And it's much less risky.

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:50.620
ADAM NASH: Yeah.

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:52.411
The great thing about
dollar cost averaging

01:10:52.411 --> 01:10:55.889
is that you get in the
habit of putting money in,

01:10:55.889 --> 01:10:58.430
that first time that you realize
that the volatility actually

01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:02.180
works for you, that you ended
up putting in money last month

01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:05.265
and now the market-- you
realize it's actually

01:11:05.265 --> 01:11:06.470
a very boring process.

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:09.050
You put in money continuously.

01:11:09.050 --> 01:11:11.150
Let the markets do their thing.

01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:13.720
I think there's one
more question here.

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:17.050
AUDIENCE: I'd like to get
your thoughts on how indices

01:11:17.050 --> 01:11:20.710
are composed, whether or not
they be market cap based,

01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:24.540
fundamentally based, equal
weighting, anything like that.

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:27.310
Just, what do you
think of those?

01:11:27.310 --> 01:11:30.310
BURTON MALKIEL: In
general, I believe

01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:35.332
in market capitalization
weighting.

01:11:35.332 --> 01:11:37.790
And this actually gets to one
of the other questions that's

01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:40.010
on the screen that
you didn't rated.

01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:43.610
When you think of it, let's
say you disagreed with me

01:11:43.610 --> 01:11:47.060
and you thought that markets
were really quite inefficient.

01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:51.150
You still ought to be an
indexer, because investing

01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:54.504
has got to be a zero sum game.

01:11:54.504 --> 01:11:56.670
CHARLEY ELLIS: Minus the
course of playing the game.

01:11:56.670 --> 01:11:59.290
BURTON MALKIEL: Well, yeah.

01:11:59.290 --> 01:12:01.234
If somebody has got
all the stocks that

01:12:01.234 --> 01:12:02.900
went up more than
average, somebody else

01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:04.890
has got to be holding
the ones that went down.

01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:07.360
But in fact, it's a
negative sum game,

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:11.020
because of the costs involved.

01:12:11.020 --> 01:12:13.260
So the first thing
to remember is,

01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:17.560
once you stray from all the
stocks in the market which

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:19.920
are weighted by their
market capitalization-- that

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:24.290
is what the market is--
you are making a bet.

01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:27.330
And maybe would
be right, but then

01:12:27.330 --> 01:12:30.240
somebody else has
got to be wrong.

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:33.150
Now, what all of
the other things

01:12:33.150 --> 01:12:36.450
do-- whether it's equal
weighting, whether it's

01:12:36.450 --> 01:12:44.050
fundamental indexing, whether
it's value investing-- is

01:12:44.050 --> 01:12:49.400
you put certain tilts
into your portfolio.

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:52.280
Fundamental indexing
has been very popular.

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:55.580
There, you weight by
the company's earnings,

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:58.340
or its sales, or its book value.

01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:02.230
And what that does is it puts
two tilts into your portfolio,

01:13:02.230 --> 01:13:07.100
it makes your portfolio slightly
more small cap than large cap,

01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:09.820
and it makes your
portfolio slightly more

01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:16.500
quote "value," if we define
value as having lower price

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:19.470
earnings and lower
price-to-book value.

01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:25.230
There have been lots of periods
where those tilts have worked.

01:13:25.230 --> 01:13:29.950
And there's a big
dispute in the academy.

01:13:29.950 --> 01:13:32.660
Is it because markets
are inefficient,

01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:36.160
or is it because of risk?

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:39.370
I think the people who
favor these sorts of things

01:13:39.370 --> 01:13:42.730
better think it's risk, because
if it's in an efficiency,

01:13:42.730 --> 01:13:45.920
somebody's going to arbitrage
it away in the future.

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:48.110
But let's say you
believe in that

01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:50.770
and that that's what you want.

01:13:50.770 --> 01:13:51.630
I don't.

01:13:51.630 --> 01:13:56.870
I want to be a capital market
capitalization indexer.

01:13:56.870 --> 01:14:00.050
But let's say you think
that-- this is something

01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:02.050
that has worked in
certain past periods.

01:14:02.050 --> 01:14:03.490
There's no question about it.

01:14:03.490 --> 01:14:06.200
And you think it's going
to work in the future.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:11.780
If you want that, don't
buy the fundamental index.

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:18.230
Buy a Vanguard value index
at a very, very low fee.

01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:22.170
Realize what tilts are in
those kinds of portfolios.

01:14:22.170 --> 01:14:25.100
Or buy small cap,
which is-- in fact,

01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:28.952
we've got some
weighting of small cap

01:14:28.952 --> 01:14:31.390
in our overall portfolios.

01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:33.580
And by it at a low fee.

01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:37.870
Don't buy these things that are
advertised, like fundamentally

01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:40.440
index-weighted portfolios,
because they've

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:42.130
got a much higher fee.

01:14:42.130 --> 01:14:45.270
And it's a great for the
purveyor of the investment

01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:47.930
product, and not
so good for you.

01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:51.830
And look, I think all of us
who talk about the stock market

01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:55.850
need to be very modest
about what we know and don't

01:14:55.850 --> 01:14:58.130
know about the stock market.

01:14:58.130 --> 01:15:01.950
But the only thing I'll tell
you that I am 100% sure of,

01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:04.440
and that is at the
lower the fee I pay

01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:06.710
to the purveyor of the
investment product,

01:15:06.710 --> 01:15:10.110
the more there's
going to be for me.

01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:12.910
ADAM NASH: I see we have a
couple more questions up here.

01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:14.530
I think the next
leading question

01:15:14.530 --> 01:15:17.220
is-- I think it's for you, Burt.

01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:18.360
You're affiliated with--

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.985
BURTON MALKIEL: No,
Charlie is as well.

01:15:19.985 --> 01:15:23.182
Charlie can take that, about
Rebalance IRA and Wealthfront.

01:15:23.182 --> 01:15:25.265
ADAM NASH: Yeah, we have
two firms-- Rebalance IRA

01:15:25.265 --> 01:15:25.931
and Wealthfront.

01:15:25.931 --> 01:15:28.910
BURTON MALKIEL: Yeah, both of us
are on that advisory board too.

01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:32.427
ADAM NASH: Both, if you want
to compare or talk about it.

01:15:32.427 --> 01:15:34.260
CHARLEY ELLIS: I'll
just say, in both cases,

01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:39.920
there's an effort to bring
cost structures that are high,

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:42.720
to go past them with a
different cost structure that

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:49.280
is low, and trying to
deliver access to value.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:50.710
That's why we're at Vanguard.

01:15:50.710 --> 01:15:51.876
That's why we're doing this.

01:15:51.876 --> 01:15:55.080
It's very much the same thing.

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.740
You could get really upset
if you spend very much time

01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:02.740
realizing how much wealth has
been created for investment

01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:05.930
managers by the
game that's played,

01:16:05.930 --> 01:16:10.020
and try to find the wealth that
was created for the clients,

01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:11.650
or the customers.

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:15.720
And on average, it
isn't a wealth-creating.

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:18.230
It's a wealth-diminishing
activity.

01:16:18.230 --> 01:16:19.822
And if you get
irritated about that,

01:16:19.822 --> 01:16:21.280
you start looking
for opportunities

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.510
to do something about it.

01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:23.801
And that's, I think, the main--

01:16:23.801 --> 01:16:26.150
BURTON MALKIEL: The
finance industry

01:16:26.150 --> 01:16:31.920
has grown in its share
of US GDP from 4% to 8%.

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:37.550
And some of it is devising all
of these derivative products

01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:40.280
and so forth that practically
blew up the world.

01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:43.480
But a third of it
is this increase

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:46.580
in financial advice,
mutual fund fees.

01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:53.920
And that, Charlie and
I think, actually,

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:59.280
is an increase in fees,
that, as I often say,

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:02.260
I can't think of
any service that

01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:08.390
is priced at so high a level
relative to its value, which

01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:10.610
I think is very, very low.

01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:12.330
There was a famous
book that was written

01:17:12.330 --> 01:17:15.770
in the Depression of a
person visiting New York.

01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:20.090
And at that time, in
downtown New York,

01:17:20.090 --> 01:17:23.580
there were a lot of yachts
on the Hudson River.

01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:29.670
And this visitor came
down to visit Wall Street,

01:17:29.670 --> 01:17:32.660
and looked at these
and asked the guide,

01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:35.160
"Whose yachts are those?"

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:40.280
And the guide said, "Oh, those
are the yachts of the Wall

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.220
Street investment advisers."

01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:45.490
And the fellow
asked, "Well, where

01:17:45.490 --> 01:17:47.760
are the customers' yachts?"

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:49.950
And I think that's the
question that I would raise,

01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:52.250
is where are the
customers' yachts?

01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:54.030
ADAM NASH: Well,
it's funny, I think

01:17:54.030 --> 01:17:55.500
the macro trends you got right.

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:58.850
It's the biggest sea
change that's happening,

01:17:58.850 --> 01:18:02.636
and it's been happening for
decades, is people recognition

01:18:02.636 --> 01:18:04.260
that they don't have
to pay those fees,

01:18:04.260 --> 01:18:06.810
that index investing
is the right approach,

01:18:06.810 --> 01:18:08.850
that a low-cost
diversified portfolio is

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:10.840
the right approach.

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:14.020
If I were to just
add-- Rebalance IRA,

01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:16.530
Wealthfront both
have that idea--

01:18:16.530 --> 01:18:18.605
the average financial
firm right now

01:18:18.605 --> 01:18:20.230
is spending all of
their effort looking

01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:22.306
after baby boomers
in retirement,

01:18:22.306 --> 01:18:23.680
because there's
this amazing wave

01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:26.530
of people focused
on that problem.

01:18:26.530 --> 01:18:28.560
Wealthfront, we focused
on a different audience,

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:32.870
which is really young
people, tech savvy, who

01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:34.770
have slightly
different concerns.

01:18:34.770 --> 01:18:37.842
They're more focused on
things like taxable accounts,

01:18:37.842 --> 01:18:39.800
because they're still
accruing a lot of wealth.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:43.490
So we've invested in
features like tax location.

01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:45.920
What portfolio you should
have in a taxable account

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:49.020
is different than a portfolio
for a retirement account.

01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:51.900
We've invested in tax loss
harvesting, which is really

01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:54.360
something that only makes
sense outside of an IRA.

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.590
It doesn't make
sense inside an IRA.

01:18:56.590 --> 01:18:58.710
But I think the basic
spirit is the same, which

01:18:58.710 --> 01:19:01.600
is, the truth is, more
investors would be better off

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:06.150
taking advantage of low-cost
diversified portfolios.

01:19:06.150 --> 01:19:07.710
Be smart about taxes.

01:19:07.710 --> 01:19:09.980
I mean, I'm borrowing
your statements, Burt.

01:19:09.980 --> 01:19:11.440
I've been trained.

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:14.230
These are the things
you can control.

01:19:14.230 --> 01:19:16.340
You can't control the market.

01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:18.390
CHARLEY ELLIS: Let me
just emphasize once again.

01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:19.973
I started off at the
beginning saying,

01:19:19.973 --> 01:19:22.360
we've got to pay more
attention to each one of us

01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:24.140
as an individual.

01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:28.180
My fingerprint can send me to
prison, because it's unique.

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:31.900
My iris is so unique
that I can go in and out

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:35.900
of highly sophisticated
encrypted facilities,

01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:39.030
and they know exactly who I
am because they took a camera

01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:41.680
photo earlier.

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:44.890
In investing, we're all unique.

01:19:44.890 --> 01:19:47.130
We may look a lot the
same, but we're not.

01:19:47.130 --> 01:19:48.287
We're different in age.

01:19:48.287 --> 01:19:49.370
We're different in wealth.

01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:50.500
We're different in income.

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:51.660
We're different in anxiety.

01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:53.100
We're different in experience.

01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:55.000
We're different in how much
time we've got to spend on.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.260
We're different in how much
we're really interested.

01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:58.810
And we're really
different in terms

01:19:58.810 --> 01:20:01.800
of whom we're responsible
for, how many kids we have,

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:03.700
how many grand kids,
all that sort of thing.

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:06.360
When you get it all figured
out, we really are unique.

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:09.870
And price discovery
has been worked out.

01:20:09.870 --> 01:20:13.430
But value discovery, what's
right for you personally,

01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:17.120
has not been really worked out,
and that's really important.

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:20.460
And any time that we
spend on value discovery,

01:20:20.460 --> 01:20:23.300
instead of wasting it on trying
to do price discovery better

01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:26.800
than the experts who are
there full time all the time,

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:29.900
it just makes so much sense
to concentrate on the value.

01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:30.890
Who are you?

01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:32.430
What are you trying
to accomplish?

01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:34.436
Knowing with confidence
that you don't

01:20:34.436 --> 01:20:38.380
have to do all the hard work of
figuring out the right prices.

01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:39.925
It's done for you.

01:20:39.925 --> 01:20:43.010
So please, concentrate on that.

01:20:43.010 --> 01:20:45.340
After that, candidly, you've
got much better things

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:47.740
to do with your time and
energy and your talent

01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:51.540
than to try to compete
against the very, very,

01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:53.900
very best at price discovery.

01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:57.070
They're doing it all the
time because they have to.

01:20:57.070 --> 01:20:58.820
Therefore, you don't
have to do any of it.

01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:01.660
And you can get the full benefit
of the very best work done

01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:04.360
by the very best people working
all the time with the best

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:07.780
equipment, the best information,
and I mean all the time,

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:10.660
working on your behalf to be
sure the prices are always

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:12.030
right.

01:21:12.030 --> 01:21:14.149
ADAM NASH: Well
on that note, I'm

01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:16.190
seeing a signal here of
the questions going away,

01:21:16.190 --> 01:21:17.874
meaning that we're out of time.

01:21:17.874 --> 01:21:19.540
But thank you, everyone,
for coming out.

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:20.831
And thank you for those online.

01:21:20.831 --> 01:21:22.090
We were happy to be here.

01:21:22.090 --> 01:21:28.589
[APPLAUSE]
