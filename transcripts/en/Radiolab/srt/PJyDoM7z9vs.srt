1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,420
Come on. Totally. You guys can say we
want to talk to you about three. Okay.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,600
Okay, let's do it. Let's do
that. Let's do that then.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,630
Like keep what we can't do. Hey,
this is radiolab I'm Jad Abumrad.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,720
We're going to do something that's
a little bit unorthodox today,

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,890
at least for us. Um, you know,

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,970
if you've listened to the show
in the last 10 years or so,

7
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:19,170
however long we've been doing this, uh,

8
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:22,530
you understand that like we
like to edit, right? We like,

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,840
we like a good edit or 70,

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,250
but today I want to play you something
that has almost no edits at all.

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,750
It's just a conversation which has of
course the foundation of what we do these

12
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:38,751
long rambling about the occasionally
profane error strewn conversations that we

13
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:42,810
then edit into something
coherent. But today,

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,990
today I want to show you
the messiness, no edits.

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,670
This is a chunk of a conversation
with science writer at Carl Zimmer.

16
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,080
He came and sat down with us a while
back and we talked for four hours.

17
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:59,670
Two of those hours became the
basis for the CRISPR podcast.

18
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,890
That was a few podcasts ago.
This was about gene editing,

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,240
but then we kept on going for another
two hours and he told us this story.

20
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,051
Actually two stories,

21
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:10,200
but we're only gonna play one
that I thought was really cool.

22
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,240
And it's about this new way of looking
at life. This is a, is this a long story,

23
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,060
a medium story or short
story? It's not a, yeah,

24
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,580
we can get through this a lot
faster than CRISPR. Okay. Okay.

25
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,050
I really like CRISPR, by the way.
Who Do I, I mean, CRISPR is, yeah,

26
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,560
it's the bomb. Hmm. Yeah.

27
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,910
That's a perfect way to describe it. Yeah.

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,540
By logical bomb. Okay. So, uh, uh,
chapter two can, maybe you can start

29
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,240
the story once, if the
once upon a time. Sure.

30
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:46,280
So once upon a time being, um,

31
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,790
I'd say once, once upon
a time being before 2003,

32
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:59,060
we basically had two kinds
of living things on earth.

33
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,240
We had sell your their life and we had
viruses and there was nice and distinct

34
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,230
and clear cut.

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,520
And so cells included us.

36
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,480
Our bodies made her cells and
bacteria, which are single celled.

37
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,510
And all the other things that can
grow and let their cells divide.

38
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,940
They have DNA, they have proteins
in them. They all got that stuff.

39
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,860
And then over here you had viruses and
viruses were just little packages of

40
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:32,861
genetic material that would go from cell
to cell and use the cell to make new

41
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:35,360
viruses. And so inside of them,

42
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:40,220
all they had were jeans and a couple of
proteins that would then just sort of

43
00:02:40,221 --> 00:02:45,140
hijack their host. They seem
like soap, soap, preliminary.

44
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,620
They don't even, maybe not
even qualify as life. Right?

45
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,330
They can't grow on their own. Um, they
can't generate their own energy. So,

46
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,080
you know, us and all other
Shangler life, we, um,

47
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:01,410
we make a kind of a fuel called ATP and
we need that to do every little thing in

48
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,660
our body. And viruses don't
make ATP. So, you know,

49
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:08,620
they're in shock when we say that life
is us cells and multicellular beings.

50
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,190
And then there's a sort of pseudo life,

51
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,820
which is these little things that live
off of us. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people,

52
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,700
a lot of scientists don't really
think viruses are truly alive.

53
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,180
Even though they just sort of take
advantage of life to make more copies of

54
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,610
themselves. Okay. Can I say
dumb questions? So viruses,

55
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:27,910
they don't have a wall around them.
And the way that that cell cells,

56
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,510
our walls essentially
are walled off areas. Um,

57
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,520
they might have a protein
shell. [inaudible] and, and so,

58
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:38,680
you know, when the flu
virus goes into a cell,

59
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,710
that protein shell kind of breaks open
and the genes and proteins inside come

60
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:47,590
out. They do have containers that
contain them for, for a while. I see.

61
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,940
Well isn't that one of
the, somebody who had a,

62
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,520
had a list of rules that make you alive
and what wasn't a container was one of

63
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:58,290
those rules. Yeah. But yeah, I mean
that, that don't do that energy.

64
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,710
But they have the
container at least. Right.

65
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:03,790
So the problem with viruses is that they
have some of the things that we think

66
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:06,520
are essential for life,
but not quite all of them.

67
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,540
So it's been convenient just
to say viruses are not alive.

68
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,140
Put them over there cause they don't
have everything that sells really.

69
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:18,940
Life has. So we'll just say they're not
alive to just viruses. Gotcha. And then,

70
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,820
so then what happened is that there
was a scientist named Timothy Robotham,

71
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:25,570
uh,

72
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,570
in England who was investigating a
Timothy Robotham Timothy go about them.

73
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,350
Yes. The English name in road Buffum
with the fuck the robot was a,

74
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:39,460
it was working in Bradford
City in England. And, um,

75
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,990
he was, uh,

76
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,680
looking at the kinds of bacteria
that might be growing in a hospital.

77
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:49,840
You know,

78
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,110
like there they were having some problems
with pneumonia outbreaks and so on.

79
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:57,490
And he was like, okay, well what's growing
around here? Uh, and so he went to a,

80
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,840
uh, sort of a cooling tower for
water on top of the hospital,

81
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:06,130
and he took a sample and he went and put
it under his microscope. And he's like,

82
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,930
hmm, some interesting bacteria here. Oh,

83
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:12,340
here's a very interesting bacteria that
doesn't really look like anything I've

84
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:13,174
seen before.

85
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,940
This guy would just kind of crawl
around to weird places and just snatched

86
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,240
little snippets of scum or what
would he, yeah, I mean, was he,

87
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:26,360
what was his job? He's a microbiologist.
Oh, of course. So you know,

88
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,580
that it would be good to know,
like, I mean some microbiologists,

89
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:34,420
do they just go scrape little bits
of rock or, or they search the world.

90
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,040
Yeah. I mean microbes are everywhere.

91
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,220
So microbiologists go everywhere to find
microbes. So they're even, you know,

92
00:05:39,221 --> 00:05:42,240
in a water tower on a hospital.
Does he do it? Was he in a,

93
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,700
in a kind of an investigatory
role? He was trying to help them,

94
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,170
help them figure out which bacteria
are making people sick. Um,

95
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:52,480
that was one of the hopes, but you know,

96
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:54,970
he was thinking of doing
a survey because you know,

97
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:00,020
they're diseases like
legionnaires disease, which
can, you know, grow in these,

98
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:03,060
these sort of containers of
water, you know, that's, there,

99
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,240
there is some concern
about that. So you know,

100
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:08,510
better to get to know what's growing. Um,

101
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,920
so he's particularly taken by one um,

102
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,690
thing that he assumes is bacteria and
it's got a kind of interesting kind of

103
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,120
roundish shape. Um,

104
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:23,990
and he calls and when bacteria around
you can call him Cockeye or caucus.

105
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,100
Um, so he names this Bradford
caucus cause it a name.

106
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,240
That's why the caucus name that comes
to me was referring to the shape like

107
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,950
strep streptococcus is,
because it's, it's around my,

108
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,160
I did not know that the things you
learn from talking to Carl Zimmer.

109
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,740
My God. Okay. So, so, um,

110
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,640
so he's, he's trying to study this
thing and he's trying to, so one,

111
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:50,510
when you're a microbiologist,

112
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:53,840
the way you study bacteria is you get
them to grow and he can't get this to

113
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:57,800
grow. He's feeding at things and it's
like smart growing. Why is it not growing?

114
00:06:57,801 --> 00:07:02,780
I can't figure it out. And
eventually, um, you know, he,

115
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:07,400
he just hits, hits a, it hits
a wall and unfortunately, um,

116
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,870
uh, his lab, uh, got shut down. Um,

117
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,560
and so he basically said,
okay, I don't want to, uh,

118
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,410
throw this stuff out so I'm gonna,

119
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,860
I'm going to give it to some of
my colleagues in France. It was,

120
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:25,850
it wasn't dying, which wasn't growing.
Yeah. So he gave it to a scientist named

121
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,400
Bernard Lascola and his colleagues
and they kind of put them

122
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,180
and we, and, and he just says, I'm,

123
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,700
he just sets it aside for a
while and doesn't, you know,

124
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,950
it's just more bacteria, you know? And,

125
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,420
and for some reason he
decided to, you know,

126
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,130
take a look at this Bradford
Caucus. You know, I'm like, what?

127
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,270
What was this thing that that
robot them was talking about?

128
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,510
So he looks at it and he
says, okay, it's this,

129
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,770
this is the size of bacteria,

130
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,190
but it looks like a gigantic virus.

131
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,100
You know it. So what is a giant virus
was usually very small. Exactly.

132
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,690
So bacteria to a virus is like,
like hundreds of times bigger,

133
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,290
hundreds of times. Okay.
So queen married too small.

134
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,980
So he looked up close and he
was like, what is this thing?

135
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,150
This doesn't look right. This, this.
If I didn't know better, I'd say this,

136
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:28,040
this was a virus. And he's saying this
based on its internal orientation.

137
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,540
It's appearance. It's because it
had the protein thingy and stuff.

138
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,860
So a lot of viruses,

139
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:38,540
they have a shell made a protein and
the shell is kind of composed of plates.

140
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,140
So it's kind kinda looks
like a soccer ball. Uh hmm.

141
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,560
So it's a very distinctive look.
Okay. And it looked like that.

142
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,760
It looked like that. It didn't look like
bacteria. Oh, interesting. I was like,

143
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,580
wait a minute, could this be a virus?

144
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,390
So this would be like maybe like
finding an soccer ball in the woods.

145
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,310
Yes. Two he'd found the, the Leviathan
equivalent of a virus. Right.

146
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,780
It didn't make sense. It was,

147
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,590
it was kind of crazy in that
microscopic realm to say,

148
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,820
maybe this is a virus. Wait, so didn't.
So Brad Mumford, what's his name again?

149
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,460
Timothy Robotham. Robotham didn't
have this realization. Nope.

150
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,160
He hadn't looked at it closely
enough. He looked at it,

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,500
but he just didn't somehow put the,

152
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,600
put the this as a virus and click
to the bacteria. No Wednesdays,

153
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,050
that's a virus day and this
was Tuesday. And, and it's,

154
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:35,160
it's likely that other people were looking
at the same things in years before.

155
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,430
I'm thinking there were bacteria in
there and they're saying, here's a big,

156
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,420
here's something the size of
bacteria. Well, in fairness,

157
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:45,020
because viruses are always small than the,

158
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,000
that you wouldn't think a big
thing would be fire. Well,

159
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:53,001
viruses are always small in the sense
that they were discovered because they

160
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:55,980
were small. So basically signed.

161
00:09:55,981 --> 00:10:00,810
What scientists did was they discovered
viruses by filtering fluid from a sick

162
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:04,830
plant or a sick animal through
a filter. Porcelain actually,

163
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:08,730
and it was so small that that anything
besides that bacteria got trapped in the

164
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:11,250
porcelain and anything smaller came out.

165
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,930
Oh and low and behold they could find
things that could cause sickness in that

166
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:17,730
fluid that pass through the filter.

167
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,900
Most of the discovery of viruses meant
it was innately small because that's how

168
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:24,840
you filtered for them. That's what they
were looking for. This is interesting.

169
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,260
So there were probably generations of
scientists who were looking in through

170
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:29,094
microscopes,

171
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,390
saw some interesting round
thing and assumed it was
bacteria and it was probably

172
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:37,980
a virus. What the fuck is this
giant, giant Leviathan virus?

173
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,610
I assume that was his
question. Well, I mean,

174
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,310
he first he had to to really
establish that it was,

175
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,680
and so what happened was that, um, he,

176
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,550
he looked very closely at it and
kind of worked at it's chemistry.

177
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,590
And the more he looked at it, the more
it looked like a virus. He started,

178
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,000
he started actually looking at it to
DNA, which hadn't been possible before.

179
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,840
It turned out that its DNA resembled the
DNA of viruses and not have any known

180
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:10,830
bacteria. Um, it didn't have, it didn't,

181
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,970
it actually didn't have the, the, the
equipment for making fuel inside of it.

182
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,830
Uh, and then the real kicker was
that he found out how to grow it.

183
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,100
What he had to do was he had to stick
this thing inside of Amoeba and then out

184
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:30,690
of the Amoeba would come
more Bradford Caucus,

185
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,870
just like a virus. Exactly like a virus.

186
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:37,080
So he needed to change the name from
Bradford Caucus to something else. Right.

187
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,280
So, so they named it Mimi
virus, Mimi virus virus,

188
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,910
because they were in France and me
music in the, in a French shop probably.

189
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,770
But because it was a mimic and he was
mimicking, mimic. Yeah. Interesting. Me,

190
00:11:50,771 --> 00:11:54,070
me, me, me, me, me. Is

191
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,600
that like a French word for Mac?

192
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,550
Um, I think they just took, you know,

193
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,020
the beginning of Mimic
and added it to virus.

194
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,850
Hello. Mimi virus. Very nice. I guess
it's the same thing twice. Me, me.

195
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,090
It's like mimic. Yeah. Okay.
I get it. So interesting.

196
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,470
Yeah. So this, so this was,

197
00:12:09,471 --> 00:12:14,471
I mean this was really bizarre when they
published their report on this in 2003

198
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:18,290
and men, people really scratch their
head because remember, you know,

199
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:21,730
ordinary viruses have, you
know, maybe 10 genes. Uh,

200
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,160
this one had a 1080

201
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,820
p and g when you have 10 genes,

202
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:29,840
those are the genes that,

203
00:12:29,841 --> 00:12:33,470
so you have a protein capsule and
so you can swim through the thing.

204
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:34,760
So when you land on a cell,

205
00:12:34,761 --> 00:12:39,230
you can borrow in and then explode
and then make babies. So those are,

206
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,830
there's not much to being a virus
and just need a few genes for that.

207
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,730
W thousand.

208
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,650
This does this thing have
particular talents that the
other viruses didn't have.

209
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,130
Maybe it looks like, does it? Oh
it does. What does that, okay.

210
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:56,070
Well, so what's one thing that's really
interesting is what happens when it goes

211
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:58,410
inside its host and Amoeba.

212
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,710
It goes in a,

213
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:06,711
but instead of kind of shedding off that
protein code and just spilling out its

214
00:13:06,841 --> 00:13:07,410
contents,

215
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:12,330
it actually goes in and stays as it was.

216
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:17,100
You mean it stays in a container and
everything just sort of, yeah. Oh,

217
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,370
it's called the virus factory.
Once it's inside there,

218
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,720
the that it's this thing they call the
virus factory and it basically is able

219
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:29,490
to, um, to, to uh, things, you know,

220
00:13:29,491 --> 00:13:32,700
components come into it and then, uh,

221
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:37,730
then it sort of has enzymes that can
refashion them and then they outcome the

222
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:39,294
components for new. Yeah.

223
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,510
Yeah. It doesn't have to go into the
nucleus of the already existence. Hell no,

224
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:46,290
it just floats in there. Oh, interesting.
So it, it, what does it do? Like

225
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,520
[inaudible] portal and
it sucks up some stuff.

226
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,640
Yeah. It has this beautiful sort of a,

227
00:13:51,641 --> 00:13:55,330
they call it a stargate because it's
shaped like it's a doorway shape,

228
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:59,610
like a star and things
come in. And then I,

229
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:02,010
I had another stargate, the, the con, the,

230
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:04,110
these sort of manufactured
things come out.

231
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:08,070
And then in the cell they
assemble into new giant viruses.

232
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,351
Oh.

233
00:14:08,351 --> 00:14:12,640
So it spits out the raw materials and
that then self assemble into a giant and

234
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:16,540
giant Leviathan, no baby gentler biases,
which then how do they get out of the,

235
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:21,430
do they explode through the surface and
blow out? Yeah. That's like a totally,

236
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:23,610
that's a totally different number. Yeah.

237
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,040
I thought normally viruses just go into
the machine that's already there cause

238
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,260
they're parasites. They just use the
living thing. This thing is, I'm an,

239
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,870
I have a weird kind of a
respect for this thing.

240
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,210
Oh yeah. It's amazing. And you know,

241
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:42,160
one of the amazing things about it
is that it can get its own viruses.

242
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:47,830
It gets, there are really, yes.
So there are viruses and viruses.

243
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,920
These things are called Viro phages and
they actually go into virus factory and

244
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:57,250
high jacket. Oh, interstate
outcome. Viro phages. Oh Wow. Yeah.

245
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,930
As soon as you have a virus
factory, that's what a virus wants.

246
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,230
It's none of the virus has its own
virus factory. Well, it's going to get,

247
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:08,450
it's going viral infected viral lies by
the other viruses. Right? Weird. Yeah.

248
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,040
Weird is the right word. I think right
now done in 2003 you know, you could say,

249
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:16,580
well this is one weird virus,
but the scientist said, well hm,

250
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,990
I wonder what else there
is like, did that create a,

251
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,580
wait a second. So they said, okay,
it's got all this extra genetic power,

252
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,480
but he's doing this sort
of special circus act here.

253
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,580
It's building its own factory and it's
just behaving differently for others.

254
00:15:33,581 --> 00:15:37,000
So maybe it just needs all those genes
to do this special thing is doing.

255
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,940
The problem was that when they looked
at these, you know, 1,018 genes,

256
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:44,730
most of them didn't match anything
anyone had found before. Hmm.

257
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,910
These are new genes. Genes. Yeah.

258
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:50,120
That you couldn't even guess at what
they were at. This is gotta be from like,

259
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:52,400
this is like an alien is
from Saturn. This thing,

260
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,140
is that where you're driving with the
story? Not quite, but kind of. I mean,

261
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,200
so waiting. So they look at all
the genes. They look at the,

262
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,700
the chemistry of life as,

263
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,580
as it's known and they don't find
any matches for this little thing,

264
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:09,400
this big thing for most of the jeans.
They couldn't find a match. Huh? You know,

265
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,050
you can look at, I mean that's a
double mister. Like what is it?

266
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,240
What is this and where does it come from?

267
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,830
Cause it doesn't seem to have
the smell of earth life. Yeah.

268
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:23,480
Except that it uses DNA. I mean, it
uses protein, it uses our chemistry,

269
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:27,430
but it's doing something weird. Um,

270
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,570
and so these scientists said, well,
okay, they looked in an English hospital,

271
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,380
you know, water cooling tower,
let's go look at one here in France.

272
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,290
And so they looked and they
found another giant virus,

273
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,290
which is even bigger than the
one that they had already found.

274
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,950
[inaudible] hospital in France,
in the air conditioning. You know,

275
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,390
it was in another cooling
tower. Jesus is like a,

276
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,740
this is a cooling tower phenomenon
so far. Rooftop biology. Well,

277
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,240
it's excitement Galore.

278
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,050
It's more like the drunk looking for
the keys under the lamppost. You know,

279
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:01,490
it's like, you know, that openness,
wherever you look there, we know that,

280
00:17:01,491 --> 00:17:04,790
we know there was giant viruses
found in one water tower.

281
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,830
So let's go look in another water tower.

282
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,870
Like that's our safest bet and hey
look, we found an even bigger one. Uh,

283
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,950
you know, which they, um, which has
even bigger. It was even bigger. Yeah.

284
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:20,210
So instead of 1,018
jeans, it had 1,059 genes.

285
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,390
Um, so they named this one mama virus,

286
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,390
Mimi's first cousin Mama. Right, right.

287
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,410
Your Mama duly and things in
the cells that Mimi didn't do,

288
00:17:30,411 --> 00:17:34,670
or did it also built the industry? Yeah,
it was, it was making a virus factory.

289
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:36,140
So it was like, so there's something,

290
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:37,640
there's a common theme
here with these two.

291
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:41,630
Now you have two giant viruses doing
the same thing in the whole stargate and

292
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:45,350
everything. Uh, yeah. Um,
what's weird is that, you know,

293
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:49,100
the Mamma virus has a bunch of
genes that Mimi virus doesn't have.

294
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,560
So it's like, and again,
don't match anything that,

295
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,600
so they don't know what
these extra ones do.

296
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,150
Some of them look like they're
involved in building proteins,

297
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,610
which doesn't make any sense because
viruses are not supposed to do that. Huh.

298
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,490
So it's, it's, this is all completely
confusing, Huh? But then they say like,

299
00:18:08,491 --> 00:18:09,750
okay, um,

300
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,770
maybe we need to kind of get away
from the whole water power thing and,

301
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,740
you know, widen our a
little, where would you go?

302
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,920
Like to the opposite of a water tower
would be like the bottom of a well,

303
00:18:19,921 --> 00:18:24,921
or is it or do you go to a library and
look in the interior of old parchment

304
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:28,890
books? Now you start looking
at places like 'em you look,

305
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:33,920
you look in the ocean or you look in
sediment or you look inside animals,

306
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,851
um, or,

307
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:40,851
or you look in the soil and they start
finding giant viruses over and over and

308
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:48,450
over again. Really? Yeah. In all of
those places. In oil, inside of animals,

309
00:18:48,451 --> 00:18:52,680
like in animals, tummies or
something. Yeah. So, um, they, uh,

310
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,780
they went to, um, these,

311
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,110
these researchers went to Brazil and said,

312
00:18:58,111 --> 00:19:01,140
let's go look at animals and see
if we can find giant viruses.

313
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,760
And they found a new species in cows and
they found a new species living inside

314
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:08,460
of a monkey. And these were,

315
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,100
were they finding giant
or giant viruses? I mean,

316
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,680
the numbers of genes were
going up and up and they would,

317
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,830
they would keep finding new
record breakers. So, so the,

318
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,810
the biggest one right
now is called mega virus

319
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,500
virus. I mean, there's, you know,

320
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:36,090
the mega in a world you
got it. That's right.

321
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,360
It's like the truck of sorts. You
know, I was like, this is like, I, I,

322
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:43,620
I'm wondering what they're gonna do as
they keep finding bigger ones because you

323
00:19:43,621 --> 00:19:46,290
keep on having to find
Sapelo for these days. Well,

324
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,980
where was mega found and where
it was workers? Meg, I believe,

325
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,890
was found in the ocean. And
how many genes does mega have?

326
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,940
Mega has a 1000,

327
00:19:56,941 --> 00:20:01,020
120 genes. Okay. So, but
it's not actually the big,

328
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,910
so it has the most jeans,

329
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:07,440
but it's not actually that physically
the biggest giant virus, which was,

330
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,220
so this, this one is a
called a Pandora virus

331
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,780
in a box, in a sealed box.

332
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:19,040
And then I opened it
and well, it's shaped,

333
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,710
it has this bizarre
shaped like an earn a Ho,

334
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:26,440
which is completely nuts.
There's no urn shaped, viral,

335
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,690
crazy. And the earn.

336
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:36,180
Does that remind somebody of the myth of
Pandora's box was actually an earn? Oh,

337
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:40,410
it was? Okay. Oh, I see. Why is it
be called Pandora's box then? God,

338
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:44,790
this is a very list to make you happy
because you love where they found it.

339
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,820
Where did they find it? So what they
did, uh, these Russian scientists,

340
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:53,821
they were collaborating with dug up
frozen Tundra that had been frozen for

341
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:58,780
30,000 years. And they said, let's
throw this out and see what's in there.

342
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,960
What kind of things had been
asleep for 30,000 years?

343
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,420
And it sounds like the beginning
of the Psi Phi movie right there,

344
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:09,720
among other things, they found pendulum
screws. They found Pandora virus.

345
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,350
Huh? And they, not only
did they find it, but they,

346
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:16,750
when they let it warm up a bit, uh,

347
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:21,070
and then they gave it some amoeba
checkout. They, they did it.

348
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,780
They did its thing. Wow.

349
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:27,810
And it w how much bigger if the first a
giant virus introduced us to was like an

350
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:31,870
elephant sized mouse.

351
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,640
It compared to that elephant size
mouse. How much bigger is this one?

352
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,950
Um, maybe it's more specific than you
might be. I need to look at the numbers,

353
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,090
but you know, you're kind of going from,
I don't know, elephants to dinosaurs.

354
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,970
You're getting bigger and bigger
and bigger. You're, uh, you know,

355
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:50,770
we're not talking about, you know,

356
00:21:50,771 --> 00:21:54,670
Pandora virus is bigger
than a lot of bacteria. Wow.

357
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,820
So these things are now being
found everywhere. You look. I mean,

358
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,530
they are incredibly common.

359
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,260
They've even been able to get giant
viruses out of people. Really? Yeah.

360
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,490
We deal with where are you find them
in a person and our intestines or

361
00:22:12,491 --> 00:22:13,510
something. Um,

362
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,430
I believe they found one
sample in somebody's lungs. Um,

363
00:22:18,431 --> 00:22:21,760
and another sample was
found in someone's blood,

364
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:27,090
but it's really hard to tell whether
they're actually like actively invading us

365
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:31,450
and making us sick. You know,
maybe seven reading Amoebas,

366
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:36,070
they can invade human cells cause maybe
on human cells are surprisingly similar.

367
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:37,750
Um,

368
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:42,250
or is it just kind of along for the
ride with some Amoeba that infect us?

369
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:45,280
Um, or does it kind of drift
in and when people are sick,

370
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:46,360
their defenses are down.

371
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:51,100
So we don't know if giant viruses have
anything to do with human disease. But

372
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,210
you have a category problem here.

373
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:00,540
If you've got a giant virus that's virus
like in it's general shell but it's

374
00:23:02,921 --> 00:23:04,060
making proteins,

375
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,930
it's got a bunch of genes
that viruses don't have.

376
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,300
You're already bigger than
some bacteria shouldn't be,

377
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:14,010
call it as its own separate thing at
this point. That's what people are,

378
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,150
are arguing about right now. I mean do,

379
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:22,180
do we keep that line between viruses
and cellular life and just put the giant

380
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:26,200
viruses with the viruses or do
we kind of blur the line a bit?

381
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,710
This feels like it's on its way from
one category to the other. So that's,

382
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,610
that's one of the big questions is
like what way did this thing go?

383
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,390
And evolution, what does that mean?
Well, how do you get a giant virus?

384
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,210
Like how do you, how do you, well that so,

385
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:44,460
so we'll get to the potential
answer to that question,

386
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,400
which I think is totally fascinating.

387
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,713
After the break.

Hey, Jad here. Radio labs,

418
00:25:44,601 --> 00:25:48,180
so we're going to return
to our conversation with
science writer Carl Zimmer.

419
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,020
It's an unedited conversation. And A,

420
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:56,030
we were talking about giant viruses
and what they can teach us about life,

421
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,930
which really starts with a
simpler question of like,

422
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,130
where the hell did they come from?

423
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,820
How do you get a giant fires? Like how
do you, how do you, well that and so,

424
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:07,300
so one clue comes from those jeans.

425
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:10,090
So now that they're finding more
and more of these giant viruses,

426
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,420
they're finding enough, a
variety of them. They can,

427
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:17,650
they can look for a serious and some
common genes that they share some,

428
00:26:17,651 --> 00:26:20,530
some common mutations in genes.
And they're finding actually that,

429
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:25,450
that it looks like giant viruses
might actually belong to one lineage.

430
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,230
Oh, interesting. Sure. Their cousins,
they have a common ancestor. Yeah.

431
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:33,520
So this tribe of us, right.
And if that, if that's true,

432
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,670
it could be an incredibly
old tribe. These,

433
00:26:36,671 --> 00:26:40,030
these giant viruses could
be a lineage, conceivably,

434
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:44,070
that goes all the way back to,
you know, the stages of life,

435
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,050
the dawn of time in order. It's really,

436
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:53,760
oh, like I went back to the very beginning
of life on earth, um, to that era.

437
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:56,190
Yeah. Yeah. I mean maybe

438
00:26:56,290 --> 00:27:00,010
when cellular life was getting
started, but the question is, well,

439
00:27:00,011 --> 00:27:03,910
what were the giant viruses like then?
Now some people have said, well no,

440
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:08,020
giant virus is actually started out as
teeny tiny viruses and they've just been

441
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,640
like gathering up new genes through
time and just been getting bigger and

442
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:15,430
bigger, bigger. Um, but you know,

443
00:27:15,431 --> 00:27:18,430
a number of the people who actually
study giant viruses and have really,

444
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:22,660
you know, helped us to understand
the most are saying, no,

445
00:27:22,661 --> 00:27:23,650
we don't think so.

446
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:29,130
We actually think that these things
started out as cellular life.

447
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,920
They were cells, they
were full blown cells.

448
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,970
Oh, you mean they were from the other
side of the road? They were cellular life.

449
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,280
And then what? They switched sides.
They changed teams. Yeah. How,

450
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,550
how to know that like I can't have
a plant that becomes an animal.

451
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:51,110
How did they, so they started off as
like what we would call creatures,

452
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:55,680
right. And then they started
out truly alive. You know, they,

453
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:00,690
they for you standing out there in the
air or the water or the ground or just

454
00:28:01,011 --> 00:28:05,080
some like some free living microbe.
Yeah. And then that could be,

455
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:08,300
why would they be, why would
you go demoed yourself? This is,

456
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,310
this is your problem with parasites.

457
00:28:10,311 --> 00:28:13,790
You keep saying mean things
about parasites. Well,

458
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:17,060
how am I here that we've been talking
about parasites taught you nothing.

459
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,770
If I have a choice
between being ace intake,

460
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:26,630
having my own integrity and choosing to
make a living on my own or to suck off

461
00:28:26,631 --> 00:28:31,080
you, I would just live on
my own. Excuse me for no,

462
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:33,830
you like parasites, but
honestly could you not use that?

463
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,810
That passage in the recording
actually it's already been cut of.

464
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,870
So say wait a second. So you,

465
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:44,870
according to this theory you
have a man's true. Nevertheless,

466
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,940
we have a micro that is,

467
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:52,490
that is doing its thing and then
something happens. What is the something?

468
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,350
It becomes a parasite.

469
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:59,240
It becomes a parish or at least you know
maybe a symbiotic here. They basically,

470
00:28:59,241 --> 00:29:03,320
what it does is it starts
living inside another cell.

471
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:06,110
You need gives up its
integrity as a, as a,

472
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:10,010
as a free life form of
free standing life form.

473
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:14,180
Just so we understand what that means.
That means that it's got a shell,

474
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,520
it's got a border, it's
making its own energy.

475
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:20,270
It's replicating in the way that
let the beginning at the beginning,

476
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,750
at the beginning, it can make its own
energy. It can grow, it can divide,

477
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,650
they can do all the things
that living things do. Yeah.

478
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,720
And then for some reason it chooses to
require some other creatures existence

479
00:29:32,391 --> 00:29:33,440
for it's own. It has,

480
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:38,500
it has to become dependent on
some other organism for its very,

481
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,610
very existence. Well, let's flip
it the other way. Say it discovers

482
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,220
a wonderful new home inside
of another cell. It says,

483
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,270
it comes in and it's like, just like,

484
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:54,220
I love leaving my park off in new
apartment for a dark cave and exciting

485
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:59,110
opportunity. No, no, no. Oh, contrare
AU. Contraire like imagine, imagine you.

486
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,350
Like let's say, let's imagine
you're like bear Grylls. Okay.

487
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:07,270
Let's imagine you are like hiking
around and killing your own food.

488
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:11,400
Okay, let's, let's try to picture
this. Okay, Robert, doing this.

489
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,330
You're gutting your deer.
You're starting your own fires.

490
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:17,560
You're going on and on and on.

491
00:30:17,561 --> 00:30:21,940
And you do that for like a few years and
then you're walking through the jungle

492
00:30:21,941 --> 00:30:25,780
and then very, very skinny
cause it's not going well.

493
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,670
So Robert Krulwich that
the haggard hunter, um,

494
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:32,890
and let's say you're doing this in
Minnesota, right? So it's like cold. Okay.

495
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,850
And then suddenly like you, you,

496
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,080
there's a break in the forest and you
come across a giant mansion and you're

497
00:30:41,081 --> 00:30:42,100
like, what is this place?

498
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:47,100
And you open the door and inside there's
like conveyor belts with ice cream and

499
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,880
steak and you know, and,

500
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:55,840
and there are slippers waiting for
you and you know, anything you need,

501
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:59,410
it's somebody else's taken care of
it. There is one thing you left out.

502
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,580
When I walk into this magical
kingdom, it doesn't let me out.

503
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,000
I can't leave ever again. Sure.

504
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:11,100
You can become so dependent on its natural
wonders that I lose my independence,

505
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:15,970
my integrity and the very, very thing
that I walked in with is now gone.

506
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,640
We did literally have this conversation
a few years ago. We did. It's true.

507
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,141
We did.

508
00:31:20,141 --> 00:31:25,141
And I did point out to you at the time
that you are quite dependent on on other

509
00:31:25,991 --> 00:31:30,670
species. Do you want me to
bring, yeah, no, no, no,

510
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:33,530
no. But I will just,

511
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:38,080
I would just say see episode 32 droughts,

512
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:42,190
eyes will rule right out of their
sockets. So, so like becoming big,

513
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,450
being able to take
advantage of another cell,

514
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,630
evolutionarily speaking is,

515
00:31:49,631 --> 00:31:54,631
is a great way to go because you have
all these things taken care of for you.

516
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,470
Now. Um, the, the, according
to this theory, these,

517
00:31:59,471 --> 00:32:02,430
these mysterious, ancient, uh,

518
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:07,470
microbes started going into these cells
and reproducing there and then going out

519
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:12,580
again and then finding another host cell
to infect. Okay. Were they making like,

520
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:17,800
um, where they making their hosts
sick? Uh, probably, yeah, probably.

521
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,340
Yeah, because giant viruses are not
good to get. Let's see. This is,

522
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:25,240
this complicates your mentioned metaphor
just a tiny bit because what it means

523
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:27,820
is that you go in the conveyor belt swirl
and you're feeding yourself and having

524
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:28,241
a good time,

525
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:31,900
but then your filth starts to muck up
the place and it starts to collapse from

526
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:36,010
within. That doesn't sound so nice.
Strain the metaphor bed boy, go boy,

527
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:43,450
Robert Frank to me, me now it's to go
to him. Okay, I understand. So, so you,

528
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,700
you spend some time in this wonderful
mansion. You, you rest, it's warm,

529
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:50,600
it's comfortable selling you,
you, you eat with your filth,

530
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,120
you start a family, you know,

531
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,980
and then all of a sudden you
and your descendants, you know,

532
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,390
leave the mansion.

533
00:32:59,391 --> 00:33:03,620
The mansion just collapses from
all the damage you did to it.

534
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,650
But you know, actually you see in
the distance there's another mansion.

535
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,750
Let's just go over there and now you feel
like rested and ready and like, yeah,

536
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,200
that all we gotta do is get over
there. So let's just go there.

537
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:14,810
We don't have to, we don't have
to stop to, to kill a deer.

538
00:33:14,811 --> 00:33:19,280
We just go to that next mansion. The ice
cream is waiting. I still got to walk.

539
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,500
So I need my legs so to speak, to
get to the next mansion. Right.

540
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,690
But I don't need the powerful muscles
that I would have needed to kill the deer.

541
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:30,650
I can let you don't even, you
don't need even need, you know,

542
00:33:30,651 --> 00:33:32,240
let's say that you're, you know,

543
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,260
you don't even need the knowledge of
how to kill a deer, wouldn't be blind,

544
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:40,670
dumb and fat. So these are these things,

545
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:45,290
these things turn these
things they get rid of,

546
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:50,240
they start getting rid of these jeans
and, and how does that happen? Just,

547
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,630
you know, a random mutation comes
along and just cuts out a bit of DNA.

548
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:57,530
She doesn't need them. You're fine.
Yeah. You're like, no, that's okay.

549
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,370
Is it a moment where, oh, there
goes a big chunk of me gone. Yeah.

550
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,503
I don't need that.

551
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:07,040
That's a regular kind of mutation that
happens all the time really in sales.

552
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,540
Oh yeah, yeah. But then you're, you're,

553
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,640
your successor being just travels a
little bit lighter and is able to succeed

554
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:17,270
just as well. Right. So, you
know, if, if, if, if, you know,

555
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:22,010
if we are born, you know, with, with
a part of our DNA that's deleted,

556
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:25,760
that had some, you know,
like hemoglobin genes in it,

557
00:34:25,761 --> 00:34:30,380
like goodnight, like that's
bad. I mean, but um, you know,

558
00:34:30,381 --> 00:34:35,381
but if you cut out a gene that this giant
virus no longer needs because it's got

559
00:34:36,831 --> 00:34:40,400
everything supplied to
it and its host fine.

560
00:34:40,401 --> 00:34:42,950
So chuck that chuck it
out. So you have this,

561
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:46,820
so the idea is that you have these
viruses, they're giant viruses,

562
00:34:46,821 --> 00:34:49,400
but they're actually been shrinking. Huh?

563
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:53,240
And at a how fast does a giant,

564
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:57,980
like the g imagining back
in the beginning there was,

565
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:02,760
there was not mega, not giant. No. In
the beginning it was a cellular B. Oh,

566
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,000
cellular. Right. Okay. So this, I mean,

567
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:11,840
privileges independent life size wise,

568
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,270
it's a blimp. It's a massive thing.

569
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:17,750
And then suddenly it starts to
shrink bit by bit by bit by bit.

570
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,210
What at what rate does it start
to shrink and shed itself? Well,

571
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,260
it could be that these giant viruses,

572
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:32,410
we're finding these giant viruses that
scientists are finding could be shrinking

573
00:35:32,511 --> 00:35:37,040
very, very, very slowly. It could be that

574
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:43,810
there are other viruses that made
this transition that shrank faster.

575
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:50,010
So maybe, maybe it's a race to
the bottom, maybe some, some,

576
00:35:50,011 --> 00:35:53,730
maybe some tiny viruses or
just former giant viruses

577
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:58,260
that just shrank really fast.
Race to the bottom. It's sure.

578
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:00,030
Different way of thinking about life. You,

579
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:05,310
you generally assume being a
multicellular organism yourself. Yeah,

580
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,940
that little things in
some deep sense though.

581
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,750
You're not supposed to say
this. I want to be big things.

582
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:14,820
You don't want to say
this. I know, I know.

583
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,210
But most people unlike you asshole,

584
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,270
most people think that

585
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:25,800
it's better to be more
complex than to be simple.

586
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:29,090
But here you're talking about
a different voyage altogether.

587
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,790
It might just work out for you
to be simple rather than complex.

588
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,440
Um, well, given that, that viruses

589
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,770
are insanely abundant on this planet,

590
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:44,830
I mean there are by some estimates a
10 to the 31st power viruses on earth.

591
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:49,150
I think about that. Like
it's a, it's a, you know,

592
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,080
it's a one with 31 zeros after it.

593
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,540
I mean it's inconceivable how
many viruses there are on earth.

594
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,440
So it's their world. So
apparently, you know,

595
00:37:00,441 --> 00:37:05,270
nature has not agreed with you, but
you know, it is interesting like, uh,

596
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:10,250
thinking about how, how
life gets smaller and

597
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:15,550
simpler. Yeah. It's interesting. Yeah.
If it's true that this trajectory is as,

598
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,680
as, as common as you say,

599
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:22,450
that that things start out sometimes start
out big and then learn to live inside

600
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:24,940
other things and in the process get
smaller and smaller and smaller.

601
00:37:24,941 --> 00:37:28,090
And this is actually maybe what
happens to a lot of viruses,

602
00:37:28,091 --> 00:37:33,010
not just sound viruses in a way it
gives the virus and honorable history.

603
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,220
I don't know.

604
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,970
I feel that way else. This boy
isn't going to sign up for nothing.

605
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,070
He's not going to sign up for that. And
then I don't know. It's okay. I will

606
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:46,680
an honorable history, but then I mean
it abandoned it's free living path,

607
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,640
right? It did.

608
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:52,200
It gave into the temptations of the
mansion full of steak and ice cream. Yeah,

609
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,393
it's true. But yeah,

610
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,550
always assumed, and this is not,

611
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:01,180
not something wants you to seem that
viruses were a kind of prodo organism.

612
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,910
They were somehow at the beginning of
something and they never quite got going.

613
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,051
Yeah. But this,

614
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:09,770
you're actually saying that these
viruses are in a way at the end,

615
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,480
not at the end, but they're at the,

616
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:15,870
I don't know how to quite use the
words that I want to use this.

617
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,350
They feel somehow at the end of
something, not at the beginning,

618
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,210
like you've just took the,

619
00:38:20,211 --> 00:38:23,990
you just took what I considered to be
the beginning and you've now made it an

620
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,880
and an end and end. And
that's interesting. I never,
that's very interesting.

621
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,690
Yeah. Very interesting. So, so life
can go in different directions.

622
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,190
Okay. And how far can that journey

623
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:40,540
go? I mean, can you go from
like how big did that it,

624
00:38:40,541 --> 00:38:45,010
was it ever like a turtle with,
with uh, with things or no,

625
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,330
like a giant dinosaur? No, no,
sorry. Yeah. There are things called,

626
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:52,720
I believe they're called mixes zones, um,

627
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:58,860
which started out as free living
animals and have become parasites.

628
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,610
And they're just down to just
a few cells, maybe mixed zones.

629
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:04,990
You say we didn't free living animals.

630
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,020
You don't mean animals in the way that
animals that anyone would think of an

631
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:11,140
animal like a jelly. Oh look, my pet
and my pet fluffy. Not like that.

632
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:13,870
Well my pet jellyfish.
Really? Really? Yeah.

633
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:19,330
So you're saying a jellyfish size thing
has now reduced itself to a tiny spec

634
00:39:19,331 --> 00:39:22,860
microscopic parasite of fish. Get The for,

635
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:27,040
I won't even say it because you can't do
it if you're that small. That's insane.

636
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,513
It really,

637
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:32,650
it's like going from something you
can see and would want to avoid while

638
00:39:32,651 --> 00:39:35,920
swimming down to something that you
might even just breathe in without even

639
00:39:35,921 --> 00:39:40,510
knowing it. [inaudible] wow.
Oh, you're blowing my mind.

640
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,280
Shrinking my, what was it
called again? Mixes. Mixes.

641
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,290
Zone mixes zone. Yeah.
How do you spell that?

642
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:50,080
M Y. X. Z. O. H. N.

643
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:55,240
I'm trying in my mind to construct a
scenario where we like the mix zone could

644
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:58,550
begin to shed. Like if we
were living inside the,

645
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:03,220
like not the iPhone but the I I own
the I universe. Well, you know, but,

646
00:40:03,221 --> 00:40:08,110
but the fact is that we, you know, we
have cast aside some things, you know,

647
00:40:08,111 --> 00:40:11,170
what have we cast to say? Well we
can't, I mean we used to smell better.

648
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:12,860
I know that. I knew that
I felt better. Yeah.

649
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,790
We used to be able to make our
own vitamin C in our own bodies.

650
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:19,780
Our own bodies were vitamin C
factories. Really? Yes. Wait, what,

651
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:23,770
what changed that? Probably did we want
to let go of that? That sounds great.

652
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:28,900
Sunshine, vitamin C, yeah. Making your
own supply of vitamin C. Well, um,

653
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:32,980
if you are sitting around eating
fruit all the time, fruit,

654
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:34,720
which is loaded in vitamin C,

655
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,370
then if you get a mutation
on your vitamin C gene,

656
00:40:39,371 --> 00:40:41,920
well in Europe you're fine
cause you, you're, you,

657
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:45,580
you're getting your vitamins c from
somewhere else. You don't feel that lack,

658
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,610
you know,

659
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:51,610
C and you don't start getting scurvy
because you're treating yourself on fruit.

660
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:57,810
And then that mutated gene may then spread
out and end up being in every member

661
00:40:58,151 --> 00:40:59,770
of your species, which
seems to happen to us.

662
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:01,570
I mean you can literally
like see like these,

663
00:41:01,571 --> 00:41:05,440
we have these broken vitamin C genes.
So sometimes we shrink to, yeah.

664
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,083
[inaudible]

665
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,430
okay. So there you have it.

666
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:29,460
A raw conversation with science writer
Carl Zimmer about shrinking shrinkage in

667
00:41:31,211 --> 00:41:34,710
life. No, usually what happens
these conversations is uh,

668
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,420
cause you're just talking and cause you
don't really have like an encyclopedia

669
00:41:38,421 --> 00:41:41,660
sitting right next to you. You get a
lot of a little things wrong details,

670
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:44,960
little facts, names, dates,
whatever. And then you know,

671
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:49,250
you fact check it later.
Uh, so in fairness to Carl,
as we were fact checking,

672
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:51,950
we gave him the chance to listen
back to the raw conversation,

673
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,930
make a couple of amendments.

674
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,350
This is fact checker.

675
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:00,930
Caro a scolding rambling Carl.

676
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,400
Okay. So, okay, we were saying that, um,

677
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,020
this is microbiologist, uh, Tim
Robotham took his samples to France,

678
00:42:10,021 --> 00:42:13,530
but actually there was
another microbiologist named
Richard Bertles that did it.

679
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,660
Um, Gotcha. Small but important. Sorry
Richard. My, our apologies. Yeah.

680
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:22,590
And Mama virus turns out to
have a thousand, 23 genes,

681
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:27,510
not 1,059 genes going. Apologies. Then
I started talking about echo virus.

682
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,190
At the time in 2011,

683
00:42:29,191 --> 00:42:33,900
it was indeed the biggest
virus known 1000, 120 genes.

684
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,700
Okay. Okay. However,

685
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:40,650
there was in 2013 a another virus found,

686
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,810
um, called Pandora virus.

687
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,470
Now I was saying that this was something
found this had Green Tundra wrong.

688
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:52,850
This was found the ocean and
this virus has oh lot of genes.

689
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:58,740
How many I had has 2,500. Whoa.

690
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:02,640
2,500. I mean, that's way
more than a lot of bacteria.

691
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,050
Also a it at a certain point.

692
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:09,430
And we do refer to Pandora virus as
being the biggest virus in size actually.

693
00:43:09,431 --> 00:43:13,570
That uh, that distinction
goes to hippo virus. And, uh,

694
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,970
also it seems that since we talked,

695
00:43:14,971 --> 00:43:18,400
there's evidence that there might
actually be a couple separate lineages of

696
00:43:18,401 --> 00:43:19,360
giant viruses.

697
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,650
One may have evolved from big
to small as we talked about,

698
00:43:23,651 --> 00:43:26,350
but another one might have gone in
the usual direction from small to big.

699
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,120
Um, there's one last thing
that I see. So apparently, uh,

700
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,150
apparently I didn't quite
spell mixes zone correct.

701
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:40,810
This is how you spell mixes
zone. M Y, X. O. Z. O. A. N.

702
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,830
Apparently I missed one of those.
Those I can remember. I mean,

703
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,160
I would be lying if I say I didn't
think a little bit less of, you know.

704
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:54,250
Okay. Extra. Oh, back in the raw stupidity

705
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,580
that goes into radio lab. Yeah. Stupid
people interviewing stupid people

706
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:07,900
about smart things. That's funny.
That's a great taglines, dude.

707
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:11,980
Okay. Uh, that's our new
tagline. I'm Chad IPM. Rod,
