Now I hope you actually spend some time trying

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.710
to justify your answer. I've come up with four different

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.590
levels of poor to okay, to better, to best.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.980
Answers here that you can evaluate yourself with. I want

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.500
you to read each one, and compare it to

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.230
the answer you put. See how it measures up to

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.910
your explanation. Then I want you to tick the

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.720
box that represents where you think your answer best fits.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.740
You could be right on par with one of my answers or in between them.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.940
Go ahead and evaluate yourself! I want to know how you think you did. If you

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.420
have any questions or if you want to

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.560
see what other people are thinking. You should

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.450
definitely check out the forums right now because

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.520
I imagine there is some commentary on this.
