Welcome, everyone.

My name is Trisha Ingram.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.330
Excellent.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.650
As the late, great children's
book author, Roald Dahl, said,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.320
"Those who don't believe in
magic will never see it."

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.630
Well, in 2011, nine-year-old
Caine Monroy spent his summer

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.310
vacation building an elaborate,
DIY cardboard

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.310
arcade inside his dad's used
auto parts store, and invited

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.490
people to play.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.350
The entire summer went by.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.570
And Caine had yet to have
a single customer.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.440
Until one day, a filmmaker named
Nirvan stopped by to buy

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.790
a door handle.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.502
What happened next inspired
Nirvan's short film.

00:01:11.834 --> 00:01:12.326
-My name is Caine.

00:01:12.326 --> 00:01:13.310
And I'm nine years old.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.550
My arcade is called
Caine's Arcade.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.490
I'm open on weekends only.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.430
And it's real cheap.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.520
-Caine does not pass by an
arcade without stopping in.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.620
He loves tickets,
playing games.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.200
He loves prizes.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.060
So it was only natural for him
to build his own arcade.

TRISHA INGRAM: So who here
believes in magic?

00:01:38.735 --> 00:01:39.900
Can I see some hands?

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.760
That's what I thought.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.910
So Nirvan posted this film on
the internet on April 9, 2012.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.710
And five days later, the
movie went viral.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.490
With now over 8 million views
and screenings around the

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.820
world on television and
at festivals, it

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.510
has launched a movement.

Here to talk about this
incredible journey is Nirvan

NIRVAN MULLICK: Hello.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.020
Thanks for having us.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.960
I'm Nirvan.

CAINE MONROY: Caine Monroy.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.230
NIRVAN MULLICK: This video
came out about a

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.810
little over a year ago.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.130
As Tricia said, it
was April 9.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.780
I just want to share a little
bit of the impact that the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.590
film has had both been on my
life, and Caine's life, and

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.420
then we'll do a little
Q and A. Sound cool?

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.700
So if you guys have questions,
think about them, and then ask

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.950
us at the end.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.950
Literally, the day I posted the
film, it just went viral.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.120
At the end of the film, there
was that little website.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.620
Cainesarcade.com.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.480
It said, donate to Caine's
scholarship fund.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.400
The goals was to
raise a $25,000

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.200
scholarship fund for Caine.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.480
Caine's dad, who is in
the back somewhere,

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.500
he was like, yeah.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.120
Maybe.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.630
Good luck.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.500
There's George.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.860
So the first day we posted the
film, it got over a million

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.570
views, and it raised over
$60,000 on day one.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:23.010
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.710
NIRVAN MULLICK: That
was the thought.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.800
We raised the goal, actually,
to $100,000, thinking by the

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.450
time Caine's ready for college,
this might even cover

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.990
a semester, because tuition
is going up so fast.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.680
So we raised the goal
to $100,000.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.952
And the next day, it raised
over $110,000.

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:40.010
At that point, we were
like, should we

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.020
raise the goal again?

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.490
And George is like, yes.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.490
Raise it to a million
bucks, please.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.130
We said, no, wait.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.750
We don't really know what's
going on here.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.480
We need to kind of figure out
what's happening, have a plan

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.400
before we invite the global
community that's helped us

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.850
reach this goal without
having a plan.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.470
Because the first two days, I
mean we were getting phone

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.560
calls, and the media
was calling us.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.540
I didn't sleep for the
first two days.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.570
We were going and doing
all these talk shows.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.010
Remember?

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.990
CAINE MONROY: Yes.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.860
Paris.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.475
NIRVAN MULLICK: Well, not in the
first two days, we didn't

00:04:08.475 --> 00:04:08.800
go to Paris.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.080
But we did end up
going to Paris.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.470
So there's this huge,
global interest.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.380
By the end of the fifth
day, we'd raised over

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.899
$152,000 for Caine.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:23.550
We gave him this giant,
cardboard check at his arcade.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.530
But it wasn't just the money
that was being raised.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.330
There was media around
the world.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.070
Justin Timberlake was
tweeting it out.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.960
It was trending on Twitter
worldwide.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.910
It had over 140 million media
impressions in the first week.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.720
And the more magical thing
was the response from

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.560
kids around the world.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.490
Kids and educators saw the film,
and they just started

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.290
making things.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.010
So this is a little clip from
a follow-up film I made,

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.290
showing a little bit of the
global response from kids and

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.410
people around the world
to Caine's Arcade.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.970
-Finally tonight,
we have a great

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.350
story out of Los Angeles.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.290
East LA, to be precise.

-When you're a lonely,
nine-year-old boy, an empty

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.420
cardboard box can be a universe
of possibilities.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.520
-I found this great story.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.480
I want to share it with you.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.290
-They're lining up to play
at his cardboard arcade.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.440
-This kid made his own arcade.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.479
-And the internet has been
flooded with response videos.

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:15.958
-Yeah!

00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:19.790
You get ten tries.

-50.

-Caine, this is me,
Jojo Romand.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.570
-I made this pinball machine.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.452
-It's called Tilt-a-Ball.

00:05:26.452 --> 00:05:27.928
-Nice!

beautiful response from

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.950
kids around the world.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.530
Something magical was
really happening.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.080
After two days of not sleeping,
I had this idea of

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.990
trying to start a foundation,
and have an impact on more

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.740
kids like Caine, who just needed
a high five and their

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.226
creativity to be fostered.

00:06:07.226 --> 00:06:08.476
Are you going for the mic?

00:06:12.314 --> 00:06:12.770
What?

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:13.790
You're four?

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:14.780
Wow.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.515
I'm 38.

00:06:15.515 --> 00:06:19.458
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:23.180
NIRVAN MULLICK: So I stayed up
for two days, and then I wrote

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.597
this mission statement on a
napkin to find, foster, and

00:06:25.597 --> 00:06:27.550
fund creativity and
entrepreneurship in more kids

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.970
like Caine.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.560
Because it was just clear there
are so many kids like

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.130
Caine out there.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.000
Parents were posting pictures of
their kids on Facebook, on

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.490
our Facebook page, saying,
my daughter is four,

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.520
and she saw the movie.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.890
She just built an arcade
in our kitchen.

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.190
She's got her own shirt.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.570
How do we get some customers
into the kitchen?

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.740
So the idea was to try make a
foundation that would help

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.010
foster creativity in
kids everywhere.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.880
So I had a conversation
with the Goldhirsh

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.360
Foundation Ben Goldhirsh.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.060
They started "GOOD Magazine."
Really great folks.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.480
I've known them for 12 years.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.300
He said to me, you guys are
starting at the destination.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.320
There's so many organizations
trying to figure out how to

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.720
scale things like project-based
learning.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.690
What can we do to support you?

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.870
At that point, they offered us a
quarter million dollar grant

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.350
to start up the Imagination
Foundation.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.400
The quarter million dollar grant
started matching, dollar

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.190
for dollar, the donations being
made by the public to

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.330
the Caine Scholarship Fund.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.490
So every dollar given by the
public to Caine Scholarship

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.050
Fund, the Goldhirsh Foundation
gave us $1.00 to start up

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.670
Imagination Foundation.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.650
At that point, we raised the
goal on the website from

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.330
$100,000 to $25,000.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.150
And this is a little bit of what
we accomplished in the

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.050
first five months from the
film being posted.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.660
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.590
-So the Imagination Foundation's
mission is to

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.810
find, foster, and fund
creativity and

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.850
entrepreneurship in
kids like Caine.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.980
After we started the foundation,
the first thing we

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.130
did is we hit the ground
running with a

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.600
school pilot program.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.330
Within the first two months,
over 100 schools in nine

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.990
countries participated, using
project-based learning to

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.870
teach kids math, science,
and engineering.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.605
-One of the greatest challenges
I think we face in

00:07:56.605 --> 00:08:00.460
education is tapping into
children's natural powers of

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.430
creativity.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.870
And one of the appeals of
Caine's Arcade is it's

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.500
demonstrated how deep those
powers are, and how readily

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.855
people will rise to
the challenge if

00:08:07.855 --> 00:08:09.276
you give it to them.

00:08:09.276 --> 00:08:11.320
-So we decided to give
this world a

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.120
global Cardboard Challenge.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.460
We Invited people around the
world to build anything

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.540
awesome out of cardboard,
recycled materials, and their

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.570
imagination.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.470
And three weeks after posting
this challenge, we had over

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:25.418
271 events organized in 41
countries around the world.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.650
-I told Caine that when
I was a kid, I also

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.250
built cardboard rockets.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.030
These were space capsules
that we could

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:38.159
actually fly in our backyard.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.030
And here I am, many years later,
and I'm still building

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:41.485
spacecraft.

00:08:41.485 --> 00:08:45.960
But this one, a real once
that landed on Mars.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.000
-Childhood imagination will
take you from cardboard to

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.135
this in just a few years.

00:08:50.135 --> 00:08:59.758
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:59.758 --> 00:09:00.260
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:01.852
NIRVAN MULLICK: The Cardboard
Challenge culminated in a

00:09:01.852 --> 00:09:05.260
global day of play, which last
year, happened on October 6,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.194
which was the one-year
anniversary of the flash mob

00:09:07.194 --> 00:09:08.565
we did for Caine.

00:09:08.565 --> 00:09:10.850
And this year, it will be
happening again on October 5.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.990
So every year on the anniversary
of the flash mob,

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.850
we invite the world to come out
and play, and celebrate

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:20.060
the creativity of kids
om their community.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.350
This year, the goal of
Imagination Foundation is to

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:26.380
engage one million kids in 70
countries in creative play.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.990
We've been growing a
lot, very quickly.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.020
So we invite you all to find
out more, and maybe

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.900
participate in a Cardboard
Challenge in your communities.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:37.860
And I just want to share a
little bit about how this has

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.640
impacted Caine, right?

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.070
You remember that day, the flash
mob, before the film

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.890
went all viral.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:45.540
CAINE MONROY: Yes.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.740
NIRVAN MULLICK: Do you remember
what you said to you

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.570
dad when you guys were
driving home?

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:50.403
CAINE MONROY: It was the
best day of my life.

00:09:50.403 --> 00:09:51.150
NIRVAN MULLICK: Yeah.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.280
So George told me that the next
day, and it kind of made

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.200
me tear up.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.100
The impact it had.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.370
I mean, we've raised over
$232,000 now for Caine's

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:01.610
Scholarship Fund.

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.950
This is a photo from
the Saturday after

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:04.870
the film went viral.

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.970
We didn't invite people this
time to a flash mob.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.580
But over 1,000 people just
showed up spontaneously to

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.840
play Caine's Arcade.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:14.530
And we had, like, there was
a line around the block.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.550
There was like a four
or five hour wait.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.950
And Caine actually started
selling a $20 Fast Fun Pass,

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:20.880
where you can skip the line.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.886
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:23.886 --> 00:10:26.290
NIRVAN MULLICK: Caine was the
youngest ever entrepreneur to

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:28.260
speak at the USC Marshall
School of Business.

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.460
CNN came out, and filmed
you there?

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.260
CAINE MONROY: Yes.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.520
NIRVAN MULLICK: Then Caine
went up to Sacramento.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.490
And he was given the Latino
Spirit Award at the California

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.410
State Assembly.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.610
And he wore sneaks
with his suit.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.260
We went to France, as
Caine mentioned.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:50.370
Caine was the youngest ever
speaker at the Cannes Lions

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.450
International Festival of
Creativity, which we renamed

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.845
Caine's Lions, for the day.

00:10:56.845 --> 00:10:58.705
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:58.705 --> 00:11:01.580
NIRVAN MULLICK: He was just
out in New York, where he

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.660
spoke at a Tedx Teen event,
hosted by Chelsea Clinton.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:06.750
Was that fun?

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.456
CAINE MONROY: Yeah.

00:11:07.456 --> 00:11:08.310
NIRVAN MULLICK: That
was your first

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.530
time on stage by yourself.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.640
CAINE MONROY: Yeah.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:12.780
NIRVAN MULLICK: I love
this picture.

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.320
This is Caine backstage,
making games out of the

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.780
pamphlets that they had.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:20.810
He did the same thing when
we were in Paris.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.110
This is a photo from--

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.620
this was Caine's Arcade for
the Day of Play last year,

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.450
right across the street.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:27.730
We had to expand for the day.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.370
We had over 800 folks
come out and play.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:31.840
Kids brought their
arcade games.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.480
Made new arcade games.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.820
Caine added the mayor
to his staff.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.720
And he got a cardboard key to
the city, which was superfine.

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:48.500
He got a billboard, too, which
was always one of his things

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.390
he asked his dad.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.760
Like, can I get a billboard
to start my arcade?

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.810
And his dad was like before,
it's a little

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.030
bit out of the budget.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:58.500
But people still come out to
play Caine's Arcade from all

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.160
over the world.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.382
How many customers do you
get when you open up?

00:12:02.382 --> 00:12:05.610
CAINE MONROY: Around
50 through 100.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:06.550
NIRVAN MULLICK: Wow.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.620
It's been a year and a half
since the flash mob, a year

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.070
since the film came out.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.250
When we went to Paris together,
Caine was like

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:15.820
finding cardboard tubes
in the alley.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:19.210
Just nonstop playing.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.240
On the way back, on the flight
back, I wanted to know.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.490
I was like, curiously,
Caine, what have you

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:25.360
learned from all this?

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:27.830
What have you learned?

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.970
So I asked him to write down a
few things that he learned.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:31.070
But we didn't have any paper.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.820
So he wrote down these
five lessons with the

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.460
Air France barf bag.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.680
So these are "Caine's 5 Lessons
on a Barf Bag." Will

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.215
you read them out
for us, Caine?

00:12:40.215 --> 00:12:42.106
CAINE MONROY: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:12:42.106 --> 00:12:44.462
NIRVAN MULLICK: This is "What
Did Caine Learn?"

00:12:44.462 --> 00:12:47.030
CAINE MONROY: "Be nice
to customers.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.590
Do a business that is fun.

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:51.750
Do not give up.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.210
Start with what you have.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:56.772
Use recycled stuff."

00:12:56.772 --> 00:12:57.630
NIRVAN MULLICK: Pretty
awesome.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:01.579
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:01.579 --> 00:13:03.990
NIRVAN MULLICK: First thing, I
love that he circled, "Do not

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.900
give up," with a squiggly
circle, and underlined it

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:06.670
three times.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:09.280
I think that's my
motto as well.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.890
This has become my business
plan for the Imagination

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.680
Foundation.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.930
I've learned a lot,
too, from this.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.980
It's been a life-changing
year for both of us.

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:22.320
The first thing I learned is it
doesn't take much to change

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.450
the life of a child.

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:25.610
Sometimes just giving a kid a
high five at just the right

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:28.980
moment, or stopping to play.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.850
Also, the next time you go buy
a door handle, you never know

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.390
what's going to happen.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:36.200
The smallest moments
can sometimes

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.830
have the biggest impact.

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:43.230
And finally, it was always
buy the Fun Pass.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.170
That was a fun moment.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:49.250
So that's our little
slides, and talks.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:53.240
And we invite you all to play,
through Caine's Arcade and the

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.100
Imagination Foundation, In our
next Cardboard Challenge.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.910
You guys can go and see ways
to bring this to your

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.180
community, and help us reach a
million kids in 70 countries

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.150
with creative play.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.500
Oh, and if you have
any questions.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.672
Yes?

00:14:08.672 --> 00:14:14.150
AUDIENCE: What did you spend
your $20,000 on?

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.040
CAINE MONROY: It's
for college.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.020
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.855
NIRVAN MULLICK: The question
was, what has Caine spent his

00:14:17.855 --> 00:14:19.170
money on that he's made?

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.440
But you made a fair amount
selling Fun Passes at your

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.235
arcade and stuff, right?

00:14:22.235 --> 00:14:22.785
CAINE MONROY: Yes.

00:14:22.785 --> 00:14:24.380
NIRVAN MULLICK: What do
you spend all that on?

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:25.420
CAINE MONROY: Prizes.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.490
NIRVAN MULLICK: For
the arcade?

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.010
Like investing back
in the business?

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.522
CAINE MONROY: Yes.

00:14:29.522 --> 00:14:31.670
NIRVAN MULLICK: But not
just in your business.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.400
Like you've been able
to buy a few things

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.360
for fun, too, right?

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.240
CAINE MONROY: Yes.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.790
NIRVAN MULLICK: What kind
of stuff do you buy?

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:37.710
CAINE MONROY: Nerf guns.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:38.590
NIRVAN MULLICK: Nerf guns.

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.900
NIRVAN MULLICK: Caine also
saved up for his first

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.240
go-kart, His first car.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.140
So he bought a go-kart.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.670
Your dad says you buy
a lot of LEGOs too.

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:48.870
CAINE MONROY: Yes.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.022
So LEGOs, Nerf gun,
and go-kart.

00:14:52.022 --> 00:14:52.410
Yeah?

00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:53.910
You want to ask a question
here on the mic?

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:55.550
AUDIENCE: No, it's
not a question.

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:56.942
It's something that
I [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:56.942 --> 00:15:00.066
NIRVAN MULLICK: Well, go
ahead and tell us.

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:02.880
AUDIENCE: I might go
to Caine's Arcade.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.060
NIRVAN MULLICK: That
would be awesome.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.290
AUDIENCE: I hope I can.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:06.720
NIRVAN MULLICK: Yeah.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.810
Caine, you want to let
people know when

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:08.750
you're open and stuff?

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.396
CAINE MONROY: This Saturday,
I am going to be open.

00:15:11.396 --> 00:15:13.170
NIRVAN MULLICK: What
are your hours?

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.475
CAINE MONROY: Let's
see, 9:00 to 3:00.

00:15:15.475 --> 00:15:17.220
NIRVAN MULLICK: 9:00 to 3:00.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.870
Caine sets his own schedule.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:24.310
And I post it on the
facebook/cainesaracade page.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:25.660
We pin the hours on the top.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.660
He's not always there.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.550
I actually asked his dad
recently, like how does Caine

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:29.185
set his hours?

00:15:29.185 --> 00:15:31.710
And he was like, Caine
has a wallet now.

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:33.880
And when his wallet is
empty, that's when

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.136
we open up the arcade.

00:15:35.136 --> 00:15:36.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.460
NIRVAN MULLICK: But he's also in
school during the week, and

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.900
stuff, so we have irregular
hours still.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:42.940
Who had the next question?

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.950
I saw somebody.

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:45.760
You?

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.930
Hi?

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:50.000
AUDIENCE: What time
do you open?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.486
CAINE MONROY: 9:00 o'clock.

00:15:52.486 --> 00:15:53.430
NIRVAN MULLICK: 9:00 am.

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:56.060
Sometimes 10:00 am.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.140
George, do you want
to come up, too?

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.930
Everybody, George Monroy,
Caine's dad.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:01.830
Come on up, George.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:02.490
Come on.

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:03.390
Come on.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.170
AUDIENCE: How did you
get the idea of

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.380
making a cardboard arcade?

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:12.326
CAINE MONROY: I wanted to
have my own arcade.

00:16:12.326 --> 00:16:13.000
AUDIENCE: What?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.925
CAINE MONROY: I always wanted
to own my own arcade.

00:16:14.925 --> 00:16:16.770
I just built one out
of cardboard.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.020
Cheaper.

00:16:20.589 --> 00:16:24.420
AUDIENCE: Well, where's
your store?

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.081
CAINE MONROY: Boyle Heights.

00:16:27.081 --> 00:16:28.780
NIRVAN MULLICK: Do you guys know
where Boyle Heights is?

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:29.780
AUDIENCE: No.

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.170
NIRVAN MULLICK: Well, you can
actually google Caine's

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:33.720
Arcade, and it will come up.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.870
You can see it on
Google Earth.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:36.360
And you can go down
to Street View.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.470
And you can actually see a
photo of Caine before the

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:40.790
movie came out.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:44.914
He's sitting there waiting for
customers on the Google Earth

00:16:44.914 --> 00:16:47.235
AUDIENCE: Do you like
your arcade?

00:16:47.235 --> 00:16:50.855
CAINE MONROY: Yes, very much.

00:16:50.855 --> 00:16:52.542
AUDIENCE: Where did you
get all the cardboard?

00:16:52.542 --> 00:16:54.200
CAINE MONROY: From my dad's
auto parts shop.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.660
They get from parts.

00:17:00.355 --> 00:17:03.376
AUDIENCE: How much money
do you earn each day?

00:17:03.376 --> 00:17:05.308
NIRVAN MULLICK: Don't
tell him.

00:17:05.308 --> 00:17:09.655
CAINE MONROY: Like $100.

00:17:09.655 --> 00:17:12.732
AUDIENCE: Do you plan to
expand the arcade?

00:17:12.732 --> 00:17:13.982
CAINE MONROY: Maybe.

00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:20.099
NIRVAN MULLICK: Caine's built a
couple new games since then.

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:21.960
My favorite, I actually made
a little movie about.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.540
It's called Ticket Grab.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.854
Where a neighbor was throwing
out a refrigerator box.

00:17:26.854 --> 00:17:28.520
Can you tell them a little
bit about Ticket Grab?

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.225
How that works?

00:17:29.225 --> 00:17:31.980
CAINE MONROY: Oh, I guess our
neighbor was getting a new

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.330
refrigerator.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:37.740
So they threw the box outside,
and I just got it to use it

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:38.830
for Ticket Grab.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:40.480
NIRVAN MULLICK: Yeah, but
Ticket Grab was kind of

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.230
elaborate, right?

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:41.860
CAINE MONROY: Yes.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.765
NIRVAN MULLICK: What did you buy
to make Ticket Grab work?

00:17:43.765 --> 00:17:48.230
CAINE MONROY: A leaf
blower, and tape.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:49.250
NIRVAN MULLICK: Yeah.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:51.470
Caine made a ticket grab
out of this cardboard

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.480
refrigerator box.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.430
And he's got a leaf blower
that he bought.

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:56.050
He's got all these little
prize tickets.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:57.030
And he puts them inside.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.390
Then you go inside the box, and
he turns it on outside.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:01.160
And tickets swirl around.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.270
He made a clear, little portal
door so you can see inside.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.820
He also made an emergency
exit.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.440
At the top where you
have to pull, he

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.440
wrote these rules down.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.170
The rules are like, scream,
yell, and have fun.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:18.060
The emergency exit was after
we'd gone to France, from the

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.250
safety descriptions.

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.460
He's been incorporating
a lot of his travels.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.260
Pretty cool.

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.270
AUDIENCE: Caine, what
do you want to study

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:27.742
when you grow up?

00:18:27.742 --> 00:18:29.290
CAINE MONROY: Engineer.

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:30.790
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.290
[CHUCKLES AND APPLAUSE]

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:37.330
NIRVAN MULLICK: Good answer
for this crowd, Caine.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.170
AUDIENCE: Could you tell
me some tips of

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.716
how to get the arcade?

00:18:41.716 --> 00:18:43.460
CAINE MONROY: Believe
in yourself.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.665
Don't stop.

00:18:45.665 --> 00:18:47.640
AUDIENCE: What's your favorite
game that you made?

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.430
CAINE MONROY: That
claw machine.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.730
It has a string on a hook, and
it has teddy bears inside.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.890
You try to hook it, and bring
it through the hole.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.610
NIRVAN MULLICK: Caine has
started building these on

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:01.400
commission, so you can talk to
him, and he can make you a--

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.700
He's made a couple cardboard
claw machines.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.550
I bought one.

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:07.290
The Exploratorium in San
Francisco bought the original

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:08.030
claw machine.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.830
They have in their permanent
collection.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:15.444
AUDIENCE: What's your newest
game that you've made?

00:19:15.444 --> 00:19:16.818
CAINE MONROY: Made?

00:19:16.818 --> 00:19:18.570
I think it's a soccer one.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.680
NIRVAN MULLICK: He's made some
games since then that aren't

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.887
even in the movie.

00:19:21.887 --> 00:19:22.482
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:19:22.482 --> 00:19:22.681
NIRVAN MULLICK: Yeah.

00:19:22.681 --> 00:19:25.135
CAINE MONROY: Air hockey.

00:19:25.135 --> 00:19:27.546
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:19:27.546 --> 00:19:28.770
NIRVAN MULLICK: You want to
describe how an air hockey

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:29.320
game works?

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.120
CAINE MONROY: Air
hockey works--

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.980
there's like this really
soft paper that

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.500
I use that's slippery.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:41.630
Then I just got a cardboard,
little like cardboard circle.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.340
Then I make two things,
like you hit it.

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.070
Then I made a hole.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:49.310
It goes down, then you get it
back, and keep on playing.

00:19:52.262 --> 00:19:56.198
NIRVAN MULLICK: There you go.

00:19:56.198 --> 00:19:57.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.715
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:00.715 --> 00:20:01.820
NIRVAN MULLICK: Can
you translate

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.040
that question at all?

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:03.890
AUDIENCE: I'm scared.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:05.980
NIRVAN MULLICK: Well,
thank you for that.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.100
I love that question.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.400
It might be my favorite
question.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:08.695
GEORGE MONROY: Caine's Arcade.

00:20:08.695 --> 00:20:10.146
NIRVAN MULLICK: Caine's
Arcade.

00:20:10.146 --> 00:20:11.966
CAINE MONROY: I said
thank you.

00:20:11.966 --> 00:20:15.772
NIRVAN MULLICK: Does anybody
else have any questions?

00:20:15.772 --> 00:20:17.902
AUDIENCE: What do you want to do
for a living after college?

00:20:17.902 --> 00:20:19.310
NIRVAN MULLICK: What you
want to do for a

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:22.392
living after college?

00:20:22.392 --> 00:20:25.280
CAINE MONROY: Own
my own arcade.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.466
NIRVAN MULLICK: Keep
the arcade going.

00:20:27.466 --> 00:20:28.610
Caine is still figuring
it out.

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:30.725
Like you've said sometimes,
maybe a game designer.

00:20:30.725 --> 00:20:31.832
CAINE MONROY: Yeah.

00:20:31.832 --> 00:20:33.082
NIRVAN MULLICK: Yeah.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.105
AUDIENCE: Who was your
first customer?

00:20:38.105 --> 00:20:39.436
CAINE MONROY: Nirvan.

00:20:39.436 --> 00:20:42.074
NIRVAN MULLICK: That's me.

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:43.670
AUDIENCE: What did you
go there to buy?

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:44.725
Play?

00:20:44.725 --> 00:20:47.280
NIRVAN MULLICK: I went there
to buy a door handle for my

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.500
'96 Corolla, a car.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.600
It had a broken door handle.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.870
I'd never been there before.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:56.440
And it was the only used auto
parts store on the block that

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.620
had a little swing hanging
from the tree.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.590
So I stopped there.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.092
And then I met Caine.

00:21:02.092 --> 00:21:02.904
CAINE MONROY: Yes.

00:21:02.904 --> 00:21:05.235
AUDIENCE: Did he have
a door handle?

00:21:05.235 --> 00:21:06.800
NIRVAN MULLICK: Yes, I bought
the door handle.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.135
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:08.135 --> 00:21:10.010
NIRVAN MULLICK: George later
actually put it in

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:11.776
for free for me.

00:21:11.776 --> 00:21:13.200
GEORGE MONROY: It was the
least I could do.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.432
NIRVAN MULLICK: It's my
magic door handle.

00:21:16.432 --> 00:21:20.040
AUDIENCE: How did
you feel after--

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:20.980
CAINE MONROY: The flash mob?

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:21.790
AUDIENCE: What?

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:22.585
CAINE MONROY: The flash mob?

00:21:22.585 --> 00:21:23.772
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:23.772 --> 00:21:26.630
CAINE MONROY: It felt pretty
cool, like everybody came.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.640
AUDIENCE: Are you going
to make another one?

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.740
CAINE MONROY: Arcade?

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.951
Maybe.

00:21:32.951 --> 00:21:36.700
AUDIENCE: How much does
a ticket for--

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:38.010
CAINE MONROY: Fun Pass?

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:41.772
AUDIENCE: A Fun Pass and
a four-try game, thing?

00:21:41.772 --> 00:21:44.160
CAINE MONROY: The Fun
Pass costs $2.00.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.090
Then the four-try, we
don't have anymore.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:48.160
NIRVAN MULLICK: You don't
have it anymore?

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:48.890
CAINE MONROY: It's
just one turn.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:49.530
NIRVAN MULLICK: So if somebody
gave you $1--

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:50.260
CAINE MONROY: No.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:51.600
NIRVAN MULLICK: They
can't play?

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.905
Nobody has ever not bought the
Fun Pass, that I know of.

00:21:54.905 --> 00:21:57.212
It's a really good upsell.

00:21:57.212 --> 00:21:59.630
AUDIENCE: How much does
one turn cost?

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.120
CAINE MONROY: One turn costs?

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.190
You got to get a Fun Pass.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:03.390
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:09.431
NIRVAN MULLICK: But then
you get 500 turns.

00:22:09.431 --> 00:22:11.645
AUDIENCE: Could you buy
a Fun Pass right now?

00:22:11.645 --> 00:22:12.570
CAINE MONROY: Yes.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:13.790
AUDIENCE: Can I buy one?

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:14.320
CAINE MONROY: Yes.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.246
Not soon.

00:22:15.246 --> 00:22:15.709
After.

00:22:15.709 --> 00:22:17.100
NIRVAN MULLICK: After this.

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:21.610
And we also have some Caine's
Arcade staff shirts, if you

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:23.821
guys want to join
Caine's staff.

00:22:23.821 --> 00:22:27.836
AUDIENCE: How old were you when
you started the arcade?

00:22:27.836 --> 00:22:30.070
CAINE MONROY: Like eight.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.172
End of eight.

00:22:33.172 --> 00:22:36.776
AUDIENCE: How long did it take
for the flash mob did die out?

00:22:40.584 --> 00:22:42.300
CAINE MONROY: The
sun went down.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.570
NIRVAN MULLICK: Caine was
working until what, like how

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:45.105
long, George?

00:22:45.105 --> 00:22:47.180
GEORGE MONROY: Until like
8:00 o'clock at night.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:47.760
NIRVAN MULLICK: Yeah.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.700
Caine worked until 8 o'clock at
night, and then after all

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.990
the customers left--

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.092
hang on one sec.

00:22:52.092 --> 00:22:54.402
AUDIENCE: How many
kids did you get?

00:22:54.402 --> 00:22:56.430
NIRVAN MULLICK: How many kids?

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:57.160
Like customers?

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.072
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:58.072 --> 00:22:59.460
NIRVAN MULLICK: How many
customers did you get?

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.920
AUDIENCE: Kid customers.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:01.970
NIRVAN MULLICK: Kid customers.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:03.170
CAINE MONROY: Like 50?

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:04.430
NIRVAN MULLICK: 50 that day?

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:06.590
We have a guest book
there that's full.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.400
You can come, when you come
play, and you can leave a

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.700
comment, and draw a picture.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.670
But after the flash mob,
I mean Caine was

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:14.900
there until 8 o'clock.

00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.120
The last customer.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.440
Then afterwards, he was cleaning
up the gains, putting

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.780
the toys away.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.830
I got that last interview with
him that was playing during

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:24.700
the credits kind of after
that had all died down.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:29.055
Got his first impression
of what it was like.

00:23:29.055 --> 00:23:32.350
AUDIENCE: How long did it take
you to build your arcade?

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:35.536
CAINE MONROY: Pretty
much like one year.

00:23:35.536 --> 00:23:39.190
NIRVAN MULLICK: Because you guys
see the pile of cardboard

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.830
boxes over there?

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:43.235
We're going to have a chance
to build some games.

00:23:43.235 --> 00:23:45.850
AUDIENCE: So you were
basically Caine's

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:46.950
best friend, right?

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:49.900
NIRVAN MULLICK: I was not
Caine's best friend.

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.150
We didn't know each other.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:54.820
I went to buy the door handle.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:56.520
I never met him before.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.690
He asked if I wanted to play,
and I asked how it worked.

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.280
And so I bought the Fun Pass.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.740
I have my first Fun Pass with
me, if any of you guys want to

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:04.740
see it afterwards.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:05.920
I'll be over--

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.280
It's right here.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.080
I keep it with me.

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.690
And every now and then,
Caine's like, oh,

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:10.420
you're out of turns.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:14.090
You got to give me another
$2 to keep charging it.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:15.233
CAINE MONROY: One month.

00:24:15.233 --> 00:24:15.980
NIRVAN MULLICK: Yeah.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.050
It expires after a month.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:20.150
AUDIENCE: When is Caine
going to grow up?

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:21.420
NIRVAN MULLICK: Caine, when
are you going to grow up?

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:22.791
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:22.791 --> 00:24:25.440
CAINE MONROY: Let's see.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:25.790
10 more years?

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:26.580
NIRVAN MULLICK: 10 more years.

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:28.730
CAINE MONROY: I'll
be 20 years old.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:31.270
NIRVAN MULLICK: Caine wrote an
essay about growing up, when

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.100
you turn 10, going
to double digits.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.600
We have it on the cainesarcade
blog.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.420
It's really cute.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.400
AUDIENCE: What's
double digits?

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.620
NIRVAN MULLICK: Double digits.

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.546
When you turn from nine.

00:24:39.546 --> 00:24:41.190
One through nine is single.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.360
Then when he became 10,
he's double digits.

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:49.295
Well, he just wrote down his
reflections on getting older.

00:24:49.295 --> 00:24:51.780
AUDIENCE: How do
get the shirts?

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:54.305
CAINE MONROY: I buy them.

00:24:54.305 --> 00:24:56.810
NIRVAN MULLICK: George, will you
tell the story when Caine

00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:00.220
went to make the shirt in Palm
Springs, and design it?

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:03.500
GEORGE MONROY: We were in the
store for like two hours while

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.440
he decided what color
he wanted, what he

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.710
wanted it to say.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:10.810
He wanted to put his
address on it.

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:13.140
And he spelled out 'staff'
because he didn't

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.030
know how to say it.

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:14.970
He didn't know what it meant.

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:17.800
He just knew that if you had
it on your shirt, that you

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:18.830
work there.

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:20.720
So he spelled it out
for the lady.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.520
And the lady put it on.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.690
She goes, oh, you want staff?

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:25.530
He goes, yeah, because
I work there.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:28.420
So then he wanted to put his
address on the back.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:29.560
And she goes, oh, no, no.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.370
You don't want to put your
address, son, because then

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:32.780
they'll know where you live.

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.090
He goes, I want them to
know where I live.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:38.390
So we ended up not putting
the address.

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:42.160
But as you can see, this shirt
is world famous now.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.385
I think Nirvan sold over
a million copies.

00:25:44.385 --> 00:25:46.320
NIRVAN MULLICK: I don't think
we sold a million shirts.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.870
But we do sell shirts
on the website, too.

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:52.705
Caine gets some money from the
shirts, and the foundation

00:25:52.705 --> 00:25:54.505
gets some money from
the shirts, too.

00:25:54.505 --> 00:25:57.220
Or you can go to his arcade
and get shirts there.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:58.365
He's got a couple of
different designs.

00:25:58.365 --> 00:26:00.970
AUDIENCE: Why doesn't
his shirt say

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:02.370
'manager' or something?

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:04.290
NIRVAN MULLICK: We actually
did make a shirt for Caine

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:08.520
that says 'boss.' So he has a
shirt that says 'boss.' But is

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.670
it dirty, or did
you outgrow it?

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:10.260
Or what's going on?

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:11.010
CAINE MONROY: Dirty.

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.170
NIRVAN MULLICK: Dirty.

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:15.970
His 'boss' shirt is dirty.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:16.660
The boss--

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.145
AUDIENCE: Where does Caine
want to go to college?

00:26:18.145 --> 00:26:19.970
NIRVAN MULLICK: Caine, the
question is, where you want to

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:21.740
go to college?

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:23.150
CAINE MONROY: I don't
know yet.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:24.090
NIRVAN MULLICK: He
doesn't know.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:25.630
He's gotten a couple offers.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:27.240
MIT wants him to go.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.480
USC wants him to go.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.240
UCLA wants him to go.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.060
He still has some time
to figure it out.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.800
TRISHA INGRAM: Thank you, guys,
so much for coming.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.690
NIRVAN MULLICK: Thank
you, guys.

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:38.590
CAINE MONROY: Thank you.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:39.190
NIRVAN MULLICK: Thanks
for having us.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:44.592
[APPLAUSE]
