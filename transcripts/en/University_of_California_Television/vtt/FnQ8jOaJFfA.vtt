00:00:20.564 --> 00:00:23.314
(relaxing music)

00:00:45.862 --> 00:00:47.870
- Welcome to A Conversation with History.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.080
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.110
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.283
Our guest today is Frances Dinkelspiel.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.270
She is an award winning
author and journalist.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.819
And is the 2016 Harvest Lecturer

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:05.270
Distinguished Women Lecture Series.

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.260
Her most recent book is

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.533
Tangled Vines: Greed, Murder, Obsession,

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.880
and an Arsonist in the
Vineyards of California.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.960
Her first book was Towers of Gold:

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.080
How One Jewish Immigrant
Named Isaias Hellman

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.840
Created California.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.440
In 2009, Frances co-founded
The Berkeleyside,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.424
a news site about Berkeley, California.

00:01:28.424 --> 00:01:32.310
Berkleyside has twice won the
best community news site award

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.810
from the Northern California

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.220
Society of Professional Journalists.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.200
In 2013, Frances and her
partner created Nosh,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.230
a site about the food
scene in the East Bay.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.090
Where were you born?

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.170
Welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.003
- Thank you.

00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:48.030
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.066
- I was born and raised in San Francisco.

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:52.480
- And, looking back, how do you think

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.040
your parents shaped your
thinking about the world?

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.380
- Well, my parents divorced
when I was very young.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.480
When I was two years old.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.130
And so, I was raised
primarily by my mother.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.260
I did see my father.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.940
But she was a single
parent for a long time

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.140
and I think what I really learned from her

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.650
was the importance of striking
out on your own in the world

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.900
and being strong and being
there for your family

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.340
and being independent.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.932
So, I think, in many ways,
she modeled that for me.

00:02:24.932 --> 00:02:29.932
And, you know, my father,
he was a lot of fun.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.750
He taught me to ski.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.610
He was into sports and that kind of thing.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.610
And so, I learned that from him.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.700
- And what were the examples
of what a woman could do

00:02:45.643 --> 00:02:48.030
that you got from your mother?

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.435
- Well, I remember, growing up,

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:53.220
what women could do
was mostly be teachers.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.190
And so, for a long time,
I thought I would be

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.489
a teacher growing up.

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.580
But my mother, at a certain point,

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.950
became a real estate agent.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.680
And I remember her
studying to be a realtor.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.100
She had to take some horrendous tests

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.020
that were very difficult.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.080
And she passed those tests.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.910
And she established her
realty business, I guess,

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.150
when I was maybe 10.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.650
And that was a real change,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.320
because she had been a stay
at home mom before that.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.880
And, after that, she wasn't home

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.970
when I came home after school.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.000
And that was a big adjustment,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.031
but I did sort of see her
make her way in the world.

00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:31.400
I think that that was the beginning.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.660
It was the beginning
of changes about women.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.330
And it started me on
the path to think that

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.730
women were not just there

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.380
to be married and pretty and smile.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.270
That we actually had an intellect that

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.340
should be explored.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.483
And, in fact, I always
hated it when I was young

00:03:47.483 --> 00:03:49.290
when people would call me cute.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.190
I always wanted them to call me smart.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.290
- And where did you do
your undergraduate work?

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.000
- At Stanford University.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.520
- But you said you went to
Berkeley for a semester.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.024
- I did go to Berkeley.

00:04:01.024 --> 00:04:04.050
I didn't love Stanford in the beginning.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.450
So, I took a class during
the summer here at Berkeley

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.570
and then I applied for
transfer to UC Berkeley

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.970
and I was accepted.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.420
But I decided not to go,

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.360
because Berkeley told me I had to retake

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.170
my freshman English class.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.880
The one I'd already taken
at Stanford for pass/fail.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.480
For whatever reason, that
was just too much for me.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.930
I thought, "I can't do that."

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.670
- And what did you major in at Stanford?

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:29.960
- [Frances] I majored in history.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.970
- In history.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.970
And so, history is something
that's in your portfolio.

00:04:36.495 --> 00:04:37.650
- That's true.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.580
So, I'm a fifth generation Californian.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.530
And so, I've always had...

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.160
Grown up with a lot of stories

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.500
about California and the family.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.190
And I guess I just had it in my blood.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.410
I just really loved finding out about

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.300
the world and different eras.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.430
And so, once I started studying history,

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.160
I sort of never stopped.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.250
- And your book about
your great-grandfather,

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:04.800
which we'll talk about in a minute,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.960
proves you could be a historian.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.240
- That's true.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.700
You know, there is a thriving economy

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.560
of independent historians in the world

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.950
who aren't affiliated with universities.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.300
And one of the reasons I sort of thought

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.805
I could go down that route was that

00:05:19.805 --> 00:05:23.430
I did some work for a
man named Henry Mayor

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.150
who was an independent
historian in Berkeley.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.510
And he had also been my English professor

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.930
at Urban High School.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.370
And Henry wrote a number
of books that did very well

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.790
and were very well respected.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.670
And he sort of showed me a path

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.100
that I could do this historical research

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.620
outside of a formal setting.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.040
- I like to ask my guests
what skills, temperament,

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.750
are required to be a journalist?

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.560
- Well, curiosity, of course.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.740
You have to like asking people questions.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.120
You have to want to get to
know the minutia of a subject,

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.760
at least for a day or two,

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.650
in order to be able to write
about it in confidence.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.720
You have to, I think, have
a certain amount of bravado.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.419
Because, often, as a journalist,

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.980
you have to go into situations that

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.280
aren't necessarily comfortable

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.720
and you have to ask questions.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.210
And you have to ask questions of people

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.980
who don't wanna answer questions.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.280
So, I think that's something
that comes with time.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.920
But you have to have the temperament

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.800
that you can allow
yourself to be disliked.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.650
I think that's a very important thing

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.440
a journalist has to have.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.190
- So, you moved into
doing an online newspaper.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.227
You founded Berkeleyside.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.710
Talk about how that came about.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.320
- So, I became a journalist
after I graduated from college.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.300
I worked in newspapers
in upstate New York.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.460
And I came out to California

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.300
and worked for the San Jose Mercury News

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.600
for about nine years.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.410
And it was a great job.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:53.944
You know, I really enjoyed it.

00:06:53.944 --> 00:06:57.970
I did leave the paper to
work on my first book,

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.360
Towers of Gold.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.670
And, once I'd finished that book,

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.360
I was looking to do some more freelancing.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.980
I'd done freelancing along the way

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.610
for People Magazine, New York Times,

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.400
lots of different publications.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.080
And that was around 2006.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.030
A time when newspapers in California

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:20.300
were really cutting back their staffs.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.807
And the Chronicle went from having

00:07:21.807 --> 00:07:24.820
300 reporters to 100 reporters.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.970
And the first thing that was
decimated was local news.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.990
And some friends and I were talking about

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.870
the fact that there wasn't a lot of news

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.950
and there was not a lot of
local news in Berkeley anymore.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.840
There was The Daily Cal
and then The Daily Planet,

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.610
but The Daily Planet was having
some financial difficulties.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.110
So, we thought, "Oh, let's
just start a local site."

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.158
It was sort of done on a whim.

00:07:48.158 --> 00:07:52.310
And we were really surprised
at the reaction the site got.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:57.310
People were very excited to
have a neutral news organization

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.560
writing about Berkeley.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.663
And we just found that our
readership kept building.

00:08:03.321 --> 00:08:06.520
And so, we sort of turned
this casual endeavor

00:08:07.376 --> 00:08:09.160
into a serious journalistic enterprise.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.310
- And how many views do you get a month?

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.040
- Well, you know, it really depends.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.320
I mean, sometimes we can go

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.750
up to 300,000 unique visitors a month

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.530
when we have something really exceptional.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:23.870
Some video or something.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.284
But, right around now,
we're probably between

00:08:25.284 --> 00:08:29.930
180,000 to 200,000
unique visitors a month.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:31.320
And please remember that

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.290
the population of Berkeley is 112,000.

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:36.850
So, we draw from around the region.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:38.110
Not just Berkeley.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.500
- And Berkeley is a unique place

00:08:41.566 --> 00:08:43.290
to be doing this sort of thing, isn't it?

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:44.710
- It is a unique place.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.330
I mean, there's so much
news in Berkeley that

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.020
we can't keep up with our small staff.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.060
And what makes Berkeley so interesting

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.830
is the university's here.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:58.120
So, you have world class
intellectuals and professors

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.450
who are doing really interesting research.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.657
You have the legacy of the '60s,

00:09:02.657 --> 00:09:06.750
which transformed Berkeley from being

00:09:08.628 --> 00:09:10.071
a more traditional Republican town

00:09:10.071 --> 00:09:12.070
into a very leftist, Democratic city.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.920
And, as a result of that,
people are very passionate about

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.810
a lot of issues.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:19.010
And so, there's no such thing
as a small issue in Berkeley.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:22.410
Almost every issue is a big issue.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.640
And so, there's a lot of
good stuff to write about.

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.230
- So, what is the business model?

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:32.230
- So, the business model is
we are a for profit news site.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:38.330
Though take those words
with a grain of salt.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.610
We have a number of
different revenue streams.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.470
We sell advertising on our site.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.130
And we sell advertising

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:49.097
in our email newsletters that go out.

00:09:49.097 --> 00:09:51.590
We have a very strong membership base.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.130
People in Berkeley who are excited about

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.989
having a local news source sign up

00:09:56.989 --> 00:09:58.234
to donate to our site.

00:09:58.234 --> 00:10:01.023
$5 a month, $25 a month.

00:10:02.248 --> 00:10:03.081
One time donation.

00:10:03.081 --> 00:10:05.370
And that's a growing part of our business.

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:09.180
And the other thing we do, we do events.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.140
In the fall, we have an event called

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.880
Uncharted: The Berkeley Festival of Ideas.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.380
It's an ideas festival.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:18.590
Really the only one in the Bay Area.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.842
And, over two days, we bring
really extraordinary thinkers

00:10:21.842 --> 00:10:24.890
in from around the country to talk about

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.993
what we might term dangerous
ideas or unusual ideas.

00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:33.050
And usually it's on a one on one format

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.930
or someone gets up and
does a small performance.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.720
It's not a conference, per se,

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.330
but it's more like a festival.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:43.090
And so, we have about 400
attendees at Uncharted

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:44.840
and that seems to be growing every year.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.190
So, that's another source
of revenue for Berkeley.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.480
- And you also cover the news, right?

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.210
In other words, I notice
that you have links

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:58.260
to announcements that
have come out in the news.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.570
- Yes, so, every day,
we do something called

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.280
The Berkeley Wire, which is
an aggregation of stories

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.030
from around the web about Berkeley.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.430
And there are a lot of
stories about Berkeley,

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:13.140
like, for example, Chancellor
Dirks announced yesterday that

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:17.050
the university's facing $150
million deficit this year.

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.292
That's a story we linked to.

00:11:19.292 --> 00:11:21.127
So, we just try to make it that

00:11:21.127 --> 00:11:23.740
Berkeleyside is a one stop shop

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.940
for people who wanna
know about Berkeley news.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.827
Not only the news that we
cover with our reporters,

00:11:28.827 --> 00:11:30.470
the pictures that we have,

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.270
but also what other people are doing.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:37.100
- And tell me about the opportunities that

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.560
online newspapers offer.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.940
One of the things you said.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.260
A lot of your friends were
being fired, basically,

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:50.260
as the employment in traditional
newspapers was declining.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:52.690
- Well, it's very expensive

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:56.310
to produce news printed on paper.

00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:00.110
And, as you may know,
the entire news business

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:04.170
is sort of imploding
and struggling to find

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.150
a business model that will work.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.330
A number of newspapers
have gone to online only

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.410
or online two or three days a week

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.439
and delivery just a few days a week.

00:12:13.439 --> 00:12:18.290
So, going online gives
you certain opportunities.

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:21.050
First of all, it doesn't
really cost much to produce it.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:24.320
And, secondly, it can be
seen anywhere in the world.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.580
You don't have to hold a
physical copy of Berkeleyside

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.060
to know what's going on.

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:34.060
So, people who are in Asia or
in France or in South America.

00:12:34.437 --> 00:12:37.050
There are Berkeley residents
all around the world.

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:40.480
And we have readers who come from all over

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.100
to read the news about Berkeley.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.920
And that's the advantage of online.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.210
And it's also easy to
make things go viral,

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.390
because people put it
on Facebook or Twitter

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.760
and they spread the word online.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.097
Which is not easy to do
with a paper product.

00:12:54.097 --> 00:12:58.620
- So, this is the way
newspapers are gonna go.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:03.620
Especially if they're
based in a local community.

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:05.580
Is that fair to say?

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.900
In other words...

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:10.214
- Well, the trend is
certainly in that direction.

00:13:10.214 --> 00:13:12.070
You know, I haven't...

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.830
I don't see the San Francisco
Chronicle announcing

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.960
it's gonna cut its print edition.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.570
So, I think we have a couple more years

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.050
before we see how things play out.

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.000
Certainly, the percentage of money that

00:13:25.109 --> 00:13:26.800
newspapers are bringing in
through their advertising

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.116
in their print product
has dropped precipitously.

00:13:30.116 --> 00:13:32.110
Pushing people to the web.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:36.130
But I think there will always
be some large newspapers,

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:39.000
like The New York Times, The LA Times,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.700
maybe The Washington
Post and The Chronicle,

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.360
that will have a print edition.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.180
But probably, eventually, there will be

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.570
very few print newspapers in the US.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:50.290
- And what is the biggest constraint

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.630
in doing a newspaper like this?

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.960
What are the main obstacles?

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.352
Some of which you didn't anticipate.

00:13:58.352 --> 00:14:02.310
- Well, before I answer that question,

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:03.920
I think one of the main drawbacks

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:06.930
of an online publication only is that

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.800
you don't have serendipity.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.670
I know that...

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.190
I often ready my New
York Times on my phone.

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:13.960
But I also get it delivered at home.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.820
And, when you open the paper,

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.240
you sometimes are drawn to articles that

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.890
you might not otherwise be drawn to

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.961
when you're looking at them online.

00:14:22.961 --> 00:14:27.961
So, that is one casualty of online.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.280
What are the drawbacks?

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.730
It's very, very difficult to make

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:35.793
a viable business with the news.

00:14:35.793 --> 00:14:40.060
It's, you know, we have
not yet mastered it.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:45.060
We still need more revenue
in order to really succeed.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.380
I mean, the jury's still
out if we will be here

00:14:49.915 --> 00:14:50.998
10 years from now.

00:14:50.998 --> 00:14:52.480
And a lot of the biggest
online publications,

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.170
like Buzzfeed or VOXX,
they're all financed

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.460
with venture capital money.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.900
And, even though they get lots of readers

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.990
and they are getting advertisers,

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:04.830
they're still not really
paying their own way.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:07.313
They're financed with outside money.

00:15:09.355 --> 00:15:10.236
- And do you have advertisers?

00:15:10.236 --> 00:15:11.069
- Yes, we have advertisers.

00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:11.902
Lots of advertisers.

00:15:11.902 --> 00:15:13.590
- Tess us about Nosh.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:17.020
- So, Nosh is a very popular product.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.350
You know that the Bay
Area is a foodie haven.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:24.720
And the East Bay is a mecca for foodies.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.910
And Nosh covers the food
scene and the wine scene.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:30.240
And we launched it a couple of years ago.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.770
And it's become very,
very popular, I think,

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.490
in part because it's mostly happy news.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:39.973
I mean, it's mostly sensory
news and things like that.

00:15:40.845 --> 00:15:42.500
Although I do a lot of reporting on wine

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.260
and there's been a lot
of local wine crime that

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.420
I've reported for Nosh.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.940
So, there is, of course,
some hard reporting

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:51.090
going on in Nosh, as well.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:53.130
- [Harry] And do you
recommend restaurants or...

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:57.640
- You know, we don't do
traditional restaurant reviews

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.680
like The Chronicle does.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.540
But we introduce restaurants

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.430
and we show pictures of their food

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.310
and we talk about the restaurants.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.860
So, when people are looking
for new places to eat,

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.633
they can come to Nosh to find them.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:15.160
- So, let's now talk about your
first book, Towers of Gold.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.300
This book is about your great-grandfather.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:24.610
Tell us about how the book came about,

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:29.610
'cause curiosity led you
to the California Library

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.810
and you were expecting to
find a couple of letters.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:34.400
But you found a lot more.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:37.620
- So, I took a leave of
absence from The Mercury News

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.250
because I wanted to try
some other kind of writing.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.250
I thought I would do
some first person essays.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.873
And, as I was doing those essays,

00:16:47.179 --> 00:16:49.023
I thought, "Well, I'll just
stick a little family history

00:16:49.023 --> 00:16:51.590
in these essays and it'll
make them more interesting."

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:55.250
So, I knew that my
great-great-grandfather Isaias Hellman,

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:58.360
his papers were at the
California Historical Society.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.430
So, I thought I'd go down
there for an afternoon

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:01.520
and sort of look through them

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.520
and use the information I
gleaned for my personal essays.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:10.250
But, when I got to the
California Historical Society

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:14.515
and asked to see the
Isaias Hellman papers,

00:17:14.515 --> 00:17:16.723
the archivist said, "Sure,

00:17:18.003 --> 00:17:18.836
but which box would you like to see?"

00:17:18.836 --> 00:17:20.400
And I said, "What do you mean?"

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:24.440
And she said, "Well, we have
40 boxes of Hellman documents."

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.930
So, that was a very big surprise to me.

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:31.440
And I started combing
through these documents.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.900
And I started noticing that

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:34.600
there were all these letters from

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.083
these iconic California figures,

00:17:38.854 --> 00:17:42.415
like Henry Huntington, Collis
Huntington, Levi Strauss.

00:17:42.415 --> 00:17:43.248
And these were people who were

00:17:43.248 --> 00:17:46.150
Isaias Hellman's friends
and business partners.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.757
And the more I looked at these documents,

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.360
I realized that there was

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.510
a great untold story in those boxes

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.203
about the rise of California from

00:17:58.203 --> 00:18:01.623
a frontier economy to a modern economy.

00:18:02.576 --> 00:18:04.230
And I decided, "Well, maybe I should

00:18:06.305 --> 00:18:07.138
write a book about Isaias
Hellman and tell that story."

00:18:08.146 --> 00:18:10.780
- So, curiosity led you to the library.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.280
But then talk about your emotions

00:18:14.643 --> 00:18:19.643
when you realized the
kind of boxes upon boxes

00:18:20.374 --> 00:18:24.403
of his work were available.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.860
- Well, I think writers
choose a subject always

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.880
and there's some
psychological reasons for it.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.270
Maybe the writer's not
necessarily aware of it

00:18:35.395 --> 00:18:36.610
when they choose that subject.

00:18:36.610 --> 00:18:38.757
And I think, for myself,

00:18:38.757 --> 00:18:41.600
I explained my parents'
divorce when I was two.

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.420
And my father died when I was 16.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.620
And I didn't really
know him all that well.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.370
And, although I knew
his side of the family,

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:50.820
I didn't know them well.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.890
And so, I do believe I was on some quest

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:57.773
to sort of reunite with the
Hellman side of my family.

00:18:59.703 --> 00:19:01.560
And so, by going through these boxes

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.080
and finding out about this history,

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:08.340
it led me to sort of learn
more about this family

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.770
that I was a part of but I
was really estranged from.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:13.750
And it was a great journey,

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:18.750
because Isaias Hellman
came to California in 1859

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.233
a penniless Jew from Bavaria.

00:19:23.225 --> 00:19:24.387
He'd been...

00:19:24.387 --> 00:19:26.910
Jews were not citizens
in Germany at that time.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:30.250
He came to California,
which was not a country

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:32.880
that had a strict hierarchy.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.560
People had come here to get rich off gold.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.050
It wasn't like the east coast.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.670
And Hellman came to
California, moved to LA,

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.270
and he eventually rose to become

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:45.230
one of the most prominent
financiers and bankers

00:19:46.087 --> 00:19:46.920
on the Pacific coast.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.823
Eventually owning Wells Fargo
Bank and other institutions.

00:19:50.983 --> 00:19:54.530
And so, that was a pretty
amazing Horatio Alger story.

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:57.190
- And what was in these boxes?

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:59.980
In other words, was it the chronology

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.415
of his whole business career?

00:20:02.415 --> 00:20:05.040
- Well, not everything was in the boxes.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.980
But a lot of things were in the boxes.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.580
Like, in the first box,
there was a report card

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.120
of his from Germany in the 1850s.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.363
And letters from his brothers.

00:20:15.363 --> 00:20:17.790
Letters from his relatives.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.760
There were business
letters, as I described.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.960
There were prospectuses for bond deals.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:28.630
There were lists of his
wife's shopping expeditions,

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:29.570
which was great.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.623
The clothes she bought
and things like that.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:34.610
He was a packrat.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:35.950
So, he even saved stuff like

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.744
when he had a receipt
from buying a newspaper.

00:20:38.744 --> 00:20:41.660
That was tucked in his papers.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.430
And there were just some
really, really great surprises.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.130
I came upon this folder.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.517
And there were all these telegrams about

00:20:48.517 --> 00:20:52.560
"Thank God the assassin's
bullet went astray.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.270
We're so happy you're alive."

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:55.299
And all this stuff.

00:20:55.299 --> 00:20:57.210
I didn't know what that was.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:59.870
And I had to do some research

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.560
looking through old
newspapers to find out that

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.500
someone had tried to
assassinate Isaias Hellman

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:08.330
in the 1890s in San Francisco.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:10.810
And that was a story
that had never made it

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:12.110
down through the generations.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:15.610
But the clue was in those papers.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.170
- And we have to say here...

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:23.170
I wanna separate what made
him a successful businessman,

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.420
in your view.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.750
The skills that he had
developed in Germany

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.763
or that he developed over time here?

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:33.820
- That's a good question.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.720
I mean, it's impossible,
really, for me to know.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.430
I think he was a very,
very, very smart man.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.750
I think he came to California

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:45.500
and he must have carried the burden

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.990
of generations of Jews before him

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.420
who had not been allowed
to work in the professions

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:51.530
that they wanted.

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:53.950
Jews were very limited
in what they could do.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:57.181
His uncle was a cattle dealer.

00:21:57.181 --> 00:21:58.014
His father was a weaver.

00:21:58.014 --> 00:22:00.120
And, suddenly, he arrived
in the United States.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.272
He had some bookkeeping training.

00:22:02.272 --> 00:22:06.810
And he went to work in a dry
goods store of his cousin's.

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:10.820
And he apparently immediately
improved their business.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.550
So, I think he had an
innate business sense.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:16.350
And he just sort of
followed that instinct.

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:20.940
He started to buy land
in southern California.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.040
And he opened his own store.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.730
And it was almost by accident
that he opened a bank.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.610
And, of course, the bank was really

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:31.905
his first major accomplishment
as a businessman.

00:22:31.905 --> 00:22:34.890
And so, I think he...

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:37.510
Banks were illegal in
California for a very long time,

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.580
because the lawmakers thought California

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.660
could be run on gold or coin.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.290
And so, he opened a bank
when it was illegal.

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:47.247
And he had to feel his way

00:22:47.247 --> 00:22:49.600
how to make that bank succeed.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.570
And I think he taught himself a lot

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:55.060
about finance along the way.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:23:00.060
- And, when we compare him,
he's a venture capitalist,

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.313
it sounds like.

00:23:01.313 --> 00:23:02.830
Is that fair?

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:03.718
- A little bit.

00:23:03.718 --> 00:23:05.975
Both a banker and a venture capitalist.

00:23:05.975 --> 00:23:09.690
- In an environment where...

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:11.300
California hadn't developed yet.

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.570
So, he was also a visionary.

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:17.730
In other words, he, having
accumulated money in banking,

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:21.650
he saw what would be worth investing in.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:22.483
- Exactly.

00:23:22.483 --> 00:23:26.363
Yes, so he invested in the
water company in Los Angeles.

00:23:27.432 --> 00:23:31.713
Everybody remembers, you
know, Chinatown the movie.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.280
Well, Isaias Hellman, until 1902,

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.490
owned the majority of the stock

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.470
in the Los Angeles Water Company.

00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:42.550
And he eventually agreed to sell it to LA.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.510
He was very involved in laying
down trolley rails in LA

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:48.970
and got involved in power and land.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:50.359
He was a UC regent.

00:23:50.359 --> 00:23:54.690
But, yeah, California was a frontier.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:56.160
I mean, when he arrived,

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.140
there was no scheduled stagecoach service

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.860
between Los Angeles and San Francisco.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:03.960
There was no train.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.960
There was no real telegraph line.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.530
And so, a lot of the people
who came to California

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:12.100
in the 1850s got in on the ground floor

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:16.060
of investing in a lot of
these infrastructure projects.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.860
You know, a lot of
people went bust from it.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.420
Isaias Hellman did not.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.350
Which I think suggests he was really

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:23.890
an extraordinary businessman.

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:25.386
But there was tremendous opportunity

00:24:25.386 --> 00:24:27.640
in California at that time.

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.430
- And, by investing in all these things,

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:33.700
he really shaped the future of California

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.150
whether he stayed in a business or not.

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:37.860
- Well, yes, absolutely.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.687
I mean, he played a very big role

00:24:39.687 --> 00:24:42.563
in a large number of businesses.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:47.040
And, as he became a
bigger and bigger banker,

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.350
he started something called

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:52.280
The Farmers and Merchants
Bank in Los Angeles in 1871,

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.630
which was the first successful bank in LA.

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:57.000
And it brought capital to the region.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Also, California was starved
for large capital for building.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.550
So, he bought capital.

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.690
He eventually bought something
called the Nevada Bank,

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:09.410
which he merged with Wells Fargo Bank.

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:13.130
And he was able to help people raise money

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:16.040
to do a lot of projects around the state.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.430
- And I want to talk about his identity

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:24.270
as a German, an American, and a Jew.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:28.330
Because he was very committed, it seems,

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.830
to his American identity.

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.747
Talk a little about that.

00:25:32.747 --> 00:25:36.120
- Yes, he was very committed
to being an American.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.630
I think, as I mentioned earlier, America,

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.230
and California in particular,
had been really good to him.

00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:43.390
He flourished here.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:46.130
However, he was also very Jewish.

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:47.139
He was involved in building

00:25:47.139 --> 00:25:49.660
the first synagogue in Los Angeles.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:52.030
He was involved in the
synagogue up in San Francisco

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:55.756
when he eventually moved up here in 1890.

00:25:55.756 --> 00:26:00.756
And where his identity as
being an American and a Jew

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:05.930
sort of started to conflict
came around World War I.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:10.720
Because there was, of course,

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.910
this whole rise of the Zionist movement.

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:15.150
And there was this...

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:18.500
After Russia had killed so many Jews

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:22.490
during the pogroms of the
early part of the 20th century,

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:25.560
there was a real push to create a homeland

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:29.930
for Jews in what was then Palestine.

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.850
And Isaias Hellman felt
very conflicted about that

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:34.340
for a couple reasons.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.920
Number one, he felt Russia and Poland

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:40.540
and all those countries should make Jews

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:43.390
citizens of those countries
and give them full rights,

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:44.980
which they did not have.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:49.980
Or he felt that Jews in
America had great opportunity.

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:56.730
He was very concerned that,

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:59.220
if you created a state of Israel,

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.220
not only would you be pushing
out the Arab population,

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.669
but then Jews would be shunted aside.

00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:09.200
They would be told to go to
Israel as opposed to America.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.850
And he felt that America
was the greatest country

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:17.160
and that he was an American first.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.060
And that that was really important.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.350
And that other Jews should
have that opportunity.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:24.210
- As somebody who is a family member,

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:26.380
but a researcher and a journalist,

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.440
what do you see is his greatest success

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.430
in a very successful career?

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:32.640
- That's a really good question.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.770
Well, I do think the
fact that he was Jewish

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:36.760
and he made such a large contribution

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.180
to the development of California

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.977
is probably his most significant legacy.

00:27:40.977 --> 00:27:43.110
But, clearly, Wells Fargo Bank

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:47.300
is his masterpiece or whatever.

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:52.060
He purchased the bank in 1905

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:53.730
at a time when the banking business

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:56.240
was sort of a minor part of Wells Fargo.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.110
It had been primarily an express
business up to that time.

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:03.420
And he helped turn it around and make it

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.150
a really strong bank.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.060
And he died in 1920.

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.520
But, after that, the bank merged with

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.560
hundreds of banks around the country.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:15.550
And, now, it's one of the dominant banks

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:16.680
in the United States.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.410
And, clearly, that wasn't
Isaias Hellman's doing.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:21.637
But he certainly laid
the foundation for that.

00:28:21.637 --> 00:28:24.400
- You know, your second books is called

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:29.400
Tangled Vines with a secondary title,

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:33.200
Greed, Murder, Obsession and an Arsonist

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.110
in the Vineyards of California.

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:37.850
So, what led you to this book?

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:39.177
It seems like there was a connection,

00:28:39.177 --> 00:28:43.860
because your great-grandfather
had invested in wine.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:44.693
- Right.

00:28:44.693 --> 00:28:45.730
So, there was a connection.

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:48.460
So, that was one of the interesting things

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.240
I found out when I researched
Isaias Hellman's life.

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:56.560
That he had bought a
controlling interest in 1901

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:59.280
in something called the
California Wine Association.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:01.350
And I didn't really know what that was.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:05.460
And it turns out that the
California Wine Association

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.500
was a monopoly that eventually controlled

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:13.195
80% of the production and
distribution of wine in California

00:29:13.195 --> 00:29:15.100
until Prohibition.

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:18.500
It was this enormous
operation that had vineyards

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.937
everywhere from southern California

00:29:20.937 --> 00:29:23.100
to Napa and Sonoma.

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.930
It had huge wine processing
facilities around the state.

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:30.920
And it sort of had a lock on
selling wine around the world.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:35.920
And I didn't find a lot of books out

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.930
about the California Wine Association.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:40.520
So, I always had it in my mind that

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.720
I might want to write more about that.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:47.067
And then, in 2009, I was
freelancing for The New York Times

00:29:47.067 --> 00:29:52.067
and I pitched a story about
a trial that was coming up

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:54.380
about a man named Mark Anderson

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.850
who had been charged with setting a fire

00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:59.900
in a wine warehouse in Vallejo

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.700
that destroyed four and a
half million bottles of wine

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.603
worth a quarter of a billion dollars.

00:30:05.603 --> 00:30:07.650
Making it the largest wine involving...

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:08.483
Excuse me.

00:30:08.483 --> 00:30:10.990
The largest crime
involving wine in history.

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:15.990
And, while doing that, I
remembered that I had a cousin

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.160
who had put a bunch of
wine of Isaias Hellman's

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.400
in that warehouse.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.350
And that wine had burned up.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:26.813
And that wine had been made in
1875 in southern California.

00:30:28.185 --> 00:30:29.420
And I had known about it,

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:31.123
but I hadn't really thought about it.

00:30:31.123 --> 00:30:35.290
So, I wrote that story
for The New York Times

00:30:36.292 --> 00:30:38.560
and then I just started
to think harder about

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:42.770
what was lost when all that 130 year port

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:45.503
in Angelica was burned up.

00:30:46.717 --> 00:30:47.718
Did it matter?

00:30:47.718 --> 00:30:48.551
Wine is meant to consume.

00:30:48.551 --> 00:30:52.510
Does it matter if someone
drinks it or a fire destroys it?

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:55.090
And that sort of got me on the trail

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:57.630
to writing a story about the crime

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:00.980
and about this vineyard that
these bottles came from.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.810
And the vineyard, as it turns out,

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:05.920
tells, really, the story of
the history of California

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:08.930
sort of in a nutshell, as well.

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:12.865
- And what is it about wine?

00:31:12.865 --> 00:31:16.393
You were obviously fascinated
for personal reasons.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:21.300
But, throughout history,
wine fascinates everybody.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.000
It's elixir.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.680
But something else is going
on, as your book proves.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:26.882
- Right.

00:31:26.882 --> 00:31:29.300
Yeah, so that was also a
question I wanted to explore.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.280
Why do people like wine so much?

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:34.000
I mean, if you think about
it, the Greeks and the Romans

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.730
both had wine gods.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:39.763
People don't worship milk
the same way or even water.

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:45.930
And so, I tried to ask
a lot of people about

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:48.150
why they liked wine so much.

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:51.130
It turns out, I think,
that people like wine

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:54.540
because it makes them feel good.

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.704
You drink it, you get
a little intoxicated.

00:31:56.704 --> 00:31:59.850
Or you just get a nice, warm glow.

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:03.240
And it sort of breaks
down sort of inhibitions.

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:06.020
And so, people are able to come together

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:06.900
when they drink wine

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.710
and they're able to connect in a way that

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:10.710
they might not otherwise connect.

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:14.840
And I think that this
is really a major reason

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.730
why people are so fascinated by wine.

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:21.190
And, of course, it can be an
intellectual endeavor, as well.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:25.040
Because wine has its own history.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.122
It has its own characteristics.

00:32:28.122 --> 00:32:33.122
You know, one wine made from
grapes grown on one vineyard

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:37.380
may taste very different from

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.200
grapes made from a vineyard 10 miles away.

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:43.192
You open a bottle of wine
at the beginning of dinner.

00:32:43.192 --> 00:32:46.320
That wine might taste
different at the end of dinner

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.760
as oxygen sort of pervades the wine.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:53.890
So, it's a beverage that has

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:55.420
a lot of different components to it.

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.600
It's almost like it has a personality.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.400
And I think that's why people
are so interested in it.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:05.400
- And also it seems like
you're suggesting, implicitly,

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:11.870
that it reflects, wine reflects

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:17.430
some of mankind's worst characteristics.

00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:20.440
But also some of its most
noble characteristics.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.810
Because vineyards are often
owned by small families.

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:27.640
Small business owned by a family.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:31.360
And so, talk a little about that.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.600
Because there's the good and the bad.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.350
And it seems to attract
quite a number of scoundrels.

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:38.750
- You're absolutely right.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:40.730
I mean, I think when we
think of the wine business,

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:42.800
particularly living in the Bay Area,

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.040
we think about the bucolic Napa Valley

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.313
with its undulating hills of grape vine

00:33:47.313 --> 00:33:49.740
and its beautiful blue skies.

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.740
And the great wine and the great food

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:52.710
you can have up there.

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:54.390
And the Napa Valley lifestyle,

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:57.720
which is something everybody can enjoy.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.010
But, as it turns out, there
is a very dark side to wine.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:05.360
Almost beginning from its
origins in California.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.000
The first winemaker was
Father Junipero Serra.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.140
A Franciscan missionary who
created the mission system.

00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:16.650
And he imported wine cuttings
from Baja California.

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:21.650
And, to grow wine, he
used the Native Americans

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:25.370
who had converted to
Christianity to make that wine.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.699
And, of course, those Native Americans,

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:30.610
once they got in the mission
system, they couldn't leave.

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:34.020
And, in many ways, they were
like indentured servants.

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.710
And that relationship between wine making

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:40.120
and indentured servitude
for the Native Americans

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:43.261
really continued through the 1870s.

00:34:43.261 --> 00:34:46.770
The Californians treated
the Native Americans badly.

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:50.500
And the very first law passed
by the California Legislature

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:54.470
in 1850 was nicknamed
the Indian Indenture Act.

00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:57.600
And it allowed white people to identify

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.087
a Native American as drunk or indolent,

00:35:00.087 --> 00:35:04.670
at which point a sheriff could
arrest that Native American

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:05.890
and fine him.

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:08.100
And, generally, the Indians didn't have

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:09.550
money to pay the fines.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:12.484
And so, the sheriff would then auction off

00:35:12.484 --> 00:35:16.090
that Indian's labor to the highest bidder

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:19.320
at increments of a week at a time.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.680
And the sheriff would
pocket a percentage of that.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.450
And the municipalities, like Los Angeles,

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:26.770
would pocket the rest of it.

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:29.961
And so, the early history
of wine in California

00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:34.320
really was based on sort of slave labor.

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.700
And I think this is something that

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.170
people don't really know.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.003
I mean, I didn't know.

00:35:38.003 --> 00:35:39.810
And I had no idea about it.

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:44.810
And it is one of the ugly
aspects to wine history.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:47.510
But there are other ones, too.

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:48.510
Greed.

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:51.640
The subtitle of my book has
greed and murder in there

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:55.810
because there's a lot of greed
and murder in the vineyards.

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:56.900
- And, interestingly enough,

00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:01.097
it's not just individuals whose sordidness

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:07.470
is reflected in the wine this
gentleman who burned down

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:10.790
the warehouse where everybody's wine was,

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:13.420
which was a real tragedy for people

00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:16.660
who have wine there for many reasons.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:21.660
But you tell the story of
how the bubble before 2008

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:26.510
came to the wine industry.

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:30.410
And the exorbitant prices that

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:32.560
were being paid for a bottle of wine

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:35.660
in the neighborhood of 200,000 plus.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:38.690
But, in the end, the wines were faked.

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:41.815
So, it's a product which

00:36:41.815 --> 00:36:46.400
even the master class can be taken in

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.880
by what they're buying.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.988
So, there's kind of a
prestige in owning the wine

00:36:51.988 --> 00:36:54.080
that may be worthless,

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:58.270
but I'm willing to pay
200,000 for a bottle.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:01.640
- So, like any product,
when something is rare

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.540
and people want it and
people are willing to pay

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.461
very high prices for it.

00:37:06.461 --> 00:37:09.340
So, probably the most
coveted wines in the world

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:10.990
are French wines.

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:15.540
French Burgundy is very
desired, as is French Bordeaux.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:20.540
And, in 2008, sort of the
auction world changed,

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:25.120
because Hong Kong lowered the taxes

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.490
it charged on importing wine.

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:30.170
And this sort of created a frenzy in China

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:34.550
for people who wanted to buy
this very expensive wine.

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:37.140
And they started bidding crazy prices

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.250
at auctions around the world.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:41.980
And there was a man named Rudy Kurniawan

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:45.970
who was an Indonesian man
living in southern California

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:48.118
who sort of took advantage of this.

00:37:48.118 --> 00:37:51.820
He had a really sophisticated palate.

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:55.890
And he, I guess, came
from a family of means.

00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:57.740
And, for a long period of time,

00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:01.780
he was just buying bottles and
bottles and bottles of wine

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:04.720
and sharing it with a lot of people

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.610
who called themselves Young Turks

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:09.050
who had made a lot of
money on Wall Street.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:12.530
And so, there was this
frenzied environment.

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:16.570
And what Kurniawan
eventually ended up doing

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:19.190
was he would take some
of these original bottles

00:38:20.713 --> 00:38:22.644
and go to restaurants and
share them with his friends.

00:38:22.644 --> 00:38:25.820
Dropping $300,000 on his black AmEx.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:27.240
And then he would ask the restaurants

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.080
to ship the bottles back to his home.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:30.990
And, once he was at his house,

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:33.230
he would concoct fake versions

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:37.116
of fancy Burgundy and Bordeaux.

00:38:37.116 --> 00:38:41.930
And then sell them as the real thing.

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:45.331
And he actually...

00:38:45.331 --> 00:38:49.290
This auction house called
Acker Merrall in New York

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:52.770
conducted two auctions
of Kurniawan's cellar

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:55.310
and sold his wines for
millions of dollars.

00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:59.799
And some of the most
important people in the world

00:38:59.799 --> 00:39:01.470
bought that wine, including William Coke,

00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:03.400
who is the brother of the Coke Brothers.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.728
He bought a number of bottles of fake wine

00:39:05.728 --> 00:39:08.270
from Rudy Kurniawan.

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:12.910
Anyway, Kurniawan was eventually arrested,

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:16.040
charged, and convicted of fraud.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:20.190
But what's happened is William Coke

00:39:21.501 --> 00:39:23.400
has been public about all
the bad bottles he bought.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:27.160
But a lot of other people
who bought bad bottles

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.540
are hiding them because
some people speculate

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.400
they want to get rid
of them on the market.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.570
They don't wanna announce
that they bought bad wine.

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:38.170
So, it did cast a pall over
the whole high end wine market.

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:43.030
- And so, the bottom line
is people don't often know

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:44.780
what they're getting.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:49.480
Grapes are stolen from land and
then sold as something else.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:53.670
In his case, he was using old bottles

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:58.670
to prove the value, which was a lie.

00:40:01.136 --> 00:40:02.930
- Right, wines are faked
all around the world.

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:04.653
They're usually high end wines.

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:06.690
But it's a big problem.

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:08.680
It's a growing problem.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.630
And, you know, it's one where

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.090
probably a lot of fake wine
gets out on the market.

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:16.730
But I would say most of that fake wine

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:20.330
is gonna be at the level, probably,

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:22.110
that you don't drink or I don't drink.

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:25.330
It's for people who really
spend a lot of money on wine.

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:30.020
It's not gonna be your
average $25 bottle of wine.

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:33.610
- This gentleman, Mark Anderson,

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:37.750
he was a real scoundrel and
he burned his warehouse down.

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:40.497
You tell that story very effectively.

00:40:40.497 --> 00:40:45.497
As a family that had some wine there,

00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:50.863
what are your feelings when
you realize that it's happened?

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:56.780
- Well, Mark Anderson
set this fire in 2005.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:58.720
And it destroyed a lot of wine.

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:01.203
And it ruined a lot of
people's businesses.

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:03.450
The wine...

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:07.410
Some winemakers were told
by their insurance companies

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:09.630
that they were not insured for that wine.

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:11.390
Because it was in transit.

00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:14.920
And so, a number of people
went out of business.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:19.580
You know, a lot of winemakers
lost placement in restaurants,

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:21.780
wine lists in stores.

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.960
And it took them a couple of years

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.320
in order to get their wine
back up on the market.

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:31.320
So, it was a very devastating
fire to the wine business.

00:41:31.347 --> 00:41:36.200
For my cousin who had put the wine

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.750
from my great-great-grandfather
in this warehouse,

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:40.780
she'd actually lent it to a winemaker

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:42.760
who had put it into the warehouse for her

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:45.850
without her permission
and without her knowledge.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:47.620
She was really devastated.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:49.980
Because she felt she was supposed to be

00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:52.142
the caretaker of this wine.

00:41:52.142 --> 00:41:56.120
And that she thought
she was doing a good job

00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:00.650
trying to sort of make
it last and she didn't.

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:03.680
Her actions sort of
led to its destruction.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.710
So, I think she was
really distraught about it

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:08.180
for a very long time.

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:13.180
And, in fact, I did open some
of this port for my book.

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:16.350
And I invited her to come and join me.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:18.540
And she just didn't want to
have anything to do with it.

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:19.373
She just...

00:42:19.373 --> 00:42:21.630
She really can't even
think about the episode.

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:25.040
So, I mean, I think that the way she feels

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:29.290
is how thousands of people feel.

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:34.290
The fire ruined the vintages
of 90 wineries in California

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:39.620
and the collections of
44 individual collectors.

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.840
- What lessons do you think you've learned

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:46.840
from your career that you
might pass on to students

00:42:48.359 --> 00:42:53.359
who envision being a
journalist slash historian?

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:58.080
- Well, so, for me, what
really drives me are stories.

00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:59.670
I love finding good stories.

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:02.280
And I think, of course, as a journalist,

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.090
there are a million stories
every day that are great.

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:07.220
But I think there are
also lots and lots of

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:10.790
fabulous stories in history that

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:15.150
have not been told or haven't
been told in a very long time.

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:18.500
And could be told in
a very engaging manner

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.260
that reaches a broad audience.

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:24.120
And narrative nonfiction is
becoming more and more popular.

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.860
And I think that's because
people love stories

00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:29.030
told in an exciting manner.

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:31.500
So, I guess I would
encourage people to go out

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.460
and go to the Bancroft Library.

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.880
Search through the
files and find something

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:39.050
that looks untold and interesting.

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:43.010
And try to tell it in a magazine format

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:44.180
or a book format or something.

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:47.170
- And how do you develop the skills

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:49.750
to tell somebody else's story?

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:51.040
- Well, that's a good question.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.600
I think that that takes time.

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.150
I think you have to do a lot of writing.

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:57.450
And journalistic writing is very different

00:43:57.450 --> 00:43:58.360
from writing a book.

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:01.070
I mean, when I wrote Towers of Gold,

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:02.950
I had to sort of teach myself

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:04.680
how to write in a different way.

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:07.250
I had to teach myself how to write a book

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:09.910
that had a narrative arc.

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:11.250
That it was scene-based.

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:13.010
That was character-based.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:17.050
Trying to draw things
out and engage readers.

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:20.410
And that took a lot of experimentation.

00:44:20.410 --> 00:44:23.730
But I think I eventually succeeded at it.

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:28.120
So, I think you have to
take off your journalism hat

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:31.010
and put on your sort of novelist hat,

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:32.810
even if you're not a novelist,

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:33.857
to tell those kind of stories.

00:44:33.857 --> 00:44:38.857
- And what will online
journalism do to storytelling?

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:43.340
Will it further it or undermine it?

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:44.650
- I think it's furthering it.

00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:48.970
I think there are lots of great websites

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:50.910
that have long form journalism on them.

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:52.981
There's some really
good reporting going on.

00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:56.100
And getting a book published

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.880
is really hard to do these days.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.196
You know, you're supposed
to have a platform.

00:45:01.196 --> 00:45:03.400
And, even if you get a book published,

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.000
it's very hard to get a book noticed.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.240
There's so many books that are coming out.

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:10.983
So, there are alternatives
to writing a book.

00:45:10.983 --> 00:45:14.240
One of them is finding a great website

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.140
and publishing online.

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:19.330
- And what role will video play

00:45:19.330 --> 00:45:23.750
in telling the story online?

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:26.870
- I think video plays a
huge role, as do images.

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:30.050
I mean, people like to look at pictures.

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:32.410
It's hard just to look at type online.

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:35.320
And graphics do very well online, too.

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:38.720
So, nowadays, when you
train to be a reporter,

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.300
unlike when I was training,

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.960
you don't just learn how to write a story.

00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:46.770
You learn how to do a podcast.

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:48.890
You learn how to do a video.

00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:50.930
You learn how to combine
all those things together

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:52.060
to tell a story.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.780
So, there's a new kind
of journalist out there

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:59.780
using all those techniques
to sort of get the news out.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.870
- Well, on that note, I'm
gonna thank you very much

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:03.810
for coming on our program.

00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:07.810
And we will look forward
to going to your websites

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:08.720
and buying your books.

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:13.720
And what is the URL for
Berkleyside and for Nosh?

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:19.170
- Okay, so, Berkeleyside
is berkeleyside.com.

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:23.040
And you can find Nosh on Berkeleyside.

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:26.910
And my website is francesdinkelspiel.com.

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:29.660
- Okay, alright, well, thank
you very much for joining us.

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:31.570
And thank you very much for joining us

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:34.053
for this Conversation with History.

00:46:35.282 --> 00:46:38.032
(relaxing music)
