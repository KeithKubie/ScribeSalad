00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:07.941
(upbeat music)

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.118
(door clanks)

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:19.819
- 3,089.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:23.790
(mumbles)

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.624
4,000.

00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:26.026
4,001.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.595
Ain't nobody getting
my butt up in here.

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:29.829
4,007.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.165
Ain't nobody getting my butt.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:33.700
Not me.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.335
Tell me, you wanna go to
jail or you wanna go home?

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:36.903
(snoring)

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:39.506
- Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike.

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:41.541
You okay?

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.309
- Where are we at?

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.878
- Well, listen,

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.546
Carrie drugged you,

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:47.814
tried to have sex with you,

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:50.016
and, oh, they think we
committed armed robbery

00:00:50.016 --> 00:00:51.451
so we're in jail.

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:54.254
- I don't like you.

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:55.488 align:start size:81% position:19%
- No, you like me.
- Mm-mmm.

00:00:55.488 --> 00:00:57.924
- Come on, come on,
take it to hole.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:00:59.993
(yells) What a shot!

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:02.362
You are an athlete,
she is an athlete.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:04.164
- Excuse me, Mister Policeman,

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:05.498
what are you watching?

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:07.300 align:start size:94% position:6%
- The Tulsa Shock-Phoenix
Mercury game.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.635
- Oh, for real, who's winning?

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:10.036
- Mercury took it,

00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:10.970
16, 15.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.439
- 15, 16?

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.273
Damn!

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:15.208
They was balling!

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:16.543 align:start size:97% position:3%
Shoot it.
- Quit it with that shit man.

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:18.344
See, that's your problem Cam.

00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:19.612
You always playing.

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:21.147
You walk up and down the
street all day playing.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:22.082
Stop playing!

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.016
- If they didn't leave the car,

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:23.950
this would've never happened.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.684
- They're the ones that left

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:25.885
the car.
- What?

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:26.820 align:start size:88% position:13%
- And y'all are the ones
that made them think

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.754
we committed armed robbery.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.155
- Man, I lost my daddy's watch

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:30.723
while you tried to
get your dick wet.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:32.559
- It wasn't no trying Cam.

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:33.927
Splash.

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:35.328
- Shut up man, you
can't even swim.

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:36.496
- I know how to swim!
- You can't swim--

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:37.897 align:start size:84% position:16%
I can swim in
something this big.

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:39.065
(all arguing)

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:40.867
- Shut the fuck up man!

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:42.135
- He talking to you,
he ain't talking to me.

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:43.536
- I'm talking to all y'all.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:45.939 align:start size:94% position:6%
- He ain't talking to me.
(mumbling)

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:47.273 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Let me break this
down for y'all.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:51.144
All I've done all day
is try to help y'all.

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:53.546 align:start size:84% position:16%
We got robbed by a
guy that keeps talking

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:55.014
about sucking dick today.

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:56.516
How do you think
that makes me feel?

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:57.750
- Hey!

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.487 align:start size:88% position:13%
Pu-Tang Clan, let's
keep it down, all right?

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:02.322
- Hey, who the fuck you
calling Pu-Tang Clan?

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:03.256
- Hey!

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:04.958
Guys, I have a gun, okay?

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:07.260 align:start size:84% position:16%
And an evidence
locker full of cocaine

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.795
so I'm gonna make
it look like y'all

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:11.564
did a bunch of blow if
you don't knock it off!

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.633 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So I'll sit down.
(all agreeing)

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:18.204 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Lookin' like John Candy.
(phone rings)

00:02:18.204 --> 00:02:19.038
- Hello?

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:21.608
Really?

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:23.977
Are you sure?

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.779
This has happened

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:27.614
Again?

00:02:27.614 --> 00:02:28.681
You know that

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:32.185
Well Dorm Boys, Dorm
Room Entertainment,

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:34.420
Dorm Door Door Door Heads,

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.688
ah, free to go.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.692
Free to go, that's my bad.

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:40.527
Oh boy.

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.529
My apologies from me

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:43.997 align:start size:88% position:13%
and the police
department all together

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.331 align:start size:84% position:16%
so-
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.000
What happened?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.401
- Turns out it was a white guy,

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:49.702
this chick was like,
"No, it was a bunch

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:50.970 align:start size:88% position:13%
of black people, a
bunch of black people."

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.039
So, it happens all
the time, honestly,

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.873
so big mistake.

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:55.241
That's my bad.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:57.010
It happens all the time guys.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.412
So, you see the confusion?

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:01.047
Ciao.
- No.

00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:02.015
See ya.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.416
Okay, so sorry about all that.

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:06.686
- By the way, it's Dormtainment.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:07.554 align:start size:72% position:28%
- No.
(door slams)

00:03:07.554 --> 00:03:09.656
Thank you so much, boss.

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:11.090 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I mean, Dorm
Entertainment is cool,

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.192
I mean, it's cool

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:14.627
(drowned out by door creaking)

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:16.829
- Sir, can I be honest with you?

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.132
Can I be honest with you?

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:22.669 align:start size:88% position:13%
I split a check
between six other guys.

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:23.503
Hello?

00:03:24.971 --> 00:03:26.239
Okay,

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.574
here's the problem,

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:30.343
the goddamn car is
at a goddamn tow yard

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:32.779
and they tacked on
another $350 bucks.

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:36.516
- (smacks lips) Come on man.

00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:44.991
(upbeat music)

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:49.896
- This is so Pornhub.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.364 align:start size:94% position:6%
- See that's the girl from
the check cashing store

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:52.865
right there.

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:53.866
- Hey, um...

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:57.537
Did you call the cops on us?

00:03:57.537 --> 00:04:01.140
- I did, but only because
I had to see you again.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.909
This is special.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.410
This is something.

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.447
- You're really weird.

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:08.881
- I'll give you guys
a ride to the tow yard

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:10.883
and pay to get your car out.

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:13.486
(all agreeing)

00:04:17.557 --> 00:04:19.559
(purrs)

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:24.364 align:start size:84% position:16%
- God, I'm Kim and you
guys are my Kanyes,

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:25.531
let's do this.

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:28.134
(upbeat music)

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:30.670
- [Cam] Yo Mike, man,

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.705 align:start size:94% position:6%
did you see these pictures
that you are on IG?

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:34.440
They're not good bro.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.310
It's not good, look at this.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.244
- [Mike] Come on, man,

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:39.679
yo, my girl is gonna kill me.

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:40.780
Rome, is your fault man.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.614
- [Rome] It ain't my fault,

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.116
Mike, shut yo ass up.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.285
- [Girl] Ooh, the Gatorade
dry-hump pic's on Insta?

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:46.753
(gasps) Those were cool,

00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:48.955 align:start size:97% position:3%
I mean, I would've done
more but they were so cool.

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.291 align:start size:97% position:3%
I would've liked it a
million times if I could've.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.960
(upbeat music)
