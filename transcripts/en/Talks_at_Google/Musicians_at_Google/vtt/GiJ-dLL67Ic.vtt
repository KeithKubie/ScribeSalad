00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:15.500

I mean, first of all, she's
sitting like high, and you're

00:05:22.633 --> 00:05:26.310
sitting low, which makes it
a very awkward situation.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.550
But I want to ask
the question.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.213

We're live on the air, and we

And I want to do something
special.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.800
I'm going to write a song, if
possible, right this very

hit, that American Express is

going to pay for it.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.210
And they're going to put
it on a commercial.

We're going to make
a ton of money.

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.330
And I'm going to share the
proceeds with everyone in the

fair kind of guy.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:35.180

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:35.993
But there's a simple thing.

00:12:35.993 --> 00:12:37.596
It's a simple rule you
need to follow.

00:12:37.596 --> 00:12:39.570
I need subjects--

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:41.560
words, thoughts, whatever's
from the crowd.

I need whatever.

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:47.566
But before you yell something
out, let the word you yell out

00:12:47.566 --> 00:12:48.840
be a fun word.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.405

Do not give me a boring
whack simple word.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:02.150
Don't give me love or peace
or fate or intimacy or

anything like that.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.460

toenail clippings or

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.370
something like that.

better our chances that

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.590
American Express will
pay for this.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:17.972
If you decide to still give
me a simple word--

00:13:17.972 --> 00:13:21.180
trust me, I have a cordless
microphone--

your spelling bee.

Oh, plural.

00:15:22.765 --> 00:15:23.580
You want to do lilacs.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.075
OK, got you.

00:15:24.075 --> 00:15:26.490
Got you.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:27.425
And Brazil.

00:15:27.425 --> 00:15:28.640
And Brazil.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.250
OK.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:30.200
Are you ready for the song?

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.454
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:15:31.454 --> 00:15:33.640
ERIC ROBERSON: OK.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.230
OK.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:35.990
What was your word?

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.990
Julie, I'm going to
take your word.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:37.550
What was your word?

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:38.860
AUDIENCE: Investment.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:39.600
ERIC ROBERSON: Is investment?

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.476
All right.

00:15:40.476 --> 00:15:41.790
All right.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.261
So corporate investment.

00:15:44.261 --> 00:15:48.139
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:48.139 --> 00:15:51.700
ERIC ROBERSON: We are in a
room full of lawyers and

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.350
entrepreneurs.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:56.350
CDs are only $10.

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.358
You can make the investment.

00:15:58.358 --> 00:15:59.672
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:59.672 --> 00:16:01.510
ERIC ROBERSON: OK, OK.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:02.990
I apologize.

00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:06.150
I apologize, Ryan,
for my silliness.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:09.810
Someone slipped something
in my tea, I think.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:17.830
OK, so we have roller coaster,
Google, lilacs--

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:19.880
plural--

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.600
Brazil, and investment.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.390
Where's the camera at?

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:25.670
I just want to make sure
that they see this.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.340
OK, all right.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:28.990
And Ian's going to create
the music right now

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.610
on the spot as well.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:31.280
So he's going to get some
publishing as well.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:34.120
So you can start it wherever
you feel--

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.450
if you want, I'll throw even
a beat to it as well.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.748
But we'll let you start first.

00:16:38.748 --> 00:17:21.560
[MUSIC - ERIC ROBERSON]

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.579

go to Brazil.

[MUSIC - ERIC ROBERSON]

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:11.249
ERIC ROBERSON: Roller coaster,

00:18:11.249 --> 00:18:12.499
investment.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.944
I might even throw
your Ex-Lax in.

00:18:21.944 --> 00:18:22.416
I might do it.

00:18:22.416 --> 00:18:24.675
I might do it.

[MUSIC - ERIC ROBERSON]

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.420
ERIC ROBERSON: [SINGING]

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:47.840
Let me tell you about a story
when I was laying on my sofa.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.260
[INAUDIBLE] girl had my
heart go up and down

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.510
like a roller coaster.

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:59.485
And I don't mean to say like
that's a good thing.

00:18:59.485 --> 00:19:05.800
But you gave me the words so
there's a song I need to sing.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.050
I'm from Jersey.

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:12.364
She was from Brazil.

00:19:12.364 --> 00:19:14.680
It's hot there.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.970
I live where it's chill.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.350
I tried to say I love you.

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.132
I offered her daffodils.

00:19:25.132 --> 00:19:28.420
She said that's whack.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:32.290
So I brought her some lilacs.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:35.336
And she let me in.

00:19:35.336 --> 00:19:38.700
And I entered.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:43.007
It was lovely, most
of it I remember.

00:19:43.007 --> 00:19:49.070
See, I thought this girl
was heaven sent.

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:53.500
From that point, I was ready
to make an investment.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.665
I went to go buy your ring.

00:19:59.665 --> 00:20:03.420
I even knew the size.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:06.608
She showed me what she liked.

00:20:06.608 --> 00:20:09.750
I checked out the
price on Google.

00:20:12.266 --> 00:20:13.516
That's expensive.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:19.360
Wish she was frugal.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.140
So I bought it anyway.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.580
I ignored the danger signs.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.940
Went with my heart
and not my mind.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:39.060
So I got on my knee while she
was laying on my sofa.

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.470
Won't you be with me
for my ride through

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.450
life's roller coaster?

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:45.700
And she said, yes.

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:55.040
Softly laid down here, then
dropped down on my chest.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:59.775
I replied by putting my hand
right on her thigh.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.830
Get your mind out the gutter.

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:12.675
So we thought about the wedding
plans and everything

00:21:12.675 --> 00:21:15.372
and how we would have
wine that was chill.

00:21:15.372 --> 00:21:17.986
And we would walk, and I would
carry her through the house,

00:21:17.986 --> 00:21:21.910
hold her up, and we would have
a honeymoon out in Brazil.

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.360
And I mean, she would walk
down, and the flower girl

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.440
would be looking beautiful
throwing purple lilacs.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.600
Until I found out that the price
of the wedding put my

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.312
American Express to the max.

00:21:36.312 --> 00:21:44.500
What I thought was heaven sent
has turned into a bad

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.750
investment.

00:21:48.205 --> 00:21:54.882
Now I'm looking at all
my money has went.

00:21:54.882 --> 00:21:58.990
Seems like all of my money
is really spent.

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:05.865
Next time, I'll find someone
frugal so I won't have to find

00:22:05.865 --> 00:22:07.340
out about bankruptcy
in Google.

00:22:10.536 --> 00:22:15.930
Hopefully, next time I'll
find someone frugal.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:18.095
Maybe I'll find a dating site.

00:22:18.095 --> 00:22:20.770
Let me type it in on Google--

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:26.680
singleblackman.com,
singlewoman.com.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.825
That's [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:27.825 --> 00:22:30.596
pause.

00:22:30.596 --> 00:22:31.846
What was that?

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.455
I turned to the wrong website.

00:22:37.455 --> 00:22:38.085
I think.

00:22:38.085 --> 00:22:40.780
I'll not go back.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.570
Had a bald-headed guy
in a speedo and in

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:44.820
his mouth was a lilac.

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:57.810
So this moral of the story,
before I am done, you need to

00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:00.520
really find who you invest in.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.525
It's not all about just fun.

00:23:03.525 --> 00:23:06.850
Because this young lady
may take your heart

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.710
and not give it back.

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:14.610
And your heart will feel
like you just took a

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.429
whole bunch of Ex-Lax.

00:23:17.429 --> 00:23:18.415
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:23:18.415 --> 00:23:20.387
ERIC ROBERSON: Thank you very
much, ladies and gentleman.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.910
This song is on the new album,
which is called "Mr. Nice

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:29.990
Guy." And you can start it,
because I want to talk a

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:32.480
little while you
play this part.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.100
But the song was inspired
by my grandfather, an

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.140
amazing wise man.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:41.910
And he lived in North
Carolina in a

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:43.452
little town called Stokes.

00:23:43.452 --> 00:23:45.365
And in that little town
called Stokes, there

00:23:45.365 --> 00:23:46.095
was a little house.

00:23:46.095 --> 00:23:47.942
And in that little
house was a man.

00:23:47.942 --> 00:23:50.080
And that man was my grandfather
who would have

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:52.180
these amazing talks in
front of the house.

00:23:52.180 --> 00:24:00.360
And one time, he said,
Eric, I'm not

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.760
into hugging in church.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:09.020
Now, he was a pastor in a little
church down the street

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.912
on a dirt road.

00:24:10.912 --> 00:24:17.550
He said, Eric, I'm not into
hugging in church.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.200
So I sat up and said, why not?

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.720
He said, because I'm a man.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.410
And if you touch me, I'm going
to feel something.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.680
Now, Lou Ray?

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:39.850
That Lou Ray in that kitchen
there, oh, I love Lou Ray.

00:24:39.850 --> 00:24:45.545
I love Lou Ray enough to
understand that I'm a man.

00:24:45.545 --> 00:24:50.705
And so Eric, sometimes it's just
better to just shake a

00:24:50.705 --> 00:24:51.955
hand and walk away.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.510
Because it helps [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:04.460
I'm going to dedicate this song
to that one particular

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.140
woman in this room who
thought she had a

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.150

I can hear somebody in
the back going, damn.

00:25:34.685 --> 00:25:35.740
I apologize.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:38.900
I apologize for my silliness.

for a call back.

rid of that iPhone.

00:40:45.145 --> 00:40:48.110
That will probably put
it over the top.

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:48.600
Just kidding.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:50.210

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:05.460
So the whole world, not just
the US, but everyone.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.230

one person from overseas

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:08.724
who was like, we've got it.

00:41:08.724 --> 00:41:10.720
We've got the world.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.540
But yeah, I was 16-years-old,

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:17.330

doing art in any form
or fashion,

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:20.150
because she was so talented.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:23.210
She was in a lot of pageants
that my mom and father were

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:24.206
putting her in.

00:41:24.206 --> 00:41:28.380
And my mom found a pageant
for teenage boys.

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:29.080
RYAN VUKELICH: Cool.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:33.450
ERIC ROBERSON: And I got up
there and embarrassed myself

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:35.150
and won the state.

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:36.490
And then I won the national.

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:38.050
And it gave me a full
scholarship to Howard

00:41:38.050 --> 00:41:41.060
University, so that was a great
part that came out of it

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:42.220
also, as well.

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:44.130
RYAN VUKELICH: Yeah, I'm sure
that couldn't have hurt your

00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:44.800
image of yourself.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.070
ERIC ROBERSON: Right,
right, right.

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:46.790
RYAN VUKELICH: Mr. World.

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:48.720
ERIC ROBERSON: Mr.
Teenage World.

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:51.600
RYAN VUKELICH: But in
seriousness, can you explain

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:54.010
how did that affect your
trajectory from there?

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:55.990
Was that a big moment, or was
it just something you did?

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:57.040
RYAN VUKELICH: It was
a huge moment.

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:57.860
It was a huge moment.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:01.730
I think one, I've always said
that I was somehow going to go

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:04.430
to college on a scholarship,
whether it was playing

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:06.876
football or doing something.

00:42:06.876 --> 00:42:10.820
And at the same time, going into
my junior year where at

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:14.250
that point I was drawing and
designing clothes, doing

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:18.190
theater, making music,
skateboarding, BMXing.

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:21.600
I was just all over the place in
everything I wanted to do.

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.210
So to gain a scholarship by
pretty much singing for the

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:26.640
most part--

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.390
I had to do other things
in the pageant--

00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:32.800
it really said, Mom and Dad, I
think I'm not going to be a

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.540
political science major.

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:37.020
I think I want to try--

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:39.680
there wasn't an R&amp;B major.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:43.280
There wasn't a, can I major
in being Al B Sure!

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.070
I couldn't do it.

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:46.060
So I grew up doing theater.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.800
So I went as a musical
theater major, man.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.640
And it was going to Howard.

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.790
And it was one of the best
decisions ever in my life.

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:56.340
RYAN VUKELICH: Can you talk
about Howard and the role of

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:59.810
historically black colleges and
universities and also of

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:01.170
Black History Month?

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:01.810
ERIC ROBERSON: Indeed.

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:05.320
You're walking down hallways
that Donny

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.430
Hathaway hummed down.

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:10.370
You're going into practice
rooms that Roberta

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:11.800
Flack played in.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:15.360
You're standing on a stage
reading a monologue that

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:18.080
Phylicia Rashad read
a monologue on.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.990
Just a history of it.

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:24.270
And I learned very early
on to be very prepared.

00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:29.300
Because at any second, Q-Tip
from a Tribe Called Quest or

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:32.960
Bill Cosby or Muhammad Ali will
walk down the hallway or

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.530
across the yard.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:39.580
But at the same time, my friends
were getting signed.

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:42.060
If anybody remembers-- (SINGS)
and if I ever--

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:44.580
the group Shai, "Fall
in Love" song.

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:45.550
We were friends.

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:47.080
They were our buddies
at Howard.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:51.410
And they handed their
record to a DJ.

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:55.950
And two weeks later, they're
on "Arsenio Hall." And five

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:59.780
weeks later, they had finished
the album in a week, handed in

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:01.210
the album, sold three
million copies.

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:03.500
And I handed them my demo
and said just hand it

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:04.310
to somebody in LA.

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:05.680
Before I knew it, I
was flying there.

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:08.160
And in my sophomore year,
I got a record deal.

00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:12.190
And so it was just a very
working environment.

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:16.470
One of my professors, the late,
great amazing Al Freeman

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:19.200
who played Elijah Muhammad in
the "Malcolm X" movie was one

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:20.530
of my teachers.

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:23.210
And he shot it while teaching.

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:27.440
So I'm like, I'm going to LA
next week to try to meet with

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.290
Warner Brothers for
a record deal.

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:30.830
Like how can he be like no,
stay here and work on your

00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:35.020
studies when he's like, I'm
going to meet with Spike.

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:36.790
It was just a working
environment.

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:38.420
Marlon Wayans was a good
friend of mine.

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:41.010
He was doing movies and going
to class at the same time.

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:43.220
So I think I needed
to see that.

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:46.680
It was the first lesson of
learning how to balance

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.350
everything.

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:49.360
RYAN VUKELICH: Yeah.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:50.900
That's a lot going on at once.

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.880
And I think inspiring to see.

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:53.100
ERIC ROBERSON: Very much.

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:54.260
RYAN VUKELICH: So thanks
for sharing that.

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:54.940
ERIC ROBERSON: No problem.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:58.860
RYAN VUKELICH: So can you talk
about how you had the deal

00:44:58.860 --> 00:44:59.860
with Warner.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:03.720
And in my mind, you were kind
of a trailblazer of

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.220
independent music.

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:08.110
People were doing it, but you've
been able to do it and

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:09.115
sustain it.

00:45:09.115 --> 00:45:13.560
ERIC ROBERSON: I think my
career has been able to

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.810
overshadow how many
times I've been

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:16.825
dropped from record labels.

00:45:16.825 --> 00:45:18.150
You know what I mean?

00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:20.800
Or just how unsuccessful
I was.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:23.090
Getting a contract signed was
on thing, but getting that

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:26.540
album out is a whole other
tricky monster.

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:30.850
And I remember having a song
on Billboard, and it's

00:45:30.850 --> 00:45:34.030
growing, and being in school.

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:37.000
I remember telling my parents,
I can't make it to class.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.990
I got a video out, and
just all these people

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:40.640
are grabbing me.

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.750
I literally can't make
it to class.

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:44.740
I can't do this.

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:46.670
So I took off like two years.

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:48.430
And then the Warner Brothers
situation didn't work out.

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:49.260
I went to Ireland.

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:51.130
An the Ireland situation
didn't work back.

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:54.150
And my mom was like, you're
going to go back to that

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:56.355
school and you are going to
get your scholarship back.

00:45:56.355 --> 00:45:57.220
I was like, all right.

00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:57.451
I went in there.

00:45:57.451 --> 00:46:00.120
I literally sang to everybody
like, (SINGS) please give me

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:02.506
my scholarship back.

00:46:02.506 --> 00:46:05.120
I'll get straight
A's, I promise.

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:09.850
And amazingly, I went back.

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.890
But it was crazy, because
I went back.

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:14.730
And it was like, (WHISPERS) oh,
there's that kid that had

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:15.730
that record deal.

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:17.800
Like the whispers walking
across the yard like,

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.426
(WHISPERS) oh, that's the kid
that fell off [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:20.426 --> 00:46:20.902
video.

00:46:20.902 --> 00:46:22.290
That was a long time ago.

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:25.070
I wonder if he still
got money.

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:27.920
So like the humbleness
of like--

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:31.310
it made me a better student, a
better singer, a more humble

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:35.330
artist, a more focused
everything, every aspect.

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:41.680
And I will tell you, if I had
this huge record and just took

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.230
off, I wouldn't be doing
music right now.

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:45.830
I wasn't talented enough
at the time.

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:48.340
I didn't know how to
handle everything.

00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:49.390
So I had to go back.

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:52.190
And going back to school and
graduating was like the

00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:54.410
hardest thing I've ever
done in life.

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:56.730
It really was.

00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:58.760
But it was a great decision.

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:01.940
And even with that, I went back
to college and I started

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:03.440
writing songs for
other people.

00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:07.460
I led a song on 112 and this
group called [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:08.160
Warner Brothers.

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:11.310
I was placing songs and
still recording.

00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:15.080
And it just got to the point
where, for me, the deals

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:15.890
weren't working out.

00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:17.940
And I had just too many
songs that just meant

00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:18.760
too much for me.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.100
It all started when I had
a real bad breakup.

00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:23.320
And I just closed the studio
doors and started recording.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.550
And those songs, I
wasn't going to

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:26.780
give to somebody else.

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:30.180
So that's how my independent
career started.

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:30.923
RYAN VUKELICH: That's cool.

00:47:30.923 --> 00:47:32.558
Would you mind sharing a couple
of the song titles that

00:47:32.558 --> 00:47:33.770
fall into that category.

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:35.460
ERIC ROBERSON: Yeah, there
was a whole album called

00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:39.950
"Esoteric." And it's crazy,
because it was a healing

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:40.760
record for me.

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:46.000
So when the album came out and
there were songs like--

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.540
what is some of the song titles?
"A Newborn Child,"

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:51.020
which is saying I'll cry like
a newborn child, which I was

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:52.960
doing at the time.

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:56.850
When the album came out and I
would meet women that were

00:47:56.850 --> 00:47:58.580
like, this record
is so beautiful.

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.412
I'm like, what do you mean?

00:48:00.412 --> 00:48:04.280
It was about pain, you
horrible person.

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:05.990
Like, don't ever listen
to my record.

00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:07.620
You don't understand.

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:10.300
But I had to realize that people
could relate to what I

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:11.680
was going through,
and it helped.

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:15.360
It helped me heal, would
help them heal.

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.740
There was a song called
"Miles Away" on it

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:22.170
that was really important.

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:24.890
And really, the record--

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:28.490
esoteric means only meant to be
understood by chosen few.

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:31.990
And that, to me,
was my career.

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:33.280
I wasn't trying to
change the world.

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.010
I wasn't trying to win
everybody over.

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:36.910
I was trying to just do
music for someone

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:38.550
who would feel this.

00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:42.530
Because I always felt like my
music career and my love life

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:43.640
were parallel.

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.906
They always have been.

00:48:45.906 --> 00:48:47.910
And as a song writer,
I was doing great.

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:49.150
I had songs for everybody
and their mother.

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:50.090
I was writing all these songs.

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:51.210
I was doing very, very well.

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:54.550
But was I fulfilled with
what I was doing?

00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:57.440
I felt like I was a solo artist
writing, a lot of

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:02.130
times, compromising or
as a fan, missing

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:03.370
what was on the radio.

00:49:03.370 --> 00:49:07.570
So I said, all right, let me
start doing what I feel like

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:08.530
I'm missing.

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:10.170
And I think that's what I'm
still doing to this day.

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:12.700
RYAN VUKELICH: That's great.

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.322
I mean, I'll be real with you.

00:49:14.322 --> 00:49:15.650
I've healed from your music.

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:17.750
And that's how I first
got into you.

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:20.970
"Past Paradise," "Find a Way,"
those are songs that when you

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:22.917
listen to, you're like, man,
he's been through it.

00:49:22.917 --> 00:49:23.095
Thanks.

00:49:23.095 --> 00:49:24.480
ERIC ROBERSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:27.050
Make checks payable
to Eric Roberson.

00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:28.900
Whoever, you can just
fill it out.

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:29.740
My father's back there.

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:30.990
He'll just accept the
checks and payments.

00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:39.070
I'll tell you, I say
this respectfully.

00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:41.285
I got a text earlier, and I
could show you for whoever

00:49:41.285 --> 00:49:44.206
doesn't believe me.

00:49:44.206 --> 00:49:47.060
The guy who I was talking to
who's in the industry, and

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:49.220
he's struggling in
his travels.

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.230
And he says, man, you
write great songs

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:52.710
about passing up vaginas.

00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:56.470
And I was like, what a great
horrible compliment.

00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:58.020
That was like amazingly
horrible.

00:49:58.020 --> 00:49:59.290
Incredible at the same time.

00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:04.170
But for me, I realized a long
time ago-- what I will tell

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:07.380
you is that the lyrics
come, and I can't

00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:08.730
take credit for them.

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:11.440
They come, and then I learn
what they mean.

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.710
And then I try to be good
enough to follow them.

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:14.700
You know what I mean?

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:16.150
And that's been my
whole career.

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:18.290
So it's like I'll a write a song
and go, wow, this sounds

00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:19.470
pretty good.

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:23.480
And then the lyrics
are stable.

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:28.400
And then I learn what that
song meant for me.

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:32.320
"Find a Way" was important
because it was--

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.230
if anyone listens to "Find a
Way," it's a song of mine.

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:37.840
And it's like I sing it
two parts, one high

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:38.690
note and one low note.

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:40.400
And I pan the high one all
the way to the right.

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.090
And I pan the low one all
the way to the left.

00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:44.380
And the high one meant
to be emotion.

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:46.600
And the low note meant
to be reality.

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.420
And as a man, I was
battling that.

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:51.660
Like sometimes we meet a young
lady and we're so used to our

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:55.120
routine, she could be the soul
mate, but I got that game.

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.690
I got to put that game on her.

00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:58.200
That I'm just ruining.

00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:00.480
Like, can I stop the game
for two seconds just

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.980
to see who she is?

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:07.450
And I've been lucky enough to
write about it or my breakups.

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:09.770
I made a decision a long time
ago, when I went back to

00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:14.020
Howard, that every subject
that came to mind or

00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:14.540
everything.

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:16.760
I went through, I'll
put to music.

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:20.960
So every argument, every great
day, every whatever, would be

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:21.640
put to music.

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.190
And I lost a lot of girlfriends
that way.

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:27.060
It came with the good or bad.

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.790
(SWEETLY) You wrote that
for me? (ANGRILY) You

00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:29.870
wrote that about me?

00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:35.660
It was the same thing, literally
24 hours apart.

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:38.240
But it's something I
decided to do, man.

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:41.140
And if God to allowed me to
have certain thoughts and

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:44.530
lyrics and melodies, how
dare I not use them.

00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:45.490
RYAN VUKELICH: That's
incredible.

00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:46.550
So what's your process?

00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:49.070
Do you just wake up with
something in your

00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:50.150
head or does it vary?

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:52.580
Because I know sometimes people
would say, oh, I woke

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:53.620
up in the middle of the night.

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:55.120
Sometimes I actually sat down.

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:55.830
Does it change?

00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:57.190
ERIC ROBERSON: It changes.

00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:58.860
I'm a fisherman of creativity.

00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:04.790
So I'm under the belief that
the idea already exists.

00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:07.300
I just have to find it
and make it tangible.

00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:12.230
So a lot of my records are
written in the bathroom.

00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:15.310
I'll leave up to you to think
what's happening in the

00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:18.750
bathroom when I'm
writing them.

00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:22.160
But every aspect from shaving
to showering to

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.510
other S words that--

00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:27.755
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:27.755 --> 00:52:28.400
ERIC ROBERSON: Soaping up.

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:28.730
RYAN VUKELICH: Situating.

00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:29.520
ERIC ROBERSON: Situating.

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:38.840
But it's funny, because before,
I was very much a

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:40.040
slave to creativity.

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:42.730
I was very much like if an idea
came and I was at the

00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:44.860
Thanksgiving table with my
family I haven't seen all

00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.970
week, I would get up right then
and go into the studio.

00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:49.919
I was very much like, I have
an idea, and everyone must

00:52:49.919 --> 00:52:51.130
respect the idea.

00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:53.420
Now, I believe that it's
going to come back now.

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:58.830
So now having kids and having a
wife, I realize that that's

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:01.920
a great idea, but I'm pushing
on the swing, and he's too

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.540
young to be left here.

00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:05.810
I mean, it'll come back.

00:53:05.810 --> 00:53:06.600
And it comes back.

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.140
It comes back.

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:09.090
But I'm always writing.

00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:09.740
Always.

00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:11.290
My phone is full of lyrics.

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:13.310
And I'm always writing
letters.

00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:17.355
And I feel like you should just
write in general to stay

00:53:17.355 --> 00:53:18.870
in shape for when
the idea comes.

00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:20.030
RYAN VUKELICH: Definitely.

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.900
You mentioned your kids.

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:21.980
Just two more questions.

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:24.430
One is what's one thing you
learned about yourself since

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:27.160
you've become a father, which
was two years ago ish?

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:27.880
ERIC ROBERSON: Yeah.

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:30.030
I have a two-year-old and a
seven-month-old, and I'm not

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:34.600
going to cry in front
of all these people.

00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:36.720
The thing I learned
about myself.

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:44.070
Man, I don't know.

00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:45.270
I learn about my kids.

00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:48.780
But I learned that I can
be a morning person.

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:52.400
Because probably for the last 20
years, I've averaged waking

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:55.300
up at 12:00 to 1:00
in the afternoon.

00:53:55.300 --> 00:54:03.010
And now my sons get up 7:30,
6:00 whatever in the morning.

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:05.690
But I learned it's another
level of love, man.

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:11.170
But it's tough, because I have
great parents who I knew the

00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:12.423
example of incredible love.

00:54:12.423 --> 00:54:14.480
I have amazing nephews
and nieces.

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:16.970
And I was crazy over them.

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:20.800
So I knew that it could exist
where it wasn't just more of

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.520
an a-ha moment.

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:28.106
But if anything, I learned that
you can balance it all.

00:54:28.106 --> 00:54:30.080
I will tell everybody out
there, there was a guy

00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.960
recently who I was just working

00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:34.110
with who was a cameraman.

00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:35.440
And he travels a lot.

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:36.370
He just got married.

00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:38.320
He's like, my wife wants to have
a kid, but, man, I just

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.280
travel too much, man.

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:41.250
And I'm like, it's
going to fit.

00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:42.720
It's going to make
its way, man.

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:46.120
Don't hold off for that.

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.600
I don't think we
really waited.

00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:48.510
I didn't push it away.

00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:53.280
But now, my last two records I
recorded, a lot of time, my

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.630
son was on my lap.

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:55.590
Either one of them.

00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:55.910
You know what I mean?

00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:57.600
Because I got to get
this idea done.

00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:58.740
I want to spend time with him.

00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:00.750
And he wants to spend
time with me.

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:01.690
Let's go in the studio.

00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:02.320
You know what I mean?

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:03.270
And it just works.

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.810
It just works.

00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:09.980
And I look forward to having
them one tour with me and the

00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:12.500
first time they actually write
a song or something like.

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:13.740
I look forward to all that.

00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:17.310
So I feel what I may learn is
just that my dreams are coming

00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:18.490
true, more and more.

00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:19.296
RYAN VUKELICH: Excellent.

00:55:19.296 --> 00:55:19.700
That's wonderful.

00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:22.450
So speaking of the studio,
last question.

00:55:22.450 --> 00:55:24.070
What's coming up next for you?

00:55:24.070 --> 00:55:27.060
I've heard United Tenor
is in the mix.

00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:27.800
ERIC ROBERSON: And I'm
not going to cry

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:28.600
about this one either.

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.270
I have to say that first,
because if I don't

00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:31.900
say it, I will cry.

00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:35.750
I started doing music because
of three influences.

00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:38.630
And one was A Tribe
Called Quest.

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:40.280
Number two was Stevie Wonder.

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:42.565
And another was a group
called Commission.

00:55:42.565 --> 00:55:44.695
It was a gospel group from
Detroit called Commission.

00:55:44.695 --> 00:55:45.130
[CLAPPING]

00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:46.210
ERIC ROBERSON: Thank you.

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:48.920
And one of the founders of that
group was a guy named

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:52.510
Fred Hammond, an amazing
vocalist, amazing writer.

00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:56.810
And not only just musically,
but I remember as a kid

00:55:56.810 --> 00:55:59.320
hearing their music and going,
whatever that is,

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:00.850
I want to do that.

00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:06.960
And I've had chances of meeting
Fred Hammond for many

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.240
years, and I passed
up every time.

00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:15.680
And my staff and some friends
surprised me with a meeting.

00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:17.380
I'm in a restaurant thinking
I'm about be interviewed by

00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:18.680
Tom Joyner.

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:20.500
And in walks Fred Hammond.

00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:21.410
I tried to run away.

00:56:21.410 --> 00:56:22.720
And I was like, oh,
you got me.

00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:25.840
You got me, man.

00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.875
And just because I wanted to be
able to tell the man, like,

00:56:27.875 --> 00:56:30.250
yo, my career means so much--

00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:31.330
I'm not going to cry.

00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:31.790
Here we go.

00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:32.090
Ah, toughen up.

00:56:32.090 --> 00:56:33.650
Toughen up.

00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:34.390
Because of you.

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.940
You know what I'm saying?

00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:37.040
I have this career, and I didn't
know if I was where I

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.030
needed to be at yet to
really understand.

00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:40.380
I didn't want to just hear,
oh, that's cool, man.

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:40.840
Thanks a lot.

00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:42.220
When are we going to eat?

00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:44.775
I didn't want that
to be blown over.

00:56:44.775 --> 00:56:46.030
So we kept in touch.

00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:49.280
And then a couple of months ago,
he said, I got an idea.

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.080
I want to form a new group.

00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:54.060
And I would love for you to
be a member of the group.

00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:55.610
And I was like, OK.

00:56:55.610 --> 00:56:57.885
I mean, I'll play the piccolo
on an album for Fred.

00:56:57.885 --> 00:56:59.020
I'll pay to do it.

00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:01.480
And it's not just me and him.

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.430
It's Dave Hollister from
the group Blackstreet.

00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:05.260
An amazing solo artist.

00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:06.800
I'm a huge fan of Dave.

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:09.330
And another amazing artist named
Brian Courtney Wilson

00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:10.840
who I'm friends with already.

00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:13.300
I met him years ago, and
we kept in touch.

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:14.780
And we all went to Dallas.

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:18.180
And over the last month or so,
we travelled back and forth,

00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:20.040
and we recorded an
incredible album.

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:24.660
And so the group's called
United Tenors or UT.

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:26.230
The album comes out
March 26th.

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:29.030
We had our first concert
last Saturday.

00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:30.690
We shot a music video
and live performance

00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:33.290
for a crowd in Dallas.

00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:36.820
And we cried through
the whole show.

00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:40.940
All four are just literally--

00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:43.800
it's a dream come true, really,
in every aspect.

00:57:46.896 --> 00:57:50.240
We performed four songs and we
played the rest of the record.

00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.670
So while we're singing,
we're crying.

00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:52.690
While we're playing
the records for

00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:53.670
people, we're crying.

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:57.480
Someone said something amazing
on stage, so literally, when

00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.675
you see the video, we're all
like this with just towels on

00:57:59.675 --> 00:58:01.810
our face through the
whole performance.

00:58:01.810 --> 00:58:05.220
But it's tears of joy.

00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:08.250
And we're probably not going to
stop crying anytime soon.

00:58:08.250 --> 00:58:12.380
In all honesty, 10, 20 shows
we're still going to be just

00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:16.400
like, (FAKE SOBBING) I just so
appreciate this opportunity.

00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:19.096
And it's a gospel album, man.

00:58:19.096 --> 00:58:20.140
I pride myself on it.

00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:22.570
I never hid the fact that
I'm a Christian.

00:58:22.570 --> 00:58:26.930
And I feel there's been a
ministry in all of my music.

00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:30.360
So it's really cool to be doing
a gospel album and with

00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:32.880
two of my heroes and a very good
friend of mine as well.

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:34.440
RYAN VUKELICH: Yeah,
that's incredible.

00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:35.450
Thanks for sharing that.

00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:37.515
ERIC ROBERSON: Thank you.

00:58:37.515 --> 00:58:39.320
RYAN VUKELICH: I'm really
honored to have you all here

00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:42.040
today too. to the point where
I might cry with you.

00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:43.500
ERIC ROBERSON: To
tears of joy.

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:45.950
Everybody, everybody, pass
the tissues out.

00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:47.550
RYAN VUKELICH: So Eric, thanks
so much for being here.

00:58:47.550 --> 00:58:47.930
I'm looking forward
to tonight.

00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:49.060
ERIC ROBERSON: Ryan, always
a pleasure, man.

00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:49.750
Always.

00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:50.610
Thank you.

00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:52.405
[APPLAUSE]
