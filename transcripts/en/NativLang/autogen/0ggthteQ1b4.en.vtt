00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.999
The new year (Yancuiic xihuitl / η Πρωτοχρονιά
/ la jaro nova / el año nuevo / le nouvel an /

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:11.240
ka makahiki hou / s’annu nou e fintzas
“cabuannu”).

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.150
2014 was a year of getting to know these guys
and you guys a bit better - I’m not shy

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.180
about it, you really are the best bits of
this channel.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.940
It was a year for experiments - we eavesdropped
on linguistic tics of travel destinations,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.160
we pondered whimsical questions (that’s
not pondering, Mr F, give us a good pondering…

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.000
there it is!), ahem, we even wandered off
into animvloggy creativeness. Ok, I retract

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.780
“we” from that last one - I dragged you,
some of you maybe against your will.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.329
We skipped from idea to idea with little care
for what internets was yearning to learn about

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.850
language. Many questions went unanswered.
Many fears surfaced because OMG WHAT HAPPENED

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.489
TO THE LESSONS!?!

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.739
Now we end up, poetically, right where we
started: pondering language. That’s a good

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.579
pondering.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.210
December cleared up my backlog and ended us
in a den of animal communication! And now,

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.210
as promised, I’m face to face with decipherment.
I’m even taking a step back to think about

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.920
writing systems in general. So, alongside
an unwieldily awesomely growing list of languagey

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.119
suggestions from you, I sense the graphological
thread unraveling throughout 2015. So keep

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:31.429
on keeping me in check. After all, we’ve
both seen you’re super good at that.

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:34.270
Subscribe for a happy new year and happy language!
