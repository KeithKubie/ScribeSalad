00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.700
SPEAKER: I have the honor of
introducing our guest speaker

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:16.000
today, Dr. Rasmus Nielsen, who
is the Director of Research

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.490
at Oxford's Reuters Institute
for the Study of Journalism.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.830
And he also serves
as Editor in Chief

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.790
for the "International
Journal of Press Politics."

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.510
His work focuses on the
changes in the news media,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.690
on political communication,
and the role of technology

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.880
that it plays in both.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.790
He's done extensive
research on journalism

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.050
and American politics as well
as various forms of activism.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.980
He's received many awards
throughout his career

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.330
and has a PhD in communication
from Columbia University.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.060
He will be sharing
some research that he's

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.110
done globally on the use of--

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.860
or the use of journalism
and social media

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.330
and how it's consumed
on digital media.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.130
That'll be a 20-minute
presentation.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.490
We'll then ask Erica
Anderson, our very own,

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.030
who heads up the Partnerships
Team in the News Lab, based out

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.560
of New York as
well, to do a Q&amp;A.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.110
I learned a lot about Erica
along the way as well.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.340
Her current role is working
with partnerships in the news

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.850
industry and seeing how we can
really broadcast and advance

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.980
storytelling.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.730
Building trust in this digital
age with the news industry.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.260
Prior to Google, she was Katie
Couric's first social media

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.890
person, helping establish Katie
Couric as the first journalist

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.979
to really lead the
way in social media.

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.520
And prior to that,
she was at Twitter

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.840
helping establish the program
with journalists, fun fact,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.200
helping build long codes
so that journalists

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.030
can tweet from remote
regions in war zones

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.920
using some satellite phones.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.530
Such esteemed speakers
that we have today.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.780
Please join me in giving a warm
welcome to Dr. Rasmus Nielsen

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.950
and Erica Anderson.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.385
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:18.268 --> 00:02:18.768
Thank you.

00:02:18.768 --> 00:02:19.750
Welcome.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.520
RASMUS KLEIS NIELSEN: Thank you.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.290
Thanks very much for
the warm introduction

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.470
and for the opportunity
to speak here today.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.040
I will talk on the basis of a
large collaborative research

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.530
project that we do at
the Reuters Institute

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.210
at the University
of Oxford that's

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.970
led up by my colleague,
Nic Newman, Richard

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.220
Fletcher, Antonis
Kalogeropoulos, David

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.572
Levy, and myself.

00:02:40.572 --> 00:02:42.280
So I will sort of
speak on behalf of what

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.160
really is a team effort.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.750
And I'm just the one who
has the honor, if you will,

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.790
to stand here in front of you
to talk about these issues.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.710
What I want to do is to give
a big picture overview, what's

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.630
happening to how people use
media, how they use news, how

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.010
they get it across a range
of different countries

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.090
across the world.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.635
I'll touch on some key
themes around these issues

00:03:04.635 --> 00:03:06.760
and try to take away some
of the big picture points

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.900
that I think are
relevant for thinking

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.830
about the role of
journalism in our societies

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.670
but also the role of large
technology companies,

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.000
like Google.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.770
So first, a quick overview
of what the study is about.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.910
We do a large survey every year.

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.110
This year, we have covered
36 different markets

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.750
across the world, a total
of 70,000 respondents,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.040
more than 2,000 in every
country that we cover,

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.770
to really give a
picture globally

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.060
of how people are using media
and news across the world.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.180
This is made possible
by a network of partners

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.970
and sponsors, including a
range of different media

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.780
organizations, like the BBC;
media regulators, like Ofcom

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.696
in the UK; private
sector media companies,

00:03:46.696 --> 00:03:48.070
including publishers,
newspapers,

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.620
and the like; universities
and technology companies,

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.660
like Google, who is
amongst the sponsors

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.960
behind this
collaborative effort.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.400
I want to touch on a set of
key findings from this survey

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.610
today before we open up for
conversation with Erica.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.720
And I'll run through
each of them in turn.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.220
The first point I
want to talk about

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.490
is the move towards
an environment of what

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.010
we might think of as distributed
discovery, where people

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.940
increasingly get their news not
by going direct to the websites

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.610
and apps of news organizations,
but by coming sideways

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.190
via search, via social,
and increasingly,

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.470
via messaging apps
or other forms

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.220
of distributed discovery, where
contrary to fears of filter

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.665
bubbles, at least
in our research,

00:04:28.665 --> 00:04:30.790
we find that people, in
fact, are increasingly more

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.560
exposed to more
different sources of news

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.430
than they were in the past.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.096
But also, an environment
in which people

00:04:35.096 --> 00:04:38.620
don't always recognize the
brands or the sources of news

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.080
that they have, in fact, used.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.380
The second point I want to
cover is the question of trust.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.770
And I will argue that our
research shows that confidence

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.499
both in social media
and in news media is low

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:52.040
in many environments
and particularly

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.040
in those that are politically
polarized, like the US.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.780
I will talk about the evolving
role of platform companies,

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.550
like Google, in terms of the
way in which we, as users, use

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.870
the technologies that companies
like Google, Facebook,

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.160
and Apple, and others
are offering is changing

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.800
the way in which we get news.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.460
And finally, I will talk about
mobile and the centrality

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.230
of the smartphone as the
defining device of news today

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.780
and, if you will,
the implications

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.840
of these developments for
the business of journalism.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.040
So this is the terrain.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.550
The first topic is the question
of distributed environments.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.770
Now, it's clear that in the
early days of the internet,

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.710
we still lived in a world in
which people primarily got news

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.670
by going direct to a source of
news, a brand that they knew.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.470
They would type in
thenewyorktimes.com,

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.870
or still maybe use
a print newspaper

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.237
or go to a broadcaster
for their news.

00:05:43.237 --> 00:05:45.070
But increasingly, the
world in which we live

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.530
is one in which people have
embraced what we might think

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.320
of as distributed discovery,
where we come across news

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.370
via platform services that are
sometimes used because we want

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.040
news but sometimes
incidentally expose us to news

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.000
while we are using the platform
or service for other purposes.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.950
In our survey, by
now most people

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.510
would say that they get news
in a range of different ways.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.550
Sometimes, going direct.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.512
Sometimes, use of
social or search.

00:06:08.512 --> 00:06:09.970
But when we do a
follow-up question

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.460
of asking people, what is
your main way of getting news

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.790
online, we clearly see this
shift towards an environment

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.200
that is more distributed.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.330
So by now, in the
countries we cover,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.940
the 36 different
markets, about a third

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.800
say that going direct
to a news provider

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.630
is their main way of
getting news online.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.870
But 2/3 mentioned various
forms of distributed access.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.540
Search most importantly,
social close behind, and then

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.670
other forms of sideways access.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.070
Amongst younger
users, those under 35,

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.420
it's 3/4 who named these
distributed forms of access

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.400
as their main way
of getting news.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.900
Many people have worried that
this development would lead us

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.150
towards an environment
characterized by filter bubbles

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.880
or echo chambers where
algorithmic selection would

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.792
lead us just to feed us more
of what we already want.

00:06:54.792 --> 00:06:56.500
In fact, when we look
at our survey data,

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.140
what we find consistently across
the markets that we look at is

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.770
that those people who use
social media or search, or both,

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.310
amongst the ways in which they
find news are consistently

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.650
exposed to more different
sources of news in the course

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.210
of a week than those who don't.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.770
Now, it's important
to say here that,

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.320
of course, for those people
who use a lot of news,

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.060
this effect may
be quite marginal.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.380
So if you use maybe five
or seven different sources

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.490
of news in a week,
you're probably

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.114
not going to see more
different sources

00:07:21.114 --> 00:07:23.062
of news via search and social.

00:07:23.062 --> 00:07:25.520
But what's important to remember
is that most people do not

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.020
use a lot of sources of news.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.800
They might use two or three
that they go to directly.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.800
And search and social in general
will add additional sources

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.800
that they would not have
come across otherwise.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.742
So we really don't find
these filter bubbles

00:07:37.742 --> 00:07:38.450
or echo chambers.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.671
In fact, we find the opposite--
incidental exposure to news

00:07:41.671 --> 00:07:43.670
that people would not
have sought out otherwise,

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.210
in particular for young people
and for those least interested

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.220
in news.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.500
The flip side of this,
which we could broadly

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.790
say is probably a good
thing, if you will,

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.447
is that there is a clear
issue of brand recognition

00:07:57.447 --> 00:07:58.280
in this environment.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.210
That people don't always
remember or even recognize

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.430
the news providers
that they come across

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.440
via search or social.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.336
So this year in the UK, we
did sort of a closed study,

00:08:09.336 --> 00:08:11.210
particularly of this
question of attribution,

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.280
where we tracked
people passively,

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.100
looking at what they
actually accessed,

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.360
a set of panelists who
had volunteered to let

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.700
their behavior be tracked.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.130
We identified the ways in
which people came across news--

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.740
by going direct, by accessing
first a social media

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.100
domain and then a news site, or
using search and then accessing

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:28.910
a news site.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:32.024
And then we would survey
those people within 48 hours,

00:08:32.024 --> 00:08:34.190
knowing that they had
accessed a certain news story,

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.231
and asked them, do you
remember where you got it?

00:08:36.231 --> 00:08:38.659
What news brand did you
get this story from?

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:41.090
Unsurprisingly, most of
the people who had directly

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.549
accessed the news
organization would correctly

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.970
recall what news organization
this was-- the BBC, The Mail

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.380
Online, The Guardian.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.780
Whereas less than
half of those who

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.660
had come across this
story via search or social

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.890
could correctly remember and
recall what the brand behind it

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:58.160
was actually like.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.590
So here is a real issue that
is in part, if you will,

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:03.680
an issue for publishers
around their business

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.630
and the standing of
their journalism.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.430
But also it's a public
issue in the sense

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.320
that we know from
a lot of research

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.570
that brands are key to the
ways in which people think

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.520
about the credibility
of information,

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.290
and the trustworthiness
of information,

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.540
and the degree to which they
will let that information

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.130
influence or inform
their views, if you will.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.710
So there is an issue here
of whether in distributed

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:27.260
environments, we are
helped enough as users

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.630
to actually navigate the
information that we discover

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.615
via the search and
social services.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.890
The next topic I
want to touch on

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.690
is this question of
confidence and trust,

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.290
which sort of follows
on, if you will,

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:42.623
in some ways from this question
of distributed discovery

00:09:42.623 --> 00:09:46.610
and whether we recognize
brands in that environment.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.140
The first thing I
want to say here

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.470
is that we asked
people in this survey

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.012
as sort of a simple top-line
question of whether they felt

00:09:53.012 --> 00:09:54.470
that different ways
of getting news

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.535
helped them distinguish
between fact and fiction.

00:09:57.535 --> 00:09:58.910
So it was sort of
a way of trying

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.470
to get at this
issue of fake news

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:02.480
that didn't rely on
simply asking people.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.060
So, Rasmus, do you feel like
you've been fooled recently?

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.080
And then me sort
of volunteering,

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.590
yes, I've been
fooled all the time.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:08.030
No.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.530
Instead we asked
people whether they

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.440
felt empowered by
different forms of media

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.660
to distinguish between
fact and fiction.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.230
Now, the first figure there
is quite striking, we feel.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.860
It's that only a quarter
of our respondents, 24%,

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.290
feel that social media
helps them distinguish

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.210
between fact and fiction.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.940
Now, obviously, this
has never been a promise

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:29.990
that social media made.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.140
It is not something that social
media platforms promised people

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.440
to help them do this, but
it is still quite striking

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.810
that when we know that
so many people rely

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:42.170
on social media as one among
several sources of ways

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.712
of finding news that so few
people seem to think that this

00:10:45.712 --> 00:10:48.170
is actually a good way for them
to distinguish between fact

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:48.992
and fiction.

00:10:48.992 --> 00:10:50.700
The optimistic spin
on this, if you will,

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.550
is that people
are actually quite

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.450
skeptical of this information.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.620
And this image that some people
have of people sort of naively

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.124
believing every
piece of information

00:10:59.124 --> 00:11:01.040
that they come across
on Twitter, on Facebook,

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.014
is not one we can
recognize at all.

00:11:03.014 --> 00:11:04.430
To the contrary,
our data suggests

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.555
that people are highly
skeptical and quite critical

00:11:06.555 --> 00:11:08.360
consumers of information
that they find

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.270
in distributed environments.

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:15.710
When we turn to news media,
the figure is much higher.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:18.350
40% say that they feel news
media helped them distinguish

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:19.697
between fact and fiction.

00:11:19.697 --> 00:11:21.530
Whether the figure is
as high as journalists

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:23.540
would like it to be is then
a separate question because

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.740
of course, here
journalists actually

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.114
do believe that
this is what they

00:11:26.114 --> 00:11:27.902
are trying to do in many cases.

00:11:27.902 --> 00:11:29.360
So the figure here,
if you will, is

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.901
one I think that
indicates that there

00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:34.010
is a much broader issue of trust
and confidence in news media

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.830
that I think has been
illustrated quite vividly

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.230
recently in the United
States around elections

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.570
and, if you will, the attitudes
of certain politicians

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.270
and parts of the public
towards journalists and media

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.440
organizations.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.300
But it's important to
see here that this,

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.390
while a global phenomenon,
is not equally pronounced

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:53.480
or the same level, if
you will, of distrust

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.820
or even crisis of confidence in
every country around the world.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.200
So looking across the 36
markets we cover in the report,

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.660
we find very
pronounced differences

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.790
in degree to which people say
that they can trust the media.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.550
Some countries, often
in Northern Europe,

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.860
have half or close to
half the population saying

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.680
they have a lot or quite a
lot of confidence in the news

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.430
media.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:17.270
Whereas in countries like
the US, it's less than 40%.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.797
And many very
polarized countries

00:12:18.797 --> 00:12:20.630
in Southern Europe,
Central, Eastern Europe,

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.671
and Latin America have
even lower levels of trust

00:12:22.671 --> 00:12:24.519
like that, like
Greece, for example,

00:12:24.519 --> 00:12:26.810
and Korea, where only about
a quarter of the population

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.360
feel that they can
trust the media.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.910
Now, a subset of this
is a follow-up question

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:34.880
about whether people trust not
the media, but my media, if you

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.560
will, the media that they use.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.330
And in polarized
societies like the US,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.629
we see very big differences,
where people are much more

00:12:41.629 --> 00:12:43.670
likely to say that they
trust the media that they

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.560
use than they are
to say that they

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.290
trust the media in general--

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.430
implicitly, the media
that other people use.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.888
Whereas in many of the countries
with high levels of trust,

00:12:51.888 --> 00:12:53.960
people trust both their
own media and the media

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.230
that other people use, which
is a slightly different

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.340
environment.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.900
In our view, this
is in large part

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.410
due to political polarization.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.110
So something that
may be accentuated

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:05.240
by media and by technology,
but it's fundamentally

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.710
a political question.

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:10.310
We tried to map this by showing
the degree to which audiences

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.370
are distributed along
partisan political lines

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:14.720
in the online environment.

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:17.136
And you can see, for example,
in a country like the United

00:13:17.136 --> 00:13:20.210
States, that you have
a majority of brands

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.130
that have an audience
that leans to the left.

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:23.840
I should underline
here, this graph

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.760
is about the audience's
political leaning,

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.200
not about the
content or editorial

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.366
line of these organizations.

00:13:28.366 --> 00:13:31.790
But a large number of brands
who have left-leaning audiences,

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.190
and then a few who have
right-leaning audiences,

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.390
and very little in the
middle, apart from Yahoo News.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:40.407
A country like the
UK, where you have

00:13:40.407 --> 00:13:42.740
a large provider in the middle,
the public service media

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:46.314
organization, the BBC;
a number of newspapers

00:13:46.314 --> 00:13:48.230
that are sort of clearly
center left or center

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.630
right, whether it's The
Mail Online, The Telegraph,

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.120
or The Guardian, and
The Daily Mirror;

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.360
and then very small,
very purely partisan

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.680
outlets on the far
left and the far right.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.381
So this is quite a
different picture,

00:14:00.381 --> 00:14:01.880
if you will, of
what an online media

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.740
environment, a high-choice
media environment,

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.948
might look like in a country
that is less politically

00:14:05.948 --> 00:14:09.710
polarized than the US and
where people generally

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.940
have higher levels of
confidence in the media,

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.020
though declining,
perhaps, after Brexit.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.870
Now, the next topic I wanted
to quickly walk through

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:20.750
is this question of the evolving
role of platform companies,

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:22.910
and how we find and
access news, and the way

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.090
in which these things
are changing over time.

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.840
The first point here
is really, of course,

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.690
to highlight the
centrality of social media,

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.340
by now the only
sort of other way,

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.020
apart from search, that really
is central to distributed

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.500
discovery.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.620
And we've seen an
incredibly rapid rise

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.600
in the role of social
media for getting news.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.200
By now, in 2017, more than
half of our US respondents

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.100
say that they get
news on social media.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.390
It's basically a doubling
in just four years.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:51.910
The development in the
UK is very similar.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.442
But what's important
to recognize here also

00:14:54.442 --> 00:14:56.650
is that, actually, this year
we've seen, if you will,

00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:00.550
a slowing down or even a
flat-lining of this seemingly

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:02.610
inexorable growth of the
roles of social media.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.360
So in many countries,
the number of people

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.030
who say they get news from
social media has stayed flat

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.250
or even declined
slightly year-on-year.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.750
And again, there
are very pronounced

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.450
country-to-country differences
between a country like Germany

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.510
versus a country
like Spain, where

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:17.020
in Spain, twice
as many people say

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.060
they get news on social media.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:21.456
So social media, perhaps a
saturation point, the same way

00:15:21.456 --> 00:15:23.080
that search may have
reached saturation

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.780
as one of the ways in
which people get news.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.420
Where do we see
the evolution then?

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.000
Well, from our point of
view, the next frontier

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.900
is probably messaging
applications.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.620
This is where we've seen
real growth year-on-year,

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:38.950
in particular WhatsApp,
Facebook Messenger, but also

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:42.250
in some countries,
individual other providers.

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.290
So we have Snapchat
that are important

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.150
for some demographics-- younger
users in many countries,

00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:49.935
particularly the US and some
other English-speaking markets.

00:15:49.935 --> 00:15:51.310
But also in some
countries, there

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.590
are individual
messaging applications

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:54.730
that are very important--

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:57.920
Kakao in Korea, for
example, and Line in Japan.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.961
So we see a lot
of difference here

00:15:59.961 --> 00:16:01.210
in the role of messaging apps.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.950
These more private
environments that

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:05.950
are not filtered by algorithms
making display decisions

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.600
but are filtered
by users deciding

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.210
who they want to share
with that in some markets

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.130
are really, really important.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:14.800
Already now we have,
in some markets,

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.170
generally markets with low
levels of trust in mainstream

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:20.140
media and with highly-polarized
environments where you may not

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.480
want to talk about politics
publicly on social media,

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.940
but may want to talk about
politics privately with people

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.700
you trust, we see countries
that in some cases,

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.811
like Malaysia and Brazil,
it's half or close to half

00:16:30.811 --> 00:16:33.310
of the population say that they
get news via messaging apps.

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.402
This really is a new
frontier that publishers

00:16:35.402 --> 00:16:36.610
are interested in looking at.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.530
But also, of course,
a whole new set

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.274
of questions around the
spread of information

00:16:41.274 --> 00:16:42.940
and all the wonderful
ways in which this

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.106
can empower people to share
things and get informed.

00:16:45.106 --> 00:16:48.670
But also, of course, the
fears around misinformation

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.790
and an environment in which
it's much harder to really track

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.680
what kind of information
do people actually

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.650
get in these environments
that are not public and not

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:59.850
transparent from the outside.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:03.180
The next frontier
perhaps might be voice.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.819
Many companies are
investing in this,

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:06.694
Amazon and Google included.

00:17:06.694 --> 00:17:08.819
And many publishers are
interested in this question

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:10.569
of whether voice
provides a new interface,

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:14.099
whether via smart speakers
or also via smartphones,

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.319
and increasingly are
offering not only responses

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:18.653
to voice queries, but
also a voice response

00:17:18.653 --> 00:17:20.819
to the query, if you will,
in terms of giving people

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:23.760
the news via these devices.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.454
And we expect to see some growth
in this area moving forward.

00:17:26.454 --> 00:17:28.620
This is clearly a priority
for technology companies.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:31.710
And publishers may be able
to leverage this growth.

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:38.860
The fourth issue I wanted
to talk about is mobile.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:43.060
Really the mobile phone,
our data suggests,

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.820
increasingly is the defining
device of digital news.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.530
And again, a bit like the
growth of social media,

00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.220
it's a development
that I think by now

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.280
is so naturalized
for many people who

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.290
might be in this room or
listening to this talk,

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:58.706
we take it for granted because
for us, the mobile phone is

00:17:58.706 --> 00:18:00.850
already the remote control
to much of our life

00:18:00.850 --> 00:18:02.045
and our digital life.

00:18:02.045 --> 00:18:03.670
But I think it's
worth remembering just

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:05.920
how incredibly rapid
this growth has been,

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.314
how quickly this has transformed
the environment for publishers

00:18:09.314 --> 00:18:11.230
and for a lot of people
who didn't necessarily

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:15.430
grow up with a smartphone
sort of glued to their ear.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:19.120
We see a rapid shift where
this year, for the first time,

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.150
we reached a tipping point
where the same number of people

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:25.150
in the US identify their
smartphone as their main device

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:29.200
for getting digital news as
identify a personal computer.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.390
And again, just look at
the pace of development

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:35.490
here in just three years as a
move from a situation in which

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.240
less than a fifth would
say the smartphone

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.614
was their main
device for getting

00:18:38.614 --> 00:18:41.750
digital news to a situation in
which 40% of the respondents,

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:45.880
and if you include tablets, well
over half of the respondents

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.300
say that their mobile device is
their main way of getting news.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:50.809
So this is a very
rapid development.

00:18:50.809 --> 00:18:52.600
And of course, it
creates a new environment

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.882
where we start accessing news
in all these sort of found time,

00:18:56.882 --> 00:18:58.840
these little pockets of
time throughout our day

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.335
that previously weren't
necessarily connected

00:19:01.335 --> 00:19:01.960
with media use.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.790
We all recognize that
experience of waiting

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:04.980
for a friend at a cafe.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.760
We flip out the phone.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:09.220
Sitting in the back of a
cab, we flip out the phone.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.050
Waiting for the subway,
flip out the phone.

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:14.170
And there are all these, if
you will, new moments early

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:17.270
in the morning, even
before we get out of bed,

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.720
tending to other private needs.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.845
Or for that matter, using
public transportation

00:19:21.845 --> 00:19:24.220
where there are these new
moments where people can access

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.764
media content in ways that were
almost unimaginable, if you

00:19:26.764 --> 00:19:28.930
will, just a few years ago,
where we were still tied

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.590
to devices that were
largely desk-bound or using

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:34.960
print and broadcast in
quite traditional ways.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.570
And this is a new situation
full of opportunities

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.720
for platform companies
and for publishers alike.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.520
And of course, also one
where increasingly we are all

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.180
competing for attention,
precious, precious attention

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.490
of getting onto the lock
screen of these supercomputers

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:50.530
we increasingly all
carry in our pockets.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:55.120
So head-to-head
competition for attention.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.800
Publishers are
pushing back here.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.383
Publishers who may
have felt that they

00:19:58.383 --> 00:20:01.060
were in a zero-sum game between
platforms and publishers

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.130
are in some markets by
now really leveraging

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:05.380
this mobile opportunity
to get their alerts

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.420
onto the lock screen
of smartphones.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:09.700
We see a resurgent
interest in mobile apps.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.590
We see mobile alerts.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:12.820
We see email newsletters.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:15.670
We see the different ways in
which publishers are really

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:18.987
fighting back to capture a share
of people's attention in part

00:20:18.987 --> 00:20:20.570
by leveraging this
mobile opportunity.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.450
But again, of
course, this is also

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:24.610
linked to the rise of
platforms in the sense

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:27.100
that we know from our research
that people who use mobile

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:29.770
are also more likely
to use social media

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:33.002
and search to get news, even
controlling for other factors.

00:20:33.002 --> 00:20:34.960
So the rise of mobile
and the rise of platforms

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.814
here is interlinked.

00:20:35.814 --> 00:20:37.480
And though publishers
are fighting back,

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.070
it is clear that platform
companies have often

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:40.974
been the best at
serving the mobile user

00:20:40.974 --> 00:20:42.640
and better than
publishers in many cases

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.100
and for many problems.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.670
This leads me to the question
of the business of journalism.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:50.500
And I think in
some ways, this is

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.050
where things get a little
bit trickier in the sense

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:55.390
that in many ways, the
world that we are describing

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:56.897
with our research
and our data is

00:20:56.897 --> 00:20:59.230
a wonderful world in many
ways, much better than the one

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:02.857
I grew up in, where multi
sort of media diversity

00:21:02.857 --> 00:21:04.690
meant a couple of
different print newspapers

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:06.100
and a couple of different
broadcast channels.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.600
This is a much better world
from my point of view as a user.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.849
I have access to more different
sources of information

00:21:10.849 --> 00:21:11.800
than ever before.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.480
They are generally free at
the point of consumption.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.830
I can find them
in many more ways.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:16.060
They are more
conveniently available

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.460
through my mobile phone than
they ever were in the past.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.710
This is great.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.770
And it's even a world in
which, contrary to fear

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.290
of filter bubbles and
the like, we actually

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.415
find that many people are
exposed to much more news

00:21:25.415 --> 00:21:27.850
than they would seek out
of their own volition.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.370
But there is a catch,
which is the question

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.710
of the funding of this news,
the professional production

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:33.293
of journalism.

00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:34.990
And it is worth
keeping in mind here

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:38.140
that when we look at who
invests in professional news

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:41.020
production, which,
warts and all--

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.020
nothing is perfect-- we
know from a lot of research

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:46.480
helps people be more
informed about public life,

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.820
help people be more engaged
with local communities,

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.560
help people take part in
the political process.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.790
So again, news is not perfect.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:53.956
News is very far from
perfect, but we know from lots

00:21:53.956 --> 00:21:56.946
of research it has positive
civic and political

00:21:56.946 --> 00:21:58.820
consequences when people
actually engage with

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.611
professionally-produced
journalism and that

00:22:00.611 --> 00:22:02.890
the existence of
such journalism--

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.590
again, with all its
imperfections-- demonstrably

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.254
help hold power to account,
reduce corruption and the

00:22:08.254 --> 00:22:09.670
like in countries
around the world

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:11.050
and communities
around the world.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:13.390
Who invests in this journalism?

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.910
Well, in this
country, even today--

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:19.000
that skipped one slide--

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.850
about 60% of investment
in professionally-produced

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:24.910
journalism, if we go by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics,

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:27.430
employment of reporters
and correspondents

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:29.530
comes from print publishers.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.192
Newspaper organizations who
still generally make 80% or 90%

00:22:32.192 --> 00:22:34.150
of their revenues from
their offline operations

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:38.380
that are in steep decline and
who are investing ambitiously

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.330
in their digital
operations and are reaching

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.600
significant audiences there
but are facing difficulties

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.880
in getting a return
on that investment

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:48.680
and generating a profit from
their digital investments.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:51.635
So news is still primarily
funded by newspaper publishers

00:22:51.635 --> 00:22:53.260
with their digital
operations, but much

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:55.780
of the revenue coming from
legacy operations and print.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:59.177
And online media information
is a much smaller part of this.

00:22:59.177 --> 00:23:01.510
Though, of course, it is a
much larger share of people's

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.510
attention and of the advertising
market, increasingly.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:05.350
The funding?

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.720
Well, historically the
funding in the United States,

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.610
in particular, came
from advertising.

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:11.020
Newspaper publishers
historically

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:14.320
made something like 80% or
even 90% of their revenues

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.490
from advertising.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:16.960
That advertising
now increasingly

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.280
goes to digital media.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:20.052
This is a well-known story.

00:23:20.052 --> 00:23:22.510
American newspapers used to
make something like $60 billion

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:24.100
a year in print advertising.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:26.260
Now it's more like 20.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.739
And digital, of course, has
grown very, very rapidly.

00:23:28.739 --> 00:23:30.280
When it comes to
digital advertising,

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.130
they are competing head-to-head
with very, very successful

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.329
companies, like Google.

00:23:35.329 --> 00:23:37.870
So when we look at the share of
digital advertising globally,

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:41.960
these are estimates of the share
captured by two large platform

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:42.460
companies.

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.010
Blue at the bottom is Google.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:48.250
The pinkish color is Facebook.

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:50.710
And then the orange
part at the top--

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:52.000
about half of the pie--

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.160
is what everybody
else in the world

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.340
competes for in terms
of digital advertising.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:59.144
So advertising alone has been a
very tough business proposition

00:23:59.144 --> 00:24:01.060
for the professional
production of journalism,

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.340
which can be quite
expensive and where

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.310
the average revenues per user
for the digital operation

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:07.330
has been quite low.

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:09.500
And advertising has
been tough to get

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.500
to generate the kind of
revenues that publishers

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.916
have been hoping
for and that they

00:24:12.916 --> 00:24:15.940
have generated in the past.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.740
So many have turned to pay.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:21.580
We find in our survey that 13%
of our respondents across 36

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:25.510
markets say that they pay in
some form for news online.

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:27.430
Highest in the Nordic
countries in Europe,

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:30.790
lower in a country like the
UK, where I live currently.

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:32.230
And in this country,
in the US, we

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.646
have seen evidence of what we
think of as sort of a "Trump

00:24:34.646 --> 00:24:37.136
bump," if you will, where
a number of publishers

00:24:37.136 --> 00:24:39.760
have seen a real increase in the
number of people who have been

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.471
willing to pay for
their journalism,

00:24:41.471 --> 00:24:42.970
perhaps in part
because of this more

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:45.460
polarized political environment,
where there's been attacks

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.340
on the value of journalism
but also a certain rallying,

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.170
if you will, around
the importance

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:53.350
of journalistic organizations
as part of the functioning

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.915
democracy.

00:24:53.915 --> 00:24:56.290
And we've seen individual
titles, whether The Wall Street

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:58.300
Journal, "The New Yorker,"
or The New York Times

00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.680
reportedly benefiting from this.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.960
And we see, again, in the
survey a clear upwards tick

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.180
in the number of people
who pays for news.

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.320
Now, while it is a challenging
environment for publishers,

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.390
I think there is no
question that there is also

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:11.520
opportunities ahead.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.270
And I think one of the
opportunities ahead

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:16.600
really is this, if you
will, increasing evidence

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.537
that if you do really good
journalism that really connects

00:25:19.537 --> 00:25:21.370
with the problems that
people actually have,

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.422
the concerns that they
actually care about,

00:25:23.422 --> 00:25:25.630
and if you are able to serve
it to them in a way that

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:30.010
is convenient, whether that
is via platform companies

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:31.900
or through your own
apps and websites,

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.639
or some combination
thereof, you can not only

00:25:34.639 --> 00:25:36.430
monetize that attention
through advertising

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:39.700
and other auxiliary revenues,
but also increasingly convince

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.710
people this is actually
worth paying for.

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:45.760
This has value that I will
pay honest dollars for.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.700
And importantly, it
is not only those

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.410
who already pay for print.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.790
It is not only older people
who are willing to pay.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:54.790
So when you break
down the pay behavior

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:58.330
by age, contrary to this
idea that some older

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:02.519
sort of commentators on the
digital media environment may--

00:26:02.519 --> 00:26:04.060
the comments they
may make sometimes,

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.830
it's not a question of
sort of millennials,

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.690
quote unquote, "to be the
blame for all this stuff."

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:09.430
In fact, we find
that younger people

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:13.540
are more likely to say that
they're paying for news online.

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:14.950
Probably, in large
part, at least

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:16.570
we would argue,
because they don't

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:19.280
have a reference price of zero.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.989
Unlike old people
like myself, who

00:26:21.989 --> 00:26:24.280
have grown up in a world in
which everything online was

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:24.880
free--

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.852
and I'm sort of mildly
offended whenever

00:26:26.852 --> 00:26:28.810
anyone wants to charge
me for something online.

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:30.712
I have to get used
to that idea that I

00:26:30.712 --> 00:26:32.170
have to pay for
things online, just

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:33.711
as I have to pay
for things elsewhere

00:26:33.711 --> 00:26:35.027
if I want something premium.

00:26:35.027 --> 00:26:36.610
Younger people who
are younger than me

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:38.484
have grown up in an
environment where they've

00:26:38.484 --> 00:26:40.110
been used to paying
for things online,

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.610
in particular on their phone,
from the get-go, whether these

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.640
are music services, like
Spotify, premium video

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.730
and entertainment, like
Netflix, or for that matter,

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:50.650
mobile applications
and games online.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:53.537
And in that context, it is
no longer sort of shocking

00:26:53.537 --> 00:26:55.870
or scandalous to suggest that
if you want a premium news

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.880
product, you may actually
have to pay for it.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.650
And in fact, we
have, again, evidence

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:02.344
here that young people are no
less likely than older people

00:27:02.344 --> 00:27:03.010
to pay for news.

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:04.540
And I think this
is, if you will,

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.030
an opportunity, a
business opportunity

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:09.550
to say to publishers that
not only is it the case today

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:12.530
that the best journalism is
better than it's ever been--

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:15.640
and also, from a user point
of view, easier to access,

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.310
easier to find,
more convenient--

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:21.430
it's also something that at
least a part of the population,

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:24.380
primarily more affluent and
privileged news lovers--

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.620
so there are issues of
social inequality here--

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.270
but that at least
some people find

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:30.990
it's actually worth paying for.

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.530
OK.

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:35.640
Key questions, and I'll
leave these on the slides

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.680
before we kick off the
discussion with Erica.

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.000
But from my point
of view, I suppose,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.541
some of the key questions that
we are left with this research

00:27:41.541 --> 00:27:44.640
is, first, the
question of whether we

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.640
can help more effectively
as researchers, as platform

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.772
companies, as publishers,
can help people

00:27:49.772 --> 00:27:52.230
more effectively navigate this
distributed environment that

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:55.980
is so rich but also so
confusing in some cases and full

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.280
of pitfalls.

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.450
There's a question of whether
publishers and platforms can

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:03.270
help restore trust and
credibility in news

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:05.850
and information, I think is
another issue where there might

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:08.100
be space for shared action.

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.830
It is a question of whether
publishing platforms who

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.650
have co-existed, sometimes
fractiously, for quite

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.090
some time now have
learned enough

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:17.670
from that history
of collaboration

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:21.540
and occasional confrontations
to find a more mutually

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.030
satisfactory settlement for
coexistence in the future as we

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:26.113
move towards these new
forms of platform services,

00:28:26.113 --> 00:28:28.500
whether messaging apps,
or voice-operated systems,

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.001
or for that matter,
virtual reality.

00:28:30.001 --> 00:28:31.750
Whether we've learned
enough from the past

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.609
to find a better
settlement for the future

00:28:33.609 --> 00:28:36.150
that works for publishers, for
platforms, and for the public,

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:37.960
too.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.710
There is a question
about publishers, too.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:42.420
About whether they
are sufficiently

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.167
ambitiously embracing
the opportunities

00:28:44.167 --> 00:28:45.000
of this environment.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.520
Or whether they are
sometimes, if you will,

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.440
captured by the
glory of their past

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.792
rather than the promise
of their future.

00:28:52.792 --> 00:28:54.750
And finally, of course,
this question of money.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:55.874
Who's going to pay?

00:28:55.874 --> 00:28:58.290
And I hope we can get to grips
with those questions today.

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:00.248
So I look forward to the
discussion with Erica.

00:29:00.248 --> 00:29:01.109
Thank you very much.

00:29:01.109 --> 00:29:06.147
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:06.147 --> 00:29:07.230
ERICA ANDERSON: Thank you.

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:08.030
Testing.

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:10.100
All right.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.030
Thank you so much.

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:12.620
That was fascinating.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:15.200
And I'm sure everyone
in the audience agrees.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.270
Let's just take a step back.

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:20.540
So this is the sixth year
that Reuters Institute

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.130
has done this study.

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:24.980
This is the biggest one
by far, 36 countries.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.170
I think you interviewed
70,000 people,

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:29.520
both quantitative and
qualitative research.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.590
Like zoom out for us.

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:35.000
What was perhaps most
interesting or out of character

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.680
for this report that you saw
compared to the five before?

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.960
RASMUS KLEIS NIELSEN: I think
in some ways, this year,

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:46.100
with the expansion of the number
of countries we were covering,

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.060
I think the most important
findings are not always

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.060
surprising, if you will.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.510
And I've tried to cover
some of them today.

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:53.930
But I think some of the ones
that were revelatory for us

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:55.305
and really
interesting are really

00:29:55.305 --> 00:29:58.280
about the international
comparisons.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.820
I believe very firmly that
just the same way as news

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:03.690
organizations and tech
companies elsewhere

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:06.740
can learn from what happens in a
country like the United States,

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.510
so, too, people here
can learn from what's

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:09.843
going on elsewhere in the world.

00:30:09.843 --> 00:30:11.880
And I would highlight
two examples.

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:16.280
One is that journalists in
this country and commentators

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.310
in this country might feel that
an environment characterized

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:24.800
by political polarization, low
trust in political institutions

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.350
and the media, and
media organizations

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:29.720
with limited newsrooms and
often shrinking newsrooms

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.290
is sort of a shocking and
new situation in the US.

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:36.380
I have colleagues from Italy
and from Greece who would say,

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.670
welcome to the club.

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:39.174
This is nothing new.

00:30:39.174 --> 00:30:41.340
And I think there is a real
idea there, if you will,

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:42.980
that we can sort of
use data like this

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:45.860
to start a
conversation about how

00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.720
publishers and platforms,
for that matter,

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:50.510
in a country like this can learn
from the experience of people

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:53.270
elsewhere who have long
tried to have a functioning

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:54.770
public debate in
an environment that

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:57.530
was much more challenging than
the US was till not so long

00:30:57.530 --> 00:30:58.620
ago.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:00.470
The other I think
surprising finding

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:03.320
I would highlight in terms of
sort of the new things that

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.567
were new for us in this
year's report is I think the--

00:31:07.567 --> 00:31:09.150
and again, as an
example, if you will,

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:10.775
of the value of
looking at developments

00:31:10.775 --> 00:31:13.910
elsewhere to sort of supplement
one's understanding of one's

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:15.802
own national and
local context is

00:31:15.802 --> 00:31:17.510
that it's been really
interesting to look

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:19.250
more closely at Asia-Pacific.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:22.370
Where I think it's easy to
overlook for people in North

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:27.080
America and Western Europe that
many markets in Asia-Pacific--

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.630
Taiwan, Hong Kong,
to some extent

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:32.550
Japan and South Korea, and
Singapore, for that matter--

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:34.777
are technologically
ahead in many ways.

00:31:34.777 --> 00:31:36.610
Higher levels of internet
use, higher levels

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:38.601
of smartphone use,
younger populations

00:31:38.601 --> 00:31:40.100
who have taken to
digital media more

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.190
quickly than more aging
populations, in particular,

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.910
in Europe.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:45.410
And I think it's
interesting to note

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:47.034
that in these
environments, while there

00:31:47.034 --> 00:31:49.580
is no question that platform
companies are absolutely

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:52.550
central to how people
find and access news,

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:56.240
it is also clear that not
all publishers but the most

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.740
successful and
aggressive publishers

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.781
have been able to carve
out a role for themselves

00:31:59.781 --> 00:32:01.400
in that environment.

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:05.480
Whether this is a tabloid title
like Apple Daily in Hong Kong

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.700
or The Straits
Times in Singapore,

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.190
that there are news
organizations there

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.447
that are really,
if you will, have

00:32:12.447 --> 00:32:17.960
been-- have found a space in a
truly digital first and mobile

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.620
first and platform-shaped
environment that I think

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:23.120
many North American and Western
European publishers are only

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.900
beginning to
imagine, if you will.

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:27.680
ERICA ANDERSON: So you're
optimistic in looking at APAC

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.889
and seeing the collaboration?

00:32:28.889 --> 00:32:30.013
RASMUS KLEIS NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:32:30.013 --> 00:32:32.360
I mean, I'm very
optimistic in many ways.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.760
I think there are very,
very real challenges

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.120
around the question of the
business of journalism.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:41.480
And I think that challenge
is one we cannot ignore.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.750
The precondition of professional
and necessary but not

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.360
sufficient precondition for
professional autonomous news

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.337
production is profitability.

00:32:49.337 --> 00:32:51.920
And if this cannot be achieved,
then there is a serious market

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.310
failure that has profound
democratic and public

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:56.450
implications.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:33:00.080
But as serious as
that challenge is,

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.200
there is no question that in
many other ways, the media

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:08.500
environment we have today is
much better for our abilities

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.880
as citizens, provided
we have the inclination,

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.857
to find and access information
than it ever was in the past.

00:33:13.857 --> 00:33:15.440
ERICA ANDERSON: Let's
take a step back

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.870
and talk about trust,
which you brought up

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:21.440
in showing the chart of trust
across the 36 countries,

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.910
and the point you made about
polarization in society leading

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.370
to less trust in news.

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:32.930
Just to quote the report, "less
than half the population, 43%,

00:33:32.930 --> 00:33:36.140
trust the media across
all 36 countries surveyed.

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:39.140
And almost a third
actively avoid the news."

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.450
That number rises
to 38% in the US.

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:45.210
So for me, the headline there
is less trust equals less news.

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:47.580
If you don't trust the
news, you don't consume it.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.705
RASMUS KLEIS NIELSEN: Yeah.

00:33:48.705 --> 00:33:51.500
I mean, I think
there is a real--

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.514
two problems that are
compounding each other

00:33:53.514 --> 00:33:54.680
around trust and confidence.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:57.950
One is that this undermines
the ability of journalism

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:00.510
to play its role
in our democracy.

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:03.200
It also undermines the ability
of the business of news

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.370
to sustain journalism itself.

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:08.610
And this crisis of confidence,
I think in part, in large part,

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:10.679
is about politics.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:14.781
Journalism primarily
covers public institutions.

00:34:14.781 --> 00:34:16.739
And if those public
institutions themselves are

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:19.469
deeply riven with conflict
and are populated in part

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:23.187
by elected officials who not
only question the integrity

00:34:23.187 --> 00:34:25.020
and motives of each
other, but also actively

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.449
campaign against
the news itself,

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:30.179
this has consequences
for people's perception

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:32.880
of journalism as well as
those public institutions.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.969
I think there is also a question
in many cases of a disconnect

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:38.610
between the content produced
by even the best news

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:41.969
organizations and the
concerns of many individuals.

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:44.394
Whether these are around
issues of inequality

00:34:44.394 --> 00:34:46.560
and marginalization, where
there are many people who

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.780
understandably do
not feel represented

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.854
by journalism in terms
of diversity, of gender,

00:34:51.854 --> 00:34:54.330
of sexuality, of
race, and ethnicity,

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:55.889
whether it's around class--

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:57.870
increasingly,
journalism is basically

00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:00.300
done by people like
me for people like me.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:04.230
And there is a question about
whether a lot of very good--

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:07.730
otherwise very good journalism--
actually confronts the people--

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:09.960
the problems that people
feel that they have.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:12.750
And there is, if
you will, sometimes

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:16.200
an issue of a risk
that people will

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.960
judge the totality of the
journalistic profession,

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.020
the output of the entire media
institution, by, if you will,

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.610
the excesses of the worst.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:26.640
So this perception that because
much journalism, or at least

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.180
some journalism, is about
sensationalist coverage

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.310
of crime, terrorism,
celebrity gossip,

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:34.890
and the like, then surely all
journalism must be like this.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:37.264
And then I don't want to pay
attention to it because it's

00:35:37.264 --> 00:35:38.620
depressing and irrelevant.

00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:41.370
ERICA ANDERSON: It certainly
feels like a crisis and one

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:44.130
that we've seen for
the last 10 years

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:46.910
with the changes
in, as you said,

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:48.449
decentralized distribution.

00:35:48.449 --> 00:35:49.990
We're no longer
getting the newspaper

00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:52.290
and reading it in the
morning with a cup of coffee.

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.420
Maybe some people are,
but habits are changing.

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:55.494
Revenue is changing.

00:35:55.494 --> 00:35:56.910
Certainly, a lot
of disruption has

00:35:56.910 --> 00:36:00.430
occurred on behalf of
technology and platforms.

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:01.740
But there are signs of life.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:02.781
I mean, it's interesting.

00:36:02.781 --> 00:36:04.980
You showed that
example about the,

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:06.289
quote unquote, "Trump bump."

00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:07.830
That subscriptions
increased at least

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:09.900
for a few national
organizations.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:10.830
I mean, talk to me.

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:13.260
What did you learn
about subscriptions

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:14.267
and the ways in which--

00:36:14.267 --> 00:36:16.350
that really compelling
statistic that young people

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:17.850
are willing to pay for news?

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:20.082
You said earlier there's
this reference point.

00:36:20.082 --> 00:36:21.540
They're willing to
pay for Spotify.

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:22.620
They're willing to
pay for Netflix.

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.280
They're willing to pay for news.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.070
Talk about that if you can.

00:36:26.070 --> 00:36:27.195
RASMUS KLEIS NIELSEN: Sure.

00:36:27.195 --> 00:36:30.004
I mean, I want to stress that
the situation here is complex,

00:36:30.004 --> 00:36:31.170
and there are real problems.

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:32.910
And I don't want to sugarcoat
any of those problems.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:34.285
And those problems
are very often

00:36:34.285 --> 00:36:36.220
around business as
well as politics.

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:38.730
But I also really want to
underline that it really

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:40.590
is the best of times
and the worst of times

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:41.350
at the same time.

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:42.183
I'm not a pessimist.

00:36:42.183 --> 00:36:44.970
And I think in many ways,
again, the information available

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:47.400
and the ways in which we
can find this information

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:51.090
are vastly superior to the
ones that I grew up with.

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:53.617
I don't know anyone under
40 who would willingly

00:36:53.617 --> 00:36:55.950
trade the media environment
we live in today for the one

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:56.950
that I grew up with.

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:59.340
And I share that view myself.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:03.270
So it is a situation that's
characterized by many problems,

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:06.180
but not only problems--
also huge opportunities.

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.820
In terms of
willingness to pay, I

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:13.020
think there is a real
sort of question of how

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:15.690
to manage transition here.

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:18.480
A lot of news
organizations have,

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:21.524
for understandable reasons,
but perhaps in retrospect,

00:37:21.524 --> 00:37:23.940
reasons that were a little bit
short-sighted-- this is not

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:25.565
a criticism of any
individual involved,

00:37:25.565 --> 00:37:27.810
but simply an
observation-- have tended

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:30.660
to navigate by quite short-term
metrics of maximizing

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:35.664
page views that in turn were
used to sell advertising.

00:37:35.664 --> 00:37:37.080
If you have done
that for 10 or 20

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:41.760
years and people have formed
their view of journalism

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.180
on the basis of encountering
your brand primarily

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:48.210
through the lens of things
that can uncharitably be called

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:51.130
"clickbait," then turning around
and saying, oh, by the way,

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:53.340
you should pay me
$20 a month for this,

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:55.770
is a tough transition to make.

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:58.140
And I think there is
quite a profound question

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:02.250
that a lot of news organizations
are really only beginning

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:04.770
to seriously ask
themselves, which is, what

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:06.810
is the problem that we solve?

00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:07.440
OK?

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:08.940
Not the problem
we used to solve.

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.220
Not the problem that our
civics teacher in high school

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.594
will tell us that
we are solving,

00:38:12.594 --> 00:38:14.220
but the problem that
we actually solve

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:16.390
for actual people
in our community.

00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:17.520
What is that problem?

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.517
And can we actually solve that
in a way that is effectively

00:38:20.517 --> 00:38:21.600
addressing the people of--

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.357
the issues faced by
real people out there,

00:38:23.357 --> 00:38:25.440
and also done so in a way
that's convenient enough

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.050
to get their attention
and to get them to engage,

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:30.870
and is done in a way that
is cost-efficient enough

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:36.270
that one can do it on the basis
of revenues that will almost

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:38.880
inevitably be smaller than
the one news organizations had

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:40.410
in the 1990s?

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:42.670
ERICA ANDERSON: So I want
anyone in the audience

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:44.790
who have questions to
start thinking of those.

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:46.950
And please, line up if
you have a question.

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:52.260
Let's talk about social
media and messaging.

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:54.300
Because one of the
findings from the report

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:57.081
is actually consumption
of news on social media

00:38:57.081 --> 00:38:58.455
is flattening out
in some places,

00:38:58.455 --> 00:39:02.370
but there's a huge increase, I
think last year a 15% increase,

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:05.580
in people consuming
news on WhatsApp.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.080
On Facebook Messenger,
I think there

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:10.944
were 30,000 bots, since that
started, delivering news.

00:39:10.944 --> 00:39:13.110
So we're beginning to see
this transition, actually,

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:16.530
into closed networks, into
messaging apps for news.

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:18.360
Can you talk a little
bit about that--

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.310
what you see as the
trend, having spent time

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:22.320
in Hong Kong,
Singapore, in Asia?

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.600
What can the US or
European countries

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.300
learn from how news is
being delivered and consumed

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:28.259
through messaging apps?

00:39:28.259 --> 00:39:30.383
RASMUS KLEIS NIELSEN: I
mean, I think those are all

00:39:30.383 --> 00:39:32.070
early indications of how--

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:33.690
and again, this is
more than anything

00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:36.150
a challenge for the
journalistic profession itself

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:38.460
and for those--
the wider ecosystem

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.910
of people who care about
it, whether ordinary users,

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:44.052
or platform companies, or
researchers like myself,

00:39:44.052 --> 00:39:45.510
is the question
of, how do we think

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:49.650
about the act of
journalism itself

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:52.560
if we are leaving behind the
shackles of how journalism

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.300
was done in the past?

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.970
A lot of journalism is
still primarily produced

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:58.890
in the form of an
article that is

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:02.640
instantly recognizable as an
artifact of print technology.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:03.390
It has the length.

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:04.530
It has the look.

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:06.990
It is largely dictated by how
things were done in the past.

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:09.300
It has evolved, but not much.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.120
Or the short news clip that was
part of a broadcast bulletin,

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.462
two and a half minute video.

00:40:13.462 --> 00:40:15.170
There's nothing wrong
with these formats.

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:17.970
I consume them everyday
myself-- sometimes gladly,

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:20.444
sometimes, with
mild disgruntlement.

00:40:20.444 --> 00:40:22.110
But I think there is
a real question of,

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:22.950
what do we think about?

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:24.990
What is the act of
journalism or the profession

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:26.070
and the practice of journalism?

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:27.920
What does it look like
beyond the article?

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.380
What comes after the
article or the news clip?

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:34.220
What is the way in which
journalists can find a position

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:38.120
in that ecosystem, whether
it is the mobile experience

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.980
or this distributed
environment where

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:43.970
I think we have to accept
that for most people,

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:47.210
journalism will be a smaller
part of a larger media

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:50.250
experience than it
was in the past?

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:53.120
And I think in some ways, this
may be tough for the journalism

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.230
profession to confront.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:56.990
But if it is a fact, then it's
incumbent on the profession

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:59.210
to face this fact
and then think about,

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:01.407
how can you solve
problems if you

00:41:01.407 --> 00:41:02.990
have less of people's
attention or you

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:04.760
have to work harder to get it?

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.884
And I think that apps
are interesting here.

00:41:06.884 --> 00:41:08.300
I think bots are
interesting here.

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:13.510
I think rethinking the format,
whether slideshows or videos.

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:15.820
And this whole idea
that increasingly, I

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.570
think some of the most
innovative thinkers

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:18.830
in the profession,
in the industry,

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:20.600
are thinking about
journalism as a service

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.980
rather than as a product.

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:27.020
Rather than just churning out,
frankly, 200 articles a day

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.390
or video enough for a
30-minute broadcast bulletin

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:33.050
that's then cut up and
loaded onto social media,

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:36.085
what does it look like if you're
no longer simply pushing out

00:41:36.085 --> 00:41:37.970
a product, but trying
to think from the needs

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:39.920
of different
communities and serving

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:41.330
those needs in different ways?

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:42.204
ERICA ANDERSON: Yeah.

00:41:42.204 --> 00:41:45.650
I'm curious, what platforms--
you talk a bit about platforms.

00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:47.377
Obviously, we're here at Google.

00:41:47.377 --> 00:41:49.460
We have a lot of people
inside the company working

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:53.670
to support journalists
and news organizations.

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:55.700
What have platforms done well?

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.440
What have they not
done enough of?

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.940
I mean, this is a transition.

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.980
It requires collaboration
and working together.

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.572
But from your perspective and
from what the report found,

00:42:03.572 --> 00:42:05.030
what are your
perspectives on this?

00:42:06.314 --> 00:42:08.480
RASMUS KLEIS NIELSEN: I
think the first thing to say

00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.700
is that different platform
companies are different.

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.830
And different publishers
have different needs.

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:14.900
So there is no
one sort of recipe

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.480
for what this relationship
should look like.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.870
And there is also, I think,
sometimes the slight risk

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:22.310
that when platforms
and publishers

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:25.550
start working together,
that the interests

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:27.230
of each individual
company can sometimes

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:29.910
overshadow the interests of the
user, the public, if you will.

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:31.534
And I think this is
a sort of a risk we

00:42:31.534 --> 00:42:33.110
need to be conscious of.

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:35.510
I think there are real
issues now that are already

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:36.696
beginning to be addressed--

00:42:36.696 --> 00:42:37.820
Google is involved in this.

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:40.070
Facebook is involved in this--

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:42.860
that are around trust
and verification.

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.575
So how to flak fake or
misleading content online,

00:42:47.575 --> 00:42:54.020
how to try to help more
clearly communicate the brands

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:56.011
whose reputation are
behind the content

00:42:56.011 --> 00:42:57.260
that people might come across.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:00.740
Google has worked on this in the
AMP carousel in search results.

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.930
Facebook has just
announced the integration

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:06.442
of brands in the articles
that show up in the news feed

00:43:06.442 --> 00:43:08.150
to sort of more clearly
communicate where

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:10.040
the information originates.

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:13.556
There's a whole set of
issues around helping

00:43:13.556 --> 00:43:14.930
people navigate
this environment,

00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:17.990
enabling effective use of it.

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:21.099
More fundamentally, I suppose
that the issue specifically

00:43:21.099 --> 00:43:22.640
between platforms
and publishers have

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:24.590
been around editorial control.

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:28.250
So who makes the decisions
about what is displayed where?

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:31.520
And how can publishers
influence those

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.040
so that they feel that
their content is not

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.560
only discoverable, but also
discoverable in a context

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:40.280
that they feel content with?

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.425
And this has been a
very long discussion

00:43:43.425 --> 00:43:45.800
between Google and publishers
as well as between Facebook

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:46.424
and publishers.

00:43:46.424 --> 00:43:49.080
Many people in the
room will be aware,

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:53.330
going back to Google News
and Google Search more than--

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.370
many years ago.

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:57.440
It's around data.

00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:01.130
So there is a question
of data that is

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:04.730
in part about commercial use.

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:07.160
Can data be shared in a
way that doesn't compromise

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:10.520
the privacy of users and that
enables not only platforms,

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.280
but also publishers to make
more informed decisions

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.460
about their content as
well as the advertising

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:19.850
and other forms of commercial
considerations that they have?

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:21.410
And then the final
one is revenue.

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:27.200
It's the question of, what is
a revenue split that reflects

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.370
the value being created?

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:31.640
And again, there's been a lot
of discussions around this

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:34.040
where some companies,
like Google,

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.896
have been invested in revenue
sharing around advertising.

00:44:36.896 --> 00:44:38.270
But there are
publishers who have

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:39.680
considerations around this.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:40.850
There are discussions
around Facebook

00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:42.480
around this sort of
question of monetization

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.430
of revenue sharing.

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:45.590
And there is the question
of whether platforms--

00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:48.710
in particular,
platforms in the West--

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:50.120
have been so
committed to an idea

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.860
or free at the
point of consumption

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.110
that they have made it
even harder for publishers

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:56.040
to actually start working
with subscriptions

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.819
and micro-payments
than it needed to be.

00:44:57.819 --> 00:45:00.110
And here, many publishers in
Asia-Pacific, for example,

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:04.252
would say that
companies like WeChat--

00:45:04.252 --> 00:45:06.710
the Tencent in China, their
social media platform, WeChat--

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:11.661
are ahead of where platform
companies are in the West.

00:45:11.661 --> 00:45:13.701
And actually, that platform
companies in the West

00:45:13.701 --> 00:45:16.220
could learn a lot from
e-commerce and social media

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:16.806
in China.

00:45:16.806 --> 00:45:17.930
ERICA ANDERSON: Well, good.

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:19.170
We're taking notes.

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:19.910
Thank you.

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:22.170
I think that one thing
I want to mention--

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:23.586
and we'll go to
this question-- is

00:45:23.586 --> 00:45:26.217
that from my perspective
on the News Lab,

00:45:26.217 --> 00:45:28.300
and working with industry
partners and journalists

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:29.890
around the world,
one of the trends

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:31.889
that I'm seeing that I
think is really important

00:45:31.889 --> 00:45:37.150
is utilizing and seeking more
information algorithmically

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:39.580
from journalists and
developers inside newsrooms

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.450
about the quality
of their content.

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:42.610
So a good example is--

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:47.110
or defining their content so
that we can more strategically

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:50.590
visualize it to consumers who--
there's a media literacy gap.

00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:51.490
Is this an op-ed?

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:52.930
Is this analysis?

00:45:52.930 --> 00:45:54.170
Is it reporting?

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:56.830
So we've launched a local
news tag, the fact check tag.

00:45:56.830 --> 00:46:00.670
And you know, that's all
schema, open web markup.

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:02.200
And so I mention it.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:02.860
It's technical.

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:03.610
It's in the weeds.

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:06.280
But I mention it because there's
this theme happening where

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:09.460
the platforms are trying to get
more information to showcase

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:12.490
the quality of the content
and to distinguish it.

00:46:12.490 --> 00:46:13.216
Question?

00:46:13.216 --> 00:46:13.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.810
I thought the point about
the echo chamber and filters

00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:18.940
was interesting, about
how people are actually

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:22.360
seeing content that they're
not normally exposed to.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.260
I was wondering, when you're
doing your research, how

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.610
you account for
how people report

00:46:27.610 --> 00:46:30.520
on what they behave versus
how they actually behave?

00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:33.760
Because I know a
lot of the time,

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.980
people will say that
they read certain things

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:37.270
but in actuality, they won't.

00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:39.250
So is there any kind
of research techniques

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:41.732
that you use to account
for that dichotomy?

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:42.940
RASMUS KLEIS NIELSEN: Thanks.

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:44.130
I think you're spot-on.

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:47.620
I mean, that's a key challenge
in doing any kind of research

00:46:47.620 --> 00:46:49.990
in this, in particular.

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:52.120
For this particular
research, we rely on recall.

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:54.970
So we have one set of questions
that are about asking people

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:57.330
to name sources of
news they've used

00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:00.010
in the last week, where they're
prompted with a list of brands.

00:47:00.010 --> 00:47:02.770
So that's where we know the
number of sources they've used.

00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:04.270
And then a separate
set of questions

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:05.936
that are around the
ways in which people

00:47:05.936 --> 00:47:07.480
say they come across news.

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:12.090
So for this particular analysis
of incidental exposure,

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:14.260
the figures both for
those who use social media

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:18.040
and those who don't are equally
susceptible to that problem

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.880
of recall-based
use, if you will.

00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:21.610
So it shouldn't
disproportionately

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:23.350
affect either one of them.

00:47:23.350 --> 00:47:27.706
The problem is real in the
sense most people don't recall

00:47:27.706 --> 00:47:29.830
everything they've done
and don't report everything

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:31.660
they've done accurately either.

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:35.420
So there is a real problem
of recall versus behavior.

00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:37.450
But in this particular
case, it should influence

00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:38.974
both sides of that equation.

00:47:38.974 --> 00:47:40.390
Now, a follow-up
piece of research

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.840
we did that was based on
actual behavioral data rather

00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:45.640
than self-reported
data is the deep dive

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:47.560
I mentioned around attribution.

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:51.460
In that case, we passively
tracked a panel of--

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:54.610
I believe we had about 6,000
working with our partner

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:58.000
company, YouGov, in the UK,
about 6,000 people in the UK

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:58.709
for a month.

00:47:58.709 --> 00:48:00.250
In that case, we
had behavioral data.

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:02.326
We knew what they had accessed.

00:48:02.326 --> 00:48:04.450
And we could count up the
number of different sites

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:06.460
they had accessed.

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:09.520
We haven't released the full
breakdown of that analysis yet,

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.140
but I will foreshadow
now and say

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:15.220
that the general
thrust of that analysis

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:16.930
is the same, is that
social media use

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:19.930
and search again is consistently
and significantly associated

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:23.317
with more diverse views than
not using those ways of access.

00:48:23.317 --> 00:48:24.150
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:26.029
RASMUS KLEIS NIELSEN: Thanks.

00:48:26.029 --> 00:48:26.570
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:29.960
I have a question about
any behavioral differences

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:32.930
you may have seen between the
people who actively seek news

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:35.210
out and those who
more come across it

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:37.220
on social media or elsewhere.

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:39.050
And then, if there
are differences,

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:41.630
is there a way to get that
second group of people

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:42.260
more engaged?

00:48:44.617 --> 00:48:47.200
RASMUS KLEIS NIELSEN: I'm really
glad you asked that question.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.780
I think that's, in many ways--

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:52.560
from my point of view, that's
probably the part of the public

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.870
that we should all think
the most about in the sense

00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:58.380
that, frankly, the news and
information needs of people

00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:00.896
like me are well-tended to.

00:49:00.896 --> 00:49:03.270
There have never been a more
privileged and spoiled group

00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:05.370
of media consumers
in human history

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:07.290
than people like me today.

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:08.950
I'll be fine.

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:11.040
But there is a question
of a much larger part

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:15.420
of the public who don't feel
motivated enough to seek out

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:18.960
journalism as we know it
today but may come across it

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.810
incidentally while doing
other things on social media.

00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:25.680
We are trying to drill
more deeply into this

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.742
because we are very
interested in that question.

00:49:27.742 --> 00:49:28.950
We think it's very important.

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:30.840
And we are particularly
concerned about this issue

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.214
that Erica also brought up of
news avoidance-- people who

00:49:33.214 --> 00:49:36.380
say that they actively avoid
the news, asking them why

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:39.310
and thinking about the ways
in which they navigate news.

00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:41.460
And I have to say that
the findings around that

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:44.880
are, I think, quite
sobering, both for journalism

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:46.980
and for the wider
public, and have

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:50.550
much less to do with technology
than one might imagine.

00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:54.060
Fundamentally, a combination--
our qualitative research

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:59.520
in the UK would suggest a very
low opinion of journalism.

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:04.680
Seeing it as sensationalist,
crime-oriented, terrorist,

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:08.280
alarmist, or superficial
celebrity gossip material,

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:10.350
which I personally don't
think is a fair judgment

00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:12.012
of journalism in its totality.

00:50:12.012 --> 00:50:13.970
But I don't blame people
for holding that view.

00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:15.761
I can find many examples
that would confirm

00:50:15.761 --> 00:50:17.540
that view of journalism.

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:20.850
So a sense of it as both
irrelevant and depressing,

00:50:20.850 --> 00:50:23.970
which is not something that
spurs much consumption,

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:28.110
combined with, I think,
a much deeper sense

00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:34.020
of disempowerment and
alienation from public affairs.

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:36.330
A sense that since
people like me--

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:37.980
interviewees would say to us--

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:40.260
can't do anything about
all these terrible things

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:43.050
we are told about in the
news everyday, why should we

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:43.720
pay attention?

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.192
How does that make
my life better?

00:50:45.192 --> 00:50:46.650
How does it make
my children's life

00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:48.900
better that I know that all
sorts of terrible things

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:51.250
are going on that I could
do nothing to change?

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:53.249
So I think there are real
issues that journalism

00:50:53.249 --> 00:50:55.020
need to confront there.

00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:57.690
And if journalism
does that, I guess

00:50:57.690 --> 00:51:03.030
I am optimistic that the
affordances of search

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.690
and social--

00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:04.800
and increasingly,
messaging and the like--

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.600
will actually help
people who are not

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.770
that motivated to engage
with more of that content.

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:10.530
But the content has to be there.

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:14.400
And it can't only be
the kind of journalism

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:17.050
that presupposes that people
are like me, that they follow

00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:20.100
with the obsession of
like a soap opera fanatic

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:22.504
and that I know all the
characters, and the drama,

00:51:22.504 --> 00:51:24.420
and what was on yesterday,
and that I can tell

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.080
the difference between
what Trump said this day

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.340
and what Jeff Sessions
said the other day

00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:28.980
and what John McCain
said the day before,

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:30.510
and what this, that,
and the other said.

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:32.310
If that's always the
premise, then you're

00:51:32.310 --> 00:51:34.320
always only going
to be able to engage

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.100
with the already engaged.

00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:39.174
And I think that is a real issue
now that we have to understand,

00:51:39.174 --> 00:51:40.590
that publishers
have to understand

00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:42.570
for the future of journalism
as a profession and the future

00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:44.490
of their business, but
one I think researchers

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:45.330
can help to understand, too.

00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:46.705
And hopefully,
platform companies

00:51:46.705 --> 00:51:49.410
can help us begin to address
those issues to ensure

00:51:49.410 --> 00:51:52.650
that the whole public is
informed and not only,

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:56.130
again, those who
are already engaged.

00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:58.090
ERICA ANDERSON: Thank you.

00:51:58.090 --> 00:51:59.850
Let's take one more question.

00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:01.090
You want to ask a question?

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:02.330
Yeah, go for it.

00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:03.090
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:05.060
So first of all,
thank you for coming.

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:08.820
My question kind of relates to
the proliferation of fake news.

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:11.610
And I guess I'm wondering,
in terms of like search

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:16.920
engines and social media, are
news sites, like infowars.com,

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:20.160
[INAUDIBLE] news, sites
that are known to publish

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:23.880
just inaccurate information,
do you feel or do you know

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:28.890
if they've gotten, I guess like,
a jump on known trusted brands,

00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:31.470
like The Washington
Post, Guardian, BBC,

00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:33.750
in terms of investing
in things like SEO,

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:36.510
or partnerships with
social media platforms,

00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:38.572
and different things like that?

00:52:38.572 --> 00:52:39.780
RASMUS KLEIS NIELSEN: Thanks.

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:42.630
What a fantastic round
of questions, by the way.

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:45.514
I think there are
initiatives underway now.

00:52:45.514 --> 00:52:47.430
And Erica rightly
highlighted some of the ones

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:48.490
that Google are involved in.

00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:50.490
But there are a couple
of different initiatives

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:53.670
also by other players, like
First Draft Coalition working

00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:56.100
with tech companies
as well as publishers

00:52:56.100 --> 00:53:00.615
to try to identify signals that
could be machine [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:00.615 --> 00:53:03.240
to address some of these issues
around what kind of information

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:04.899
surfaces.

00:53:04.899 --> 00:53:06.690
I think that's incredibly
important in part

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:14.370
because I think the real head
start that some sites have

00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:17.412
who are not always equally
committed to the idea

00:53:17.412 --> 00:53:19.620
of journalists being sort
of find truth and report it

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:26.250
or fact-based discourse is
more that you can express

00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:29.130
your opinions about public
affairs a hell of a lot faster

00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:31.650
than you can report on
what actually happened.

00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:34.350
And as long as search
and social privileges

00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:40.400
speed over almost
any other signal,

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:44.900
then there will inevitably be at
least a period of time in which

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:48.980
those who are brazen enough
to simply say what they think

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:51.020
has happened around
some public event

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:54.260
and promote it aggressively,
using SEO and SMO, and so

00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:58.520
on and so forth, but just
saying what they think happened,

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:00.410
that will have at least
a window where they

00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:04.580
dominate public discussion.

00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:09.347
I think the broader issue
is that in terms of--

00:54:09.347 --> 00:54:10.680
there's much that could be done.

00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.440
And I'm glad to hear that
much of it is underway

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.600
and that people like yourself
with a journalistic background

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:16.683
are involved in this in
addition to technologists,

00:54:16.683 --> 00:54:19.680
who need to be part of
solving this problem.

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:23.300
I think the next
complication, I suppose,

00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:29.670
is that there are things
that are demonstrably false

00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:32.670
and that are published either
with the intent of profiting

00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:34.680
from it or with the
intent of influencing

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:37.530
political processes, whether
it's state-backed propaganda

00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:39.644
or people who are
very ideologically

00:54:39.644 --> 00:54:41.310
committed to a certain
view of the world

00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:44.159
and do it as sort of
activists, if you will.

00:54:44.159 --> 00:54:46.200
But I think there is a
much broader set of issues

00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:50.010
that are more about
partisanship, if you will,

00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:54.580
than they're about
being fake or false.

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:57.290
And that, I think, will be a
hard engineering challenge,

00:54:57.290 --> 00:54:59.080
if you will.

00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:01.690
I live in the UK.

00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:05.650
The Guardian is a clearly
opinionated news organization.

00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:08.876
The Mail Online is a clearly
opinionated news organizations.

00:55:08.876 --> 00:55:10.750
They may publish things
that some people find

00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:13.060
infuriating that
will be selective,

00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.960
that will be partisan, that will
interpret things and perhaps

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:20.680
even sort of push an argument
to its outer boundaries,

00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:21.680
if you will.

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:23.340
But they won't be fake.

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:27.490
And it will be very hard to
think of a technical solution

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:29.440
to adjudicating
that information,

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:31.990
or whether we even should want
a technical solution to that.

00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:34.360
I personally believe that
we want a robust exchange

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.460
of views in public.

00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:41.770
What we don't want is to reward
malicious misinformation, which

00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:45.680
I think we have seen some
of in some countries.

00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:46.513
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:55:46.513 --> 00:55:47.596
ERICA ANDERSON: Thank you.

00:55:47.596 --> 00:55:48.850
Well, we're at the end.

00:55:48.850 --> 00:55:52.420
I want to just ask you, since
we have you here, last question.

00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:54.070
Next year, looking a year ahead.

00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:55.778
If you could look into
your crystal ball,

00:55:55.778 --> 00:55:57.490
what do you think
the headline will be?

00:55:57.490 --> 00:56:00.190
What are you anticipating
might change?

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:04.777
I mean, is there anything
you're thinking about right now?

00:56:04.777 --> 00:56:07.110
RASMUS KLEIS NIELSEN: I mean,
I think the issue of trust

00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:10.180
is one we really want
to try to bottom out.

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:13.130
And we'll do more
research in that area.

00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:16.420
And I have taken some
suggestions today

00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:18.430
from conversations here
and from conversations

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:21.014
with other publishers where we
are trying to understand better

00:56:21.014 --> 00:56:23.471
the flow of information in
these more private environments,

00:56:23.471 --> 00:56:26.110
like messaging apps, and really
trying to better track that.

00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:28.859
But of course, we are
vulnerable to the issues

00:56:28.859 --> 00:56:31.150
like the ones that were raised
by an earlier question--

00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:33.362
that at the end of the
day, our ability to map

00:56:33.362 --> 00:56:35.320
this stuff relies on
people actually telling us

00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:36.340
what they're doing.

00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:39.250
So we have some
ideas for next year.

00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:42.029
And we will sort of try to
pursue them at our modest best.

00:56:42.029 --> 00:56:43.570
And we also hope
for more suggestions

00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:46.600
from people like yourself
as well as publishers

00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.599
and academics and
researchers elsewhere

00:56:48.599 --> 00:56:50.890
who, like us, are trying to
understand what the hell is

00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:53.050
going on with news
and information

00:56:53.050 --> 00:56:54.250
in this brave new world.

00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:54.670
ERICA ANDERSON: Good.

00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:56.280
Well, thank you so
much for coming.

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:57.613
RASMUS KLEIS NIELSEN: Thank you.

00:56:57.613 --> 00:56:59.330
