00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.350
&gt;&gt; Let's get right
to the business

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:20.160
of why we're really here, what
you see here, Kim Roberts.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.880
She is the author of "A Literary
Guide to Washington, DC:

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.400
Walking in the Footsteps
of American Writers"

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.790
from Francis Scott Key to Zora
Neale Hurston and we are--

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.810
and usually having books in
the back for sale and there's

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.930
at the-- we're being
offered a reduced rate.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.830
And of course since we're the
Library of Congress it's also,

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.380
you know, [inaudible],
so that's always nice.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.370
So you guys have got
very [inaudible] entity.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.860
And we also-- After the
talk we will have a display.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.490
But she is the author of this
book and five books of poems,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.460
most recently "The
Scientific Method",

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.680
"WordTech Editions" from 2017.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.210
She co-edits the
"Beltway Poetry Quarterly"

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.640
and the web exhibit,
DC Writers' Homes.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.270
Roberts has been the
recipient of grants

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.450
from the National
Endowment of the Humanities

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.800
and the DC Commission for the
Arts and has been a writer

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.940
in residence at 18
different artist colonies.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.340
Poems of hers have been featured

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.290
in the Wick Poetry Center's
Traveling Stanzas project

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.570
on the Academy of American
Poets Poem a Day Project

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.220
and on podcast sponsored
by the Library of Congress

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.340
and the National
Endowment for the Arts.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.530
I also will say that she-- I
had a little bit of a preview

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.030
of this because when the
SHARP 2011 Conference came

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.140
to Washington, DC, we
often have excursions

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.510
and I had Kim do a tour
of the [inaudible] Carter

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.340
and the African-American
literary culture here

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.470
that was very well received, and
we had many people attend that.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.530
And also, both Sabrina
and I, I don't think--

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.430
But I know Kim from
graduate school,

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.100
University of Maryland, too.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.510
So let's welcome Kim
Roberts and [inaudible].

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.170
[ Applause ]

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.420
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Thank
you so much.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:40.360
It's an honor to be able to
speak before you and thank you,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.830
Eleanor, and also in
her absence thank you

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.480
to Sabrina for organizing this.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.540
So my book tells the story
of Washington, DC's writers

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.140
from the founding
of the city in 1800

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.570
to just the beginnings
of modernism.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.300
I stop around 1930.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.900
It combines four
neighborhood walking tours

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.030
with brief portraits of
individual writers of note.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.790
Some of these writers
will be familiar

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.560
to any well read American

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.580
but many will I hope
be new discoveries.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.690
I decided to focus on the city's
early history because I thought

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.960
that those were the stories
that were less well known,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.570
they certainly were
to me initially.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.420
I've organized the book into
five chapters corresponding

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.440
to five, sometimes
overlapping time periods

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.020
that marked the eras
of the most [inaudible]

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.520
in the city's early
literary communities.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.430
Chapter 1 has no walking tour

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.030
but all the other chapters
combine a tour with portraits.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.840
The book also serves as
an anthology with poems

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.930
and prose excerpts from
each featured author.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.410
So I thought I'd focus
today on eight writers

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.920
from the book starting
with the author

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.970
of our country's
national anthem.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.870
A lawyer and DC's
former district attorney,

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.150
Francis Scott Key was
a hobbyist writer.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.060
His only remembered poem was
published originally as the

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.030
"Defence of Fort
M'Henry" and Key wrote it

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.640
after witnessing the bombing of
Fort McHenry during the Battle

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.780
of Baltimore in the war of 1812.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.520
Ironically, when it was set to
music, it was set to the tune

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.090
of a then popular British
drinking song called

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.660
"To Anacreon In Heaven".

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.510
In addition to occasional poems
that were collected into a book

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.740
that was published 14
years after his death,

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.290
Key published a nonfiction
book, the power of literature

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.130
and its connection
with religion.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.090
Key lived in two
locations in DC,

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.170
the Maples at 619
D Street Northwest

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.110
on Capitol Hill still stands,
although it's been broken

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.880
up into multiple
condominium units.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:01.120
Another property that it's shown
on this slide was once located

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.530
on M Street in Georgetown.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.640
It was made into a museum
celebrating the author

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.800
but it was torn down when
Key Bridge was constructed.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.160
However, across the street

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.210
from that house location
there's now a park

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.010
with a bust of the author.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.540
In addition to the bridge
and the little park,

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.580
Key Elementary School, part
of the DC public school system

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.130
and Key Halls at George
Washington University

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.600
and the University of Maryland

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.700
at College Park are
named for him.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.470
Key also owned a country estate,
the farm where he was born,

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.680
Terra Rubra, named for
the red clay of its soil

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.350
in Carroll County, Maryland,
a property that was added

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.010
to the National Register
of Historic Places in 1978

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.540
and is privately owned.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.280
Key owned slaves, most of
whom worked at this farm

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.800
but during his lifetime he was
actually considered a racial

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.340
humanitarian who pursued
dozens of legal cases

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.040
to secure the freedom
of enslaved families.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.040
Although he freed seven of his
slaves during his lifetime,

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.610
Key still owned eight enslaved
people at the time of his death.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.530
Believing that people of African
descent could never become full

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.550
citizens, Key was the co-founder

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.960
of the American Colonization
Society,

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.050
which promoted the
settlement of freeborn

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.520
and formerly enslaved
people in Africa.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.260
Frederick Douglass, renowned
for his influential memoirs

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.560
and essays was known as an
eloquent and charismatic orator.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.890
His memoirs include "A
Narrative of the Life

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.660
of Frederick Douglass, an
American Slave" published

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:44.500
in 1845, "My Bondage and My
Freedom" 1855, and "The Life

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:50.510
and Times of Frederick
Douglass" 1881 revised in 1892.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.520
Douglass moved to DC in 1872.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.610
He served as DC's
recorder of deeds and later

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.190
as consul general to Haiti.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.400
He is remembered with a bridge
across the Anacostia River named

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.740
in his honor and a statue
of Douglass represents DC

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.530
in National Statuary
Hall in the US Capitol.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.220
Some of you may remember
we had to fight long

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.540
and hard to get our statue in.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.920
Every state is represented
by two statues

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.510
in National Statuary Hall.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.020
We finally got one.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.970
But it is a lovely one,
Frederick Douglass.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.950
Douglass' house in
Anacostia is now preserved

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:32.610
by the National Park Service.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.140
It contains his original
furniture and books.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.210
And in the rear, the National
Park Service has recreated his

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:44.650
windowless stone studio, which
Douglass called the growlery.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:48.100
If you haven't been there,
I highly recommend the tour.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.100
2018 is the 200th
anniversary of Douglass' birth

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.340
and the Park Service is
honoring him throughout the year

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:57.140
with a series of special events.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:06.000
Walt Whitman lived in DC for
10 years, from 1863 to 1873.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.650
He's the author of the
masterpiece "Leaves of Grass",

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:13.490
a volume of poems he reedited
and republished numerous times

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:18.460
between 1855 and 1891,
as well as "Drum Taps"

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.060
which we actually have
a rare first edition

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.980
of on display here,
published in 1865,

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.870
"Memoranda During the
War" and "Specimen Days".

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.580
None of his boarding house
residences in DC still stand.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.610
I went through his
correspondence

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.920
which of course is
all held here.

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.240
The Library of Congress
has the best collection

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.790
of items relating to
Whitman and the world.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:50.670
And I was able to find seven
different boarding houses

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:54.800
where he rented rooms in the
10 years that he lived here,

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.680
but they were all in
the old part of the city

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:02.770
and they are now all the sites
of high-rise office buildings.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:06.090
But he is still remembered
in the city in other ways.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.100
A bust of him graces
the front desk

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.370
of the manuscript reading room
here at the Library of Congress

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:14.200
and his words are included in
several public art projects,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.250
at two metro stations,
Dupont Circle

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.610
and Archives Navy Memorial,

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:22.230
at Washington Reagan
National Airport

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.180
and in the paving
stones at Freedom Plaza.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.780
In addition, a two block stretch

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.180
of F Street Northwest has
been given the honorary name

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.800
of Walt Whitman Way.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:37.220
Whitman volunteered as a
nurse visiting patients

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.120
in over 50 temporary
war hospitals set

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.910
up across the city.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:45.180
Two months after arriving in
DC, Whitman wrote in a letter

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.890
to his brother Jeff
about why he stayed.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.750
I cannot give up
my hospitals yet.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.300
I never before had my
feelings so thoroughly

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.220
and so far permanently
absorbed to the very roots

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:02.660
as by these huge swarms of
dear wounded, sick, dying boys.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.060
I get very much attached
to some of them and many

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.220
of them have come to depend
on seeing me and having me sit

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.860
by them for a few minutes
as if for their lives.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.810
Long after the end of the
civil war, indeed for the rest

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.090
of his life, Whitman continued
to write and publish poetry

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:23.000
and prose on the war's
impact on American identity.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.860
Whitman even claimed
that "Leaves

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.420
of Grass" could not
have been written

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:29.770
without his wartime experiences
despite the fact the three

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:31.800
earlier editions had
been published prior

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.540
to his moving to Washington.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.440
For him, the civil war
and how the nation reacted

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.870
to it were more revealing

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.900
and more ennobling
than any other time.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:44.540
Of the years he spent
in DC, Whitman concluded

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.180
that I consider them
the greatest privilege

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.440
and satisfaction with all
their feverish excitements

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.050
and physical deprivations
and of lamentable sights

00:10:54.050 --> 00:11:01.020
and of course the most
profound lesson of my life.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:04.150
Paul Laurence Dunbar was the
first African-American poet

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.340
to become nationally known
and celebrated by both readers

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:10.400
of color and of mainstream
white audience.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.600
His books of poems include "Oak
and Ivy", "Majors and Minors",

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.460
"Lyrics of a Lowly Life",
"Poems of Cabin and Field",

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.880
"When Malindy Sings" and
"Lyrics of Sunshine and Shadow".

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.420
His works of fiction
include "The Uncalled",

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.180
"Folks from Dixie",
"The Strength of Gideon"

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.380
and "The Sport of the Gods".

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.630
He also wrote the lyrics
for "In the Homie",

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.550
the first musical written
and performed entirely

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.140
by African-Americans
to appear on Broadway.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:45.310
Dunbar moved to Washington,
DC in 1897 to take a job

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.230
as an assistant librarian.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:52.100
Where? Here, of course, at
the Library of Congress.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:57.420
He hated the job and he left
it after less than a year.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.410
In 1898, he married another
writer, Alice Dunbar-Nelson,

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:04.060
and they lived with Paul's
mother in two locations

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.950
in the LeDroit Park
neighborhood of DC.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:09.070
One of those houses, a row house

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.850
at 1934 Fourth Street
Northwest still stands.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:17.520
It's not marked with a historic
plaque or recognized in any way.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.490
I always wonder if the current
residents have any idea that two

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:24.820
such eminent American writers
once lived in their house.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:30.050
In 1900, diagnosed with
tuberculosis and alcoholic,

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.030
he left the area to try
to regain his health.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:36.070
He returned to DC
briefly then Dunbar moved

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.730
to his mother's home in
Dayton, Ohio where he died

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:42.460
in 1906 at the age of 33.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.760
He's remembered locally

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.210
with a DC public high
school named in his honor.

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:52.240
Alice Dunbar-Nelson is
the author of "Violets

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.340
and Other Tales" and "The
Goodness of St. Rocque".

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:58.560
She edited "Masterpieces
of Negro Eloquence"

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.920
and the "Dunbar Speaker
and Entertainer".

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.160
Dunbar-Nelson was
a regular columnist

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.340
for the Pittsburgh Courier
and the Washington Eagle

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:10.480
and co-editor of the AME Review.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.340
She also served as
Mid-Atlantic field organizer

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.810
for women's suffrage,
a representative

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:17.870
for the women's committee
on the council of defense

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:22.530
and was a popular speaker
to a wide range of groups.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.680
She helped to establish
the industrial school

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.480
for colored girls in
Marshallton, Delaware.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:33.040
The Dunbar marriage
was not a happy one.

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.420
Dunbar was physically abusive
and the pair separated in 1902

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.190
and Dunbar died four
years later.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.960
Dunbar-Nelson subsequently
moved to Maryland and Delaware.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.790
She married two more times

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.370
but always retained her eminent
first husband's last time

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.460
as it helped her
to get publishing

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.410
and speaking engagements.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:56.280
She also depended
on royalty checks

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.650
which she split with
Dunbar's mother.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.860
Her third marriage
to Robert J. Nelson,

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.610
a journalist, was her happiest.

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:14.430
Mark Twain lived in DC in 1867
working briefly as secretary

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:18.450
to Senator William
Morris Stewart of Nevada.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.900
He lived in a boarding
house favored by journalists

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.570
where he terrorized his
landlady Virginia Wells.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:28.280
According to Senator Stewart
who also lived at that address,

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.060
he would lurch around the halls
pretending to be intoxicated.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.650
He would burn the light
in his bedroom all night.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:38.340
Pretty soon, he took to smoking
cigars in bed and ruined all

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:41.090
of her sheets with burn holes.

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:42.960
Twain finished the
manuscript of his book

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.260
"The Innocence Abroad"
while living in DC.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.670
His experiences in DC directly
inspired his next novel,

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:52.840
"The Gilded Age", a satire
of the city's political

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:57.150
and social life, co-written
with Charles Dudley Warner.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.880
His label for the post-civil
war period has stuck.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.080
It describes the economic
growth, widening divide

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.820
between the rich and poor
and political corruption

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.500
that are hallmarks of that era.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.230
Sinclair Lewis, famous for his
novels about small town life

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:20.510
in the Midwest did his most
productive writing during the

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.330
period he lived in
Washington, DC.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:25.880
Seems like he needed to leave
the Midwest in order to be able

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.180
to write about the Midwest.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:30.720
He wrote his classic books
"Main Street", "Babbitt"

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.730
and "Arrowsmith" while
living in the capital and two

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:37.330
of the homes he rented
still stand.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:41.690
The first American writer to win
the Noble Prize for Literature

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:45.670
in 1930, Lewis wrote
23 novels as well

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.940
as plays and short fiction.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:51.460
His other novels include
"Elmer Gantry" and "Dodsworth".

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:55.820
We have "Dodsworth" on display
here, both adapted into movies,

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.260
as well as "It Can't Happen
Here", "King's Blood Royal"

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.000
and the posthumous
"World So Wide".

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.190
H.L. Mencken characterized
him as a red haired tornado

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:09.020
from the Minnesota Wilds.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.350
"Main Street" sold an
estimated two million copies

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:17.030
within the first few years after
publication and made Lewis rich.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:20.650
Biographer Mark Schorer states
it was the most sensational

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.920
event in 20th century
American publishing history.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.470
The printers could not keep up
with orders and publishers had

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:31.440
for a while to ration out
copies to book sellers.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:36.390
Langston Hughes lived
in Washington,

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:40.970
DC for a very short time,
one year and four months.

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:44.680
During that time, he was
depressed and unsettled,

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.640
yet it was an extremely
important time

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.220
in the poet's early development.

00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:53.360
While residing in DC, Hughes
won his first poetry competition

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.500
and gave his first
public poetry readings.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.810
He got a contract for
his first book of poems

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.160
from Alfred A. Knopf
in New York,

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:03.840
finished that book
manuscript and published

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.050
"The Weary Blues"
in February 1926.

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.670
He also wrote most of the poems

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.060
that would appear
in his second book.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.350
He developed friendships
with prominent writers

00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:17.090
and intellectuals such as Alain
Locke and Carl Van Vechten

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:20.280
and also with numerous
younger writers,

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.070
and some of those
friendships he would keep

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:24.760
for the rest of his life.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.090
His experience in
Washington was also crucial

00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:29.030
to Hughes for another reason.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:31.160
It solidified and
deepened his commitment

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.200
to the African-American
working class,

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.640
which would influence
his writing

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.910
for the rest of his life.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:39.620
Hughes' use of vernacular
English and the rhythm

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.230
of the blues widely
influenced modernism

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:45.050
and the course of
American letters.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.930
Two of his residences
still stand, a private home

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:53.070
at 1749 S Street Northwest,
again, not marked with a plaque.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.910
No one would know.

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:59.950
And that's where he lived
one winter with his mother

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:03.020
and his stepbrother Kit in 1925

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.650
in two unheated rooms
on the second floor.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:10.150
They had a movable heater
which they took turns moving

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.770
from one room to the next.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.870
And also the 12th Street YMCA,

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.270
now the third Thurgood Marshall
Center for Service and Heritage

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:23.400
at 1816 12th Street Northwest
where Hughes briefly lived

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:27.520
in a tiny single occupancy
room on the third floor.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:32.640
If you go to the Thurgood
Marshall Center, you can--

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.760
if it's during a weekday,
you can ring the doorbell

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.570
and they will let you in.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:40.190
They've got displays
in the lobby

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:43.340
of the first floor recreating
what the lobby would have looked

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.640
like during Hughes' time.

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.970
And on the second floor,
they've recreated one

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:49.380
of the single occupancy rooms

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:53.320
and they actually very sweetly
put in a manual typewriter.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.800
So I think they are trying

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.100
to say this is what Langston
Hughes' room could have

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.420
looked like.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:04.900
But it's worth a trip if you're
in the U Street neighborhood.

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.240
Like Langston Hughes,
Duke Ellington

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.800
and so many other artists of
the Harlem renaissance period,

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.150
Zora Neale Hurston
began her career in DC.

00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:23.050
She attended Howard University
from 1919 through 1924,

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:26.770
earning an associates degree
and embracing campus life.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:30.320
She joined a sorority, the
campus theater group and wrote

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.130
for the campus literary
journal, "The Stylus",

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.240
where she published
her first short story.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:41.540
While a full time student at
Howard, Hurston also held jobs

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.030
as a manicurist and waitress.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:48.570
Hurston owned only one dress
when she first arrived in DC

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.190
but soon earned enough to enter

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:53.480
into the city's elite
African-American circles.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.920
She was a regular at the
Saturday nighters salon

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.170
in the home of Georgia
Douglas Johnson

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:00.770
and developed friendships with
other writers and scholars

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.170
that would last the
rest of her life.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:05.850
After DC, she moved to New
York where she earned a degree

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:10.380
in anthropology from
Barnard College in 1927.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.100
That same year, she was awarded
a grant from the Association

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.920
for the Study of Negro life
and history based in DC

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.140
to do anthropological
work in Florida,

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.820
which led to the publication of
her second book, "Mules and Men"

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:28.080
in 1935, as well as the
recent posthumous publication

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.890
of "Barracoon" earlier
this year.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:35.160
That was also done on
that same research grant.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.310
Neither of her former DC
homes is marked with a plaque.

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:42.230
We're getting a theme here.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:44.800
I do think that DC
needs to do a better job

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.630
of claiming our fantastic
rich literary history.

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:52.700
You can find all of these
writers and more in my book.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.850
I'm really pleased with
how the book came out.

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:59.750
The University of Virginia Press
did a gorgeous job with the maps

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:02.670
and combining historic
photographs, many of them

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:05.310
from the collections of
the Library of Congress

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:09.360
with contemporary photographs
taken by a local writer

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.850
and visual artist Dan Vera.

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:15.930
And I can take questions.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:20.660
I do hope that you
will want to take some

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.870
of the walking tours
yourself, do some exploration.

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.810
&gt;&gt; Do you have a podcast
of the walking tour?

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:29.110
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: I do not.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:32.010
I do not. We talked about
that at the press at one point

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:35.030
and that never-- Yeah.

&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Thank you.

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.210
Thank you.

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.990
For those of you who are
interested in DC Writers' Homes,

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:25.540
that's a website that I
co-curate with Dan Vera,

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.150
the same guy who
I just mentioned.

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:33.560
We are documenting where in
the city writers have lived

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:38.190
from the city's founding to
the present with the caveat

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:44.800
that the writers have to be dead
but the houses have to be alive.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:49.860
We're not doing any site of
on that particular website.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:53.990
And we have a short bios
of each of the writers

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:58.450
and then contemporary photos
of what their homes look like.

00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:02.250
And again, it's part of this
effort to try and get us

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:06.030
to acknowledge all
of these layers

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:09.580
of history that we live among.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:13.150
So you can look up
by neighborhood

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.940
and different locations
in the city.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.400
You can find out what
famous writers, you know,

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.990
lived in your neighborhood.

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:26.510
So, thank you for
mentioning that.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:48.770
[ Inaudible ]

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:52.560
Oh, I love the London
system of the blue plaques.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.160
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Yeah.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.460
So the answer is no.

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.760
Every jurisdiction
is a little different

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.980
in how they handle
historic plaques.

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.560
In DC the law is that it--

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.770
the request must come
from the homeowner.

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:09.930
And that would mean that
homeowners would have

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:14.750
to actually know the history
of who lived in their houses

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:18.140
and care about it and
care about it enough to go

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:22.550
through a fairly elaborate
process of requesting

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:24.410
that kind of recognition.

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:29.210
Having said that
however, there are ways

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:35.170
that we could help homeowners
do that more efficiently and,

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:37.390
you know, it would
be great to have a--

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:42.250
You know, cultural
tourism has signs of now--

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.880
there are many more
certainly been--

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.460
I moved to the city a
little over 30 years ago

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:50.710
and there was nothing
at that point.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:53.620
So now we're doing a
slightly better job.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:59.710
And certainly there are more
people, average Washingtonians

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:02.090
who are aware that--
the Harlem renaissance

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:05.610
for example is a horrible
name for a literary movement

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:08.450
because it implies it
only happened in New York

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:11.950
but it actually happened in
several cities simultaneously

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:15.930
and you could argue that
it actually started in DC.

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:21.860
So that's a name that was given
much later to that movement.

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.730
So we're beginning
to do a little better

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:30.410
but it's slow work and,
boy, it would be so helpful

00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:32.700
if we had something like
that system in London.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.100
I'm so jealous of
that system in London.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.670
I don't know if anyone here has
been to London and just walked

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:42.400
around neighborhoods, but you
know, those signs are everywhere

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.890
and they're fascinating and
it's very easy also to their--

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.800
it's connected to a
website, you can--

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.100

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:54.010
&gt;&gt; Suzanne: I'm just going
to follow up and then ask

00:25:54.010 --> 00:26:01.700
if you have approached people
in DC government to see

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:04.830
if you could get these plaques.

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.130
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: I have not.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:10.150
I have talked with the
Humanities Council of Washington

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:18.030
about the possibility of
someone spearheading an effort

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:37.560
but not much has come of it.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:54.900
&gt;&gt; But I do know that-- I
think DC is becoming more--

00:26:54.900 --> 00:27:00.050
the cultural institutions
are becoming more aware

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:06.240
of what has gone on in the city

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.870
because even the
National Gallery

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:12.260

the Washington Color School--

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:13.560
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Right.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.000

to the [inaudible].

&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Yeah, I know.

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.080
You're absolutely right.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.290
Yeah, it's-- I think that it's
because we're so overshadowed

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:24.730
by the federal government
that there's this idea

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:29.820
that nothing else
happens here and in a way

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:35.730
that gives the arts
an underdog status

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:42.920
that has had some positive
effects because writers--

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:52.220
artists of all kinds
tend to band together

00:27:52.220 --> 00:28:00.990
and support one another and
there's an incredibly gracious,

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:04.950
generous, literary
community here in DC.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:10.700
That's unusual for other
city, comparable cities.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:23.470
But in many ways it really works
to our detriment, you know.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:31.300
But we're still just seen as--

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:38.250

what is the London system?

I'm not sure who
administers that but it's--

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.680
&gt;&gt; It's from the city.

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.980

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.580

I don't know.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:38.720

into it more.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.560

this is sometime ago.

come to some [inaudible].

have a couple of the--

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.560

don't want that.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:58.760
So I have a couple of
funny stories about that.

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:00.060
So, Dan Vera and I were
out documenting a few--

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:01.360
photo documenting a few houses
and we went to the house

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.660
of the very first US poet
laureate, Joseph Auslander

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:03.960
and we-- and took a few picture.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.260
Well, Dan took a few pictures.

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.560
The owner came out and
asked us what we were doing.

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.860
And, you know, of course you
can stand on the sidewalk

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.160
and take a picture of a house.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.460
You don't have to ask
permission but we, you know,

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:11.760
explained what was going on,
said something about, you know,

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.060
who this writer was
who lived in the house

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.360
and the homeowner said,
"Oh, we don't want

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.660
to be included in that.

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:16.960
We don't want tourists to
come up knocking on our door."

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.260
And Dan and I just-- and we
could hardly keep in the--

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:19.560
our glee as we were imagining
like Auslander groupies.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.860
No. We assured him it was not
ever, ever going to happen.

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:22.160
But we have had other
people who, you know,

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.460
for example we were
photographing the childhood home

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.760
of Philip K. Dick and the
homeowner's grandson came out

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.060
and he had never heard of the
author until we mentioned some

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:27.360
of the movies that had
been made from his books

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.660
and then he got extremely
excited and pull--

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.960
ran in, got his grandmother,
pulled her out to talk--

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.260
you know, so you know,
that goes both ways.

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.560
But I will say that what I
consider the most important

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.860
extant site of the Harlem
renaissance era is a private

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:37.800
home that was owned by Georgia
Douglas Johnson on S Street,

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.940
so near the historic
U Street neighborhood.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:42.860
It's at S and 15.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:47.670
And I have led a Harlem
renaissance walking tour

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:51.120
or versions of a Harlem
renaissance walking tour for,

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.100
I don't know, a decade
or two now.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.520
And so I always would stop
in front of that house.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.480
And one of the former owners,
every time I would come

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.740
out with a group of--
who were taking a tour,

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:06.620
they would make a big point
of shutting their blinds.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.840
They hated that they
were living in a house

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.970
that was so recognized.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.020
But they sold the house.

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:18.640
They moved away and the new
owners have embraced it.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:22.460
So, you know, I take
pleasure in the fact

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:27.690
that Georgia Douglas Johnson
will outlast any modern owner

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:29.650
of the house.

lived is [inaudible].

research, I will tell you

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:11.310
and your bed is lumpy and
if the food is good or,

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:12.610
you know, et cetera.

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:15.330
So those letters were just
a treasure trove for me.

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:20.680
However, before 1870,
none of the addresses

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:23.190
in DC were regularized.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:27.040
So what I mean by that
is as houses were built,

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.410
they were just numbered
as they went along.

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:33.510
It wasn't until 1870
that they decided that--

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:39.440
so for example if you live
in the 300 block of L Street,

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.020
then you know that you go to
L Street between 3rd and 4th.

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.260
That didn't have that
regularized system,

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.860
didn't happen until 1870.

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:54.440
So, every address in the city
prior to 1870 had to be changed.

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.740
And-- So the hardest thing--

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.040
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:00.320
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: -- for me
was translating the earlier

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.250
addresses into the
current addresses.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:06.520
&gt;&gt; Were there-- were the city
directories of [inaudible].

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:11.370
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Yes, so the
1870 city directory gave very

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:19.380
elaborate instructions on how
to translate addresses in each--

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.680
There were different
parts of the city

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:22.280
where it was done
slightly differently.

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.510
So it gave these elaborate--

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:27.700
But I had to go back to
the based real estate maps

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:30.690
and actually look at
plats to make sure.

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:32.810
So, that was tedious.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:38.190
&gt;&gt; Well, a more general approach
is-- and when-- for your period,

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:42.760
would you say that there is--

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:46.530
was a literary poetry
of Washington

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:51.860
and how would you define
that and if there wasn't

00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:56.260
such a thing, why
it wasn't there.

00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:57.560
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Yeah.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:58.860
So yes, the answer is yes.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:02.070
But part of the weirdness
of our city is that prior

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:07.560
to the civil war there
was a small group

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:12.840
of year round residents and
then there was this huge group

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.780
of people who came just
for the winter season

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:17.940
when Congress is in session.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:22.470
And so there was this sort of
seasonal literary community

00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:26.260
that swelled and then there
was this modest, you know,

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:33.710
sort of small town
older group of citizens.

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:39.230
So that really affected
literary culture quite a bit

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:40.770
in the city's early days.

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:44.960
You know, it's harder to
build community with people

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.830
who are only here
part of the year.

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:52.740
So, that was one thing that
sort of kept things very small.

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:57.610
And initially DC didn't have
the-- it didn't have theaters

00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:59.910
and bookstores and, you
know, the types of places

00:34:59.910 --> 00:35:03.480
where a literary
community might gather.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:07.340
So it really wasn't
until after the civil war

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:12.580
that we became a
city of any size.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.500
And that's when things
really started to change.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:21.480
&gt;&gt; What were the markers of
the literary [inaudible]?

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:26.030
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Well, I would
say the main markers were places

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:27.590
where writers could gather.

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:33.270
So that would be the rise
of salons in people's homes.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:36.840
That would be certainly
the rise of institutions

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:42.290
such as Howard University,
the American Negro Academy.

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:48.210
You know it's at-- but
the institutions are--

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:51.810
help build community.

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:57.630
Certainly there were a lot
of writers in the early days

00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:00.600
of the literary community
who were journalists,

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.540
as well as creative writers.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:06.870
So a big part of sort
of a meeting house

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:10.100
for writers would
have been the--

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:13.490
what was called newspaper row.

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:16.460
&gt;&gt; There were towns and bars.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:17.760
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: There
were, yeah.

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.220
Actually for the
journalists in the early days,

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:25.260
a lot of them were hanging
out in bars in the block

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:30.030
where the National
Theater is today.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:34.560
Those were favored
by journalists.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:40.750
It's where the gin rickey
was first developed that's--

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:43.270
well, one of our-- one
of our claims to fame is

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:47.810
that what was made up here
and, you know, that the bar

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:52.510
at the Willard Hotel
was another place.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:54.100
Yeah, so.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.380
[ Inaudible ]

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:59.150
The National Press Club
came, yeah, much later.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:05.660
I don't-- I don't know the exact
date but interestingly part

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:09.290
of what was then called
newspaper row is now the site

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:12.630
of that building, the
National Press Club.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.650
&gt;&gt; Which is all male
[inaudible].

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:16.360
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Right,
of course.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.820
&gt;&gt; We have a question
at the back.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.120
Go ahead [inaudible].

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.420
&gt;&gt; I have two questions, one--

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:25.550
I think British [inaudible]
Washington, DC was the discovery

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:28.560
that Francis Scott Fitzgerald
[inaudible] were very,

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.860
you know, [inaudible].

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.530
And so I'm just wondering,

00:37:32.530 --> 00:37:36.700
are there any things
literary people buried in DC?

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.000
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Oh yeah.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.130
&gt;&gt; And secondly, can you
talk about Henry Adams?

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:43.430
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Oh, sure.

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:47.420
Yeah. So the reason that
the Fitzgeralds were here is

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:54.170
because it was his family
that had lived here.

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:59.660
Yes, his family had lived here
so they were actually married

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:05.810
in DC in his parents' house
or his grandparents' house.

00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:07.720
So they had family
connections here.

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:10.150
And then you know of
course their daughter,

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:12.650
Scottie, settled in DC.

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:15.870
So, weirdly it was just
a family connection

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:19.040
but they didn't live here.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.040
They never lived here.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:28.700
But there are some other sort
of surprising burials here

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:33.500
where writers wanted
to be in the capital,

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.450
in the sort of center
of, you know,

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:39.990
but didn't necessarily have
a connection to the city.

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:43.210
What is the name of the
writer who wrote the poem

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:46.510
"Home Sweet Home" which
became a famous lyric?

00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:50.340
[ Inaudible ]

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.640
Yes, right.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.450
Is he never lived in the city
but he wanted his remains to be.

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:57.520
You know, so there
is examples of that

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:02.260
which is sort of fascinating.

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:03.760
I don't really understand
the appeal

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.630
but at that, you know, OK.

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:08.930
And then your second question
was about Henry Adams.

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:19.670
So Henry Adams, he lived in DC
after he retired from teaching

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:24.500
at a-- He was a history teacher
at Harvard and the editor

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:25.860
of the North American review.

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:32.020
And he had come to DC
of course as a child

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:36.720
and visited his grandparents
and his great grandparents and,

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:39.610
you know, he had-- He was part
of this big political dynasty.

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:44.280
So he knew if he moved here,
he would have cache right away.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.680
And he lived in a couple

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:50.190
of different residences
in Lafayette Square.

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:57.500
The last house, the
one that he had built

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:01.230
for himself is now the site
of the Hay-Adams Hotel.

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:03.370
And that's why it's
called the Hay-Adams Hotel.

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:07.050
It was the site of his house
and his best friend's house,

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:15.070
John Hay, who was another writer
but is famously known as one

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:18.480
of the two personal
secretaries to Abraham Lincoln.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.010
Later became Secretary
of State under a couple

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:22.620
of different presidents.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:28.070
I'm getting sort of way
late here but the only house

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:33.330
of Henry Adams is-- that still
stands is a place that he--

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:36.720
his father rented
for one winter.

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:40.620
His father was a
senator and he served

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.950
as his father's personal
secretary

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:46.040
and it's now the Arts
Club of Washington.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.800
So that that's the one place.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:54.090
And of course he's buried
here in Rock Creek Cemetery

00:40:54.090 --> 00:41:01.320
under a monument that is
probably the most important

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.830
piece of funerary art
in the entire nation.

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:08.790
If you have not made the
field trip to go see it, I--

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:13.130
it's part of the Henry Adams
tour in my book but I just--

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:16.670
I think it's stunning.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:18.230
It's worth seeing.

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:24.980
And you know, Henry Adams was
such a snob, you know, he--

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.660
there is absolutely no way

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:30.890
that I would have been
acceptable to him as a person.

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:33.640
He-- not just because
I'm a woman

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.760
but also because I'm Jewish.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:40.240
He hated Jews, very
anti-Semitic.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:44.480
And yet, his writing is just--

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.530
I mean what an exquisite
prose stylist.

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:51.850
He's so worth reading and
you know he's dead now.

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:56.270
We don't have to deal with what
a nasty human being he was.

00:41:56.270 --> 00:42:01.170
But his books, especially "The
Education of Henry Adams",

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:04.960
his memoir and "Democracy", I
feel like everyone should read.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.370
And "Democracy" is fun.

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:09.850
It's a fun read.

00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:11.150
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:12.450
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Thanks.

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:13.750
Thanks for asking.

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:15.050
&gt;&gt; John.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:16.350
&gt;&gt; John: This is [inaudible] to
go back to the previous section

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:17.650
about [inaudible] but talking

00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:19.790
about literary cultures
in Washington.

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:21.090
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Yeah.

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:22.390
&gt;&gt; John: It seems to me,

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:27.360
and this is partly [inaudible]
numerous appearances on the web,

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:30.740
there it makes two and
second [inaudible].

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.470
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Oh, yeah,
yeah, there's cultures.

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:33.770
Right.

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:36.100
&gt;&gt; John: And I'm struck by
the fact that from [inaudible]

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:39.730
to civil war on into the 1950s,

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:49.720
there's a very small continuous
African-American intellectual

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:51.670
and cultural tradition

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:54.530
in Washington Center
throughout the [inaudible].

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:55.830
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Right.

00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:57.130
So start-- yeah.

00:42:57.130 --> 00:43:01.010
Starting in-- during the
civil war the city was a draw

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:04.420
for intellectuals of
color and that continued

00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:07.250
through reconstruction
and long afterwards.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:12.450
And this is one of the
things that I really--

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:15.580
I wish this story
were better known

00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:18.530
and we did a better
job of claiming.

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:22.290
When you compare us to New York,
this city was more affordable

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:26.650
and so the neighborhoods in
the middle of the city, Shaw,

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:29.080
Pleasant Plains, LeDroit Park.

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:33.160
Those mid-city neighborhoods
were places where people

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.010
of color could afford
to own not just rent.

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:39.590
And that made a middle
class lifestyle here

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:44.300
in DC more attainable than any
other major city in the US,

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:48.820
plus the education
that was offered here.

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:51.780
So I don't know if
you're familiar

00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:53.780
with M Street High School.

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:56.920
It's the forerunner to
today's Dunbar High.

00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:01.800
But it was not just
the top high school

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:08.340
in DC during segregated public
schooling, it was the top school

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.930
for students of color
in the entire nation.

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:14.250
And there were many
families who moved to DC just

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:19.400
for the opportunity to send
their children to that school.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.890
Plus of course we had
Howard University.

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:27.600
Partly because of
the strange story

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:32.500
of how slaves were freed
first in DC before the rest

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:33.800
of the nation,

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:37.640
the African-American
intellectual community felt

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:43.160
like people of color had gotten
a head start here in the city

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:47.200
and that we needed to
be a national model.

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:53.520
Plus, you know, there were good
paying prestigious jobs here

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.180
especially in the
federal government

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:56.580
that people of color could get.

00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:00.170
There were, you know--
this was--

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:05.290
I will say during the
Harlem renaissance period,

00:45:05.290 --> 00:45:11.790
a lot of writers and artists who
started here moved to New York

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:15.790
but a lot stayed and in
general, the people who moved

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:19.520
to New York tended to be the
men and the people who stayed

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.270
in DC tended to be the women

00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:24.140
who were the major
writers of that period.

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:26.090
&gt;&gt; I know Helen has
[inaudible] this one.

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:30.490
I'm going to add one little
thing just tying to that knot

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:33.190
because I'm also
thinking even before--

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:37.220
I'm thinking antebellum
period, I'm thinking

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.490
of Elizabeth McHenry's
work for [inaudible].

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:41.020
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Oh,
it's a great book.

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.250
&gt;&gt; And she's not looking
Washington really quick.

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:46.470
A lot of her research
from the African-American,

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:50.110
that book centers on [inaudible]
literacy and Baltimore

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:54.130
and DC figures the kind
[inaudible] foundations

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:55.430
of what happens.

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:58.060
And I'm so sorry I'm packing all
because I wanted [inaudible].

00:45:58.060 --> 00:45:59.840
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Well, and I
will say that's one of the books

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.800
that I referenced in my
own book and she writes

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:08.060
about the salon-- oh, good.

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:11.060
OK. She wrote about
the salon in the home

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.700
of Georgia Douglas Johnson.

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:15.000
Yeah, she did great research.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:21.900
&gt;&gt; My question is if--
could you tell us more

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:23.690
of Frances Hodgson Burnett?

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:28.740
I've read a couple of her novels
and the novels actually tells

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:32.100
about salon life and that
she herself had [inaudible].

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:33.580
If you could tell us about--

00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:34.880
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Sure.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:36.350
&gt;&gt; -- what was her relationship,
because she lived here?

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:37.650
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: She did.

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:38.950
She-- so she's now
mostly remembered

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:41.760
for her children's
literature, "The Secret Garden",

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.340
"Little Lord Fauntleroy"
but she started

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:46.070
out as a novelist for adults.

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:48.460
And during her lifetime that's
what she was best known for.

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:50.910
And she set a couple
of her novels in DC

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:54.820
and of course I've read them.

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:58.510
They're fun in a
sort of dated way--

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:05.610
[ Inaudible ]

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:06.910
I didn't know that.

00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:09.400
&gt;&gt; Yes. It's a-- I
cannot remember the name

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.700
but it's a very good one.

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:17.790
And actually like a [inaudible].

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:20.550
And it's got, well,
the same [inaudible].

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:21.850
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: I
need to look for this.

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:23.210
&gt;&gt; Right. Right.

00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:25.500
And it's hard to be [inaudible].

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:26.800
And I know she would take--

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:28.100
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Yes.

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:29.400
So she lived, she--

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.700
&gt;&gt; She's interesting woman.

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:32.000
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: She is.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.300
She was a very interesting
woman.

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.600
So she lived in a house
on Massachusetts Avenue,

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.900
right in the Dupont
Circle neighborhood.

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:37.440
It unfortunately
no longer stands.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:42.320
And she was immediately
upon moving to DC--

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:46.810
She moved here because her
first husband was a physician

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:49.080
and started to practice
in the city.

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:52.540
And she immediately made
a sensation, you know,

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:56.980
making sure that she
knew everyone who was--

00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:05.930
anyone in the white upper
class artistic circles

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:09.860
that she was running in.

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:15.180
And-- but she divorced and
remarried I think two more times

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:17.990
which is very scandalous
at that time.

00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:23.930
She also lost her son to
tuberculosis and she turned

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:28.370
to forms of spiritualism to
try and deal with her grief.

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:30.510
So she's a complex--

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:35.740
[ Inaudible ]

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:37.540
OK.

00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:42.110
[ Inaudible ]

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:43.410
Interesting.

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:50.570
&gt;&gt; Because no one knows
about the Washington, DC.

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:55.230
It's more like it's British.

00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:57.690
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: OK.

00:48:57.690 --> 00:48:59.620
&gt;&gt; You know, you
think that you--

00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:03.510
that she, that she was
kind of-- kind [inaudible].

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:04.810
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: No.

00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:09.660
&gt;&gt; OK. So got novels in England
and it seems like [inaudible].

00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:11.030
You might know of the silence.

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:13.910
It was moving to
[inaudible], you know this--

00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:16.280
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: No.

00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:17.580
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:18.880
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: No.

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.940
I have to-- clearly I
have to look further.

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:25.480
OK. [Inaudible] Well,
one of the things

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.780
that made DC literary culture
so open to women writers

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:30.510
in particular was the fact
that we had so many newspapers,

00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:34.120
so many journals that
were published here.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:41.000
And they tended to publish
poetry, short fiction,

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:47.250
short articles by women because
they were looking for content

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:55.450
that was patriotic,
sentimental about, you know,

00:49:55.450 --> 00:50:02.170
family and romance and home
life or that was about nature.

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:04.100
And those were all subjects

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:08.350
that were considered
suitable for women writers.

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:18.590
Your questions, you
guys are so good.

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:21.580
What a joy it is to talk
with you about all of these.

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:25.430
&gt;&gt; Well, I think the
relationship between place

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:29.160
and literature is
very interesting

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:37.790
and there are a lot of--

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:49.780
and there was a lot of actually
university courses offered

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:53.880
about the relationship between
place and space especially

00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:56.350
when it comes to the novels.

00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:58.600
I don't think I've [inaudible]
specifically about DC.

00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.900
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: No.

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:05.130
And this is what-- yeah,
this is what surprised me.

00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:10.170
Because there are other cities,
for example San Francisco,

00:51:10.170 --> 00:51:14.300
Boston, Chicago have done--

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:15.600
&gt;&gt; Philadelphia.

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:16.900
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Yeah,
Philadelphia.

00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:27.270
Have done really good jobs of,
you know, making a big deal

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:32.280
about their-- even Baltimore
does better than we do, so.

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:39.980
&gt;&gt; Well, it is kind of
interesting because even

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:48.380
in the 20-- I'm thinking
of Edward Jones--

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:49.680
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Oh yeah.

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:53.430
&gt;&gt; And Edward Jones's
short stories too

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:59.500
that all built around the metro.

00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:10.870
So I mean it's obviously
pretty things in place.

00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:15.910
And even some of the
international writers

00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:18.450
that we have here, right?

00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:19.750
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Right.

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:21.050
Right.

00:52:21.050 --> 00:52:22.350
&gt;&gt; You think of someone

00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:23.650
who probably [inaudible]
his memories growing

00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:26.170
up on 16th Street and
then reading in the park

00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:36.520
and there was just such a rich,
you know, area that we've,

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:41.610
you know, have think of,
you know, [inaudible] here

00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:46.900
at our website, there's a
lot more at [inaudible].

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:52.240
&gt;&gt; So there was a project
started a couple years ago

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.130
by some librarians

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:56.950
at the [inaudible] DC
followed by [inaudible].

00:52:56.950 --> 00:53:00.520
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: DC By the Book.

00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:07.100
&gt;&gt; DC By the Books where they're
having them on an [inaudible].

00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:14.790
You can put by zip code
or neighborhood and--

00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:17.940
but they made it crowdsource.

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:24.830
They made people that entered
the book send a couple sentences

00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:29.320
about it or a couple
sentences from the book.

00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:34.150
It's a-- it was really
interesting project

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:36.770
but I don't know--

00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:38.070
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: OK.

00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:41.540
So I was a consultant
on that project.

00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:42.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:44.140
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Yeah.

00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:45.440
And if you-- it's still up.

00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:46.740
It's called DC By the Book.

00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:49.600
I think it's dcbythebook.org.

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:54.620
And it's on the server
of DC Public Libraries.

00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:57.160
&gt;&gt; And you know like
that probably came

00:53:57.160 --> 00:54:02.240
out and I might be wrong.

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:09.620
Don't you think that came out
of John Coles set approval

00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:21.130
because he has literary
maps of all the states

00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:27.210
so he started the
center for the book?

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:33.990
Why do you think that
probably DC would stay put.

00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:40.490
And so that's what
Philadelphia--

00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:45.470
the Philadelphia Center for the
Book was not the same as Center

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:49.390
for Book History
of the Penn State

00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:52.010
but it's also based
off of Penn State.

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:56.680
We had actually the author, a
scholar, and he was involved

00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:01.060
in that and come to speak
when we were [inaudible]

00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:03.760
because library was
closed to [inaudible].

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:08.340
Anyway, and that was
the first interactive

00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:12.030
but maybe you feel it wasn't.

00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:16.570
You know, I mean it's online
where the others are published

00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:19.830
in print and given out in
different public libraries

00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:21.870
for events and you know,
things like that by people

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:23.170
who [inaudible] states.

00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:24.470
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Right.

00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:25.770
&gt;&gt; And you're absolutely
right that there are cities

00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:27.070
that are doing [inaudible]
DC, that's an--

00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:28.370
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: I'm glad you
know about that project though

00:55:28.370 --> 00:55:29.670
because it's been
sort of languishing.

00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:30.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:32.270
&gt;&gt; I always thought
when I retired,

00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:33.570
I would sit around
and [inaudible].

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:34.870
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: There's also a
couple of DC literary historians

00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:36.170
who have started
adding Wikipedia pages

00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:37.470
in a much more concerted
effort as well.

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:38.770
So there are these little
homegrown projects popping

00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:40.070
up here and there.

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:41.370
&gt;&gt; There's so many active
book clubs you will look--

00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:42.670
you would think of and the
library system should hook

00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:43.970
up with all the book club

00:55:43.970 --> 00:55:45.270
because that would be a great
resource of, you know, inputting

00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:46.570
and [inaudible], you know,

00:55:46.570 --> 00:55:47.870
knowledge because [inaudible]
I think so many in the city,

00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:49.170
it's just unbelievable.

00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:50.470
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: We are a
highly educated reading city.

00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:51.770
I mean, yeah.

00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:53.070
It's amazing.

00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:54.370
&gt;&gt; Are you working on
volume 2 in the [inaudible]?

00:55:54.370 --> 00:55:55.670
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Everyone
always ask me this question.

00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:56.970
I have no plans to
do so at this point.

00:55:56.970 --> 00:55:58.270
I started looking into who
were the writers in this city

00:55:58.270 --> 00:55:59.570
and that history when I first
moved here 30 years ago.

00:55:59.570 --> 00:56:00.870
So of course I didn't
know I was writing a book

00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:02.170
for a very long time
but the idea that I--

00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:03.470
it might take me another
30 years to write any sort

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:04.770
of volume 2 is a little
daunting at this point.

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:06.070
So I'm not making any claims.

00:56:06.070 --> 00:56:07.370
&gt;&gt; Do you know is it as rich?

00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:08.670
&gt;&gt; Kim Roberts: Oh
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:09.970
So, that the history
after the 1930s

00:56:09.970 --> 00:56:11.270
of DC includes the Howard Poets.

00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:12.570
This was also an
amazing flowering

00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:13.870
of the small press movement--

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:15.170
the little press movement
in the 1960s and '70s.

00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:16.470
There is an enormous
amount of vigor

00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:17.770
in the spoken word
community that, you know,

00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:19.070
DC is one of the places-- most
people don't realize for example

00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:20.370
that the very first
youth poetry slam team

00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:21.670
in the nation was
started here in DC.

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:22.970
So you know there's all kinds
of more modern movements

00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:24.270
that modern history that if
I don't do it I hope other

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:25.570
people will.
