ALISA VITTI: Welcome everyone.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.120
My name's Alisa Vitti.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.850
I'm the author of "WomanCode."
And I'm really, really excited

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:07.300
to be here.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.360
I'm in the midst of my
whirlwind book tour.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.560
I just got back from London.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.470
And I'm just excited about
sharing "WomanCode" with women

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.200
everywhere.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.300
So I'm thrilled to be here
at Google, bringing

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.210
"WomanCode" to Google.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.620
Very exciting.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.910
For me, I never really
considered how important

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.310
hormones were and how hormones
affect everything until my

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.200
hormones stopped working
properly.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.200
So I want your picture me as I
was a number of years back.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.500
I was over 200 pounds.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.700
I was covered face, chest, and
back, in extreme cystic acne.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.350
I was exhausted.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.380
I couldn't wake up
in the morning.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.500
I couldn't go to
sleep at night.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.470
It was a whole nightmare.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.380
And I wasn't getting
my period, maybe

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.930
once or twice a year.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.740
I was also at Johns Hopkins on
my way to becoming an OB/GYN

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.100
when all of the hormonal
stuff hit the fan.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.560
And it was in that moment, where
I was faced with this

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.010
whole future of obesity,
diabetes, infertility, heart

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.150
disease, cancer, that I realized
that there was a

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.290
different path.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.770
And in that moment with my
doctor, once we finally--

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.580
I was one night at the medical
library and researching a

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.910
little bit on what might I have,
because I had gone six

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.380
years without a diagnosis.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.570
And I finally figured out what
it was that I had, which is a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.820
condition called polycystic
ovarian syndrome.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.765
How many of you know someone
with that disorder?

00:01:28.765 --> 00:01:32.500
It's 1 out of 4 or 5 women
have that disease.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.390
And it's a miscommunication
between the hypothalamus and

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.330
the pituitary gland
and the ovary.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.260
And so you don't end up
ovulating or menstruating.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.750
So I asked her, now what, now,
that we know what we do, after

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.930
we had our doctor's visit?

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.520
And she said, there's really
nothing that we can do.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.680
But we can medicate you along
the way for all of those

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.770
problems that you'll
be having.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:54.680
And I was a young woman.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.290
And I thought to myself, do I
want to be on medication for

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.330
the rest of my life for heart
disease and high blood

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.020
pressure and diabetes
and infertility?

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.250
The medication roller coaster
seemed endless.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.440
And that's when I decided to
throw myself into functional

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.870
medicine, because I had been
privy to some really cool

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.350
research at Hopkins about
nutritional genomics and

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.310
epigenetics.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.680
Do you guys remember the
Human Genome Project?

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.330
And what came out of that was
a surprising discovery, that

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.020
there's this little
ghost protein that

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.940
wraps around your genes.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.990
And there are only two factors
that influence its

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.870
construction or expansion, which
then causes genes to

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.730
express disease or health.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.710
And it's food and lifestyle.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.340
So, of course, it was very
exciting to think about if we

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.420
can manipulate gene expression
on that microscopic level with

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.560
food and lifestyle, what could
we do with food on a systemic

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.710
standpoint in the endocrine
system?

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.540
And so I began putting
my protocol together.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.710
And I love especially sharing
about the skin.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.670
Because so many people with
cystic acne, they end up

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.220
taking things like Accutane
and all of these things.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.490
And I have not done
any of that.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.860
And to have 60 pounds come off
of my body, to have my skin

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.730
clear up, to be able to be
having a period and ovulating

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.750
normally for over 12 years now,
it's really remarkable.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.200
Because every time I go to the
gynecologist still, they're

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.440
like, do you really not
have PCOS anymore?

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.640
And they do all the
blood tests.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.730
They check everything out.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.920
They're like. wow, we just have
never thought that that

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.060
was possible.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.670
So it's exciting that not only
do I share this work with

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.140
other women but also, I know
firsthand the power of using

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.110
food sequencing, which is the
crux of my protocol in terms

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.920
of correcting hormonal issues.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.920
And this is why it's
so important.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.580
Right now, unlike any other
time we've seen before in

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.030
women's health, we are
dealing with issues

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.530
at an epidemic rate.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.230
Now, this number of 20 million
women suffering from menstrual

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.920
disorders, fertility issues,
libido issues, energy issues,

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.810
it's a low number.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.640
In fact, when I talk to my
colleagues, they're always

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.750
encouraging me to double or
maybe triple the number.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.040
But safe to say, that half of
the women who are struggling

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.500
are not talking about it.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.380
So it's easily upwards
of 40 million women.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.050
In 2009, we had almost $2
billion being spent on

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.600
assisted reproductive
technologies, like IVF.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.270
How many of you know friends who
are doing the IVF roller

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.910
coaster and its multiple rounds
and it's failing?

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.050
And it's distressing, right?

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.300
And now there's some concern
about what are the long term

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.040
repercussions of so much
synthetic hormone stimulation

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.830
during the IVF process on your
overall health and well being.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.060
So we're not having the results
that our bodies are

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.770
capable of.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.970
We're designed to have
healthy periods.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.850
We're designed to make
babies if we want to.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.540
In fact, we're designed to have
a hotter sex drive as we

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.870
age, unlike men who peter
off, pun intended.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.690
So we are supposed to be
fantastic all of our lives.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.500
And there is just this
flood of issues.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.820
And I think what's exciting
for me, because I've been

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:12.870
doing this for a long time.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.980
I've had a center in the
city for over 10 years.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.050
What's exciting is now that
it's more prominent in the

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.610
media, I love talking about
the Kardashian sisters,

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.140
because we have been with them
from their period problems to

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.640
their pregnancy problems to
their postpartum problems.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.750
And it really puts a nice lens
on what so many women are

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:32.420
dealing with.

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.300
And everyone can identify with
one of the issues that these

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.230
women are going through.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.960
So it brings up something
that's really, really

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.730
interesting.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.620
So in 2009, the National
Institute of Health published

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.670
a very important body
of research.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.670
And I wish I had t-shirts that
I could wear that said, I've

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.630
read the bio cycle study,
on the front, and on

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.130
the back, have you?

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.620
Because this is something
that's ground breaking

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.350
research for all women.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:06.420
And this bio cycle study
basically with let us know

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.630
that if you have any sort of
menstrual disturbance in your

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.960
20s or 30s, something as simple
as PMS, something

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.640
that's the butt of our jokes.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.480
Like, I'm just that way
half the month.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.010
And it's just normal.

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.420
How many of us anticipate
that that's the case?

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.420
Yeah?

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.370
In fact, it can end up leading
to the big four disease of

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.770
inflammation in your post
menopausal years.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.600
So something as harmless as we
jokingly think about PMS can

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:41.530
end up increasing our likelihood
for diabetes, heart

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.980
disease, cancer, and
Alzheimer's.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.230
So to me, that is something that
I would want us to pay a

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.020
lot of attention to.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.420
Because the great news is you
can completely change and

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.090
affect how your body's
performing from a hormonal

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:56.060
standpoint by using food.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.830
So like I was saying, hormones
affect everything.

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.620
How many of you connect the
dots back to your hormones

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:10.920
when you have a flare up of
acne or constipation or

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.520
sleeplessness or your mood is
changing or the way you're

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.140
thinking about a project
is changing?

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.506
Maybe you've tied that back
to your hormones.

00:07:20.506 --> 00:07:21.950
This is good.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:22.320
This is good.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.900
I'm going to give you
even more granular

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.100
level thinking on that.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.500
The problem that we have in the
way that these issues are

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.100
being approached is that the
western medical model has us

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.820
treating symptoms.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.180
And really, you should think
of that as spot treating.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.540
You have a headache,
you take an Advil.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.990
You have cramps, you take--

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.750
What do you guys take
for cramps?

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.400
Midol, Advil, whatever
you're taking.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:49.980
You have acne.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.060
You buy potions and lotions.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.250
Maybe you try some internal
medicine.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.570
And how many of you spend at
least $100 on supplements a

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.720
month, just trying things out?

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.470
OK.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:02.210
All right.

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.510
How many of you are trying
supplements at all?

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:05.540
Yeah.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:10.310
So we're always trying to spot
treat what is going on with

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.140
our hormones.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:15.870
And really, when I dove into
the research that led me to

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.320
the protocol that I designed,
what I found from a functional

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.100
medicine standpoint was that we
actually have to treat the

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.260
root causes.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.980
If we're going to allow the
body to heal itself and

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.870
resolve its issues on its own,
which is exactly what the

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.620
endocrine system is designed to
do, we have to address the

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.600
root causes.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.340
And I want to go over
that with you today.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.850
What are the functions of
the endocrine system?

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.530
How do you interact
with it with food?

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.659
So that whatever troubles you're
having, from PMS to

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.440
infertility to wanting to
preserve your fertility for

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.380
the next few years until you
meet your partner, the partner

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.070
of your dreams or
what have you.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.930
I met mine at Google.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:51.780
Isn't that funny?

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.946
AUDIENCE: Are you serious?

00:08:53.946 --> 00:08:56.450
ALISA VITTI: He's
an ex-Googler.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:02.010
So you want to be prepared for
that, hormonally speaking.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:06.520
And so we can do that
using food.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:10.450
What's really cool, and since
I'm at one of the coolest tech

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.100
companies here, I just wanted to
brag a little bit about my

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.150
tech company.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.730
So I have been in clinical
practice, as I mentioned, for

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:18.620
over 10 years.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.470
And about a year and a half ago,
I had a really exciting

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:24.440
conversation with a
couple of people.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.070
And I shared with them this big
vision that I had, that

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.930
women's hormonal health needs
to be as prominent as

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:31.850
something like Weight Watchers,
for example.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:32.810
We need to have a tool.

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:33.930
We need to have a system.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.910
So I went ahead and built the
world's first online hormone

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:37.940
improvement platforms.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.890
So think of it like Rosetta
Stone for your ovaries.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.290
You can log in and
do the protocol.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:47.160
Because I was having women
calling in from the UK, from

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:51.230
Australia, from South America,
from Europe and we needed a

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:53.170
way to serve all of them.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.380
So it's really cool.

00:09:54.380 --> 00:10:00.110
In the past two years, we've
seen so many women logging on

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:04.760
to the system from six
continents, really getting the

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.240
results that they want and all
through using the protocol.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.870
So women who've had--

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.350
Emily, for example, this
one of our clients.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.970
She was having two
periods a month.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.730
Think about going on acting
calls and having

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:20.690
two periods a month.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:21.230
That's a lot.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:22.190
That's intense.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.960
And to be able to resolve
that permanently with

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.100
changing her diet.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.760
Or Lisa, who is someone
who I just adore.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.500
Her first pregnancy was through
multiple rounds of

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.820
IVF, after which she was
suffering from severe

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.870
postpartum depression, weight
gain, and her underlying

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:42.070
hormonal issues magnified.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.680
And she prepared her body for
the next conception using the

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.230
"WomanCode" protocol and was
able to get pregnant the first

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.520
time without IVF, no postpartum
depression.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.110
The child actually has a
stronger immune system.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.980
And her pregnancy was much
easier the second time around.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.670
So all food, all food.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.840
Oh yeah, I do have to brag one
more little thing about the

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.520
"Dr. Oz" show.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.870
How many of you saw the
clip that I did

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.020
on "Dr. Oz?" Anyone?

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.610
Well, we will make it
available to you.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.440
I made a little TV history,
actually recently.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.720
This is all around
the book launch.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.350
And what I did on the "Dr. Oz"
show was I wanted to share

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:25.180
with his audience, with
women everywhere--

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.440
You know how he did the
famous look before you

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.940
flush for your poop?

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:30.720
Remember that?

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:30.990
Remember?

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.190
I know.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.950
I'm going to say lots of
bodily functions today.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:33.540
Just bear with me.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.710
I know it's lunch, but
we got to go with it.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:40.100
I just thought, well, one of the
best ways for a woman to

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.305
gauge how she's doing hormonally
month over month is

00:11:43.305 --> 00:11:46.740
to actually take a look at her
menses before she flushes.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:49.680
Because the color and texture of
that will actually tell you

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.130
what's going on with your
estrogen, what's going on with

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:53.310
your progesterone.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.480
And I will admit, you ladies
are faring much better than

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.390
the Londoners.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.370
When I brought this up to the
London crew, they were like--

00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:59.370
[GASPS]

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:00.480
ALISA VITTI: Oh my god.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.680
She's talking about
menstrual blood.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.760
That's horrible.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.750
But it's so important to know
what the different colors and

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:07.880
textures are.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.340
There are four key ones.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:11.380
And I would love for you all
to go and check that

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.840
clip out and know.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.550
And spread the word to your
friends, because not only in

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:18.730
the short term does it have
health implications, like for

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.930
example, if you have low
estrogen and your period looks

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.380
a little light and thin,
like strawberry jam.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.750
Thinly spread strawberry jam
is how we simulated these

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:27.390
things on TV.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.550
I used fruit juices on
little white dishes.

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:30.800
It was very cool.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:34.130
We joke about that.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:37.170
Like, oh, my period's so
light and lucky me.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.525
But actually, you're now putting
your bone density at

00:12:39.525 --> 00:12:42.040
risk, because estrogen protects
bone density.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:42.910
That's in the short term.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.000
In the long term, it has other
repercussions about the way

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.840
that your ovaries age, the way
that your body ages, and your

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.050
long term fertility.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.080
So looking and checking
month over month.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.250
And that's just one
of the four.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:54.180
See now, aren't you curious
to know the other three?

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.210
I'm not going to tell you.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.880
So the book just came out.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.620
It's really exciting.

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.660
And I want to walk you through
it as a way of introducing you

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.570
to the protocol and how
your body works.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:09.540
So let's start with
the first part.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.810
The first part has to do with
unlocking your woman code.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:16.610
Because there's this thing, if
there was a code inside of

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:19.620
your body that would give you
access to feeling good all

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.120
month, you'd want to crack
the code, yeah?

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.540
How many of you are computer
programmers in here?

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:24.995
Any hackers?

00:13:24.995 --> 00:13:26.880
Ah, so hot.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.590
Yes.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.070
So I'm a biohacker.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:30.010
I'm a hormone hacker.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:30.680
That's what I do.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.090
And I've figured out
how to do this.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:34.410
I want teach you how to hack.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:35.760
So here's the problem.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:43.050
The problem with accessing the
code is that we're blocked in

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:43.700
a lot of ways.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:45.750
And one of the first things
that you have to do in

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.560
establishing an environment
inside of your body where your

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.810
endocrine system can thrive is
that you need to remove what I

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:53.820
call flow blockers,
pun intended.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.430
We want to restore flow, not
just your menstrual flow, but

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.240
also your whole hormonal
cascade.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.630
As I like to say,
head to ovaries.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:05.940
So the first problem is, how
many of you, if I asked you to

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:10.440
get up on the whiteboard right
now and draw me a 28 to 30 day

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.810
monthly cycle with all five
hormonal patterns, could do

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.786
that for me?

00:14:15.786 --> 00:14:17.036
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:20.124 --> 00:14:21.100
ALISA VITTI: Uh huh.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.420
And?

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.790
And she doesn't know what
the fifth one is.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:24.480
I know.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.700
And don't worry.

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:26.790
It's kind of a loaded
question.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:29.390
I teach doctors all the
time, surgeons.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:33.900
And they can't do it either,
which says a lot.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.310
So we don't know what's
going on.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.190
And that's just on the
level of the period.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.520
But we also don't know what the
parts are, what they're

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.440
doing, how your thyroid's
affected by, how much sodium

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.350
you're consuming during it.

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.590
We just don't know.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:47.750
So that's part of the issue.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:49.510
The other issue, as I mentioned
earlier, is this

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:53.430
paradigm in health care to
spot treat symptoms is

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:57.490
incorrect for systemic
health issues.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:02.860
If it were just as simple as
your wrist was broken and they

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.330
put a cast on it, then
that would be great.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.140
You can spot treat that issue.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.550
But because we're talking about
all of these different

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.250
glands and all these different
hormones, we need a whole

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.510
system approach to
get it right.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:14.570
And then the third thing--

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:18.295
And this is really where
you can get activated.

00:15:18.295 --> 00:15:20.480
One of the chapters of the book
really goes into, so you

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.070
have a manual for this.--

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:25.900
Is removing endocrine
disruptors.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.370
One of the reasons why we are
seeing women at epidemic rates

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:32.060
experience suffering around
these issues in their health

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:36.100
is because we are living in an
environment that is flooding

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.390
our bodies with something called
xenoestrogens, which is

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:43.670
just a fancy pants term for
synthetic estrogens, strange,

00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:44.960
external estrogen.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.930
And it adheres to our own
estrogen receptor sites.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.940
And it starts to cause confusion
in the hormonal

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.060
conversation that our body's
trying to have and can make

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.830
you estrogen dominant, which
then causes all sorts of

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.560
problems around your cycle
and your fertility.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.720
So what can we do?

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.920
First things first,
you have to choose

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.740
organic 80% of the time.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.150
Notice, I'm not saying
100% of the time.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.780
I'm just saying 80%.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.250
Especially, when it
comes to fruits,

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:13.110
vegetables, and animal products.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.290
These are just the biggest
offenders in terms of

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.150
endocrine disruption that you
could expose your body to.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:21.870
And if you are trying to lose
weight, clear up your skin,

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:25.210
preserve your fertility for the
long term, fix PMS, get

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:26.890
rid of the annoying--

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:31.120
Just doing this alone will make
dramatic inroads into

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.320
that progress.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.410
And then the second thing
that you need to do is--

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:37.980
And I give a giant
list in the book.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.300
You have to look at the lotions
and potions you're

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.630
putting on your skin.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.820
Your skin is your
largest organ.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.510
It's also the largest organ
of elimination.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:50.140
Anything that you put on your
skin, you better be willing to

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.970
take a tablespoon of
it and eat it.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.240
That's always my litmus test.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.730
Would I, if under duress,
eat this body lotion?

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:58.810
I know that sounds silly.

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.110
And I don't actually
eat my body lotion.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:04.790
But if I needed to, I would
feel comfortable doing it

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:08.950
because it has three or four
ingredients in it, like olive

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:15.890
oil, Shea butter, vitamin E.
If you have something from,

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:20.290
I'm not going to name names,
fancy lingerie stores that

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:23.770
smell really perfumy and all of
that, and you're putting it

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:30.630
on your skin, there are so many
chemicals in that lotion

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.240
that are FDA known endocrine
disruptors that are ending up

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.860
in your bloodstream and messing
with that delicate

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.380
chemical conversation
of your hormones.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.340
Really, really essential
you do an audit.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:44.410
Just audit your medicine
cabinet, your bathroom

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:48.440
products, from your shampoo to
your make up to your lotion,

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.020
and see if there's a way for
you to start slowly.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.330
Finish up what you've got.

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.105
Does not need to be extreme.

00:17:54.105 --> 00:17:55.300
Finish up what you've
got and start to

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.980
slowly make some changes.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:01.410
Let me assure you, 15 years ago,
Whole Foods did not have

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:04.590
the wide array that it does
today of fun products

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:05.590
that you can try.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:10.170
But now, there are so many
fabulous skin care lines and

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:13.475
makeup lines and body care lines
that you can experience.

00:18:13.475 --> 00:18:14.370
And you should.

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:15.680
You should give us a try.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.060
I'm going to save questions
for the end.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:17.720
Is that OK?

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.870
But write them down, because
I'm totally into it.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:24.290
So what I want for you, I want
you to get into a state of

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:28.280
hormonal flow, where you are
in sync with your hormones

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:33.870
every day, where you know how
to manage your endocrine

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.200
balance on a regular basis.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.670
So let's go into the protocol
and share with

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:38.660
you how that works.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.810
And this is the second
part of my book and

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:42.730
accessing your code.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:46.330
So the first piece of the
sequencing protocol, and I'm

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.870
just going to load them all
up for you, is blood sugar

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:50.300
stabilization.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.270
And I'm going to go through each
one and share with you

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.750
some of the fun science behind
how this all works.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:57.770
Because I think science
is really hot.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.160
And the more I know about my
body, the better I'm able to

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.000
work with it.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.470
And I feel like all of you smart
Google ladies are into

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:05.810
data and science.

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:06.510
Yes?

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:07.390
Not afraid?

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:08.560
Good.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.220
So that's the first thing.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.540
And it's so important because
of the nature of which the

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.060
endocrine system prefers
to operate.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.210
And stabilization of blood sugar
is the first place you

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:20.660
have to go.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.790
If you go anywhere else--

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:24.070
And this is one of the things
that I talk a lot

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:25.610
about in the book.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:29.180
How many of you detox, have done
a cleanse, have done some

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:31.040
sort of juice madness?

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:31.740
That's great.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.980
I'm drinking a green juice,
but I'm not on a cleanse.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.310
I just like to alkalinize
my blood system.

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:41.100
It's so important to appreciate
that just doing a

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.440
detox doesn't actually
get your endocrine

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.160
system to work better.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.080
It actually can make
you feel worse.

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.000
And it's because it's
out of order.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.220
So second piece, all
of you mentioned

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.870
that you were exhausted.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.305
And this is a state of
adrenal fatigue.

00:19:57.305 --> 00:19:59.170
I'm going to show you what's
happening with your adrenal

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:01.440
gland in a moment, of why that's
happening to you and

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.730
what you can do to restore it.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:07.870
One of the reasons why detoxing,
first, is a problem

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:09.590
for women who are dealing with
these issues is they are

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.980
typically all adrenally
fatigued.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.200
You all have some experience of

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.820
inappropriate cortisol levels.

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:18.960
When you start doing cleanses,
extreme cleanses--

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.260
Like the worst offender, I
think, is the master cleanse,

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.360
because you're living on lemon
juice and cayenne pepper.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.980
It's insane.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:26.940
And you're not really eating.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.590
You're further taxing adrenal
function, making all of the

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.230
problems more compounded.

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.490
Even though it might be trendy
and Gwyneth Paltrow's doing

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:39.960
it, and I love her, I just don't
want you to do it first.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.270
Because then in the third step
of the protocol, in the food

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:46.900
sequencing piece, we then do
focus in on metabolizing

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.490
toxins and eliminating
excess estrogen.

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:53.580
And we do that in a very safe
food based way that doesn't

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:55.270
cause you to feel any worse.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.900
And the last piece, which is
my most exciting piece,

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.580
especially when it comes to
the world of work, is the

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.290
hormonal synchronization
piece.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:08.050
How do you live in cyclical
harmony with the four distinct

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:12.080
hormonal shifts that you
experience in a 30 day period?

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.420
Because they are changing the
way you think, the way your

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.950
body wants to exercise, the
kind of sex you want to be

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.230
having, how much sleep you need,
what kinds of things

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:21.230
you're naturally going to want
to prioritize at work.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:22.610
They're affecting all of that.

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:25.530
And knowing how to lean into
that makes you healthier in

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.830
the short term, and also
more successful in your

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:28.970
life in the long term.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:31.595
And I'm 10 years into living
this life style.

00:21:31.595 --> 00:21:35.980
So I can assure you, just last
year, launching this platform,

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.100
writing a book, planning my
wedding, getting married, and

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:42.420
looking and feeling great, all
of that is possible because I

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.040
live in this constant state
of forward vector motion.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.230
What's really cool about your
cycle is that it's own form of

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:49.510
natural biotechnology.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.160
And we'll learn more about
that as we go.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.890
But let me introduce you to
one of my favorite people,

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.190
your endocrine system.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:57.810
I have such a great relationship
with her.

00:21:57.810 --> 00:21:59.130
She is extraordinary.

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:00.540
And I want you to get to
know her a little bit.

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:04.690
And this is just a very basic
rendering of how she operates.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:06.580
And we're just going to
go through the parts.

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.080
You have in your midbrain,
hypothalamus

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:10.150
and pituitary gland.

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:15.440
Think of them like the person
who listens to the voice mail

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.290
and then the switchboard
operator.

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:20.100
Hypothalamus is listening,
scanning your bloodstream,

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.000
negative biofeedback, really
seeing what's the hormonal

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.450
status quo right now in real
time, all the time.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:29.350
And the pituitary gland is
sending out messages to all

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.360
the other target glands of
the endocrine system.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.090
Oh, we need more thyroid
hormone.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:34.790
Oh, we need more adrenaline
or cortisol.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:36.680
Oh, we need more of
this or that.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.470
And that's your switchboard
operator.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:39.870
Then you have your thyroid.

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:43.500
Then you have the adrenals,
the ovaries, the pancreas.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:47.430
I include some other things
in here because, from a

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:50.150
functional medicine standpoint,
we also want to

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:53.760
consider how the body
is detoxifying.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.830
So I include things like the
liver and the kidneys and the

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:58.530
heart, as well.

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.380
Because it's all about keeping
things moving.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.340
So let's talk a little bit about
the first step of the

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:07.840
protocol and how your blood
sugar is operating.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.610
So how many of you woke
up this morning and

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:13.900
had a cup of coffee?

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.030
And how many of you had that
cup of coffee with nothing

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:19.660
else, just for the first
hour and a half?

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:20.140
OK.

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.960
And how many of you had the cup
of coffee with something

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.410
like a carb, like, I don't
know, not a pop tart, but

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:26.100
something like that.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.440
Like toast or banana.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.055
AUDIENCE: Does fruit count?

00:23:29.055 --> 00:23:30.400
ALISA VITTI: Yeah.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.700
Fruit's got sugar, yup.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:36.040
So basically, what ends up
happening to you is you wake

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.560
up in a state of hypoglycemia.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.740
So let's just define
the terms.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.550
There's hyperglycemia, too
much sugar in the blood.

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:43.840
Hypoglycemia, not enough
sugar in the blood.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.530
You wake up in a state of
hypoglycemia because you've

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:49.290
slept for eight hours,
hopefully.

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:52.560
And you haven't eaten, unless
you're hooked up to an IV

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.000
feeding tube, which
you're not.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.860
And so your blood sugar is
low when you wake up.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:01.670
So if you put something that
has too much sugar in your

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:03.000
bloodstream in the morning,
your blood

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.090
sugar's going to spike.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:06.860
And caffeine, and I ask about
the caffeine issue because

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.920
it's the one thing that you do
that changes your blood sugar

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.540
destiny the rest of the day.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.750
If you do caffeine, here's
what caffeine does.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:18.780
It indirectly has more sugar
secreted into the bloodstream.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:20.910
Caffeine stimulates cortisol.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.680
Cortisol, we'll learn in a
moment, talks to your fat

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.950
cells and has those fat cells
convert into glucose.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:30.220
So indirectly, it gets your
blood sugar levels up.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.910
It also stimulates adrenaline.

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:36.230
It actually prevents your body
from breaking adrenaline down,

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:37.090
is what caffeine does.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:38.660
So you feel the effects
of it longer.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.050
And that's why you feel
energized from coffee.

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.410
And I put major quotations
around that, because it's not

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:44.150
real energy.

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:47.340
It's just adrenaline that
you can't get rid of.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.910
So now you're blood
sugar's up.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.360
And no matter what you do the
rest of the day, if you've

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.300
done the caffeine the first
thing in the morning like

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.410
that, you will not get off
this roller coaster.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:58.700
You will be chasing that first
high all day long.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.640
So you'll crash midmorning.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.280
And you'll feel like whoever is
having a birthday and the

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.360
cupcakes are around or whatever
it is, you're going

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.380
to have more carbs than
you would normally.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.460
By lunch, you're going to
be doing the same thing.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:11.060
You're going to over indulge.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.320
And you're going to be beating
yourself up the whole time

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.510
thinking, where's
my willpower?

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.440
I told myself I was going
to be good today.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.780
And there's no possible way.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.170
The brain chemistry will
override you every time,

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:23.520
because the first thing the
endocrine system wants to

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:28.280
protect is not your period,
ironically.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.090
It's the sugar that's available
to the brain, the

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:33.410
heart, and the muscle tissue.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.070
If you do anything to mess
with the sugar that's

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:38.700
available for your brain, your
heart, and your muscle tissue,

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.020
you have no more say
in the matter.

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.320
Ghrelin will be secreted.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.050
All sorts of neurotransmitters
will start to get in line to

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:47.130
make you crave sugar.

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:49.560
Because if you haven't put
enough in, the brain is going

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.160
to freak out.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.320
And then all of a sudden, it's
going to try to bypass you.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.610
Because clearly, you have no
idea what you're doing,

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:55.930
according to the brain.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:59.650
So that's a typical profile
of what a lot of women are

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:00.230
experiencing.

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.650
And then even if you don't do
caffeine in the morning, or

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:05.320
you do it with food, or you
have, let's say, something

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.490
like half a bagel in the
morning, or a muffin, or

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:11.380
something that seems reasonable,
it's shooting up

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:12.940
your blood sugar level
no matter what.

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:15.820
And then you're going to have
insulin act on that.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.360
It's going to drop your
blood sugar levels.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.710
It's going to go all
over the place.

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:23.290
So you're finding yourself less
and less able to stay

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:26.410
away from those afternoon
cravings.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:28.710
How many of you feel
like at 3:30 or 4

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:29.960
o'clock, you feel awesome?

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.410
OK.

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:36.110
Crickets.

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:38.940
So I did a little experiment.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.030
I'm a researcher.

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:43.120
And so I sat in a Starbucks
for a couple of days.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.690
And I sat there all day.

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:46.340
I was just working there.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:48.560
And I just tracked
the patterns.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:52.690
And my thesis was that we would
see spikes in traffic at

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:55.100
Starbucks during the times
where people are

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.620
stereotypically hypoglycemic,
which is midmorning and

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:00.860
midafternoon.

00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:04.540
And let me tell you, the
zombielike march into a

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:09.940
Starbucks at 3:30, from 3:30
to 4:30, it is insane.

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:13.220
Don't even go to try and buy
coffee at that time.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:16.560
You will wait for 25 minutes
to get a cup of coffee.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.060
And it's not just the coffee.

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.140
Also then, oh well, this little
sweet thing only has

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.460
180 calories.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:23.790
And that seems reasonable.

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.560
So you're having more sugar
than you would normally

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.190
because your body is
requesting it.

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.540
And so this is a big problem.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:33.240
Also, any of you ever driving
in a car and see

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.560
someone with road rage?

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.220
Road rage is hypoglycemia.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:37.010
That's all.

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:39.190
If you see someone with road
rage, or even on the subway,

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:41.570
give them a bar,
like a Larabar.

00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:44.490
Just fix them right away.

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:48.770
What we want to see is blood
sugar that's hugging the

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:51.290
stasis line much more closely.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:55.040
And you get there by modifying
concentrations of

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.560
macronutrients during breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.160
And we help women figure out
what do they need in each

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:05.210
meal, based on their body's
response to carbohydrates,

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:08.140
proteins, fats, and
extreme sugars.

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:09.880
So how much can you tolerate?

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.310
How much can you tolerate such
that you're only undulating

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:14.900
around the line, versus
spiking and

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.230
dipping around the line?

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:18.950
And for someone who used to
struggle with weight as a

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:22.160
result of my hormonal issues,
just clearing this up alone

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.450
takes care of any sort of
stubborn weight issues that

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:26.450
you might be having.

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:29.580
So it's really, really exciting
to know that you can

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.100
just eat your way.

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.560
Eat to be thin, which
is really fun.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.650
Because I like to eat.

00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:36.910
Food is delicious.

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:41.150
If you don't get the blood
sugar right, it starts to

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.910
throw off that chemical
conversation

00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:45.240
in a long term way.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.890
So in the short term, we know
that it affects the brain, the

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:51.330
heart, and the muscle tissue,
and starts to have you secrete

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:54.440
all sorts of neurotransmitters
that get you excited to eat

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.500
sugar and zap your will power.

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.690
Will power doesn't really
exist in a neurochemical

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:00.965
standpoint.

00:29:00.965 --> 00:29:04.560
So I don't really think
to try to use that.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.810
I would rather you leverage your
hormones instead, because

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:08.720
they're much more powerful
than your

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.060
thoughts in a lot of ways.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.870
But over time, if you continue
to have this blood sugar

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:16.190
roller coaster, it's going
to affect your liver.

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:18.110
It's going to affect your
pancreatic response.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:19.400
It's going to affect
your thyroid.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.320
It's going to affect
your adrenals.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.510
And it's going to clog up the
pathways of elimination.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:27.290
And I'm going to share
more about that now.

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:32.790
Of course, at the end of all of
this, how is it causing you

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:33.530
to pay attention to it?

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:37.600
Because you may not notice these
discrete symptoms of

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.340
your adrenals being off, or
your thyroid being off, or

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.160
things of this nature.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.840
Although, in the book, I teach
you how to observe these

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.740
things in the body
in real time.

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:49.980
But how you'll notice it over
time is that all of a sudden,

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.120
your period will be funky.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.730
You'll have a big
heavy period.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:54.570
Or you'll have clots.

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:56.290
Or you'll have major cramping.

00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:00.100
Or you'll have PMS that just
rocks you and takes you out of

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:03.340
your life for a day or two,
which is not normal.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:09.420
And by the time you get to
observing a symptom like that,

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:13.420
do you appreciate, now, the
mountain of chemical imbalance

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:16.980
that has been persisting
for a period of time?

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:20.515
No hormonal symptom, from a
menstrual standpoint, a

00:30:20.515 --> 00:30:22.930
fertility standpoint, low
energy, low sex drive, just

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:24.880
happens out of the blue.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:25.920
Never.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:26.250
Never.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:27.660
Doesn't just happen to you.

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:31.400
It comes through improper
management of the food that's

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.560
affecting these things that
we're talking about in the

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.070
food sequencing that then causes
an environment for all

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:37.260
of this to start
to break down.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:38.840
Make sense?

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.020
So let's look at the adrenals.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:40.990
This is so much fun.

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:43.930
I love cross sections
of glands.

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:45.760
OK.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.280
I'm such a science nerd.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.110
But you wear cute
jewelry anyway.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:50.650
It's fine.

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.890
So the adrenal gland,
so powerful,

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:55.150
located in your mid back.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:56.530
Do you all know where your
adrenal glands are?

00:30:56.530 --> 00:30:57.500
Now you do.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.000
Over here.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.640
Right here.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.480
OK.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.180
And they are nestled in
with the kidneys,

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.530
really powerful gland.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:08.750
In fact, the inner most part,
the medulla, forms at the same

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:11.400
time in utero as the brain
and the spinal cord.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.330
It's a primitive extension
of the brain, in fact.

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:16.190
The cortex, which is what we're
going to talk about, the

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:19.280
three outermost zones, are
essential for your life.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:24.410
And unlike the brain, the
adrenal gland does not adapt.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:25.250
Not happening.

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:26.510
Doesn't adapt to stress.

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:28.090
Doesn't adapt to your diet.

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:31.380
It does not like it if you do
things that make it unhappy.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:34.530
And it will start to affect
you in very profound ways.

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:36.900
Now, I'm not going to get into
the zona glomerulosa,

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.590
fasciculata, all these wonderful
Latin names that

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:41.080
won't make any sense to you.

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.600
But what I am going to tell you
about is this relationship

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.570
between cortisol and DHEA.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:51.400
So if you notice, the two
innermost zones, the

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.000
blue and the pink.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.870
The blue is the zone that
produces cortisol.

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:59.950
The pink is the zone
that produces DHEA.

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:07.430
When you have stress, let's say,
you're on a deadline or

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:09.770
you're running late to an event
or something like that,

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:11.600
you get a little boost
of cortisol.

00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.045
Why?

00:32:12.045 --> 00:32:13.485
Why does this happen to us?

00:32:13.485 --> 00:32:16.820
Well, cortisol has a special
relationship with your butt.

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:19.250
How many of you have a special
relationship with your butt?

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:21.090
Just your adrenal glands do.

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:25.970
So it talks to the fat cells
that are stored in whatever

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:28.210
body part that tends
to store your fat.

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:30.840
But for women, it's usually our
hips, butt, and thighs.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.200
That's typically where
we tend to store fat.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.980
And cortisol tells
those fat cells,

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.800
hey, something's happening.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.030
We don't know what it
is, because it's

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:38.970
not the whole brain.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:41.080
It's just a primitive part of

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.570
responding to external factors.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:46.890
Can you please convert some
of that fat to glucose?

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:49.070
Because what is fat?

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:52.940
Fat is just long term
storage of sugar.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:54.210
That's all that it is.

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:56.750
So cortisol reverses the
process, get's it into the

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:57.330
bloodstream.

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:59.600
And all of a sudden, you have
a little bit of extra energy

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.700
for the brain, the heart, and
the muscle tissue to respond

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.660
to the external stress.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.050
Makes sense?

00:33:07.050 --> 00:33:09.620
Now, that's cool once
in a blue moon.

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:12.850
That's cool if all of a sudden
you have to catch the train.

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:14.210
And if you don't catch the
train, you're going to miss

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:14.780
your plane.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.940
And that's really great.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:20.760
But it's not great if this is
happening to you all day long.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.010
And here's why.

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.410
It has a suppressive
effect on DHEA.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:32.120
The more cortisol that your
adrenal gland secretes, the

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.000
less DHEA you will produce.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.750
And DHEA is the mother hormone
from which, for women, 90% of

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.740
your testosterone
is manufactured.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.690
So any of you who are feeling
like you can't build up muscle

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.070
mass though you are working
out, you still

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:48.930
feel soft and flabby.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:50.990
You go to flex and nothing's
there, but you've

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:52.570
been doing push ups.

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:54.610
Is that happening to people?

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:56.140
If you're all adrenally
fatigued, it is

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:57.420
happening to you.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:01.850
If you feel like you just don't
have the same stamina

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:05.360
for running around and doing
things in your life, this is

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.340
what's happening.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:08.199
Cortisol up, DHEA levels down.

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:13.850
If your sex response and drive
is kind of like, meh, this is

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:15.389
what's happening here.

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:17.770
And do you know what
I mean by, meh?

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:21.230
So what should it look like?

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:24.540
On a normal, healthy person
without any level of adrenal

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:28.920
fatigue, you get a nice surge of
cortisol in the morning to

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:29.630
wake you up.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:32.290
How is it that we stay asleep
all night and then all of a

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:33.639
sudden, magically, in the
morning, we wake up?

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:34.929
It is not the alarm
clock people,

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:36.800
although that does help.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.400
But if you want to do
an experiment--

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.360
I don't use an alarm clock.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.219
I just tell myself before
I sleep what time I'd

00:34:41.219 --> 00:34:41.820
like to wake up.

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:43.040
And then I just do.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.050
Why?

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:45.330
That's a whole other
fun conversation.

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:50.380
But my adrenal glands support
the ability of my body to wake

00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.000
up at the right time
in the morning.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.960
Because again, cortisol
surging at this

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.110
time is doing what?

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:59.780
Talking to your long term sugar
storage, aka your fat,

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.820
getting some of that to convert
in to sugar to help

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:05.120
your brain, heart, muscle tissue
go through metabolic

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.310
changes to feel like
they can be awake.

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:09.890
That's what's happening
in the morning.

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:12.150
And then you get another
surge midday.

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:13.550
You get a little bit
in the afternoon.

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:16.100
And it starts to taper off
dramatically so that you can

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.230
wind down and go to sleep.

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.730
Now, how many of you feel like
when you wake up, you kind of

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:22.160
feel a little hung over, like
groggy, even though you have

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:22.980
not been drinking?

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.790
I know you're all not drinking
every night.

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:30.090
But you wake up and you're
like, oh god, help me.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:33.040
This feeling, this is
a normal feeling.

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:33.680
We're all laughing.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.930
OK, here's what's happening.

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:37.860
You're having adrenal fatigue.

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:41.680
So instead of having that nice
surge of cortisol helping you

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:44.480
wake up with joy and vigor in
the morning, which is how you

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:44.820
should feel--

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:46.590
Remember when you were a kid,
you were like, I'm up.

00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:48.746
Somebody else wake up.

00:35:48.746 --> 00:35:51.020
Oh my god.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.870
That's how it should
be every day still.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:54.830
But that's not happening.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:56.970
Instead, we get not
enough cortisol

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:58.700
secreted in the morning.

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.370
We feel a little bit like
we're dragging.

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:04.620
Even though we're doing
caffeine, still we don't feel

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:05.800
the same surge of energy.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.940
How many of you had the caffeine
this morning and felt

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:11.380
like you were five and it
was Christmas morning?

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:14.720
No, it is not giving you the
return on your investment that

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.100
you would like it to.

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:18.000
And then, you maybe
get a little bit

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:18.890
more around the midday.

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:21.870
But you start to get your big
surge in the afternoon, late

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:24.110
afternoon, evening, even
as late as 10 o'clock.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:26.870
How many of you feel like
you're night owls?

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:30.350
And you wake up truly
after dinner.

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:32.770
And you're like gosh, I should
just do all my work in the

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:33.760
middle of the night.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.340
That's super cool.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.340
I'm not someone who's
a conformist.

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.030
I'm going to be in the
middle of the night

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:39.610
doing all my work.

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:40.540
No.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.840
This is just an indication that
your adrenal glands are

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.570
not performing the way
that they should.

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:47.750
There are four different degrees
of adrenal fatigue.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:52.050
This, I would say, is
about stage two.

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:55.080
Stage three and stage four
include other things like

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.360
major anxiety, response at
inappropriate times, even

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.470
panic attacks for no
appropriate reason.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:04.770
That type of a thing can
accompany heart palpitations,

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:07.920
sweating, it gets much,
much worse.

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.190
And think about it.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.370
We're talking about cortisol.

00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:11.320
We're talking about
adrenaline.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.200
We're talking about DHEA.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.980
We're talking about this gland
that governs a lot of the

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:17.050
functions of your response.

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:21.840
And it's hard to pinpoint
because it can be lumped in.

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.820
The symptoms can be lumped
in with other things.

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.620
Because you'll feel
generally tired.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.770
So maybe you'll think it's
a thyroid problem.

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:30.860
Or you'll have maybe
reduced immunity.

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:32.400
And you think, oh it's
just flu season.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.830
But actually, when adrenal is
underperforming, you are much

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:39.300
more likely to catch
everybody's cold.

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.890
OK.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:42.190
So there's all of this.

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:46.690
Poor digestion, improper
elimination, all of this can

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:48.140
be affected by adrenal
fatigue.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.450
So it's really, really
important that we

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:51.410
get the hang of it.

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:53.950
And depression and anxiety,
such a big

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:55.130
problem for so many women.

00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:59.040
We go through monthly bouts of
this if we're hormonally

00:37:59.040 --> 00:37:59.450
imbalanced.

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:02.130
But with adrenal fatigue on
top of it, the issue is

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:04.770
compounded in multiples.

00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:08.380
So if you're struggling with
a feeling of not feeling

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:11.690
yourself or feeling anxiety or
feeling continuous worrisome

00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:14.580
thoughts, we should look at
what's happening with your

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:18.210
adrenals and eat for
adrenal happiness.

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:24.560
Third piece of the food
sequencing protocol has to do

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.520
with your pathways
of elimination.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.100
And you have four of them.

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:33.790
And all them work in synergy
to help you break down

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:36.560
hormonal toxins, especially
estrogen.

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:37.790
Think about it this way.

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:41.600
Imagine if you were producing
adrenaline in the morning.

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.800
And then you weren't able to
break that down and get that

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.950
out of your body.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:48.180
How would you feel?

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:49.790
You feel a little, all day.

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:52.080
You feel anxious.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.820
And estrogen, this happens
to so many women.

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.950
You're producing estrogen
on a continuous basis.

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:59.080
That's your body's job.

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.430
Your ovaries are producing
estrogen.

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:02.990
This is what it's supposed
to be doing.

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:05.850
If you're not breaking that
down, estrogen's one of those

00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:08.140
hormones that's like a
double edged sword.

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:11.610
Just the right amount makes you
look and feel fantastic.

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:15.770
Too much or too little is very
problematic in different ways.

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:18.040
So if you have too much estrogen
that's not breaking

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:22.680
down, this can cause all sorts
of problems in terms of your

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:28.550
hormonal health, from weight
gain to fibrocystic breasts to

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:34.850
increased risk for cancer to
PMS, endometriosis, fibroids,

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:37.870
ovarian cyst development,
all of this.

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:39.270
Very serious stuff.

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:44.480
And what's interesting when we
think about how they work

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.740
together is that--

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:48.780
And the reason why they're
organized in this way is

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:52.790
because this is decreasing
magnitude.

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:54.230
So the skin is your
largest organ.

00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:57.020
That's why it's so important
that you make the choice not

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:59.940
to put things on your skin that
are going to already--

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:02.120
You're already dealing with
estrogen dominance because we

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.300
live in 2013.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.020
And this is the state that the
environment is polluted with

00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:09.810
so much xenoestrogen that
evidently fish, which develop

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:12.650
their gender outside of the
mother's reproductive system,

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:16.590
are all turning into female fish
in the rivers because a

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:18.930
lot of women are taking
birth control pills.

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:20.840
That's ending up in
our water supply.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:23.090
And there's chemicals
and pesticides.

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:24.340
It is happening.

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:27.010
So we are flooded with
too much estrogen.

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:29.260
And so we just don't want to put
any more on ourselves that

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.010
we don't have to.

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:33.300
The liver, I'm going to talk
about in a moment, but has a

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:36.320
special relationship with
your large intestine.

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.100
We're going to talk about
poop for one more time?

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:38.780
OK, you're cool?

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:39.950
You're cool with poop?

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:41.040
I'm so cool with it.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.280
Here's the thing.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:46.690
How many of you feel like you go
to the bathroom every day,

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:47.496
no problem?

00:40:47.496 --> 00:40:48.240
Put your hands up.

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.270
Everybody keep your hands
up until this no

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:52.840
longer applies to you.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:57.080
How many of you wake up and
go to the bathroom kind of

00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:00.100
relatively before noon?

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:00.890
OK.

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:03.870
How many of you have that happen
within 90 minutes of

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:07.120
opening your eyeballs, have
a bowel movement?

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.660
90 minutes.

00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:12.760
How many of you have that
within 20 minutes?

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.610
Great, awesome.

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:15.790
That's where you should be.

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:17.430
You wake up--

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:18.510
Oh wait, one last check.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:21.420
You have that 20 minutes,
no caffeine.

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:21.860
Awesome.

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:22.180
Awesome.

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:22.970
OK good.

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:28.010
So how it should work is
eyeballs open, glass of water,

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:31.230
brush your teeth,
bowel movement.

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:32.780
20 minutes.

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:35.190
If that's not happening, you're
struggling with a level

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:36.400
of constipation.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:40.180
And why that's important is it's
indicating now, if the

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:43.210
large intestine is the smallest
place that we have

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:46.550
elimination of estrogen, can
you imagine the backup that

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:49.380
it's going to cause in the
liver, in the lymphatic

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:51.140
system, on the skin?

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:53.810
Constipation, for sure, will
lead to skin problems.

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:55.990
And a lot of women are
struggling with rosacea and

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.950
eczema and acne.

00:41:56.950 --> 00:42:01.660
And all of this is a sign that
the liver, the large

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:04.570
intestine, the lymph are
overloaded with toxins and

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:06.500
that you need to change, not
what you're putting on your

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:09.270
skin to spot treat the
eczema, the rosacea.

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:10.010
We talked about this.

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:11.070
No more spot treating.

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:13.030
We want to start cleaning
up liver,

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:14.100
large intestine function.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.900
So let's look at the liver.

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.250
And I want to break down
the pathways of

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:20.160
elimination for you.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.580
This is super cool because
this really shows the

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.780
importance of what
you're eating.

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:27.826
Your liver has these two phases
of detoxification.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:35.850
The first phase, basically,
breaks your hormones down into

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:40.970
fat soluble, more toxic forms
of the hormone than it was

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:41.930
originally.

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:45.030
The second phase converts it
into a water soluble, less

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:48.610
toxic form that can leave your
body safely through the urine,

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:50.910
the sweat, the bowel movement.

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:53.720
So the skin, the lymphatic
system, the large intestine

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:56.630
are going to be the
transport systems

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:58.340
for this waste product.

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:03.150
What is required to be on tap in
your liver, stored in your

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:06.590
liver at all times are key
micronutrients to support in

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:09.120
phase one and phase two of
this detoxification.

00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:13.190
So these are things like B
vitamins, vitamin C, selenium,

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:15.390
glutathione.

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:17.440
I want to focus in a little
bit on selenium and

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.880
glutathione because they're
kind of fun.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.960
So how many of you remember the
whole story of the sperm

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.770
and the egg and when they come
together, it makes a

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:26.563
life, dah dah dah?

00:43:26.563 --> 00:43:28.450
Do you know why that happens?

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:30.070
This is so cool.

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:32.500
This is a little off topic, but
everybody needs to know.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:33.870
It's selenium and glutathione.

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:35.960
It actually is such
an important

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.860
chemical catalytic reaction.

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.880
Selenium is stored in the sperm
in high concentration.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.510
Glutathione in the egg in
high concentration.

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:46.910
When they come together, it's
the selenium and the

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:51.420
glutathione that react in a
catalytic way that starts the

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:53.026
cell dividing.

00:43:53.026 --> 00:43:55.310
Isn't that so amazing?

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:58.190
And it's because of what
you were eating.

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:01.520
You cannot supplement as
effectively the selenium and

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.160
glutathione versus other
supplements.

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.980
We know vitamin C supplements
are recognized by the body.

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:09.150
Glutathione, we haven't been
able to manufacture a

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:10.980
synthetic form that's
bioavailable.

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:12.780
You have to eat it.

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:16.240
And if it's not present in
adequate supply for your liver

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.400
and you're noticing little
breakouts, what's happening

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.890
with your egg quality?

00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:23.060
So we're thinking about
preserving our fertility for

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:23.670
the long term.

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:25.740
We have to be thinking about all
the ways in which this is

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:26.135
interconnected?

00:44:26.135 --> 00:44:27.630
Do you understand?

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:29.400
So how do we get glutathione?

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.420
How do we get selenium?

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:31.550
Selenium is easy.

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:34.070
Two to four Brazil nuts
a day, you're set.

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:35.252
That's rich supply
of selenium.

00:44:35.252 --> 00:44:37.170
This is good for your partners,
if they're men.

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:40.030
And they're working on sperm
quality, motility, health,

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:43.900
whatever, great to have them
be eating Brazil nuts.

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:49.060
Glutathione, lucky us, is found
in any every organic,

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.915
raw fruit and vegetable.

00:44:50.915 --> 00:44:52.800
It's in everything.

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.380
So if you were to have something
like one green juice

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:59.440
a day at any point, doesn't have
to be during a fast or

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:04.280
anything, or some steamed or
raw veggies, or some good

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.280
quality fruits, you're going
to be dosing yourself with

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:10.340
this essential micronutrient
that not only is talking about

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:12.280
preserving egg quality,
but also helping your

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.000
liver do its job.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.060
Because if we don't have
adequate supply.--

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.020
Remember, in phase one, it
breaks the hormones down into

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:23.060
a more toxic form, that ends up
circulating in your body if

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:24.730
it's not broken down properly.

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:29.020
And it can make your liver
perform inappropriately and

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:32.010
have you store more sugar as fat
in the liver and not break

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:33.300
down hormones the way
that you want.

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.285
So it's so, so important to
eat for all these organs.

00:45:37.285 --> 00:45:38.490
I know it might seem
overwhelming.

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:42.660
But trust me, it's so easy once
you put it all together.

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:45.920
So I want to go into the last
piece of the protocol here.

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:49.630
And then I'm going to open
it up to some questions.

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:52.620
The really interesting thing
that I found when I was doing

00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:54.740
all of my research in functional
medicine and

00:45:54.740 --> 00:45:57.200
nutritional genomics and
looking at all sorts of

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.560
interesting things like
chronobiology, which is the

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:02.800
study of the circadian patterns
of different organ

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:05.310
systems in the body, is that
I thought, wow, isn't it

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:09.070
interesting that no one is
looking at the pattern of the

00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:12.510
menstrual cycle and mapping
food on to that?

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:13.860
Because we can map--

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:16.650
For example, the adrenals
really love salt in the

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:18.940
morning, really don't
like it at night.

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:20.110
They like potassium at night.

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:22.440
So drinking a little coconut
water at the end of the day

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:25.280
can be a way to help your
adrenals release and relax

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.400
from cortisol overdose.

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.730
So there's food that maps
onto our different

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:31.960
organ circadian patterns.

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.910
But no one was looking at
that for the cycles.

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:37.740
So this is my big contribution
is, how do we eat to be in

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:38.600
cyclical harmony?

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.380
Because the reality is--

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:42.950
And I want to break down, you
have these four phases, in

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:43.760
case you didn't know.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.430
Because most of us know the
obvious one, the menses.

00:46:47.430 --> 00:46:49.170
And we might know the
PMS, but we don't

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:50.020
know what that's called.

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:50.950
It's called the luteal phase.

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:51.960
But let's go in order.

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.940
Starts with the folicular
phase.

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:56.080
Eggs developing.

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.420
Multiple little cysts on
the level of the ovary.

00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.330
Then you move into the
ovulatory phase.

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:02.520
One of the eggs leaves
the ovary.

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:03.310
Boom Boom.

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:04.580
And then we're in the
luteal phase.

00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:06.750
There's two distinct parts of
the luteal phase, which I'll

00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:07.800
show you in a moment.

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.420
And then, of course,
there's the menses.

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:10.610
Those are you four phases.

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:13.240
Happens to you whether you're
observing them or not.

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:14.990
But I'd like for you to be able
to start observing them

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.420
in real time.

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.760
Because most of us don't know.

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.446
How many of you know when
you're ovulating?

00:47:19.446 --> 00:47:23.950
Yeah, 2% of you.

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:27.290
Most of us only know when we
start menstruating because we

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:27.820
can see it.

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:28.276
It's obvious.

00:47:28.276 --> 00:47:29.890
And you need to get products.

00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:31.520
And that's when we
pay attention.

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:32.980
But what's really cool is,
remember how I was going to

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:35.190
ask someone to come up
and draw this chart?

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:36.730
Here's the chart.

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:38.210
Five hormones.

00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:43.350
The hormone that I don't have
present here just because we

00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:45.500
like to layer it in after so you
can see these first four

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:46.730
is testosterone.

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:49.710
You have testosterone patterns
that fluctuate as well that

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:53.850
affect your stamina at the
gym, your sexual desire,

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:55.780
preferences, all of that,
throughout the month.

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:58.830
And they are absolutely
mapped onto the cycle.

00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:01.660
Let's just break down the luteal
phase for a minute.

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:05.020
And I go into such granular
detail about all the little

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.180
parts of your cycle
in the book.

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:08.500
I cannot wait for you get
your hands on it.

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:11.083
But in the luteal phase,
you have two halves.

00:48:11.083 --> 00:48:16.130
You have the build half, which
is indicated by the rise in

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:19.190
the purple and the green lines
on the chart from day, let's

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:23.930
say, 18 up to 24.

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:26.830
And this is both estrogen
and progesterone rising.

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:27.780
Why?

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:29.460
Estrogen's thickening the
lining of uterus.

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.650
Progesterone's holding
it in place.

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:36.380
Then if there is no conception,
what happens?

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:39.890
Both of these hormones
start to drop off.

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:42.860
And progesterone and estrogen
start to diminish.

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:46.120
And the lining is able
to leave the body.

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.890
And that's when menstruation
starts.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:51.480
There are two distinct halves of
this because, I want you to

00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:53.250
pay attention to how you feel.

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:55.760
Most women still feel
perfectly fine.

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.450
They still feel like they're in
their post ovulatory glow

00:48:58.450 --> 00:48:59.980
the first half of the
luteal phase.

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:01.110
Their energy's good.

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:02.810
There's a little surge
of testosterone here.

00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:05.800
So we're feeling energized and
able to do everything.

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:09.400
The second half of the month,
depending on how far apart

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:13.430
estrogen and progesterone are on
this chart from each other,

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:16.510
is the degree to which you
will suffer with PMS.

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:19.050
So for example, if estrogen was
very high and progesterone

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:22.390
was much lower than what you're
seeing here, then

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:24.930
you're going to have cramps
and bloating and breast

00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:28.530
tenderness and mood swings
and all of that.

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:31.900
And if prior to that
progestorene levels are not

00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:33.330
adequate, this is
where it becomes

00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:34.950
difficult to even get pregnant.

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:38.460
So if you're thinking about
trying to make a baby, you

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:40.780
have to know where you are
hormonally in each phase of

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:44.080
your cycle so that you can do
that more successfully.

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.360
Now, here's where
it gets cool.

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:50.050
In the book, there are several
different charts that map out

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:53.820
for you each of these phases so
that you can start to plan

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:59.930
your food, your exercise, your
priorities, and your sex life

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:02.290
around where you
are hormonally.

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:07.360
Because these distinct hormonal
patterns, this is

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.040
happening to your brain.

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.750
Estrogen is flooding your
brain at different

00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:11.470
times of the month.

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:14.060
Progesterone, all of
these things are

00:50:14.060 --> 00:50:15.760
changing your brain chemistry.

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.460
And it makes a lot of sense
that you would feel

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:20.660
differently week over week.

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:22.920
Because you know intuitively
that you already do.

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:25.690
How many of you, for example,
first half of the month you go

00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:30.090
into a boot camp class at the
gym and you crush it?

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:31.340
You walk out of there
like, eye of

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:33.200
the tiger, it's awesome.

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.010
That happens.

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:38.100
Then same class, same you, same
Lululemon pants and you

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:41.160
go to the same thing two
weeks later, and

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:42.370
you're like, oh God.

00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:43.120
Make it stop.

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.600
When is this class over?

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:45.420
And you're thinking
to yourself,

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:47.190
what's wrong with me?

00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:48.636
It's not you.

00:50:48.636 --> 00:50:50.290
It's Where you are
in your cycle.

00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:53.640
And you're in the wrong class
for that time of your cycle.

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:56.330
In fact, if you're dealing with
adrenal issues and you

00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:59.600
overdo it with the exercise at
different times of the month,

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:02.720
you can actually make yourself
gain weight.

00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.060
How many of you have had any
girlfriends who've trained for

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:09.120
a marathon or triathlon and
they've put on 20 pounds from

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.130
doing that?

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:11.960
I see this all the time
in my practice.

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:15.060
This has to do with adrenal
fatigue, hormonal imbalance,

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:17.550
and overexercising at the
wrong time of the month.

00:51:17.550 --> 00:51:21.470
It's amazing what you can do
with a lot less effort and

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:24.690
strain on the body if you lean
into your hormonal natural

00:51:24.690 --> 00:51:26.140
rhythms that are happening.

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:30.920
So I wanted to give you a taste
of the priorities of how

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.210
your brain is shifting, your
neurochemical shifts, so that

00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:36.050
you might start to apply those
in your work life.

00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:39.170
Because my whole company runs
on this cycle, actually.

00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:40.790
We call it a form of body
time management.

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:43.550
Again, it's a natural form of
biotechnology that's governing

00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:45.540
the way your body performs, so
you might as well use it to

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:46.920
your benefit.

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:49.620
So during the follicular phase,
this is when the brain

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:51.830
is getting initial doses
of estrogen.

00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:53.320
And your brain is
starting to--

00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.500
Think of it like popcorn
of ideas.

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.360
You're like, oh, this would
be interesting to do.

00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:59.430
Or this might be an interesting
way to tackle this

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:01.320
project that I want to
get done this month.

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:05.490
This is a great time during
your, let's say, month of

00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:09.310
working to plan projects, to
map out your chart to do,

00:52:09.310 --> 00:52:13.210
anything that you need to do to
set yourself up for success

00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:15.360
for the month.

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.590
In the ovulatory phase, because
of the flood of

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:21.330
estrogen on the brain, you're
much more communicative and

00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:23.200
social and magnetic
at this time.

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:26.010
This is a great time to work in
collaboration with people

00:52:26.010 --> 00:52:29.380
in your team, to set up
strategic meetings, to ask for

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:33.320
a raise, to go on first dates
or second dates, or have

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:34.600
important conversations.

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:37.230
It would be easier for you
to do it at this time.

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:39.280
You can do it any time of
the month, of course.

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:41.050
But this is when you
will be most--

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:43.590
It will feel effortless
to you.

00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:46.780
In the luteal phase, the effects
of progesterone and

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:50.590
estrogen on the brain in
conjunction have a getting

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:52.580
things done kind of an effect.

00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:54.380
So I always tease women.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.950
And I say, OK, remember how
you've told yourself to do

00:52:56.950 --> 00:52:59.670
your laundry two weeks ago and
you just cannot get it done.

00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:01.470
But then all of a sudden,
something happens.

00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:04.430
You don't register as it moving
into your luteal phase.

00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:06.970
And you just want to organize
your shoe closet and your

00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:10.560
bills and do your accounting
and write thank

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:11.310
you letters to people.

00:53:11.310 --> 00:53:14.910
And you're just banging things
out, getting things done, this

00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:17.110
is naturally happening to you
in the luteal phase from a

00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:18.340
neurochemical standpoint.

00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:19.590
So lean into that.

00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:22.240
If you have to get things done
on project basis anyway at

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:26.060
work, why not try to leave some
time in your schedule

00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:31.150
during these weeks, these 10
days, to have project time.

00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:32.420
Don't over schedule yourself.

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:34.670
Make sure you give yourself
three hours a day to get

00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:35.780
things done and crank
things out.

00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:38.450
You will feel so much
more on top of your

00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:40.170
projects if you do this.

00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:43.130
Then during menstruation, what's
happening to the brain

00:53:43.130 --> 00:53:47.120
chemistry has you actually
having the maximum amount of

00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:50.200
communication across the corpus
callosum, which is the

00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:52.450
bundle of nerve fibers that
connect the right and the left

00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:54.320
hemisphere of the brain.

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:57.050
So this means you're
synthesizing data from the

00:53:57.050 --> 00:53:59.710
right and the left hemisphere
in ways that you don't the

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:00.540
rest of the month.

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:03.880
So this is actually a time to do
an evaluation, whether that

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:07.030
be evaluating people on your
team, if that's your role, or

00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:10.290
evaluating your own project
performance that month, or

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:11.820
evaluating how you're
doing in your life.

00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:13.680
Like, how's your relationship
going?

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.270
Are you really happy in
your relationship?

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:16.730
Or are you just tolerating it?

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:18.680
We all do that, unfortunately.

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:21.240
Are you really happy with what
you're doing in your job?

00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:23.950
Are you moving forward the
way that you want to?

00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:28.020
Now, think about a bicycle
versus someone walking.

00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:29.370
Put two people on
the same path.

00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:30.060
One's on a bike.

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:30.890
One's walking.

00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:33.610
Who's going to get to the
finish line faster?

00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:35.140
Bike rider, yes.

00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:37.680
And has to do is forward vector
motion of the wheels.

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:41.170
So imagine just doing this for
one month, how much you would

00:54:41.170 --> 00:54:43.710
get done, how far you
would accomplish,

00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:44.720
what you need to do.

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:48.480
Then project that out
one quarter, half a

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:49.980
year, a whole year.

00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:53.570
How much more progress you would
make by leveraging your

00:54:53.570 --> 00:54:56.700
hormonal patterns versus
not working with them?

00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:00.250
It is kind of like trying to
turn a television on with a

00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:02.200
remote control that only
has one battery.

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:05.250
You wouldn't even dream of
having no TV turn on.

00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:09.980
But we try, as women, to operate
not using this, not

00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:12.520
using this technology that's
available to us that is having

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:15.280
a real influence on our brain
chemistry, our physical

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:18.790
sensations, our moods, our
energy, our stamina.

00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:22.290
And because we're not using
it, we are inadvertently

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:25.590
working against it, from an
endocrine system standpoint.

00:55:25.590 --> 00:55:28.450
And it's taxing our
hormonal function.

00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:30.650
So we feel more adrenally
fatigued.

00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:33.230
Our period problems
become amplified.

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:35.660
Women are dealing with premature
ovarian failure.

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:36.720
They're not getting pregnant.

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:39.220
Their sex drive is going away
in their early 30s.

00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:40.760
Why is this?

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:44.720
It's not just the chemicals
in the food and in the

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.260
environment.

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:49.450
It also has to do with
how we're not

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:52.730
partnering with our bodies.

00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:56.370
So, so important to think about
how you can get into

00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:57.720
cyclical harmony.

00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:00.640
In the last section of the
book, I talk all about

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.060
different-- my favorite foods.

00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:04.900
And I just wanted to share some
of the favorite foods

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:07.860
that you can start taking away
from today to address some of

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:09.580
the issues that you might
be dealing with.

00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:12.990
So if you're dealing with any
sort of PMS or period

00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:14.990
problems, this would be the list
that I would give you to

00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:18.430
start with, in addition to
taking on the food sequencing

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:19.710
that we talked about.

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:22.260
First thing that I could say,
the most important thing is to

00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:24.490
eliminate soy products.

00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:25.940
I have the word reduce
on the slide.

00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:28.110
But I would highly encourage
you, if you're dealing with

00:56:28.110 --> 00:56:32.620
fibroids, endometriosis, PCOS,
PMS, ovarian cysts, heavy

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.210
bleeding, to eliminate soy.

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:39.940
Soy has high concentrations of
estrogen, especially if it's

00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:42.360
not organic GMO Free soy.

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:45.270
There was a study done in Brazil
on GMO soy and its

00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:47.970
effects on both male
and female rats'

00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:49.520
reproductive system.

00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:51.300
Poor rats, they had to
eat all that soy.

00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:53.880
And what they found was actually
that the GMO soy

00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:57.720
changed the uterine structure
in the female rats, changed

00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:01.020
the shape of the uterus
in the females.

00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:06.040
And what's really exciting about
what's going on with the

00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:10.130
whole genomic research and food,
we actually now can look

00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:16.100
in a laboratory setting at your
biome, your human genome,

00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:20.690
plant genomes, the food you're
eating, and the intestinal

00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:22.930
microbiome that you have
and how they're

00:57:22.930 --> 00:57:23.660
interacting with eachother.

00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:25.610
They're changing each other.

00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:27.120
These genes--

00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:29.750
The vegetable that you ate
has genetic material.

00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:32.200
It's mixing with yours.

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:34.620
And the bacteria that you have
in your gut is mixing with

00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:35.560
your genes.

00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:37.740
So you need to learn how to
partner with that whole

00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:41.660
process, otherwise it's going
to run your life.

00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:44.670
Definitely want to get
you more on kale.

00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:47.760
Kale, cabbage, brussel sprouts,
broccoli, these

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:51.670
cruciferous vegetables contain
substances that help the body

00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:52.950
break down estrogen.

00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:55.340
They also are rich in magnesium
and calcium, which

00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:59.180
helps during the PMS phase, if
you're struggling with that.

00:57:59.180 --> 00:58:01.240
And then, of course, this is one
of my favorite juices for

00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:04.130
women who are having
cycle issues.

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:08.050
And it's just a good cover for
blood building, for liver

00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:11.570
detoxification, and
for circulation.

00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:15.200
So you can get this recipe
and try it at home.

00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:15.930
Make your own juice.

00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:17.420
It's really, really great.

00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:22.240
Let's say you are thinking about
having a child at some

00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.410
point in the future.

00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:26.370
And you'd like to preserve your
fertility, make sure your

00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:29.080
egg quality is good, make sure
ovulation is strong.

00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.760
These are some things
that you can try.

00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:32.940
Turmeric has been shown to
improve the vascular

00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:34.230
health of the ovary.

00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:37.340
Cinammon actually reduces
insulin levels, which help

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:38.780
keep ovulation healthy.

00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:42.910
Avocado, one of the studies I
cite in the book, avocado

00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:46.190
should be a poster on every
IVF doctor's office.

00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:49.310
Because we now know, lab tested,
women who go through

00:58:49.310 --> 00:58:52.910
IVF and eat three avocados a
week versus women who don't

00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:56.420
eat any avocados have a 3 and
1/2 greater successful outcome

00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:59.750
with IVF than the women who were
not increasing levels of

00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:00.850
essential fatty acids.

00:59:00.850 --> 00:59:01.670
Why?

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:04.260
Hormones are all stabilized
in fat.

00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:07.120
And women on our no fat, low fat
diets are doing ourselves

00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:10.520
a huge disservice for hormonal
health and long term fertility

00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:13.730
optimization by not eating
good sources of fat.

00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:16.070
So each your avocadoes.

00:59:16.070 --> 00:59:20.570
In terms of energy and sex
drive, a lot of this has to do

00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:21.760
with your adrenal health.

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:23.760
So there are a couple of things
I would have you do

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.410
immediately.

00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:26.880
Get off the caffeine, because we
know it over stimulates the

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:31.340
adrenal, not even, green tea,
not even decaf, nothing, for a

00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:32.430
couple months.

00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:35.290
By the way, the whole protocol
takes three months to do.

00:59:35.290 --> 00:59:37.790
So don't think this has
to be a forever thing.

00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:40.140
But if you want to get your body
kick started to healing,

00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:41.000
give your body a break.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.110
And the summertime is very
easy to go off caffeine

00:59:43.110 --> 00:59:44.480
because it's hot.

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:48.340
You'll want colder things
anyway, so try it now.

00:59:48.340 --> 00:59:49.770
Get on a B vitamin.

00:59:49.770 --> 00:59:53.470
A B100 complex will contain
adequate levels of B12, B6,

00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:56.620
and B5, which the adrenal
glands need to perform.

00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:59.730
And I would say if you're really
struggling with adrenal

00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:01.480
fatigue, and some of the things
I talked about with

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.900
weight and energy levels
resounded with you, I would

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:08.040
definitely exercise no more
than 20 minutes at

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.910
a time at the gym.

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:12.030
After that, you're burning
your adrenal reserve.

01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:13.500
And you're causing more
spikes in cortisol.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.170
And you're making the
problem worse.

01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:17.530
So this will, of course,
continue to keep you in that

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:19.900
vicious cycle of low energy.

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:21.560
And when there's no energy,
there is no

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.550
reserve for sex drive.

01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:25.940
So if you want to bring sexy
back, it's not Justin

01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:26.470
Timberlake.

01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:28.780
It's B vitamins.

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:31.230
Although, he's so cute.

01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:32.160
Connect with us.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:35.720
We are a whole community of
women who are living in the

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.650
WomanCode way.

01:00:37.650 --> 01:00:40.890
We are all in flow with
our hormonal health.

01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:42.030
Find us on Facebook.

01:00:42.030 --> 01:00:44.720
There's a weekly video
series that we

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.430
have that's me talking.

01:00:46.430 --> 01:00:48.730
So if you enjoyed me talking,
you'll see more of me.

01:00:48.730 --> 01:00:50.090
And they're all under
five minutes.

01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:52.970
And it's really about how can
you be troubleshooting in real

01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:55.530
time all the issues that
you're dealing with?

01:00:55.530 --> 01:00:56.500
And connect with us.

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.010
I want to hear how
you're doing.

01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:03.180
So I want to open it up to you,
little ovary town hall.

01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:05.500
What are some questions
that you have?

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.880
What are some things that you
heard that you have some

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.040
deeper dive desires around?

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.690
And how can I support
your cycle, your

01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:13.050
fertility, your sex drive?

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:14.540
Lay it on me girls.

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:15.030
Yes.

01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:17.952
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned with
the different parts of

01:01:17.952 --> 01:01:20.142
your cycle that there are things
that you should focus

01:01:20.142 --> 01:01:21.848
on more, because [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:21.848 --> 01:01:23.796
when your cycles are.

01:01:23.796 --> 01:01:26.393
What would say if you had to
schedule yourself with some

01:01:26.393 --> 01:01:29.640
kind of medical procedure
or surgery or something?

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:31.101
Where in your cycle would
you have to do that?

01:01:31.101 --> 01:01:33.400
ALISA VITTI: Depends
on the procedure.

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:39.580
But ideally around the ovulation
time, where you have

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:40.870
a little bit extra
testosterone.

01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:43.250
So a little bit more stamina
and energy to

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:44.930
bounce back more quickly.

01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:49.080
And also because as you lead
up to menstruation--

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.640
How many of you have ever gone
to the dentist right before

01:01:51.640 --> 01:01:53.860
your period and notice that your
gums bleed a lot more?

01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:00.580
You have more of that potential
for happening.

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:03.980
So you have more bleeding
happening, less coagulation,

01:02:03.980 --> 01:02:04.700
leading up to that.

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:06.680
So I would schedule it more
towards the first half of the

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.640
month if you can.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.120
Great question.

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:08.550
Yes?

01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:11.583
AUDIENCE: So I've heard
two things.

01:02:11.583 --> 01:02:13.750
The one, that cortisol,
it increases that.

01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:15.650
It makes that deposit.

01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:18.500
But it seems like in this case,
it actually signals the

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:19.450
burning of fat.

01:02:19.450 --> 01:02:25.080
And I also heard that caffeine
helps stimulate metabolism.

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.770
And both of those things seem
like they conflict?

01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:29.220
ALISA VITTI: Yes.

01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:30.825
AUDIENCE: So what are your
thoughts on that?

01:02:30.825 --> 01:02:32.970
ALISA VITTI: It brings up
an important point.

01:02:32.970 --> 01:02:36.590
Every magazine you read every
month, isn't it annoying?

01:02:36.590 --> 01:02:37.460
There's like do this.

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:38.520
Now, do this.

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.830
And by the way, we're just
saying do the opposite of what

01:02:40.830 --> 01:02:41.950
we said last month.

01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:45.760
So this is some of the things
that this makes me feel

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:46.610
reminded of.

01:02:46.610 --> 01:02:50.100
But when we're talking about a
woman who's struggling with

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.690
menstrual issues, fertility
issues, low energy, low libido

01:02:52.690 --> 01:02:55.680
issues, adrenal fatigue
is happening.

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.420
Period pun intended.

01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:01.890
So we know that for woman who
has got these issues that

01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:04.130
caffeine is going to have an
adverse effect on her.

01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:05.840
It's not going to stimulate
her metabolism.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:08.530
In fact, how it works on the
blood sugar level is cortisol

01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:12.080
is going to get the fat out from
the fat stores into the

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:12.580
bloodstream.

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:15.140
But then the pancreas is going
to be hyper responsive,

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:18.120
secrete lots of insulin
to try to restore it.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.710
So that's how indirectly you
end up with more fatty

01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:24.410
deposits, because you have too
much cortisol being produced.

01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:27.680
So again, because caffeine is
triggering that for women who

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.530
are adrenally fatigued and who
are struggling with these

01:03:29.530 --> 01:03:32.690
issues, it causes a vicious
cycle from an endocrine

01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:34.200
function standpoint.

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:38.770
Now, for some people who,
let's say, are in their

01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:41.510
perimenopausal years, post
menopausal years, caffeine can

01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:43.250
be a beneficial tool.

01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:45.420
But for a lot of women who are
in their reproductive years, I

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:47.580
don't find this to
be great advice.

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:49.530
And unfortunately, a lot of--

01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:51.770
And I was on the "Dr. Oz"
show and all of this.

01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:53.560
A lot of these shows are
being watched by women

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.600
who are over 50.

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:58.410
And so a lot of the topics are
being geared towards that

01:03:58.410 --> 01:03:59.720
demographic, which is great.

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:00.860
They need support too.

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:03.790
But I'm really interested in
women who are still in their

01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:04.610
reproductive years.

01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:08.510
Because what you do in your 20s
and 30s will completely

01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:11.390
dictate your hormonal destiny,
your whole entire health

01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:14.590
destiny in your 40s, 50s,
and 60s and beyond.

01:04:14.590 --> 01:04:17.730
So I want to take your period
seriously for sure.

01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:18.320
More questions.

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.150
Great question.

01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.840
You had a question.

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:21.826
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:04:21.826 --> 01:04:23.181
Well, one of them you answered,
because I was going

01:04:23.181 --> 01:04:23.798
to ask you about selenium.

01:04:23.798 --> 01:04:24.784
ALISA VITTI: Good.

01:04:24.784 --> 01:04:26.263
AUDIENCE: The other one was
about what we put on our skin.

01:04:26.263 --> 01:04:27.249
ALISA VITTI: Yes.

01:04:27.249 --> 01:04:30.110
AUDIENCE: So spray tans, those
are all chemicals.

01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:30.866
ALISA VITTI: Oh.

01:04:30.866 --> 01:04:31.580
AUDIENCE: Right?

01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:32.160
ALISA VITTI: Great question.

01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.985
No one has asked me that
question before.

01:04:34.985 --> 01:04:37.270
AUDIENCE: I'm trying to stay
out of the sun and

01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:38.375
be good to my skin.

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:40.680
I wear SPF 50 on my face
every day now.

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:41.536
ALISA VITTI: Great.

01:04:41.536 --> 01:04:43.505
AUDIENCE: But I don't like
looking pale in the summer.

01:04:43.505 --> 01:04:44.970
So I've been doing the
occasional spray tan here and

01:04:44.970 --> 01:04:48.340
there, even thought I know
that's probably great either.

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:49.340
ALISA VITTI: Yeah.

01:04:49.340 --> 01:04:50.550
Here would be my
recommendation.

01:04:50.550 --> 01:04:54.260
If you really are limiting it to
two months out of the year,

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:56.630
I would say that's OK.

01:04:56.630 --> 01:05:00.860
I personally would never put
that chemical on my skin, any

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:02.575
kind of self tanner--

01:05:02.575 --> 01:05:02.992
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:05:02.992 --> 01:05:04.230
It's a self tanning lotion.

01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:08.150
ALISA VITTI: Just because
it affects melatonin.

01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:09.310
That's how it works.

01:05:09.310 --> 01:05:11.120
And melatonin's a really
powerful hormone.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.450
In fact, it's so powerful that
you cannot get it without a

01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:16.340
prescription outside
of this country.

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:18.490
In Europe, if you want to take
melatonin to help you with

01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:19.740
your sleep, you have to have
a doctor write you a

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:20.835
prescription for it.

01:05:20.835 --> 01:05:22.160
Here, we just go buy it.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.600
And we take massive
doses of this.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:25.840
That's a whole other
conversation.

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:28.340
But I would not use that.

01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:30.560
However, if you are going to use
it, and that's a personal

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:34.270
choice, again, I'm only asking
you to be good on protocol 80%

01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:35.260
of the time.

01:05:35.260 --> 01:05:37.450
Because if you have an
environment where 80% of the

01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:40.840
time you're strengthening your
endocrine response, the 20% of

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:43.670
your life where you make choices
like you're going to

01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:46.270
have a night of drinking, you're
going to have the spray

01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:48.730
tan, you're going to have
whatever food on vacation

01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:49.840
you're going to have,
your body can

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:50.930
bounce back from that.

01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:56.790
Any ratio different than that,
like 70%, 60% on, your body

01:05:56.790 --> 01:05:58.810
can't respond as quickly.

01:05:58.810 --> 01:06:01.970
And you start to get into
symptoms much, much faster.

01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:03.330
So make choices.

01:06:03.330 --> 01:06:07.940
If you're rest of you is
hormonally golden, fabulous,

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:11.270
you're humming along and
everything's great, then two

01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:12.120
months of--

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.190
I would rather you do the self
tanner, just because I would

01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:17.410
rather you not risk the aerosol
exposure of the whole

01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:18.440
way that that's delivered.

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.240
You're breathing it in.

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:19.980
It's a whole other thing.

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:21.850
I would rather you
do spray tan.

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:23.050
AUDIENCE: You would
rather, which one?

01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:24.440
ALISA VITTI: I'm sorry.

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:26.720
Self tanner cream, than
the spray tan.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:30.543
And I would also rather you do
it small amounts of the year.

01:06:30.543 --> 01:06:31.410
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:32.120
And then what about--

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.332
I've heard that there's organic
spray tan out there.

01:06:34.332 --> 01:06:34.800
Have you heard of it?

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.100
ALISA VITTI: I haven't
heard of it.

01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:38.310
But I would check out self
tanners at Whole Foods.

01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:40.770
I haven't looked, because I
prefer to glow in the dark.

01:06:40.770 --> 01:06:44.500
And I don't tan at all.

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.880
But check it out and see.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:49.630
Certainly, the organic self
tanners are going to have the

01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:54.760
surrounding cocktail, the
recipe, the lotion is not

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:58.160
going to have parabens and
petrolatum and other chemicals

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.400
that are known endocrine
disrupters.

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:03.180
So if it does exist,
100,000%, do that.

01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:03.860
Yeah.

01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:04.555
Great question.

01:07:04.555 --> 01:07:05.362
Yes.

01:07:05.362 --> 01:07:08.200
AUDIENCE: A lot of what you
talked about assumes that

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.525
you're not regulating your
cycle with birth control

01:07:10.525 --> 01:07:11.670
pills, right?

01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:12.450
So you mention00

01:07:12.450 --> 01:07:13.670
ALISA VITTI: Not true,
but go ahead.

01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.920
Keep going.

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:14.750
AUDIENCE: Oh.

01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:16.856
My question is, what if
you're on the pill?

01:07:16.856 --> 01:07:19.380
And you touched upon in
the beginning about

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:20.400
going off the pill.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:21.912
I'm curious what your
thougts are.

01:07:21.912 --> 01:07:23.200
ALISA VITTI: Yes.

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.330
Lots of conversation. about
the pill in the book.

01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:27.450
And I can go on and on and on.

01:07:27.450 --> 01:07:32.470
But essentially, you're still
having hormonal cycles if

01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:33.480
you're on the pill.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.940
If you're having symptoms, and
many women do still have

01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:38.620
symptoms of hormonal issues on
the pill, and if you have

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:41.020
adrenal fatigue, and if you're
constipated, and you're having

01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:44.150
other things going on, and
you're on the pill, the best

01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:47.960
thing for you to do is to start
getting on the protocol.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:51.940
Because if you then identify or
if you now realize that you

01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:54.360
have an underlying hormonal
imbalance for which you

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:56.190
decided to take the pill.

01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:59.340
And the pill for these issues
that we're talking about,

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:01.520
think of it like putting
masking tape over the

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:04.970
indicator light on your car.

01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:07.780
It's blinking at you to try to
get you to pay attention.

01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:10.550
Change the oil, something's
wrong, refill at the next

01:08:10.550 --> 01:08:11.720
station, something like that.

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:14.490
And being on the pill prevents
you from really paying

01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:16.510
attention in real time.

01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:21.029
But if over time, the symptoms
start building and it's

01:08:21.029 --> 01:08:23.100
undeniable that you have some
hormonal stuff that needs

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.170
addressed, get on protocol.

01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:26.450
And then you can work
with your doctor.

01:08:26.450 --> 01:08:28.899
We have so many women who do
this, who then end up taking a

01:08:28.899 --> 01:08:32.060
little birth control
pill vacation.

01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:33.479
You do the protocol
for three months.

01:08:33.479 --> 01:08:36.319
Then you take three months off
the pill and reassess, how is

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:37.859
your hormonal performance?

01:08:37.859 --> 01:08:39.870
Are you now healthy and
hormonally balanced?

01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:41.569
If so, your choice.

01:08:41.569 --> 01:08:43.270
Go back on the pill,
no problem.

01:08:43.270 --> 01:08:45.340
If you get off the pill and
you're still struggling with

01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:47.439
symptoms, there's more work for
you to do nutritionally,

01:08:47.439 --> 01:08:48.729
maybe another month or two.

01:08:48.729 --> 01:08:53.040
But it is so essential in your
20s and 30s to resolve those

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.010
issues now.

01:08:54.010 --> 01:08:56.569
Because what I don't want to see
is what I see often, far

01:08:56.569 --> 01:08:58.160
too often at my center.

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:01.350
Women who've been on the pill
for 15, 20 years with hormonal

01:09:01.350 --> 01:09:05.410
imbalances from their teens and
early 20s, fibroids, endo,

01:09:05.410 --> 01:09:09.500
cramps, whatever,
PCOS, even PMS.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.779
And then they find
their partner.

01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:13.300
They want to have a baby.

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.189
They're pushing 40.

01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:16.670
And now, all of a sudden,
you go off the pill.

01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:20.840
And you have a reduced
amount of time to

01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:21.930
correct these issues.

01:09:21.930 --> 01:09:24.510
And your stress levels are
high because you feel the

01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:25.410
pressure of all that.

01:09:25.410 --> 01:09:30.010
So don't do that to yourself,
meaning you now have some

01:09:30.010 --> 01:09:32.340
important information that I
know isn't being discussed on

01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:34.520
a regular basis unless
I'm here.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:35.660
And I'm happy to be here.

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:37.930
But share it with your
girlfriends.

01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:39.140
Hand them a copy of the book.

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:41.630
Let them know, hey, this is
really, really important that

01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:44.670
you understand and appreciate
what your period is actually

01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:48.132
telling you now about your
fertility in the future.

01:09:48.132 --> 01:09:49.094
Yes.

01:09:49.094 --> 01:09:51.980
AUDIENCE: So going back, instead
of having coffee and

01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:52.950
the bagel in the morning--

01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:53.985
ALISA VITTI: Is this what
you have for breakfast?

01:09:53.985 --> 01:09:55.010
AUDIENCE: No.

01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:57.185
Actually, I was eating dinner
foods for breakfast.

01:09:57.185 --> 01:09:59.592
ALISA VITTI: Dinner foods
for breakfast are ideal.

01:09:59.592 --> 01:10:02.882
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was eating
salty stuff or

01:10:02.882 --> 01:10:03.866
leftovers from dinner.

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:07.310
So what do you recommend eating
then first thing in the

01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:08.790
morning to set yourself
off right?

01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:11.110
ALISA VITTI: Depends on your
body's metabolism.

01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:14.330
That's why step one of our
process on the online platform

01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:17.210
is metabolic testing, so that
you know exactly what your

01:10:17.210 --> 01:10:20.890
body needs, carbohydrates, fats,
proteins, sugar in the

01:10:20.890 --> 01:10:22.540
morning, salt.

01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:25.750
And you know what works for
you and what doesn't work.

01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:29.510
We also teach you how to track
which foods are working for

01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:30.560
you best and which are not.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.980
So we do all sorts of fun
food experiments.

01:10:32.980 --> 01:10:37.070
But ideally, and it changes week
over week where you are

01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.550
in the cycle.

01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:41.360
And I lay this all out for you
how you can start your own

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:44.030
experiment on your own at home,
based on where you are

01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:45.740
in your cycle, what kinds of
breakfasts, lunches, and

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:47.070
dinners you would have,

01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:49.530
hormonally optimizing yourself.

01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:53.050
More questions.

01:10:53.050 --> 01:10:55.060
I'll take two more
before we wrap.

01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:56.692
You have a question.

01:10:56.692 --> 01:10:59.760
You've been looking at
me soulfully all day.

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.010
Tell me.

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:06.665
AUDIENCE: I'm curious to know
what you use on your skin.

01:11:06.665 --> 01:11:07.920
ALISA VITTI: Yes.

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:10.740
I just did a vlog about
is talking about

01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:11.360
clearing up the skin.

01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:14.240
And we got, I don't know, a
zillion comments about, oh my

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.360
god, what products do you use.

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:17.610
I didn't realize my skin
was that gorgeous.

01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:18.170
Thank you.

01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:22.530
And having been a former acne
sufferer, it's valuable to

01:11:22.530 --> 01:11:24.140
just continuously get
that feedback.

01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:27.110
Because when you've had acne,
you're never quite sure if

01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:28.170
your skin looks good anymore.

01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:31.510
But now, after so many years, I
think I'm getting the memo,

01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:35.860
All I use on my skin, for
real, I use two things.

01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:40.250
I use an alpha hydroxy acid
twice a week at night.

01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:42.100
I use something by
Earth Science.

01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:45.120
It's called AB glycolic
or hydroxy or

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:45.554
something like that.

01:11:45.554 --> 01:11:46.430
I buy it at Whole Foods.

01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:48.210
Very gentle.

01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:49.460
Twice a week, that's it.

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:50.750
I just wash my face at night.

01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:52.430
Other than that, I don't put
anything else on it.

01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:55.330
Maybe sometimes a little witch
hazel in the summer if I feel

01:11:55.330 --> 01:11:56.240
particularly oily.

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:58.395
I am Mediterranean, so
I self lubricate.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:05.100
And then for moisturizer, the
only thing that I use is pure

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:08.600
aloe vera gel, which you buy
in the sun care section at

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:09.730
Whole Foods.

01:12:09.730 --> 01:12:10.690
It's a little tube.

01:12:10.690 --> 01:12:12.300
I buy two a year.

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:15.170
They each cost $4.00.

01:12:15.170 --> 01:12:16.850
That's it.

01:12:16.850 --> 01:12:17.930
Aloe vera gel is amazing.

01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:18.520
IT's anti-inflammatory.

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.680
It's antiwrinkle.

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:22.200
It's natural cell turnover.

01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:25.930
And it's fantastic,
shrinks the pores.

01:12:25.930 --> 01:12:27.650
You don't need to get
sucked into--

01:12:27.650 --> 01:12:31.130
Once you know how food works in
the body, all the marketing

01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:33.600
about lotions and potions, you
kind of look at it like,

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.990
that's not true.

01:12:34.990 --> 01:12:36.850
None of that's actually true,
what you're saying.

01:12:36.850 --> 01:12:39.980
The simpler, the more direct
the ingredient, the better.

01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:40.860
AUDIENCE: Makeup remover.

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:44.025
ALISA VITTI: Makeup remover.

01:12:44.025 --> 01:12:46.480
What am I using?

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:52.430
Oh yes, I think it's another
Earth Science, natural, like a

01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:53.985
lotion, very gentle.

01:12:57.050 --> 01:13:01.740
Makeup, I use mineral makeup
at Whole Foods or Aveda

01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:03.600
mineral makeup.

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.460
I use natural mascara.

01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:10.650
I think the brand is called
Gabriel, things like that.

01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:14.530
Jane Iredale makeup, amazing.

01:13:14.530 --> 01:13:16.530
Lots of great organic
make up now.

01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:20.530
And there's a great website you
can go to check that out,

01:13:20.530 --> 01:13:22.170
Green Beauty, I think
it's called.

01:13:22.170 --> 01:13:25.110
AUDIENCE: Is Bare Minerals
actually minerals?

01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:27.120
It's actually good
for your skin.

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.341
You can sleep in it and
all that stuff.

01:13:28.341 --> 01:13:31.170
ALISA VITTI: Bare Minerals has
some chemicals in it that are

01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:32.210
endocrine disruptive.

01:13:32.210 --> 01:13:35.010
So that's why you should
check the ingredients.

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:37.770
You want mineral make
up that is without

01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:38.610
all of those chemicals.

01:13:38.610 --> 01:13:40.140
So that's why some of the ones
at Whole Foods are better.

01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:42.140
I think one is called
Mineral Fusion.

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:42.490
Yeah.

01:13:42.490 --> 01:13:43.680
You use that one?

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:44.480
AUDIENCE: I've used it before.

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:44.895
ALISA VITTI: Yeah.

01:13:44.895 --> 01:13:45.220
It's good.

01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:45.865
It's really good.

01:13:45.865 --> 01:13:47.646
AUDIENCE: What about
sunscreen?

01:13:47.646 --> 01:13:50.680
ALISA VITTI: I use Alba
Botanical sun screen.

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:52.030
This is so much fun.

01:13:52.030 --> 01:13:53.970
I am a product lover.

01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:56.750
So I should do a whole
thing on products.

01:13:56.750 --> 01:14:00.340
Alba Botanical, I use
their SPF 50 face.

01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:03.130
And then they have a really
yummy enzyme pineapple.

01:14:03.130 --> 01:14:07.060
So while your sun tanning,
you're also exfoliating dead

01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:08.960
skin, which builds up in copious
quantities while

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:10.430
you're exposing yourself
to the sun.

01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:11.430
AUDIENCE: Do you wear
that every day.

01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:14.220
ALISA VITTI: I don't wear
sunscreen every day,

01:14:14.220 --> 01:14:14.780
personally.

01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:16.830
And I don't spend a lot of
time out in the sun.

01:14:16.830 --> 01:14:19.880
And if I do, if I know I'm going
to be in the sun a lot,

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:20.860
I either wear a hat.

01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:24.010
Or I do put some sunscreen
on my face.

01:14:24.010 --> 01:14:26.070
But I try not to do it.

01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:27.590
But I think that's been
a good thing.

01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:29.820
Because people on this book tour
have been like, how old

01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:30.910
are you again?

01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:34.830
And certainly, it's a
combination of, obviously,

01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:37.850
what I'm eating and my hormonal
health, but also how

01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:38.750
we take care of our skin.

01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:40.850
AUDIENCE: What about
insect repellents?

01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:43.700
ALISA VITTI: Oh my god,
don't use it.

01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:44.890
No, no, no.

01:14:44.890 --> 01:14:45.860
AUDIENCE: I kind of can't
live without it.

01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:46.480
ALISA VITTI: No.

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:46.870
Yes you can.

01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:50.600
All you need to do is take 200
milligrams of vitamin B1.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.080
Changes the scent
of your skin.

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.290
Mosquitoes won't even
know you're there.

01:14:53.290 --> 01:14:54.650
AUDIENCE: B1 or D1?

01:14:54.650 --> 01:14:55.860
ALISA VITTI: B. B as in boy.

01:14:55.860 --> 01:14:55.980
B1.

01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:57.035
AUDIENCE: Take it every day?

01:14:57.035 --> 01:14:59.680
ALISA VITTI: No, just take it
an hour or two before you're

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:01.800
going to go out outside where
the mosquitoes are going to

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:02.390
eat you alive.

01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:03.596
AUDIENCE: Take how much?

01:15:03.596 --> 01:15:04.325
ALISA VITTI: 200.

01:15:04.325 --> 01:15:07.150
AUDIENCE: And so if I'm
travelling somewhere,--

01:15:07.150 --> 01:15:08.190
ALISA VITTI: B vitamins.

01:15:08.190 --> 01:15:09.845
AUDIENCE: --just take
it once a day?

01:15:09.845 --> 01:15:12.480
ALISA VITTI: No, take it before
you're going to be out

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:13.910
where you're exposed a lot.

01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:16.510
So typically, mosquitoes are
not out all day long.

01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:20.730
They're only out at night when
it starts to get cooler.

01:15:20.730 --> 01:15:23.480
Just pay attention to where your
trouble zones are and try

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:26.080
it around there.

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:29.750
The stuff in bug spray is
endocrine disruptive on a

01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:32.480
major, major scale.

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.740
So you don't want to be spraying
that on yourself or

01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:36.490
on children.

01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:37.740
Don't spray it on your kids.

01:15:40.130 --> 01:15:41.790
One last question, then
we're going to wrap.

01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:42.288
Yes.

01:15:42.288 --> 01:15:44.778
AUDIENCE: So related to
the B supplements.

01:15:44.778 --> 01:15:47.268
I kind of get this feeling
sometimes that we weren't

01:15:47.268 --> 01:15:49.260
designed to have to
take supplements.

01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:50.290
ALISA VITTI: You're right.

01:15:50.290 --> 01:15:53.762
AUDIENCE: So, with things like
the B vitamins, what kind of

01:15:53.762 --> 01:15:57.234
foods can we get those
quantities of B vitamins?

01:15:57.234 --> 01:15:59.110
ALISA VITTI: Complex
carbohydrates.

01:15:59.110 --> 01:16:02.050
Complex carbohydrates, eggs,
and animal protein contain

01:16:02.050 --> 01:16:04.150
massive quantities
of B vitamins.

01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:06.490
And so again, if you're someone
who is-- and we didn't

01:16:06.490 --> 01:16:09.620
talk about all the fad diets
that are out there, vegan,

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:13.750
paleo, fresh airaterian,
whatever you're doing, I am

01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:16.570
not dogmatic about food.

01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:20.780
To me, it's not so much about
the trend or a theory.

01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:24.190
I'm only interested in what is
the actual response that this

01:16:24.190 --> 01:16:26.530
food is creating in the body.

01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:29.280
And then I want to put that food
in based on if my body

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:29.960
needs that.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:33.490
So for example, if you're
struggling to have cycles at

01:16:33.490 --> 01:16:37.800
all and you're vegan, it might
be really great if you were to

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:40.800
introduce organic pasture fed
egg yolks into your diet.

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:41.120
Why?

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:43.770
They boost levels of
progesterone in the body,

01:16:43.770 --> 01:16:46.990
which you might need to get
your cycle back on track.

01:16:46.990 --> 01:16:48.590
And other B vitamins
do other things.

01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:49.650
And I can go on and on.

01:16:49.650 --> 01:16:54.040
But you have to be willing to
eat everything in the right

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.160
quantity for you.

01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:00.110
And for women especially, I
can't drive the healthy fats

01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:01.560
idea home enough.

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:04.500
And eating more fat will
actually, if you're dealing

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:06.840
with all these hormonal
problems, help you lose weight

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.090
faster, for sure.

01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:11.900
I'm so glad to have met you.

01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:13.750
I'm happy to sign
some books now.

01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:15.650
And I would love to stay
connected to you.

01:17:15.650 --> 01:17:17.510
We have free resources
for you.

01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:20.400
In fact, as a special thank you

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:23.100
shop today and to come to this,
I would love to give to

minute consult with

one of our Flo coaches.

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:29.160
So if there's any further
questions that you have, you

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:30.870
can certainly get
those answered.

01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:32.400
And I'll just need is

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:34.220
And we'll get you set up.

01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:35.700
Thank you so much

for your great questions.
