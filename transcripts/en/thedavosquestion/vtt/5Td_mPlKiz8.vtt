&gt;&gt;Hi YouTube. I watched Pablo's video, and
I really agree with you that it's slightly

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:14.280
different for CEO's than for doctors and lawyers
and everything much to show you. But the point

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:24.800
that Pablo made. About the fact that making
money should never be the only consideration

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.890
is something which uh even the greatest proponent
of capitalism whether it's Adam Smith or Ang

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:41.620
Rahm made very clear. It's one thing to make
money while you're doing good for your company,

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.300
for your shareholders, your workers, and it's
another to make money while you're taking

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.870
you're company down the drain. This is really
what's been happening. We've had CEO's get

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:01.260
bonuses while their company has been saving
why the company has been failing. Look at

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.490
John (inaudible) redecorating his office to
the tune of a million dollars while getting

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.900
money from the taxpayers to bail out this
company. This is what should be unacceptable

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:22.120
and that's where a moral compass, a code of
ethics needs to prevail. So the rule should

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.260
be: don't make money for yourself in times
of (inaudible) or redecorating your office

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.150
or anything like that while you're taking
money from the taxpayers. And don't do it

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.950
while your company is going down the drain.
I think these are two very,very basic ethical

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.650
rules that our CEO's need to follow otherwise
they're becoming the Marie Antoinettes of

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.830
the economic (inaudible). Remember when we
read about Marie Antoinette we used to sort

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.160
of laugh how could she have possible had said
"Let them eat cake" when she was getting any,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.310
and many of our CEO's aren't getting it either.
