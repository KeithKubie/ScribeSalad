1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,320
Did you see the clip that uh, um, uh,

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,950
Crooklyn from a Kirkland on,

3
00:00:06,951 --> 00:00:11,951
on Twitter put up of I'm the owner of
bare knuckle boxing saying that a fighter

4
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:18,150
didn't fight hard enough.
Yeah, I saw that. Yeah. I um,

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,360
and, and, and he was proud of these.
Like this is the way we do it.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,790
See if you can find her tweet.
Yeah. This is the way we do it.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,570
This is what you could expect.
Yeah. That was ridiculous.

8
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,210
You just going to dock a guys
pay. Yeah. So she's getting,

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,580
he took 50% of his money
cause it didn't meet. Yeah.

10
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:35,030
Cause it didn't meet his
standards. Yeah. I just,

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,380
I'm one when he said did the crowd
chair as something that get done. Yeah,

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,740
I think so. I hope not. I'd hate to
see that some of the crowd gets here.

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,440
I said to the president,
I'll go up bare knuckle fighting champion.

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,150
This is Mr. David Rico phone man. He
looks like he's on coke. Look at them.

15
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:51,680
At least

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,440
looking at both of you guys having fun.
The make some noise.

17
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,070
[inaudible]

18
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,340
no fighting championship.
It's a brand new sport.

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,360
Nupur new company and we're here for
action and we want action and we demand

20
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:07,120
action from the fighter.

21
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,110
Mm.

22
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,740
We didn't get accident that last bite
cause rusty Crowder, one of the run,

23
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,140
therefore he's given half this Perth
to Reggie Barnett. Make some noise,

24
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,710
Biloxi. This is how we do it. At bare
knuckle, you fight or you don't get paid.

25
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,060
That's not good.

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,980
It's not good that he thinks that Zombie
Prophet wrote this can't be legal.

27
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,900
It was. See what Stephie
Hayes wrote, uh, Crooklyn MMA.

28
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,530
Wonder how that works. So like, okay.

29
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,680
[inaudible] she wrote what the
actual fuck is this hillbilly halted?

30
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,040
Ah, yeah. I concur.

31
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,290
What in the actual fuck is that hillbilly
bullshit? No pride. They used to dark,

32
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:58,470
right? The yellow card was a, yeah. A
yellow card is a penalty for being boring.

33
00:01:58,471 --> 00:02:01,960
Most of them were. Yeah. And
sometimes irresponsibly. I,

34
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,400
I've watched some of those yellow
cards. I'm like, you crazy. You crazy.

35
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,890
Take that back. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He gave the guy a yellow car.

36
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:11,130
He can't fight the harder. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah. We can't engage.

37
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,000
He's going to get lit up.

38
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,330
And these these moments we have to
try to figure out what the fuck to do.

39
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,410
You're on the outside, you're trying to
figure out how to get in. Right, right.

40
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,420
Well, and you get in and
then the referees, I caught
fight fight and you're like,

41
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,210
but in Asia at some of the,

42
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,020
like some of them as I used to work
a lot at this Korean show and they've

43
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,670
changed. They're figuring out their
style. But man, when I first got there,

44
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:34,440
they're like, um, so there's a yellow
card. Any backward step, a backstep,

45
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,980
any backstep you should, we move on
to take to give you a little card.

46
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,270
And I was like, Leo Machida would never
make any money. That's what I'm saying.

47
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:44,370
I don't know if I can do with that.
I don't think that's,

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,370
I mean you invited me over
here for a reason. I'm, I'm,

49
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,590
I'm just going to do what I
do and hope you bring me back,

50
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,250
but I don't know if I can do that.
Yeah. Good for you. Yeah. Do,

51
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,290
do you ever go to a place and the
commissions or a promoter will tell you,

52
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,160
hey, fights, go to the ground.

53
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,350
I want you to give it just a couple
of seconds and stand them up.

54
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,590
I go places and people telling me
what to do all the time. Really.

55
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,590
And I'm not gonna do it cause
people in the end of the day,

56
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,850
no one's gonna know that you told me to
do it. It's going to be me doing it 100%.

57
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:17,740
So yes. Yeah. So I'm gonna um,
yeah, I can't, I can't. Um,

58
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,540
yeah, basically. So glad you just said
it that way too. Cause that's, that's,

59
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,330
people need to get that in their head
because I know that sometimes people do

60
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:30,331
get affected by whether they want to
please a promoter or please a crowd or,

61
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,970
and they're not doing the right thing.
It's such a tremendous responsibility.

62
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:37,120
Yeah. You're going to be a bit,
you're the one who's going to be a,

63
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,300
for some of those choices, you
know, those choices that they made,

64
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,980
they're making those choices with
your name, so yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

65
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:49,690
Like the backstep key,
Kevin Johnson answering the guy.

66
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,350
But this is a tweet from the bare
knuckle FC. Okay. Kevin Johnson,

67
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:55,300
no money was taken from any fighters.

68
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,820
That statement did exactly
what it's supposed to,

69
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,950
we're supposed didn't say to suppose and
lit a fire under every single fighters

70
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:07,951
ass from that point on giving you one
of the greatest fights you'll ever see.

71
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

72
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:16,030
Those guys fought that way because that's
who the fuck they are. Right, right.

73
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No,

74
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,340
there's no had nothing to do with that.

75
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,170
Jason Knight and autumn low off.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You can't,

76
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,200
you can't claim credit for a hint clearer
for Jason Knight doing what he did on

77
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,330
the lowball fuck Outta here.

78
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:37,630
They would fight that way in
a fucking Walmart parking lot.

79
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,080
That's how those guys would fight every
time they fight their case and night.

80
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,170
Both those dudes are,
and both those Luther's so tough.

81
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,150
Jason Knight has my favorite nickname.
Hick Diaz. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

82
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,390
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like
a bad mother fucker. Yeah. Uh,

83
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,580
he's a bad motherfucker that, but it
was tough looking at their faces, man.

84
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,440
After the fight, I was like, man, I
might have to rethink my position on,

85
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,240
on bare knuckle fights. Look at
their faces afterwards. Yeah.

86
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,560
I mean that is crazy. You know,
it's a lifetime of cuts. Yeah.

87
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,960
All over the phone I'm looking at is,
is right under his nose cocktail.

88
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,860
Crazy cut man. He stitched, stitched
the fuck up all over the place.

89
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,480
That is rough man.
His whole face got lacerated.

90
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:33,240
I mean that is a lot
of cuts. Yeah. It's a,

91
00:05:33,241 --> 00:05:36,400
that's more like a Moyie Thai fight
and it really makes you think,

92
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,230
but I can't, I'm, that's gotta be the
most brutal. Right. More time. Yeah,

93
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:44,350
I believe so. [inaudible]
type bare knuckle would be
like, what do they call it?

94
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:46,050
Left way where they just stay,

95
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,530
they kind of like wrap the hands up in a
a hand wrap. Yeah. It's up bare knuckle.

96
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:54,010
But it's um,
I think a bare,

97
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,320
bare knuckled Moitai would be the hardest.
But the thing,

98
00:05:57,321 --> 00:06:00,350
what my argument was always,
and it still remains this,

99
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,720
that if you're not going
to pad anything else,

100
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,100
like you're not going to pad the shins,

101
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:07,610
who not going to bad the knees or the
elbows. Why you padding the knuckles,

102
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,380
you're just giving people a false sense
of security in terms of what is actually

103
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:14,840
effective.
We don't want,

104
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,850
we don't want to practice something that
doesn't really work if you don't have

105
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:23,510
gloves on. Right. I mean, if
every time you punch someone,
you don't have gloves on,

106
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:26,870
your hand would break. We would do
okay. We clearly can't punch people.

107
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:30,590
It's stupid. You gotta use elbows and
knees and you got to do something. Right.

108
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:31,040
Right,
right.

109
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,040
So in order to fight with your
knuckles as much as UFC fighters do,

110
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,160
you pat everything you
pad that you put raps,

111
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,820
you put padding over at boxing is like,
it's a different world.

112
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,220
As soon as you take gloves off,
it's a different world.

113
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:50,990
Punches get in that you can't block,
it's it's way more consequence.

114
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,130
Lot more cuts.

115
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,100
But at least now we know
what actually works. Right.

116
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,470
I see. Interesting. I wasn't thinking
about it from that point of view.

117
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:05,150
He has that has given people, people are
thinking that, uh, yeah, you're right.

118
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:07,310
Like people think that
boxing will be four in May,

119
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:10,050
may or thing was the most effective
way of doing things. Yeah.

120
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:15,190
But then when you a MMA as
a whole different from the
size of the boxing glove,

121
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:16,551
oh,

122
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:19,190
the techniques you can do and what you
can't do and what's gonna work and what's

123
00:07:19,191 --> 00:07:20,620
not gonna work. Yeah. It's,

124
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,550
it's supposed to be the sport of fighting
and you basically brought it down to a

125
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:26,331
raw form,

126
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:30,740
but you're still covering the knuckles
and patting the knuckles just because of

127
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:33,650
perception and see the
problem with that guy,

128
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,850
this bare knuckle got boxing guy when he
says some stupid shit like that is that

129
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:42,590
it reinforces what people
don't like about combat sports.

130
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,400
What people don't like about
the idea of bare knuckle boxing.

131
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:50,370
That it's brutal and it's just there for
chaos and write, write, write, write.

132
00:07:50,371 --> 00:07:54,980
We come for action. We're
here to see action that guys
think out about MMA. Yeah.

133
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:59,930
And, and I don't think that, um,
I don't think that a MMA athletes,

134
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,250
I think a MMA athletes I think
are the most honorable and,

135
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,230
uh, well behaved. And, you
know, not because of fear,

136
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:10,970
anything because of what the sport is.
