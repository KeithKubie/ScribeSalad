00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.440
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.656
&gt;&gt; A man I have the honor

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.330
of introducing today
needs little introduction

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.790
to a literary crowd such as this.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.260
With 23 books to his name Richard
Rhodes is among the most prolific

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.256
authors here today.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.920
His best known work maybe
the making of the atomic bomb

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.153
for which he won a Pulitzer Prize in
non fiction, a National Book Award,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.086
a National Book Critics Circle
Award, and it was the first volume

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.170
in a series about the
makings of the nuclear age,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.990
a project that has absorbed
him for more than 20 years.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.880
His new book for which
he is on a book tour

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.536
at the moment is the
fourth and final volume

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.490
in that epic series The
Twilight of the Bombs.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.420
It examines the civilization's
changes brought

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.920
about by nuclear technology
in the post cold war years,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.453
the securing of the former Soviet
nuclear arsenal, the first Iraq war

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.993
and the lead up to the second, the
prospects for nuclear abolition

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.546
and an issue that I think
preoccupies us all here today the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.840
risk of nuclear terrorism but when
I mentioned to one of my colleagues

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.656
that I'd be introducing
Richard Rhodes he said, "Aha!

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.356
The nuclear bomb guy."

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.610
Many of you probably think of him
that way but take a quick spin

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.600
through a list of his published
works and you'll see what a diverse

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.620
and accomplished author he is.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.276
He has written about dogs
and of course of horses,

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.803
two of my favorite subjects, about
greeting cards and cannibalism,

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.616
about sex and soy beans, and
he's done it in the Rolling Stone

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.143
and the Journal of Chemical
Education, in Playboy and of course

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.850
in the pages of the Washington Post.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.350
Among his 23 published books
are 4 works of fiction,

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.576
a personal memoir and a biography.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.440
He's been host and correspondent
for public TV's Frontline

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.886
and he's written at least
one play Reykjavik based

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.036
on the historic 1986
summit in Iceland

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.730
between Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.153
Most of what he's written is
what I would call nonfiction

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.156
and what he I think has another
term for and I'm going to ask him

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.616
to elucidate that for
us a little bit.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.930
Let me invite him to explain it
and tell us more about the Twilight

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.170
of the Bombs and also for
anybody who would like hear more

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.080
from him he will be speaking
and signing books at Politics

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.300
and Prose tonight at 6 o'clock

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.353
so please invite your
friends along to that too.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.380
Thank you.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.880
[ Applause ]

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.613
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.413
It seems really appropriate to
follow Henry because he was talking

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.606
about Leo Szilard and of course the
making of the atomic bomb begins

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.506
with the day Leo in 1933 walked
across the street in London

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.210
and thought of the idea of a
nuclear chain reaction that kind

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.160
of started this whole
story moving forward.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.280


00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.610
This last volume that
I've just published--

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.956
let's see, here is
at least the front,

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.376
there's a wonderful bomb
test winding around the back

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.866
and I think it will be the last,
picks up the story at the end

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.913
of the Cold War just before the
collapse of the Soviet Union

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.050
and it's metastases into
four nuclear powers instead

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.583
of one nuclear power which was a
great challenge to our government

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.350
and our diplomats and
carries it forward

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.923
to approximately the present.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.146
Perhaps the turning point

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.153
or the ending point being President
Obama's historic speech at Prague

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.203
in the spring of 2009
when he announced it

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.663
as official US Government policy

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.133
to move toward the complete
elimination of all nuclear weapons.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:55.770
A dream that had-- yeah.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.670
[ Applause ]

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.440
&gt;&gt; A dream that had
also been a theme

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.186
of President Ronald Reagan's life
who he had indeed since the end

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.913
of the second world war have
been puzzling over the question

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.333
of how you could get rid of
nuclear weapons but he turned

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.590
to a technological
solution to the problem.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.793
So in my play where Robert
Oppenheimer comes back to life

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.576
from the dead to-- because
they needed a character

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.023
who could stand outside
the story and comment on it

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.063
and of course Robert Oppenheimer
being Robert Oppenheimer

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.043
as it is he steps on stage he takes
over the play but be that as it may,

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.303
at some point Oppenheimer says
to Reagan well, but you know,

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.233
you are trying to solve a
problem that's a political problem

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:47.036
with a technological solution and
then Reagan says to him well isn't

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.150
that what your bombs were anyway?

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.210
And he was right, he is right.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.360
We got into this business
during the war because we feared

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.733
that the Germans had a
considerable lead, we continued it

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.390
because we were frightened of
the Soviet Union's capabilities

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.583
and we continue it after
the end of the cold war

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.703
with considerable difficulty in
rationalizing why we still need

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.973
so many nuclear weapons
in our arsenal.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.436
So I picked up the story
at that point and deal

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.830
with the serious problems we had
in trying to put the nuclear genie

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.853
that had-- was now spread across
4 countries not only Russia

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.913
but also Belarus and Kazakhstan
and Ukraine, how we convince

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.060
over the next 5 years those
countries other than Russia

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.660
to send their arsenals
back to Russia

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.446
to sign a nuclear nonproliferation
treaty and become non-nuclear states

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.093
and that's quite a story in itself.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.863
But there was so much more going
on, the image that I opened the book

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.590
with is the sentence, when the
ice broke on the river of history

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.983
at the end of the Cold War
and because the world had been

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.213
so polarized for the previous
40 or 50 years it's true

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.290
that in a sense everything
came loose

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.096
and each individual nation
state had to think about finding

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.896
or adjusting it's relationship
to the rest of the world.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.666
And I think that accounts
for the diminished fifth

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.376
of new third world nuclear
powers, a very few of them

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.630
but certainly North Korea and Iraq--
I'm sorry, and Pakistan that emerged

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.940
after the end of the Cold War as
those countries tried to figure

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.256
out where they were and what
their relationship would be

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.343
with the new world that
was no longer bipolar

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.353
but was now multi polar,
multi lateral.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:12.076
One of the things that I write about
and that I think you will enjoy

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.380
in this new book was the inspections
in Iraq after the first Gulf War.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.293
You remember that President Bush
the first elicited an argument

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.193
about an Iraqi Nuclear Weapons
Program as one reason for that war.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:32.320
It turns out that the reason he
did so was that he was concerned

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:39.766
that after we cleared the Iraqis out
of Kuwait it might not be possible

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.293
in terms of international politics
to justify continuing into Iraq

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.896
and reducing the scale of Iraq's
military forces which was the plan.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:56.056
Therefore, he had to invent, which
he did, an Iraqi Nuclear Program,

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.033
we did not know there was
such a thing at the time.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.320
There were hints but
no real evidence

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.066
so imagine everyone's surprise after
that very brief war when it turned

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:12.063
out there were in deed Iraqi nuclear
facilities under development all

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.026
over the country, a
very large scale program

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:15.933
that in some ways corresponded
to the Manhattan Project here

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:19.986
in this country and that they
were trying different methods

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.293
for enriching uranium and so forth.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.126
The stories that I heard from
David Kay and Bob Gallucci

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:35.256
who were the two Americans who
led those inspections for the IAEA

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.650
and for the United
Nations were wonderful cops

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.453
and robber stories among
other things because our guys

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.566
with some kind of broken down UN
land rovers were chasing the Iraqis

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.236
around their own country.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.970
In particular we had hints that
they were using an old World War II

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.013
technology to enrich uranium
which is called Cyclotron

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.980
or electromagnetic
isotope separation

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.206
that involved magnet cores
that weighed 60 tons and were

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.703
about 15 feet in diameter.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.620
They were big discuss-shaped soft
iron cores for the big magnets

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:22.543
that would separate
the different isotopes

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.230
of uranium and enrich it thereby.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:33.470
The Iraqis were loading these huge
magnet cores onto tank transporters

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.626
which are huge flatbed trucks
and as we came in the front door

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.876
in our land rovers we, the
inspectors, they were driving

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:47.676
out the back door of the base with
these magnet cores on big trucks.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.583
So Bob and David talked
about chasing around,

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.320
being fired into the air by the
Iraqis, because they were trying

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.760
to get television footage
of this equipment

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.376
to prove that they had seen it.

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.910
&gt;&gt; And of course eventually
tracking down the materials

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:08.130
and either removing
them from their country

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.796
or destroying them
by blowing them up.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:17.513
You remember the days
when the team was stuck

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:22.183
in a parking lot outside the
Department of Agriculture

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.520
in downtown Baghdad
because as they--

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:31.186
Kay told me they had found down in
a basement room of the Department

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:35.096
of Agriculture the actual
plans for an Iraqi bomb.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:37.346
And they were determined to get
those documents out of that building

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:41.273
and in fact by the time the parking
lots standoff occurred the documents

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:46.940
were already gone.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:48.053
I asked David Kay how they
snuck them out and he said,

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.173
well we had these great Kiwi
medics who were helping us out.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:56.353
He said, I had a guy on my
team who had the worst case

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.900
of diarrhea I'd ever seen
and he had to be taken out

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:03.773
and the Iraqis agreed to let him
go, he said so we gave the documents

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:11.053
to the Kiwis they stuffed
them in their shirt

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.773
and carried the stretcher out the
door and the documents were safe

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:17.203
but they didn't want to
tell the Iraqis that,

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:20.510
the Iraqis weren't prepared
to let them go until they gave

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.443
up the documents and so
for 4 days they stood

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.186
in that parking lot
unsure of their fate.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:27.953
This has its comic side but
it was very serious business.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:36.146
Their lifeline to the outside world
was a 1991 type satellite telephone

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.106
and they were on that phone the
first of the four days nonstop

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:46.743
for 23 hours to CNN and any other
news media that as the satellite

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.966
or as the earth turned they were
able to hit different time zones

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.346
and they continued their
radio broadcasting.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:00.506
But at 23rd hour approximately
there was a break and they hung

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.873
up the phone Kay said and it
immediately rang and Kay picked it

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.653
up and it was the operator in
London who said you've been

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:14.750
on the phone now for 23 hours
we don't know what you're doing

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:15.950
but we need a credit
card [laughter].

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.616
And Kay said I told them, well,

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.676
you're not getting my
damn credit card but--

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:25.516
he said but let me tell
you what's happening here.

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.203
So he explained to the operator
among other things that their--

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:32.196
the reception on the
satellite was kind of weak

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:33.920
and the signal varied a lot and the
operator said well let me get back

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.620
to you, I'll call you back,

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:44.233
and about 30 minutes later the
phone rang and the operator came on

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:44.826
and he said now that we understand
what this is about we're going

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.340
to move the satellite for you.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.466
[Laughter] And they
could maintain that link

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:54.530
until the Iraqis finally gave up
and they were allowed to leave.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:58.510
[ Pause ]

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.240
&gt;&gt; The book also deals with the
crisis with North Korea in 1994.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.786
I think it's not generally
known how very close

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.896
to a second Korean War
we came at that time.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:25.086
You'll recall that the North
Koreans had built a reactor

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:28.876
at Yongbyon north of Seoul
and had been negotiating back

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:30.366
and forth again with Bob Gallucci.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.183
Bob Gallucci seems to have been
the indispensable man in the '90s.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.806
He's now the president of
the McArthur Foundation so,

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.680
in some ways he's still
indispensable

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:46.176
but some glitches had come up and
the Iraqis basically pulled out

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:47.826
and were talking about going
ahead and taking the plutonium

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.226
from their one reactor,
taking the uranium, the fuel,

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:54.440
and extracting the plutonium
and making their first bombs.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:00.966
This became very close
to a war scale crisis

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.040
within the Clinton administration
because we were threatening

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:09.280
to impose increasing sanctions on
the North Koreans as you may recall,

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:12.756
we were threatening to turn
Seoul into a sea of fire.

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:17.456
In fact, Gallucci told me that we
were within a day or two of war

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:24.343
and that we were just about to
evacuate the American Embassy

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.530
and all the other embassies in Seoul

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.596
which as he understood it would have
been a signal to the North Koreans

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:32.533
that war was about to come and
that they probably would have moved

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.726
preemptively to attack
Seoul had that happened.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.473
General Locke who was in
charge of our forces in Korea

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.026
around this time told President
Clinton that we could win the war

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.826
with North Korea but that the cost
would be a million and a trillion

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:50.240
and the president said
what does that mean?

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.713
And General Locke said a
million South Korean lives

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.786
and a trillion dollars extracted
from the South Korean economy

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.813
because of the destruction
of that war.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:05.716
So those were the stakes.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.650
And you'll recall that
Jimmy Carter much

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.320
to President Clinton's disgust
stepped forward and went

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.123
as a private citizen to North Korea

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:18.876
and settled things
down with Kim Il-sung.

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:21.720
Then Bob Gallucci went
back to his business

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:24.256
of negotiating with
the North Koreans.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.396
Kim Il-sung died almost immediately
and his son came to power.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:33.370
Negotiations went forward
very successfully

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.303
but didn't quite finish
the job by the end

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:38.710
of the Clinton administration.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.150
Madeleine Albright went to North
Korea, I believe, in December even

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:47.170
after the election and President
Clinton was prepared to go himself

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.706
but because that election

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:50.770
of the year 2000 was mooted
he didn't feel he should leave

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:54.110
the country.

00:15:55.110 --> 00:15:55.843
And then when the Bush
administration came

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:58.446
in they had a very different
attitude toward North Korea

00:15:59.440 --> 00:15:59.586
and things kind of
fell apart after that.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:06.560
But that million and a trillion just
reminds you, reminds me certainly

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:12.326
of how many times since the
beginning of the Cold War and even

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.976
since the end of the cold
war we have come very close

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.870
to at least a large
scale conventional war,

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:23.163
if not indeed some kind of
nuclear exchange in the world.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:24.890


00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:30.363
So I looked later in
the book at the question

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:35.050
of how can we resolve this
dilemma if we feel nuclear weapons

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:39.410
in some sense are important
to our security

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:41.456
but if we feel we'd be more
secure if there were none

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:45.870
in the world and indeed we would.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.043
In fact one of the problems with
getting rid of nuclear weapons is

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:49.760
that the United States would be
relatively speaking even more

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:57.313
powerful with conventional forces
only given our enormous capacity

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:02.466
compared to other countries than
it is now when even small states

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.733
such as North Korea can
effectively stand us off

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:11.463
with a small nuclear capability.

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:13.963
If there's any reason why Iran
might be moving toward a nuclear

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:20.563
capability that and Israel's
capability are certainly two

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:22.570
of the reasons.

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:25.970
There is a commission in 1996 called

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:29.160
by the Australian Prime Minister
called the Canberra Commission.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.253
Richard Butler the Ambassador
from Australia for Nuclear Issues

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.526
and Nuclear Disarmament told me

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:40.696
that the most important thing he
felt came out of that commission

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:45.930
of international leaders

00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:50.330
on this subject was what he
calls the axiom of proliferation.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.006
For him this is the bottom
line of the whole question

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.900
of who has nuclear weapons.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.173
Who should have them or how
we should get rid of them.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.026
And it goes like this.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.693
So long as any state has nuclear
weapons other states will seek

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:06.936
to acquire them.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.473
That means that ultimately
if you want a world safe

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.346
from nuclear weapons
everyone has to give them up.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:15.556
That's an immensely
complicated problem obviously,

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:23.123
sometimes I think saying we have to
all disarm our nuclear weapons is

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:23.453
like saying we have to settle
world peace then we won't need

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:28.380
them anymore.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.313
It's almost that complicated.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:31.570
But it is there as
a fundamental fact

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:37.790
which President Obama paraphrased
in his Prague speech by saying

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:43.203
which is really kind of the next
step in this series of axioms,

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:47.620
if we believe that the spread of
nuclear weapons is inevitable then

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:51.343
in some way we are admitting
to ourselves that the use

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.780
of nuclear weapons is inevitable.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.430
We've dodged that bullet
now since 1949,

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:04.140
since the Soviet Union
became the second state

00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.593
to acquire a nuclear arsenal.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:09.530
But how much longer
will we be so lucky?

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.326
How many times since those
first days have we been

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:18.643
within a hairs breadth
of a nuclear exchange?

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.120
I have cited in my works
the Cuban Missile Crisis

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.410
and the Able Archer
event in Europe in 1983

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:28.760
when the Soviets thought we
might be preparing to attack them

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.440
and seriously considered
striking us first.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.520
But I've talked to people who
should be in a position to know

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:38.630
in our government who have said
oh yeah those too, but you know,

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.823
there were a lot more that
haven't' come to light yet.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.203
So we really have been quite lucky.

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:52.973
Getting rid of nuclear weapons is
going to mean ultimately dealing

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.160
with conflicts situations
that are thorny indeed.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:04.596
&gt;&gt; Most of all Israel, North Korea,
Iran, and in my mind the country

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.683
that is going to be the hardest
nut to crack, the hardest

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:14.300
and most difficult place to convince
to give up it's nuclear arsenals,

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.566
our country, the United States.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:21.240
We started all these, we maintained
all these for whatever reasons,

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:25.710
good or bad or indifferent, a lot
of I think the Cold War had to do

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:33.250
with domestic politics not with
relations with the Soviet Union,

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:33.653
you can read about that
in this book as well.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.800
But the fact is we're the ones

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.660
who I think will have
the greatest difficulty.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:42.216
And one of the reasons is
a simple practical fact.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:45.210
We spend about 50 billion dollars a
year maintaining a nuclear arsenal

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.330
that is basically utterly
useless except

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.693
as a display of potential force.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:56.726
That's a lot of money, it supports
a lot of people and industries

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.086
and I think it's going

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.553
to be difficult indeed
to wind all that down.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Yes? Thank you.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.900
So let me just quickly end.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:11.883
There's much more in
the book including

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:14.396
and I won't give you the
details you'll have to read it,

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:20.970
including the real reason we went
to war with Iraq the second time.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:26.400
Which I will just say had to do with
anthrax not with nuclear weapons.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:27.660
At the end, I come back to the
question how do we do this?

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.090
And I look at a model that
I've written about before

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:34.563
that I'm sure you've read in my
books before but it seems to me

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:37.516
as a fundamental model for
how you live in a world

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:40.453
without nuclear weapons
and that is the model

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.766
of the public health system.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.900
We lived once with a
kind of universal scourge

00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.680
which was epidemic disease and the--

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.640
a few reformers and then
later medical doctors

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.340
and researchers found
fairly straightforward ways

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:04.140
to identify the source of a disease,
to isolate the carriers of a disease

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.696
and in a few cases in this--

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:11.363
in the 20th century even to begin
the process of eliminating disease,

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.706
small pox, most of all which most
of us don't even think anymore.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.473
Polio, the elimination
is almost complete today.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:23.090
There has been no polio in the
western hemisphere since 1991.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:28.383
And the states that still have polio
cases are not surprisingly the ones

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:29.323
that have the least infrastructure
and the least support.

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.383
So I discussed at some
length that analogy

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:36.746
and I think you might find it
interesting to look at and think

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.133
about because we have a success
story where millions upon millions

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:45.616
of lives were saved
and are still safe

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.270
because of some fairly straight
forward ways of thinking about--

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:52.556
of relating to the
natural world differently

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:54.816
from the way we related before.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.846
I think the same thing is
possible with manmade death

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:03.376
as with biologic death but manmade
debt is actually a harder problem

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.530
because people and their motives
and their needs, their expectation

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.510
and their fears are all involved.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:14.126
So let me stop there and take any
questions or comments you have.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:15.620
Thank you.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000


00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.120
[ Applause ]

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:23.990
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:26.816
&gt;&gt; At the dawn of the atomic age
some people thought the genie could

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:28.176
be stopped and others thought it was
inevitable, just a matter of time.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.283
Do you think it could
have been stopped

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:38.896
and what do you think people
will think another 100 years out?

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.620
How do you think this will
evolve that thinking over time?

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:44.716
&gt;&gt; Could they have kept the
genie pushed down in the bottle

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:50.476
or was the development of
nuclear weapons inevitable?

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:54.823
You know, I always quote something
Robert Oppenheimer once said

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:55.073
that I think speaks
exactly to this question.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.933
He said the deep things
in science are not found

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:02.670
because they are useful.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:07.006
They were found because it
was possible to find them.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:11.906
Nuclear fission was an
inevitable outcome of the studies

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:13.170
of the nucleus of the atom
of the atom that began

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.543
in the early years
of the 20th century.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:20.953
You reach a certain point and you
inevitably find nuclear fission.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:22.073
Once nuclear fission was found--

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.150
and I say inevitable because
scientists all over the world

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:26.953
when they got the word that
2 German radio chemists

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.106
that identified this amazing
new reaction scientists all

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.390
over the world kicked themselves.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.893
They understood that they've
been seeing it in their labs

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.293
but because they hadn't
thought through what was going

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.146
on they hadn't identified
what it was.

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:45.253
And I mean really, I've talked to
a number of them who were just sick

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:50.380
for a couple of days after
this huge discovery was made

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.636
that they missed just because
they didn't think it through.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:57.516
So, it inevitably came along and
the idea that this was some sort

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:58.653
of falsity and bargain on
the part of the scientist

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.936
that they all could have
gone off in a room somewhere

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:02.750
up in a mountain top and said, oh
let's not do this, is simply absurd.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:11.723
There it was and the reaction was so
fiercely exothermic, so much energy

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.056
out for so little energy in.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:15.366
And in the context of the discovery
having been made nine months before

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:18.680
the beginning of the
Second World War

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:20.983
in Europe inevitably people would
think of the possibility of a bomb.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:25.910
Now what followed from that

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:30.656
and the nuclear arms raise those
inevitably were political decisions

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:31.186
made for many different
kinds of reasons.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.906
I think fundamentally, at least
at the beginning, from deep fears

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.730
that the only defense
against these weapons

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:41.330
which the scientists
recognized as early

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:46.863
as 1939 would be similar arsenal
and the threat of retaliation.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.763
That kept it going for a long time.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.200
So I think that's a full
answer to that question.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.480
Yes?

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.170
&gt;&gt; Yes. A lot of people don't
know there was this genius--

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.856
genius, genius in Meredith Gardner

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:07.216
and he broke the indecipherable
ciphers that the Soviet's used

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:11.193
and this is called
the VENONA messages.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.793
&gt;&gt; Oh yes, right.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.993
&gt;&gt; Into 30s and to 40s and
he broke them in the 50s

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:22.486
and if you read the VENONA
messages I think you will find some

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:26.180
justification as to why we
have atomic bombs [laughter]

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:31.150
but the second thing is in the
VENONA messages I always knew,

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:33.136
every one that knew that
[inaudible], green glass,

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:37.830
definitely as the Rosenberg

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:42.096
and Julia state they didn't have
access to the atomic secrets.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:47.206
A man that did that was messaged--
a young American called Ted Hall,

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.160
Theodore Hall and yet he immigrated
to the United States-- England.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:54.583
&gt;&gt; In England, yeah.

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:56.650
&gt;&gt; He was a Cambridge
professor and he died old age.

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:57.716
He was never put to
death or anything.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.250
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.783
&gt;&gt; And he gave the Soviets
most of the usable secrets.

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:04.450
&gt;&gt; That's correct.

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:06.316
&gt;&gt; Can you comment on
both of those two things?

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think, you know,

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:11.783
it's always puzzled me why Ted Hall
was allowed to live out his life.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:12.220
I think that suggest that he had new
things or had documents or something

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:19.280
that our government security
people didn't want to see released,

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:22.196
that's usually why
people aren't touched.

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:26.540
But the larger question, I'll
just speak to it with an anecdote,

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:31.130
could the Soviets have build an
atomic bomb within the timeframe

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.960
that they did about the same time
it took us without the secrets

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.710
that were passed to
them by their spies?

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:43.403
And I corresponded with this Soviet
Robert Oppenheimer a man named

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:46.136
[inaudible] in the
last years of his life

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:50.536
by the new thing e-mail
back in the early '90s.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:55.206
And he pointed out that by 1947
they had worked out a bomb design

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:59.696
that would be half as heavy,
half as big and twice as powerful

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:02.563
as our first bomb as
our Nagasaki bomb.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.590
And I said why didn't you do--

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:06.066
build that one instead of
building a copy of ours?

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.980
And he said because Lavrentiy
Beria who was the monster

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:15.576
who ran the Gulag system
and was also in charge

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:19.956
of their bomb program had said
to them with great contempt,

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:23.786
I don't give a damn what you
think is a workable design.

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:27.030
Build me the American
bomb I know it works.

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:30.670
He said it was worth our lives

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:31.313
so we built the American bomb
that's what my government wanted.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.486
But then I noticed in
looking at the list

00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:41.483
of their tests their second
bomb test was of a bomb that was

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.900
about half the size and twice
the yield of our Nagasaki bomb.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.706
So they built theirs next

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.306
after they've fulfilled
the political requirements

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:51.126
that were there for
them to deal with.

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.420
Sir?

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:57.666
&gt;&gt; Do you believe that Iran has any
interest in a nuclear power program

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.906
or is it just solely a
nuclear weapons program?

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:01.756
&gt;&gt; You know I think
there's-- I think it's--

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:03.196
there's ample of reason to believe

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:05.273
that Iran is following basically
the path that Israel followed.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.640
The sort of bomb in the basement not
acknowledged that we are building

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.000
such a thing or have
built such a thing.

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:17.696
It was a very successful
path for Israel,

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.206
still is in many ways to this day.

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.096
It leaves an ambiguity there
about their relationship

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:25.676
to being a nuclear power,

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:27.340
even though everyone knows
they are a nuclear power.

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.546
So that seems to me
what Iran is doing

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.110
but it's been progressing
very slowly

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:34.006
which isn't just the
technological problems,

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:35.653
although there are plenty of those.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:41.640
Arguably what they are doing is
as North Korea has been doing

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:46.516
in a much more blatant way
trying to use their capabilities

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:49.873
as a negotiating tool
to find some settlement

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.740
with the United Stats in particular.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:53.966
North Korea, without question,
and you will read this

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:57.136
in the books several chapters
may surprise you amazingly

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:04.556
about North Korea's reasons
for developing nuclear weapons.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:09.996
&gt;&gt; Primarily it was because during
the Korean War we systematically,

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:14.626
strategically bombed North
Korea back to the Stone Age just

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.180
as Curtis LeMay had
threatened to do.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:22.126
We particularly destroyed all of
their hydroelectric dams as well

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:27.650
as a lot of dams that controlled the
flood control for their rice fields.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.633
I mean it's a horrible story.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:30.373
We killed several million
North Korean civilians

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:32.273
with strategic bombing
just as we had done

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:35.376
against Japan during
the Second World War

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.783
with perhaps more justification
in that case.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:43.503
Under those circumstances
the main goal of Kim Il-sung

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:45.366
for many years thereafter was to get
an alliance with the United States

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.486
that would allow North Korea

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:51.813
to rebuild an electrical capacity
probably based on nuclear power.

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:56.090
And it has been for that
purpose down through the years

00:30:59.030 --> 00:30:59.856
with other things thrown in
needless to say the presence

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:02.080
of American nuclear weapons in South
Korea, the long standing conflict

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:06.443
between North and South Korea
basically a long standing Civil War.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:10.883
All that's been there,
but underneath it all,

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:13.336
and you'll hear it
every time you hear

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:15.920
about what the North Koreans are
bringing to the negotiating table,

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:18.286
they want an electrical supply.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:20.363
I mean, that's kind
of where we still are.

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:23.516
When Bob Gallucci negotiated
the deal with them

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:28.303
for two nuclear power
reactors of western design

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:33.456
that the South Koreans would supply,
I said why did you give them that?

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:34.233
He said that's what they wanted.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:36.716
And of course, they would be
under international control

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:39.213
and all those things but-- so
it's not always what one reads

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:43.370
in the papers that these are
crazy people and so forth.

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:47.526
There really is a practical
reason why North Korea would

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:48.960
like get a head start
on becoming a country

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.200
like its cousins of the South.

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.996
They were actually economically
better off than South Korea

00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:58.970
until the late 1970's
and it was then

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:00.036
that they decided they needed a
program of nuclear development

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:03.890
which may or may not include a bomb.

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:07.690
Eventually it did include a bomb.

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:09.896
Do we have any time left?

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.830
&gt;&gt; Time, it's over time.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.660
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much.
