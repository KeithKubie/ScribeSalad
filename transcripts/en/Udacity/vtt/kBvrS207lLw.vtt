00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.370
To summarize, if host A and

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.390
host B want to securely communicate,
here is the typical IPSec workflow.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.750
Suppose this is the first
time that A sends data to B,

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.480
then according to policy
requires protection.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.840
The router or gateway of A's network and
the router of B's network

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.110
then use the IKE protocol to
first negotiate the IKE SA.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.980
And then use that IKE SA
to negotiate the IPSec SAs.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.350
Then an IPSec tunnel can be
created between the routers and

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.070
the traffic from A to B is
protected by the tunnel.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.340
For example,
the packet data can be encrypted and

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.570
optionally the head of information
including the source IP address

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.740
as well as the packet data
can be authenticated.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.690
When A terminates the connection to B,

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.050
the IPSec tunnel between the two
routers also terminates.
