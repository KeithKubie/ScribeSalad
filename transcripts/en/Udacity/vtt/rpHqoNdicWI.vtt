00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.342
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If we divide both sides by four, we end up with 3 is less than x. However, I

00:00:04.342 --> 00:00:08.675
had said that I wanted x on the left side of the inequality. So that means we

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:13.292
need to flip this whole thing around. The whole thing becomes a mirror image of

00:00:13.292 --> 00:00:15.730
itself. Then we have x is greater than 3.
