00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.810
&gt;&gt;Evetta: As teenagers are educated for careers
in the 21st century.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.590
And what are they educated in? They'll be
talking to you guys about that, but when I

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.960
was looking on their website I was pretty
shocked. They have classes like parallel computing

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.913
and artificial intelligence. Do you guys have
that in high school? [laughs] I didn't.

00:00:21.913 --> 00:00:26.400
This school also maintains, I believe, 12
or 13 of its own research labs just for students

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.460
and these include a prototyping and engineering
materials lab, a neuroscience lab, and an

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.460
automation and robotics lab.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.960
I wish I really had access to a school like
this growing up. So the kids in your county

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.620
are really very privileged.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.319
Evan and Shane, we're really thrilled to have
you here as speakers. We're really big fans

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:47.519
of the work you're doing to inspire the next
generation of technology leaders. And we can't

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.940
really wait, we can't wait to hear exactly
how you're doing it.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.249
So please come on up.

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:54.879
Thank you.

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:55.879
[applause]

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:03.889
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: Thanks Evetta. It's a pleasure
to be here today at Google; take the day away

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:10.560
from school and get a lunch that tastes a
little bit better than we have in our cafeteria.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.590
I wanna start us off --

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.150
by asking you a question.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:23.760
So that's a picture from a school from about
a hundred years ago, and yet many schools

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.820
still have that structure of a classroom today.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:38.770
But if you could recreate your high school
learning environment, what would it look like?

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.500
&gt;&gt;female in audience: More access to virtual
learning.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.500
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: More access to virtual learning.
What else?

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.840
&gt;&gt;female in audience: [inaudible] open spaces,
collaborative spaces.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.250
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: Collaborative spaces. Food.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.190
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Good food, seriously.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.159
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: What else?

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.909
&gt;&gt;male in audience: A more creative environment.

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:01.909
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: More creative environment.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:02.909
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [inaudible]

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.750
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: Emphasizing problem solving.
Good.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.221
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Lab space.

00:02:07.221 --> 00:02:08.280
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: Lab space.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.880
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Smaller class sizes.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.480
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: Yep. Smaller class sizes.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.230
&gt;&gt;male in audience: A computer on every desk.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.159
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: A computer on every desk.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.230
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [inaudible]

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.300
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: White boards.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.300
[laughter]

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.300
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [inaudible]

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.300
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: [laughs] Yeah.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.590
I have to say even in our school we still,
we have a blend of white and dark boards.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.090
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Do you have smart boards?

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.300
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: We do and smart boards.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.300
Um-hum.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.300
Good.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.300
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [inaudible]

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.180
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: Say that one more time.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.680
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [inaudible]

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.459
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: Yeah, less classroom and more
hands on experience, absolutely.

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.959
&gt;&gt;female in audience: I'd like to be outside.

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.340
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: Like to be outside.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.140
Good. Yeah, these are all great elements in
a school environment. Some of 'em which we

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.150
have and we'll share that with you today.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.049
But before I, before we talk about our school,
I wanna talk about the challenges actually

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.430
that we have in America associated with education
and the times that we're going through.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.260
It's not an easy road ahead for computer science.
We're gonna highlight our program and all

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.981
the things that we do, but across the U.S.
actually we need a lot of help. And I'll try

00:03:24.981 --> 00:03:28.049
and explain why.

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.069
So in schools today across our country, we're
really in an age of accountability. There's

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:39.969
such a strong focus on meeting standards through
No Child Left Behind and even through ESEA,

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:44.020
which is followed up with No Child Left Behind.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:50.909
The emphasis is-is not on creative and learning
environments or giving spaces for problem

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.799
solving. The emphasis is on closing achievement
gaps.

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:01.470
So if students don't perform at certain levels
on tests, then the focus is helping those

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.099
students get to that level. So what you test
is what you get.

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.620
It's created an emergence of collaborative
learning environments for-for teachers which

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.580
is actually terrific 'cause teachers are less
isolated than they used to be, but again the

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.040
focus is really on can they meet the base
standard.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.010
Now those people who poke at No Child Left
Behind -- actually the Chesapeake Bay Foundation

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.500
created No Child Left Inside, which is a way
of a grass roots movements of getting students

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.840
outdoors and-and connected to their environment.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.120
Here's a picture of our students in a project,
a research based project in a pond that looks

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.780
at the different characteristics that will
influence salamander migration.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:57.000
And you can look around the world in a documentary
"Two Million Minutes" produced a few years

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.380
ago, the amount of time that you're gonna
spend in high school, actually not in the

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.840
school, but over four years and the quality
of learning is drastically changing.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.669
You see in China and India, countries that
have populations four times that of ours,

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:23.810
four times, that they have arguably more honor
students than we have students all together.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:30.260
But as a country we are focusing on achievement
gaps.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.491
So if high school were like a cake, which
picture should it really resemble?

00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:41.861
And the way in which it resembles today actually
is the picture on the left where we're trying

00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:47.680
just to complete the cake. The creativity,
the added dimension, the unique [bad audio]

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:56.090
that we would like to see so that students
can do interesting things is missing.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:05.330
And part of that is in curricular areas. You
see in, you know you have your core curricular

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.760
areas and so when you want to think about
computer science, that's seen as the frosting

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.930
on the cake. It's only to those students who
are able to show that they can do really well

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.510
in other areas.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:25.690
That's the challenge that we have ahead of
us is that computer science in order, in order

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:31.461
to make computer science integral to every
curriculum, we have to find a way to actually

00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:35.500
make it part of the picture on the left. But
it's not seen that way; it's not seen that

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.020
way across our country.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:45.640
Newsweek published an article this summer,
"The Creativity Crisis". So around the world,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.610
when we look at east Asian cultures, they
tend to out-perform the United States in math

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:57.490
and science consistently, year after year
after year after year on international assessments.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:03.700
But the U.S. is focusing on closing the achievement
gap so we can improve on those assessments.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:11.710
Well somethin' has to give. Well what gives?
The time that we've devoted to that creativity.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.270
And so when my colleagues from overseas ask
me to come and give presentations they wanna

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:19.990
know about creativity.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.910
They wanna know about creativity.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.960
There are pockets of innovation.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.090
Schools like ours around the United States
are a part of a consortium called The National

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:38.850
Consortium of Specialized Secondary Schools
for Math, Science and Technology, N-C-S-S-S-M-S-T.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:44.770
And that is -- our sister schools in New York
City would be Bronx Science, Stuyvesant, Brooklyn

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:51.220
Tech. Those are all schools in which we share
our instructional practices so we can come

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.210
up with innovative ideas.

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:59.550
And in the State of Virginia, there are 18
regional Governor Schools and so we're located

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:06.750
in Northern Virginia. So students who come
to TJ, which it's commonly referred as, is

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.020
coming from only six different counties.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:15.380
But there are intentional public schools that
are created to-to provide a unique learning

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.430
environment in math, science, and technology
across this state and across the nation. They're

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.050
just few and far between.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.340
So why do you think Google's interested in
education?

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.401
Go for it.

00:08:30.401 --> 00:08:33.729
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [inaudible] Because Google's
going to be getting the students in four to

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:34.729
five years.

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:37.529
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: Yeah, Google, Google's gonna
get the students in four to five years; excellent.

00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:41.840
So we're trying to prepare students who could
be productive at Google.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.730
What else?

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.180
Um-hum.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:57.760
&gt;&gt;female in audience: We need scientists to
[inaudible]

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:04.650
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: Great. Yeah, we need innovative
people so regardless if they come and work

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:10.760
at Google, we need to create that environment
of creativity and competition so that students

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.241
can be doing really interesting things. And
that's what you want. You want people to be

00:09:14.241 --> 00:09:15.241
doing interesting things.

00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:17.050
[clears throat]

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:21.520
So as a quick overview of our talk, I'm gonna
talk about program design at our school as

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.520
the Principal.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:28.710
Shane here is the mastermind behind computer
science and will go into the details about

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.680
programming and-and the learning that occurs
in computer science within our curriculum.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:39.430
And then we'll finish off part, talking about
partnerships that we have with external corporations

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:43.120
that really enhance the robustness of our
school.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.850
So I'm gonna share a few pictures of our learning
environment ?

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.000
in biotechnology, in oceanography --

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.610
Actually if you notice that, that's a very
unique creature there.

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.290
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Lunch.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.220
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: Yeah, [laughs] that's right,
it's lunch.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:06.410
It's actually a septapus that was missing
one of its tentacles.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:11.730
Microelectronics.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:18.740
That's collaborative underwater, a collaborative
project between energy systems in oceanography

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.740
and underwater robot.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:27.840
Autonomous tourbot and a solar vehicle.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:38.570
A wheelchair operated by memory.

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:43.480
So these pictures are describing exactly what
you had mentioned; an open environment in

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.320
which students are doing interesting projects.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:50.690
Recycling zinc.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:55.020
And beyond our work in science and technology,
it's also our responsibility to work with

00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:01.910
younger students in inspiring their interests
in those fields.

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:06.770
And then also thinking about the environment.
Our students have a platform at our school

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:13.570
that if they want to do something socially
responsible, such as get solar panels for

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:18.970
our school, they have an avenue. We dedicate
one-eighth of our day to our students to pursue

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.621
a particular passion; its non-graded academic
period.

00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:29.520
So a group of students environmentally conscious
created a solar panel initiative and through

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:37.320
that initiative they decided to write grants.
They decided to contact local corporations

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:43.550
who could provide seed money or have a fund
raiser that ultimately enabled our, our school

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:47.870
to receive solar panels, a solar array on
our roof.

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:53.680
And we're a public school so we actually don't
have that much money. We have to rely on partnerships

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.580
with our community. We have to rely on partnerships
with our community to do really interesting

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:02.040
stuff.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:06.940
And so those solar panels are now part of
our energy systems research program.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:14.430
We create a one question which our students
generate that would connect what's going on

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:19.440
in the world to our mission of science and
technology.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.502
So these are examples of student questions
in which they had posed and then ultimately

00:12:23.502 --> 00:12:28.610
they vote on one that they would like to pursue
as a school.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:36.580
So all these pictures are to emphasize our
key values and schools, our key values and

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:42.029
skills at, in our curriculum. Critical inquiry
and research; all students are engaged in

00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:46.149
research. Problem solving; unique problems.

00:12:46.149 --> 00:12:53.540
Curriculum is not designed in a way in which
students need to learn new knowledge, understanding,

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:59.370
and skills that is explicitly defined. That
happens to a certain level; that's the cake

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:04.430
portion. But when we start talkin' about the
frosting, our students are contributors to

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:11.860
new knowledge, new understanding, and new
skills that we have not revealed previously.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:18.810
Intellectual curiosity; giving them the space
and time to pursue a particular passion and

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:22.279
showing that has a strong interest in humanity
through their social responsibility

00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:28.250
So here are the basic principles behind our
program design in-in our school; broad picture.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:34.260
We have to challenge students to make their
education choice more meaningful. And what

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:38.080
I mean by that is that some of our students
make a commitment to come to our school by

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:45.089
driving an hour and a half each way every
day, in traffic.

00:13:45.089 --> 00:13:47.899
And so in order to make that commitment, we
have to provide a learning environment that

00:13:47.899 --> 00:13:50.220
they couldn't get anywhere else.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.420
Focus on science, technology, engineering,
and math.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.420
Be true to our mission.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:58.810
CIRPSICSR which are those critical values
and skills I'd mentioned earlier.

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:04.220
The curricular freedom to teachers and students
so they can pursue a passion.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:12.330
We have dedicated time in an undefined curriculum.
That's the challenge in today's education

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.040
is that there's a defined curriculum and we
want students to pass the test.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:20.860
But if you actually make a part of your curriculum
undefined so that students are, students are

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:26.880
generating those new ideas, it becomes very
robust and creative; probably very similar

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.610
to what you're, what you experience at Google.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.390
&gt;&gt;female in audience: [inaudible]

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:35.010
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: That's right in your 20 percent
time.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:41.620
So you have the opportunity to be generative
and we-we share that value with our students

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:44.750
and with our teachers as well.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:49.560
So if you have, let's say you're talking about
11th grade English. Eleventh grade English

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:53.270
regardless of the teacher, you would expect
about 85 percent of the curriculum to be the

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:58.460
same; that extra 15 percent is geared towards
unique partnerships, projects, activities

00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.460
 --

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:05.290
based on their experience and who they get
to know.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:07.510
So they have the opportunity to continually
innovate.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:17.520
Okay, just a quick overview of our courses
just so you have an idea of what's different.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.260
A lot of times people ask, "So what are students
taking?"

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:24.261
It's not all math and science. They have to
go through an Advanced Studies Diploma; four

00:15:24.261 --> 00:15:29.029
years of math; all students take calculus;
three-quarters go beyond.

00:15:29.029 --> 00:15:32.800
Computer science which Shane will talk a little
bit later, all students take a year in Java

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.220
and then many go beyond.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.959
Four years of English, Social Studies, three
years of language; seven different languages;

00:15:39.959 --> 00:15:42.350
two years of P.E.; a year of Fine Arts.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:51.060
And then Science; seven science and technology
credits; four lab sciences on the left. Geosystems

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:56.060
is a capstone course for 12th graders preceded
by Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:59.279
And then we start off with Design &amp; Tech in
9th grade.

00:15:59.279 --> 00:16:02.850
A series of electives just to give you an
idea.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.430
So this, these are the types of courses where
we can create 'cause we can develop a critical

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:13.120
mass. So Organic Chemistry or Nanotechnology;
Quantum Physics; Computational Physics; Alternative

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:18.769
Energy Systems; DNA Science; those are all
types of courses in which we can create because

00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:22.720
we have the number of students interested
in those areas.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:30.350
And then a culminating senior year research
project in one of our 13 labs where one of

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.000
'em is Computer Systems.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:40.100
So I'm gonna pass over to Shane to talk a
little bit about our Computer Science program.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.930
&gt;&gt;Shane Torbert: Thank you.

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:49.279
I'm just gonna take a few moments to give
you some idea of our sort of backgrounds,

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:53.149
philosophy as we approach the curriculum so
that when I talk about the actual specific

00:16:53.149 --> 00:16:55.930
courses you'll have some idea of where we're,
where we're coming from.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:17:01.670
This is my current favorite statement of what
it is we're tryin' to do. This is from Garry

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:06.130
Kasparov who was actually on C-Span a little
over three years ago. Somebody asked him,

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:11.600
"Why are there so many great chess grand masters
that came out of the Soviet Union?" and-and

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.600
this was part of his answer.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:18.010
And so what we're tryin' to do at-at TJ and
specifically in-in computer science and-and

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:24.290
specifically within that in the computer systems
lab, is we're tryin' to identify a particular

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:30.500
talent for-for computing in the students.
They often don't know that-that-that they're

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:36.650
good at this. So how do we, how do we figure
out who-who's-who's really got a knack for-for-for

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:37.950
CS?

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:42.121
And once we've, once we've done that, once
we've identified that group of-of-of students,

00:17:42.121 --> 00:17:49.410
what do we then do while they're still in-in-in
high school to-to prepare them?

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:55.790
So everybody has bias, the-the-the-the bias
of mine is probably most relevant when I'm

00:17:55.790 --> 00:18:00.230
talking about the courses, and this is probably
preaching to the choir here at-at-at Google,

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:05.410
is that I-I feel very strongly the students,
particularly in-in high school when they're,

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:09.230
when they're starting out, should-should be
writing their own code.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:14.240
This-this used to be sort of an obvious statement
in high school CS education; it's murky to

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:21.350
me now as to if you talk to a hundred people
involved in CS education in high school, how

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:23.179
many would say that it's a really important
thing?

00:18:23.179 --> 00:18:28.090
But to me this is sort of what really grabs,
when you're 15 or 16, what really grabs you

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:32.260
and-and-and pulls into-into the field is the
fact that you're, I mean this is how you get

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:36.770
your hands dirty in-in-in computing is you're
actually writing code yourself.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:42.840
And so we have emphasized that at-at in all
the courses I'm-I'm gonna describe; it's not

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:49.200
the case where a student is-is simply learning
about a particular area of-of-of-of CS or

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.799
using some other pre-built system or something
like that. It-it -- whereever we can we want

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:56.890
students to be able to write things from-from
scratch.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:02.860
And so personally this is the-the-the big
influences is on-on me are the-the systems

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:08.510
lab itself. I mean it was there for 15 years
before I ever walked into it and so it's-it's

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:10.970
clearly when you, when you walk into the room,
it's one of these places where you can tell,

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:14.860
"Wow, these, there's a lot of really smart,
intense, energized people that are interested

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:15.900
in this."

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:21.220
And so what I did just as a teacher was to
listen to them. Right? I mean if have really

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:25.360
good students the fact that they're 16, 17
years old, they've got great ideas. Try to

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:29.670
figure who-who really knows what's going on
and-and-and-and-and pay attention.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:35.760
And also I'm actually not at TJ this year
I'm on a sabbatical at George Mason's Computational

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.920
Fluid Dynamics Center doing explosions and
stuff.

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:45.520
But they have the same mindset there. It's-it's
a similar type place where-where possibly

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.360
you wouldn't be able to things yourself since
you actually really know what's-what's going

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.360
on.

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.790
And for me the-the-the-the two bullets at
the top here in terms of active learning and-and

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.840
the sort of creativity you can get out of
something when you're really engaged in it,

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:02.340
to me that's what, that's what produces at
the, at the end of the day really powerful

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:07.860
students. I mean leaving high school really
powerful students to-to go off to an undergraduate

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:08.860
program.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.640
And then I-I thought I should say something
just about why-why would you even have courses

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:18.380
at-at all. I mean you have, you have a school
so even if the school looked, looked like

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:22.640
this school it was only the facade and there
was nothing behind it, you had no classrooms

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:28.160
at all, you could still have speakers and
internships and students could still read

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.251
things and all this other stuff.

00:20:29.251 --> 00:20:33.750
So why-why do you even want courses at all?
What is it we're trying to do when we design

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:35.350
a curriculum?

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:43.610
And for-for-for me and I mean this in a really
positive way, courses are artificial. I mean

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:50.780
I-I-I try really hard to make up a sequence
of problems that I think for a diverse group

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:56.250
of students, diver, in terms of, in terms
of ability -- will be able to-to-to hit them

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.740
all in a way where everybody pro-progresses.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:05.670
This is not, it's not, it's not simple, but-but
I found that if you, if you do it well you

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:11.919
can, you can tell that you, that-that you
did it well and-and what the students can

00:21:11.919 --> 00:21:14.809
do then is-is-is-is enhanced.

00:21:14.809 --> 00:21:18.160
So these are the, these are the courses sort
of broad view.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:22.830
We mentioned that all the students take at
least one course. That's this introductory

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:27.220
course. I'm giving rough enrollment numbers
here so you have a sense each year how many

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.400
students we have passing through these courses.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:36.250
In, for the introductory course we offer a
self-selected option of an accelerated version.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.190
This is for the people who-who when they came
in even if they didn't have to take the course,

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:41.890
they knew they were gonna be into this.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:47.030
So we get a lot of people even when they're
13 obviously who-who-who know they're interested

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.660
in-in computer science already. So we have
an accelerated version.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:55.100
We also have a very large number of students
who come in during the summer and take the

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.100
introductory course.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:03.710
The-the AP Computer Science course which for
us is mostly 10th graders, that's undergone

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:08.740
tremendous change in the last 15 years and
in particular the last two or three years.

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:15.260
For us the change has been not as-as large
because we have a big program.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:19.950
And then after the AP course the AI course,
the-the parallel course and the Senior Research,

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:26.280
all of those courses are offered in the computer
systems lab.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:34.059
So the-the first course is taught in Java,
mostly Windows labs. This is, it's done in

00:22:34.059 --> 00:22:37.740
Java basically because the AP exam is-is administered
in Java.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:43.980
We do an objects first approach. We start
with Karel robots which came out of Carnegie

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:49.570
Mellon and the recent version came out of
Pace University here in, here in Manhattan.

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:53.740
We actually have now a homegrown version that
some students wrote a few years ago in the

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:54.740
summer.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:59.960
But our goal is to get, starting with students
who we assume, we assume they don't know anything

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.420
and our goal is as quickly as possible to
get some-some-some tools and some skills in-in-in

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:10.390
their hands where they can, where they can
start to be creative. And by the end of the

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:13.530
course there's an expectation that everyone
will-will be able to produce some sort of

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:19.490
final project which is often a game or-or-or
something amusing. So I mean they're 14.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:26.630
And so this is, this is to-to a large extent
a typical introductory course. Everybody's

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:29.000
learned what an "if" statement is or for loop.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.799
These are just some sample programs, the guess
the numbers through the binary search game

00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:38.630
where you're told every time you make a guess
if your guess was wrong, was it too high or

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:43.490
too low. And so people who've never-never
learned anything about algorithms can figure

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:47.110
out what a binary search is pretty quick 'cause
they wanna win.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:55.650
And the, this tree turtle, this is sort of
a-a- an homage to log-the old logo system

00:23:55.650 --> 00:24:01.010
a little turtle drawing-drawing the tree there.
This is one of our first sort of serious a-attempts

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.471
to-to teach the students recursion.

00:24:02.471 --> 00:24:08.480
In my experience it takes about three years
of-of-of periodically coming back to try to

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:13.750
teach recursion before most students are pretty
good at it. It's not something that's-that's

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:17.900
simple just from an instructional perspective.
Some students get it instantly, but if you're

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:22.660
tryin' to get -- there are all these issues
with scale. If you wanna have five students

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:27.059
come out of the school that are really good,
then you do one thing. If you wanna have a

00:24:27.059 --> 00:24:30.630
hundred come out that are really good, then
you have to do some other things.

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:35.919
And so for-for-for-for recursion it takes,
it takes three years.

00:24:35.919 --> 00:24:40.510
And then there's a, we do some-some animation
basically in the first semester the-the animations

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:46.330
there are set up for like a simple pong game
or a breakout, one of those types-types of

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:52.020
games which if you, if you, if you go on somebody
else's website and play these and you're a

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:56.320
teenager it's not that interesting. If you
can actually write it yourself or your friend

00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:00.480
writes it and you're trying to write one that's
better, all of a sudden it's-it's-it's the

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:05.390
coolest thing in the world 'cause you can
actually do it.

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:11.530
The AP course, this is also obviously taught
in Java. We have a Solaris lab that's like

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:17.490
a sun ray thin client lab that we've used
for a number of years now. And was a couple

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:21.220
of years ago was-was, we got a big upgrade
from a grant from Sun.

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:28.280
But this is sort of a typical algorithm analysis
data structures course. These are a lot of

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:32.240
the topics that were dropped by the college
board a couple years ago. We just ignored

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:36.320
that and just kept teaching the-the-the same
topics.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:41.429
And so this is on the, on the screen there,
it's another recursion it's a flood filled

00:25:41.429 --> 00:25:48.170
recursion problem, learning about binary trees
and heaps. I mean these things it's probably

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:54.260
similar, very similar to-to-to-to some of
the problems you first learned it your-yourselves.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:26:02.140
And it's having started very early on with
objects the college board has this case study

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:06.760
that is almost like an agent environment.
It's not, it's not really like agent environment.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.790
It's sort in that, in that direction.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:14.330
So for students who are really interested
we then have this-this is the more popular

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:20.039
elective course; this would be mostly juniors;
we usually have like four sections of this.

00:26:20.039 --> 00:26:25.040
It's taught in Python for the last six years,
although one year we taught it in Ruby, before

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:31.240
that it was taught in Lisp for a long time.
This is in the computer systems labs which

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:38.440
is Linux. So we do a lot with graphs, unstructured
graphs, road networks, things of that sort.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.150
We use Russell Norvig as a, as sort of a-a
source, but we don't, we don't issue it to

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:46.760
all the students. We go through it step by
step.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:53.120
But in terms of on the, on the slide here,
I don't know how well you can see there's

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.789
a little green outline of the circle. We do
a little image processing problem where you're

00:26:57.789 --> 00:27:03.550
trying to detect the circle. And so we do
like Sobel, Canny edge detection and then

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:08.070
the Hough transforms through voting method
to-to try to figure out where the center of

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:09.070
the circle is.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:14.900
This is, this is a good example of a topic
that, on the whole, is way too much for most

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:23.820
high school students. If, however, you're
very careful and you choose very-very-very,

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:28.270
if you're very judicious about what-what you
try to do with students, you can get 75 students

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:34.470
to do that, in, after-after a couple of years
of-of-of taking CS.

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:39.169
Behind that is a picture from Sugarscape.
So that-that really is trying to do Asian

00:27:39.169 --> 00:27:45.419
environment and show emergence of patterns.
If you have winter all of a sudden there's

00:27:45.419 --> 00:27:46.500
a migration to-to the other hill, that kind
of thing.

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:52.030
We do this with an Othello problem which is
just your standard mini Mac's alpha beta pruning

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:56.470
at the end of the first semester and then
the other one is a sliding tile which of course

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:57.610
is a graph search.

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:01.831
We still haven't totally figured out how to
get teenagers to do neural networks on a,

00:28:01.831 --> 00:28:05.500
on a large scale, but, I mean one of the things
about this is you have to be willing to just

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:06.500
sort of fail.

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:10.220
So the first year we tried it, it was a total
wreck. The second year it wasn't a wreck at

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:14.190
all. It just wasn't great. The third year
it was actually pretty good.

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:18.730
So then the next time through it's -- you
know what you're doing and you can actually

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:24.370
get people to at least understand sort of
what the, what the basic pieces are.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:29.730
We've had a parallel computing course for
I guess 20 years. We-we won a super computer

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:35.559
in the early 90s. For a long time it was taught
in C++ or Fortran. It used PVM at-at various

00:28:35.559 --> 00:28:36.720
times.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:40.799
The big thing we use now is-is MPI at least
in the, in the first semester. We do a lot

00:28:40.799 --> 00:28:47.570
of graphics wherever we can so if you zoom
in on the Mandelbrot set, students like-like

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:52.690
doing ray tracing and-and things of this sort.

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:57.549
The-the-the biggest thing again, we're trying
to be careful here. Almost always in the problems

00:28:57.549 --> 00:29:01.440
that we're picking we're choosing things where
they're embarrassingly parallel and you can

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.809
get, you can [bad audio] operations and the
student don't have to deal too much cross

00:29:04.809 --> 00:29:09.500
communication between-between the various
nodes.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:14.900
Now in the, in the nearest neighbor and body
type of problems, that doesn't happen and

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:20.780
it gets harder, but you have to be really
careful. I mean you're also dealing with people

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:25.870
who are, the students who are just taking
physics. And maybe you'll have a couple of

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:29.809
students that know differential equations,
sort of a lot of the classical problems that

00:29:29.809 --> 00:29:34.400
are done with, they're done in parallel aren't
accessible. But there are lots of problems

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.091
that are. So that's what we try, that's what
we try to do.

00:29:37.091 --> 00:29:43.951
And we have 50 work stations that are clustered
together. We recently got a big donation of

00:29:43.951 --> 00:29:49.840
good old InfiniBand system. So we're sort
of always hacking together whatever we can.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:53.610
And I'll say something about CUDA at the,
at the end.

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:59.059
And so all of this for about 50 students a
year all of this leads to independent senior-senior

00:29:59.059 --> 00:30:06.480
project. One of the big issues here is sort
of project management, writing a paper. You've

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:11.370
gone through potentially four courses that
were structured to sort of help you succeed.

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:16.140
Now you feel like you're kind of on your own.
This can be kind of a shock to someone who's

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:19.860
17. But it's good experience because they
have it in-in a safe environment.

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:27.990
For the most part in-in-in CS these tend to
be simulations. Either there's a the-the image

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:32.980
in black is a simulation of students going
through the school and so then you pull the

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:36.270
fire alarm and the students all have to evacuate
or some-something of that sort. That's a popular

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:38.179
one. But often it's something with agents.

00:30:38.179 --> 00:30:47.070
You get a little bit of-of physics simulation
type of problem. This is a fluids-fluid simulation

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:52.150
that a student did last year. I wanna qualify
that one though; that's not a, that-that-that's

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:55.550
not typical. That was one of the better projects
that we've ever had.

00:30:55.550 --> 00:31:00.400
And then the one in the background with a
little GUI is a music project [bad audio].

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:06.410
basically it could be whatever-whatever they
want. I mean whatever they're interested in

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:09.820
and whatever we think that we, that we can
support.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:16.471
I'll mention a couple of other sort of non-curricular
opportunities.

00:31:16.471 --> 00:31:23.080
We have a very successful computer team that
meets during an activity period. The primary

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:32.590
focus is USACO competitions. Knowing what
the computer team does when I try to decide

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:37.212
on problems that we're gonna, that we're gonna
do in courses, I try not to have too much

00:31:37.212 --> 00:31:41.130
overlap. I try to have just a little bit of
overlap, but if I know that students can go

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:45.029
to the computer team and learn about network
flow, then I don't need to do network flow

00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:50.179
in-in class. I can tell them to go to the
computer team. Somebody'll teach you about

00:31:50.179 --> 00:31:51.179
it.

00:31:51.179 --> 00:31:55.260
And then the other, and then the other big
avenue outside of class is the-the Student

00:31:55.260 --> 00:32:00.720
Sysadmins. This has, this has been around
forever. Sort of this started the lab was

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:04.560
a group of students that had sort of been
passed on from-from year to year.

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:12.460
And sort of the killer app is the, is the
Intranet which we use for to run the school

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:16.580
basically. I mean it does a lot of scheduling
and-and-and-and voting and communication and

00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:26.100
things of that sort. And it's entirely conceived,
developed, maintained by students. There was

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.651
a big upgrade to it in 2007 so.

00:32:28.651 --> 00:32:37.580
In terms of the, in terms of the future, and
so this is somewhat speculative, the big issue

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:43.610
broadly in CS education is always what language
do you use to write in. So when I took Computer

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:48.179
Science in high school in the, in the mid-90s
it was in Pascal; it had been in Pascal for

00:32:48.179 --> 00:32:55.820
a long time. It was very briefly in C++ which
was a huge disaster just in terms of participation.

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:59.760
I mean if you're looking just at raw participation
sort of how many programs are there, how many

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:04.080
students are there, how many teachers are
there? It was a big disaster. I mean not-not-not

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:09.081
to beat on C++, but just the way it all, the
way it all played out.

00:33:09.081 --> 00:33:16.490
And they-they changed languages very quickly.
It was in C++ very-very briefly. And so it's

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:19.140
been in Java now for-for quite a while.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:26.380
The-the things aren't going well. There's
a recent report, the URL is there, this runningonemptyreport

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:34.060
in terms of the national high school outlook.
It's I mean it's bad; it's pretty bad; it's

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:38.330
running on empty not running on full, whatever.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:44.220
So if I had to speculate next language I'd
say it's probably gonna be Java because they're

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:49.620
a little gun shy about switching languages.
Python; we've had a lot of success with Python.

00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:58.710
There's a lot of introductory courses in universities
that are trying Python. Or-or nothing. I mean

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:06.330
you get, there's definitely a-a-a feeling
about, "Do we really need to write code?"

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:11.690
And so I argue heavily that the answer is,
"yes," and if it's not going well you should

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:15.139
figure out how to make it better, but I think
it's a definite possibility that CS in-in

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:22.169
high school could-could stop involving writing
code on a large scale. Not Jefferson.

00:34:22.169 --> 00:34:27.359
But in-in terms of, in terms of big things
to figure out how to deal with, we've been

00:34:27.359 --> 00:34:31.520
doing a lot with parallel programming; two
different levels where we're trying to deal

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:39.149
with this. One is, one is the big distributed
system, the Cloud, where we've worked some

00:34:39.149 --> 00:34:41.950
with Google, Reston on this.

00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:48.310
The other is sort of the fine grain OpenMP
NVIDIA CUDA type approach. And at that point

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:52.740
we also use, there's a system at the University
of Maryland called XMT that tries to get at

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:57.440
sort of algorithms. What does the algorithm
look like at a, at very fine level? Not what's

00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:58.940
this big problem and I'll just break it up
into pieces and send it out on-on the Cloud

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:06.240
or I wanna run ten thousand different-different
designs to figure out what's-what's the best

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:13.480
and I send each one out on a Cloud. Not that.
But just to get one of these simulations or

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:16.440
whatever to run, how do I get this loop to
go faster?

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.470
And so those are very different problems.

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:25.359
And then the in-in-in terms of data, the people,
not the people I'm working with directly,

00:35:25.359 --> 00:35:30.540
but some of people at George Mason are involved
in this LSST project that's it-it's gonna

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:38.231
create a huge amount of data. I-I don't know
how much in high school that will, that will

00:35:38.231 --> 00:35:40.300
show up.

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:44.720
In the elective courses in the lab we try
to get problems to be of a sufficient size

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:48.951
that if your algorithms aren't good you can
actually tell, but I don't know it could,

00:35:48.951 --> 00:35:50.400
it could just be too big.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:36:00.431
Let me give two possibilities for-for, as
far as where else, where-where does computing

00:36:00.431 --> 00:36:05.940
go in high school if CS is doing poorly itself?
I'll give you two examples at-at TJ. We have

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:10.900
a math class Numerical Analysis for the past
five years. It's actually run I don't know

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:15.760
maybe four times. It doesn't-doesn't always
run every year. But it uses MATLAB and depending

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:19.960
on the instructor that it's either like MATLAB
where you write a lot of code or MATLAB where

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:23.410
you don't write as much code. You kinda go
either way.

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:28.140
And we've had a computational Physics course
for-for many years which is taught by a physics

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:33.710
teacher who-who writes code. And that most
recently is-is-is been in Mathematica. Where

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:40.430
again, depending on, it sort of depends on
the instructor these are systems where maybe

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:44.900
you really write a lot of code and maybe not,
depending on how it's done.

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:49.290
Another possibility, and again these are all
enrollment numbers, rough enrollment numbers.

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:54.380
So this is not a lot of students in-in-in
terms of what's happening now.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:37:00.310
In terms of-of potential, we have lots of
students taking math and science courses and

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:04.359
there are places where obviously you can imagine
in math and science in high school with good-good

00:37:04.359 --> 00:37:10.500
students, where you can imagine doing-doing
something that-that-that's in the direction

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.730
of computing.

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:17.670
This is way easier said than done because
you have huge sort of teacher recruitment

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:25.881
training issues. I mean it's hard enough to
keep teachers teaching CS to then say to teachers

00:37:25.881 --> 00:37:31.180
teaching chemistry that you've gotta have
now your all-all-all your students in your

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:32.180
class write code.

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:36.730
I'll-I'll believe it when I see it, but it's
one-one possibility.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:42.090
But what that doesn't answer, these are a
few things we've been working on. We're always,

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:46.830
computer systems are always trying to push
the envelope constantly. We try not to get

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:47.930
too comfortable ever.

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:53.970
So a couple of things we've working on the
last-last couple of years: biology sort of

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:59.900
gene sequence type matching programs where
you actually take from public databases and

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:02.210
then you build these little tree of life drawings.

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:11.390
We've been doing things with CUDA now for-for
two or three years as we're programming on

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:13.850
the, on the, on the, directly on the NVIDIA
graphics card.

00:38:13.850 --> 00:38:15.510
You know we get better at it.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:20.830
The picture of Darwin and the Mona Lisa -- that's
approximating an image with transparent polygons,

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:25.820
so it's like a genetic algorithm type problem.
I mean this is the kind of thing that when

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:28.500
you're 16, you can actually write code and
do this and it's like, "WOW! This is really

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.360
cool!"

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.859
So that gets a lot, a lot of, a lot of buy
in.

00:38:33.859 --> 00:38:38.460
The water wheel is supposed to be like a design
problem. We've-we've never really known exactly

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:48.089
how to tie into engineering courses. We've,
it's a lot easier to tie into physics or statistics.

00:38:48.089 --> 00:38:54.640
But I think there might be something here
because there's obviously a lot of renewed

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.410
interest in-in energy and-and in efficiency.

00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:03.849
And my personal favorite is this asteroids
program 'cause beginning students particularly

00:39:03.849 --> 00:39:07.930
in the summer, you get students who are like
way ahead of the-the regular pace and they

00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:12.230
wanna know what to do. My-my stock answer
is to have 'em try to do asteroids because

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:16.720
with one, I feel like I can teach almost half
a semester just off of this one little, this

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:23.390
one little game in terms of control and the,
and it's sort of right at the right point

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:28.251
of-of-of-of-of trig and-and what they know
about velocity and acceleration and-and how

00:39:28.251 --> 00:39:34.099
they manage lists. And we try to get the asteroid
to break apart. How they manage objects.

00:39:34.099 --> 00:39:40.230
I don't know who would do that if not a computer
science course. That's not, I still think

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:48.849
any-anything in that arena would happen. So.

00:39:48.849 --> 00:39:53.350
And I've tried to do a little bit of a fly
by here so if there's, af-afterwards when

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:58.250
we do the questions, [ ] questions, I could
talk for a week on these courses.

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:03.510
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: And I'm gonna actually just
wrap up in one minute so we can start questions.

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:10.530
I did have a portion associated with partnering
with schools. I just wanted to make a quick

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:13.440
statement about it.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:18.690
All schools need help and they need help in
different ways. And what we've learned through

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:24.020
a lot of our partnerships is-is not just to
go out and ask people for money. It's really

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:30.930
involving people to give challenges to this
school; to extend our curriculum in ways that

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:34.050
we haven't thought about it before.

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:40.430
And so our plea, as you think about how you
partner with schools, is ultimately: In what

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:50.150
ways can you engage students in-in some authentic
activity that would create meaning for Google?

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:53.880
And-and you do some of that already.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:58.369
And then the other thing that we would love
is as Shane had mentioned, across the country

00:40:58.369 --> 00:41:02.000
we're running short on people who can teach
computer science.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:10.000
It would be great if people took a sabbatical
from time to time, go to your local school,

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.550
get people really excited about computer science.
Just through your enthusiasm about what you

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:19.940
do gets other students really psyched up.

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:25.640
So ultimately we have to build a future generation
of computer scientists. Not just to-to be

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:32.970
at Google. I mean even if you wanna go into
biomedicine, you need to have a background

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:38.089
in computer science. And we recognize there's
a, there's a clear problem going on.

00:41:38.089 --> 00:41:42.380
And Shane had mentioned -- there could be
a lot of integration into the whole curriculum

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:46.650
which is what happens at some schools. Rather
than have a separate computer science strand.

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:53.690
But ultimately we have to find ways of gettin'
students really excited, really excited about

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:57.810
the possibilities of computer science. And
you experience it on the other end. See you

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:00.869
experience it here.

00:42:00.869 --> 00:42:08.800
So my big request is: find a way to get into
schools and share challenges of what you face

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:13.171
and give students learning opportunities kinda
of what we've shared with you.

00:42:13.171 --> 00:42:19.930
And spend as much time as you can because
you, you're the ones who will ultimately be

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:24.290
the ones who in-inspire students to go into
computer science.

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:31.380
So I really appreciate what you do and the
potential that you can serve as a role model.

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.970
At this time we'll go ahead and take some
questions.

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:34.960
Um-hum.

00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:51.270
&gt;&gt;male in audience: I'm kind of curious; all
this stuff you talk about in terms of courses

00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:53.070
it sounds like it's very high level in terms,
it's sort of like I guess [unintelligible]

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.070
 ?

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:55.070
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: It's actually just a ?

00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:56.070
Go ahead.

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:57.070
&gt;&gt;Shane Torbert: Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

00:42:57.070 --> 00:43:00.130
So the-the-the question and tell me if this
is a fair, the question is we-we're sort of

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:05.710
approaching CS from the standpoint of you're
writing code, you're at the software level

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:12.060
and not at the machine level in terms of how
the-the-the computer is actually working.

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:16.079
And I-I think the answer to your question
is what happens at our school is, and this

00:43:16.079 --> 00:43:21.440
is one of these economies of scale issues
because we have a big program and lots of

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.099
students, they take lots of courses.

00:43:23.099 --> 00:43:29.940
What we've found is that we do, we do a little
bit of it, but we have a whole electronics

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:36.370
lab. We have a whole freshman program that
all of the students go through where they

00:43:36.370 --> 00:43:40.400
see a lot of the sort of under the hood how
does a machine work at all.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:45.000
So for many years we had a computer architecture
course and we eventually just sort of melded

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.320
it into the-the parallel course because what
we found was it was rather than for us to

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:53.750
fake it, it was better to tell the student,
"Just go take the microprocessor course across

00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:58.680
the hall." And-and so we get a lot of cross
over with-with students taking those kinds

00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.770
of courses also.

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:08.040
There are certain places where it comes up
obviously in the parallel course with-with-with

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:13.140
pointers and then also just what's like thirty
cache line issues and-and-and-and sort of

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.369
the net-networking type issues there.

00:44:15.369 --> 00:44:21.849
But we-we always approach it from the perspective
of, "I'm trying to write this code," and in

00:44:21.849 --> 00:44:25.869
the back of our minds we know there's somebody
somewhere else in the building who's approaching

00:44:25.869 --> 00:44:29.420
it from, "I'm trying to build this thing from-from
circuits."

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:33.840
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [unintelligible]

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.160
&gt;&gt;Shane Torbett: Right.

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:39.210
Typically the point where they would, oh yeah,
sorry.

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:47.670
So the-the we're-we're dealing with teenagers
so if they, if they start off sort of interested

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:52.600
in computer science or they start a down a
path where they're taking these courses, how

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:57.910
much do they sort of stay on that, on that
path or-or-or diverge?

00:44:57.910 --> 00:45:06.109
And so we lose two-thirds after the mandatory
course. So two-thirds say, "Okay, I'll take-take

00:45:06.109 --> 00:45:09.859
the mandatory course. Thank you very much.
I'm not gonna take any more courses."

00:45:09.859 --> 00:45:16.160
And then of the, of the 150 or so who take
the-the course in 10th grade, roughly half,

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:21.250
it's maybe a little bit more in terms of sort
of total presence in-in the lab, keep taking

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:23.710
courses after that. And the other ones go
in-in-in other directions.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:31.079
And again sort of the-the other, the thing
that's not, that's sort of un-unsaid is these

00:45:31.079 --> 00:45:34.480
aren't their only courses they're taking.
So it's not as if they're, and they might

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:38.579
feel a little bit like they're majoring in
computer science, I mean some-some of them

00:45:38.579 --> 00:45:43.079
do major in computer science in-in-in a sense
within the school. All their electives are

00:45:43.079 --> 00:45:44.079
CS electives.

00:45:44.079 --> 00:45:49.079
But that's-that's, us-usually the students
are also taking AP Physics, or AP Chemistry

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:52.890
or things that are gonna prepare them in other
directions also. And I-I think it's one of

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:56.640
the great things about the lab is that there
are more people who use the lab than take

00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.640
the courses.

00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:04.880
So you get lots the-the actual pool of sort
of used of the community is-is much larger.

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.420
&gt;&gt;[bad audio]: [unintelligible]

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:16.859
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: And-and I wanna add one element
to that which is actually a challenge on our

00:46:16.859 --> 00:46:22.310
level. We-we identify students who could be
really talented in computer science. And we,

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:28.070
so there's this internal comp-competition
of what areas of science and technology do

00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:29.630
they pursue.

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:35.960
And there are unfortunately, unfortunately
there are very so-social pressures internally

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:42.160
among the students; gravitate in certain areas
and pre-conceived notions. It's very unfortunate

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.730
that the proportion of females is-is very
low. And, I'm sorry.

00:46:44.730 --> 00:46:48.730
&gt;&gt;female in audience: What's the number?

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:57.599
&gt;&gt;Shane Torbert: It's, I mean in the school
it's roughly 50/50; so the first year obviously

00:46:57.599 --> 00:47:03.860
it's roughly 50/50. In the lab it's probably
20 percent -- something like that which frank-frankly

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:08.660
I think is-is pretty good relative to a lot
of other things I've seen, but clearly not

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.700
representative of the actual talent distribution.

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:16.050
&gt;&gt;female in audience: So if it's 50/50 and
only 20 percent in the labs what are the women

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:17.050
generally ?

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:18.050
&gt;&gt;Shane Torbert: Life --

00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:20.050
&gt;&gt;female in audience: [unintelligible]

00:47:20.050 --> 00:47:21.602
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: Life and biological sciences.

00:47:21.602 --> 00:47:22.602
&gt;&gt;female in audience: [unintelligible]

00:47:22.602 --> 00:47:23.602
&gt;&gt;Evan Glaser: Biotech.

00:47:23.602 --> 00:47:31.060
And so a struggle for us then is we see students
who, females in particular, who have incredible

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:34.619
potential in computer science and-and choose
a different direction.

00:47:34.619 --> 00:47:39.369
And high school is set up in a way that you
have the flexibility to go in a lot of different

00:47:39.369 --> 00:47:44.339
directions and that the hope is later in life
they'll see the values too when they originally

00:47:44.339 --> 00:47:49.220
took this or us mentioning, "Hey, we think
you have a lot of potential in this area.

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:51.710
You should consider applying it."

00:47:51.710 --> 00:48:01.810
But in the end [bad audio] where-where we
lose, it-it's very difficult to observe. And

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:07.579
we've created girls only computer science
sections. I mean we tried to do some experimental

00:48:07.579 --> 00:48:11.380
things, but it hasn't produced the results
that we had hoped.

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:18.750
But down the road we hope to see in 10 years
as alumni come back that they'll say, "I'm

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:23.440
really blending different aspects of my career
where computer science is an important component

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.440
of that."

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:28.840
&gt;&gt;Shane Torbert: One other thing on that too
is the numerical analysis class I've-I've

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:33.579
taught myself a couple times and since it's
a math class ev-ev-ev-even though they're

00:48:33.579 --> 00:48:40.030
writing a lot of code, it was, it was sort
of like it was 50/50 boys and girls 'cause

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:44.950
the girls don't have any, in-in the school,
don't have any preconceived notion against-against

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:50.500
taking math so they just take math. That was
the course and so they were writing-writing-writing

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:51.500
code there.

00:48:51.500 --> 00:49:00.710
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: We have time for one more question
and I guess we could take more questions off

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:01.710
line.

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:04.443
How 'bout in the, in the back?

00:49:04.443 --> 00:49:05.443
&gt;&gt;female in audience: [unintelligible]

00:49:05.443 --> 00:49:10.440
&gt;&gt;Evan Glazer: So the question is about fine
arts and how do we handle, how do we integrate

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:17.550
arts into our curriculum and also at the national
level, how do we deal with the challenge associated

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:18.550
with cuts in arts?

00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:24.900
That's a big elephant in the room and I, and
I have to admit we have a hard time movin'

00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:30.800
it. And-and here, so I'll explain what we
do and I'll explain the opportunities that

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:34.670
people have, but I don't think we do a good
enough job and the challenges that lie ahead

00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:38.030
for fine arts and applied arts.

00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:44.369
So we have a-a fine arts curriculum, but in
a school of eighteen hundred students, so

00:49:44.369 --> 00:49:50.500
we have one orchestra director, we have one
band director who doesn't have a full load,

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:57.290
one choral director who doesn't have a full
load, and half an art teacher; very limited.

00:49:57.290 --> 00:50:01.680
And actually it continues to decline.

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:05.530
So independent if students wanted to pursue
those courses because, and the reason why

00:50:05.530 --> 00:50:12.819
that happens is two-fold: one, I-I shared
with you the expectations of our diploma which

00:50:12.819 --> 00:50:17.570
far exceed any other high school in our area
and as a result something gets pushed out.

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:20.869
And-and that's what often gets pushed out.

00:50:20.869 --> 00:50:28.380
And second, there's a weighting system that
students are given additional credit so as

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:35.160
they think about their preparation for college,
fine arts and applied arts aren't really given

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:42.030
the special recognition that you would if
you were taking a course in Artificial Intelligence.

00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:48.250
And so the students then get in a mindset
of rather than pursue a passion of theirs,

00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:55.180
they are pursuing what someone else would
anticipate of acknowledging their next step

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:56.800
into college.

00:50:56.800 --> 00:51:01.740
Having said that, those students who can't
take art; I mentioned we have an eighth period;

00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:06.460
we dedicate a part of our week as a non-academic
period to pursue a passion; students then

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:12.440
have open access to all of those areas in
which they can participate in fine and applied

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:14.410
arts.

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:20.800
Within the curriculum, our art teacher's very
active in working with, for example, biology

00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:27.240
teacher and the role of developing good drawing
skills for observations when you're out in

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.400
a natural environment.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:32.599
So there's some connections that are-are drawn,
but not to the level that I would hope.

00:51:32.599 --> 00:51:44.320
And on a federal level I showed the picture
of the cake, it I'd- I don't know. I don't

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:50.470
have any optimistic foresight on how that's
gonna be addressed because there's such a

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:59.270
strong movement towards basic skills and showing
that we have competency on tests because schools

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:04.329
get shut down for not doing well on them,
that the creative aspects such as the fine

00:52:04.329 --> 00:52:11.510
arts and applied arts get-get pushed by the
wayside.
