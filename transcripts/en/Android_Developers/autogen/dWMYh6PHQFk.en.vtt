stick tags to the walls like we did in
 

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:12.680
stick tags to the walls like we did in
the video we actually a during google

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:12.690

so yeah you can have a lot of fun with
 

00:08:17.969 --> 00:08:20.629
so yeah you can have a lot of fun with
this so we've written these tags but the

00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639
this so we've written these tags but the
 

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:22.070
this so we've written these tags but the
question is what did we actually write

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080
question is what did we actually write
 

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.110
question is what did we actually write
to these tags we can check we have tag

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:24.120
to these tags we can check we have tag
 

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.119
to these tags we can check we have tag
info up here which is an app you can

00:08:26.119 --> 00:08:26.129
info up here which is an app you can
 

00:08:26.129 --> 00:08:28.189
info up here which is an app you can
download from the Play Store I scan this

00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:28.199
download from the Play Store I scan this
 

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:29.540
download from the Play Store I scan this
tag

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:29.550
tag
 

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.780
tag
and it says you have n def data what is

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:32.790
and it says you have n def data what is
 

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:35.930
and it says you have n def data what is
that n def data it's a URI so what we're

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:35.940
that n def data it's a URI so what we're
 

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.880
that n def data it's a URI so what we're
basically doing is just writing a URI to

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:37.890
basically doing is just writing a URI to
 

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.690
basically doing is just writing a URI to
a tag and when you scan that tag it goes

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:40.700
a tag and when you scan that tag it goes
 

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.820
a tag and when you scan that tag it goes
it gets caught by the intent filter on

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:43.830
it gets caught by the intent filter on
 

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.680
it gets caught by the intent filter on
the app and I've actually got the intent

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:45.690
the app and I've actually got the intent
 

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.440
the app and I've actually got the intent
filter up here you can see it says when

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:48.450
filter up here you can see it says when
 

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.380
filter up here you can see it says when
you find an end F thing and that end F

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:51.390
you find an end F thing and that end F
 

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:55.910
you find an end F thing and that end F

and is also looking for path prefix f if
 

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.400
and is also looking for path prefix f if
you look over here we can we have the f

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:01.410
you look over here we can we have the f
 

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:06.410
you look over here we can we have the f
it's basically f4 find equals clue dev

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:06.420
it's basically f4 find equals clue dev
 

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.690
it's basically f4 find equals clue dev
for good 0 so Deb for good 0 is the tag

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:08.700
for good 0 so Deb for good 0 is the tag

the tag it's just just a URI now we can
 

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.590
the tag it's just just a URI now we can
actually play the game using these tags

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600
actually play the game using these tags
 

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.690
actually play the game using these tags
that we just wrote mmm so we have it up

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:20.700
that we just wrote mmm so we have it up

your hunts if you're going to be then
 

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.060
your hunts if you're going to be then
writing a whole bunch of tags for each

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:53.070
writing a whole bunch of tags for each
 

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:54.470
writing a whole bunch of tags for each
one of those places and then hiding the

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480
one of those places and then hiding the
 

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.390
one of those places and then hiding the
tags and what we notice when we are

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:56.400
tags and what we notice when we are
 

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.070
tags and what we notice when we are
setting us up is if you have one really

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080
setting us up is if you have one really
 

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.540
setting us up is if you have one really
obvious tag it lets people know that

00:09:59.540 --> 00:09:59.550
obvious tag it lets people know that
 

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.980

they made it to the right place and the
 

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.240
they made it to the right place and the
other two can be hidden a little more

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:02.250
other two can be hidden a little more
 

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:03.980
other two can be hidden a little more
like hard difficulty to make it the

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:03.990
like hard difficulty to make it the
 

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.230
like hard difficulty to make it the
search more fun so one easy to hide it

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240
search more fun so one easy to hide it
 

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.600
search more fun so one easy to hide it

worked out pretty well um we also have
 

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.120
worked out pretty well um we also have
one easter egg if you have a tag that's

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.130
