KEITH: Jerry Stahl,
he's the author

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.690
of the memoir "Permanent
Midnight," which

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.280
was made into a movie
starring Ben Stiller,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.660
and "Perv-- A Love
Story," both of which

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.980
were "Los Angeles Times"
best sellers, as well

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.870
as acclaimed novels
"Painkillers,"

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:17.750
"Plainclothes naked."

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.000
He's also written extensively
for film and television.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.170
He recently wrote the
screenplay for the HBO

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.330
film "Hemingway and
Gellhorn," which

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.810
starred Clive Owen
and Nicole Kidman,

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.020
and his much anthologized
fiction and journalism

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.910
have appeared in "Esquire,"
"Details," "Playboy,"

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.000
"BlackBook," "LA
Weekly," and "Tin House."

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.380
He is a resident of
Los Angeles, which

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.910
makes us extra special
happy to have him here.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.410
So let me go ahead
and hand it over.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.356
Everybody, this is Jerry Stahl.

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:45.328
JERRY STAHL: Thank you.

00:00:45.328 --> 00:00:46.786
Thank you.

00:00:46.786 --> 00:00:49.745
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:49.745 --> 00:00:51.370
JERRY STAHL: Thanks
so much for letting

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.455
me take over your lunch hour.

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:57.080
It's really exciting
to be here for me.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.680
You know, I was
just using a urinal,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.950
over which I noticed a little
sticker for blaze dependency

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.590
testing.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.290
At which point, I
got paranoid there

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.840
was a drug I was addicted to
that I've never even heard of,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.441
and they were going
to test my urine.

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:16.040
But if anyone can
relate to that joke,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.950
they're probably not here now.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.150
That's what I'm guessing.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.940
But I was just telling
Keith before, it's

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.080
really convenient-- I don't
want to-- I love Google

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.880
as if they were blood
relatives of mine.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.070
But I was mentioning when
you go to my Google page--

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.820
and I have to say that
with my wife here--

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.150
but it mentions that I'm married
to Brandy Alexandre, who nobody

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.450
will admit knowing was a porn
star in the '80s who I've never

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.580
personally met, never
even seen any of her work.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.680
And I was just consulting--
it was very fortuitous for me

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.920
to be here at Google, so
I could figure out a way

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.390
to tell the world,
when they Google me

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.300
and see me in the
corner, that I'm not

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.520
in fact married to Brandy.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.681
We were never friends.

00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:01.555
It was never serious.

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:03.260
I never met her.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.760
And it means nothing to you.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.960
I'm dying up here.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.080
But on to "Happy
Mutant Baby Pills,"

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.047
which is my newest book.

00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:14.880
I'm going to try to be
as close as possible,

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.360
so there will be
feedback to the mic.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.320
Wow, the electricity
in this room.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.629
Sometimes-- I've spoken
all over the world,

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.170
and sometimes you
just go to a place,

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.630
and you just feel
that vibe, like wow.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.180
This is an audience
that's on fire.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.700
I can't lie.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.210
I don't know what they're
putting in those mung beans.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:45.620
So as my host, Keith,
mentioned-- what he left off

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.490
the resume is that I was
a professional heroin

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.140
user for a number of years,
which was really a great career

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.430
move for me because it got me
a book deal and a movie deal.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.120
And I was doing a
lot of research,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.760
which I didn't know was
research at the time.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.320
And I mention that because
all my books are essentially

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.290
part of one big, massively
OK-selling oeuvre.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.090
And this book, "Happy
Mutant Baby Pills,"

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.485
which I see they have on
the chair, which makes me

00:03:18.485 --> 00:03:20.860
feel like I'm in geography
class, which is kind of great.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.150
The textbook is there.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.870
This book relates to drugs
because the story behind it,

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.540
even though it's a novel, is--
like all junkies of the '80s

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.540
and '90s, including the
late, lamented Lou Reed,

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.950
I got hepatitis C,
which is what you

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.300
get if you're lucky
enough not to get AIDS.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.130
Not to get technical, but if
you bleached your needles,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.540
you would kill the hep C.
But you needed to boil them

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.330
for 10 minutes to
not-- I mean, you

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.010
wouldn't get AIDS if
you used to bleach.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:00.950
As you can see, drugs
have affected my memory.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.090
So if I'm not exactly
linear, indulge me.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.790
Or not.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.040
And to kill the
AIDS virus, you had

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.680
to boil needles for 10 minutes.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.899
And junkies are always in a
hurry, because places to go

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.529
and people to see.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:20.300
I didn't do that.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.470
So what happened is two things.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.950
Right before I started
writing this book,

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.130
Abbott Pharmaceuticals came
up with a cure for the disease

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.290
I had, or so they thought.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.700
And I did a trial drug
program at Cedars-Sinai.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.640
Pays me massively to
plug them wherever I go.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.510
I am, by the way,
contractually bound

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.780
to mention heroin and
Cedars-Sinai whenever I speak.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.850
So that's out of the way.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.320
We can get back to business.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.270
And long story short, the
second I took the first pill,

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.970
and they started talking to
me, they said, oh by the way,

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.780
this stuff is so toxic
that if you so much as

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.400
touch a pregnant woman,
or if you happen to sweat

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.190
and she touches a little drop
of your sweat in your bed,

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.060
your baby will essentially
be born purple with wheels.

00:05:20.057 --> 00:05:21.140
That's not what they said.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.000
I'm being scientific.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.090
We've already lost one.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.280
And Lenny Bruce said, if
people don't start walking out

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.460
in the first five minutes,
you're fucking up.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.974
So I'm glad they're fleeing.

00:05:31.974 --> 00:05:34.140
If there's not an empty
room by the time we're done,

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.580
I will have failed.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.370
And what happened is, my
girlfriend, now my wife,

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.860
had just told me that
she was pregnant.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.450
So boy was my face red.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.190
So I've just gotten married.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.380
We're pregnant.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.300
And I'm now on a drug that
is so toxic, if I sneeze

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.900
in her direction, we're
going to have a sideshow

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.740
act on our hands when the kid's
born, if we're optimistic.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.740
So had to get rid
of her for a while.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.830
We split up while she was
pregnant-- which is just

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.570
a lovely thing to do
to a pregnant woman--

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.550
so that I could be on
this massively toxic drug,

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.590
the other side effect of which
was-- I'm sure none of you

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.040
have had this experience-- was
basically aside from itching,

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.640
sweating, all that, all
the normal stuff, which

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.820
I'm no stranger
to, was basically

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:32.290
like being on bad acid, not
to brag, for about 12 weeks.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.270
Which is great for a
writer, but not so great

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.450
for getting through life.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:42.010
So it occurred to me
a couple of things.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.940
I was a drug addict
for years and put

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.210
God knows what strain of
bus station toilet water

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.110
into my veins.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.840
And now I'm on these drugs that
are totally legitimate, more

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.400
or less, because they
haven't been FDA approved,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.830
and they're so toxic, and
there's so many of them,

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.650
that I became obsessed
with all the drugs

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.675
we are taking that are
kind of involuntary.

00:07:06.675 --> 00:07:09.630
And I became obsessed with
the impact on pregnant women.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:15.420
And I became obsessed with
probably really the creepiest

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.050
side effect of the fact that
there is complete deregulation

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.530
and that there is
GMOs in everything

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.630
and that there is pesticides and
that Monsanto runs the world,

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.380
and if you have stock
in them, forgive me.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.120
It will go up, and we will
die, but what the hell.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.930
The point is, even
mother's milk at this point

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:42.300
has Benzene, toilet cleaner,
window washer, lithium,

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.500
which in my case, my kid
gets a little free lithium,

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.215
it wouldn't be the worst
thing in the world.

00:07:47.215 --> 00:07:48.800
And it freaked me out.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.930
So I wrote a book about
this because what can you

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.080
do when you're a novelist?

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.820
You have all this information,
and you have a captive audience

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.625
if someone decides
to pick up your book.

00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:00.250
And you've got to
make it entertaining.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.330
So that was the
impetus for this book.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.730
Because as I walked
in, so many of you

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:07.695
took me aside and
said, Jerry, what

00:08:07.695 --> 00:08:09.070
was the impetus
for this book you

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.620
wrote that I've never heard of?

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.340
And I wanted to
answer that question

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.310
so that you wouldn't
walk away unsatisfied.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.370
How's lunch, by the way?

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:18.500
Is it good?

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.840
Everybody good?

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.720
I'm trying not to say fucking
too much because as I was also

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:27.320
telling Keith as I walked
in, the last time I actually

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:30.990
had an office job-- and again,
I don't mean to brag-- after I

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:36.190
got off heroin, I was working
at McDonald's at the age of 38.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.620
A man in uniform, ladies.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.130
Poly blend.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.510
In Phoenix, I'd say
it's about 105 degrees.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.750
And my job, among others,
speaking of poisons,

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.430
was to-- every morning,
they would deliver the meat

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:54.170
into the parking lot and leave
the patties outside in like 105

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:55.960
degrees, vaguely green.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.050
And I got to like scoop
the patties up, take them

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.080
inside, let them thaw a little.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:07.350
And then I got to make the Egg
McMuffin, Egg McMuffin batter.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.250
And because you
are eating lunch,

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.760
I won't elaborate
on the fact that I

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.490
got fired for being caught
urinating into the Egg McMuffin

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:19.650
batter.

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.480
But not the first time.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.990
So consider the next time
you have a McDonald's, all

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.250
that-- I see that guy
putting his lunch aside.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:29.930
And forgive me.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.010
I rarely speak at meal times.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:37.430
We would have provided
buckets, had I known.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.415
Consider the number of
disgruntled employees

00:09:40.415 --> 00:09:41.250
who are in the back.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.310
Because now, your average
McDonald's employee is like

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.454
a guy with an engineering degree
who couldn't get into Google

00:09:47.454 --> 00:09:48.870
so now he's at
fucking McDonald's.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:54.597
So it is kind of your
fault, but not really.

00:09:54.597 --> 00:09:55.680
I didn't want to go there.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.650
But yeah, I mean,
essentially, you're

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.860
putting a man in a McDonald's
uniform just by being here.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.829
But I made it out, happily.

00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:05.120
I'd probably still be at
McDonald's, had they not fired

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.620
me.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.360
They had a-- I'm just going to
ramble a little bit because it

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.040
is Hollywood.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:18.100
They had a movie we had to watch
on how to make the fries when I

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.520
got to McDonald's.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.154
And it had a really kind
of a great looking guy

00:10:24.154 --> 00:10:25.945
and a great looking--
I'm going to say gal.

00:10:25.945 --> 00:10:28.990
I don't usually use the
word gal, but she was a gal.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:32.120
And I remember thinking, boy, I
bet they went to acting school.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.930
This is probably some
Juilliard graduate,

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.890
and the best they could do is
get a gig doing the how to make

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.570
fry tape for McDonald's.

00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:43.990
And I guess none of you
guys have had bad jobs.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.370
I'm an expert at bad jobs.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.530
Which brings us back to
"Happy Mutant Baby Pills."

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.360
I don't know why
I'm holding it up.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.068
I feel like I'm in a
fucking infomercial.

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:00.790
I had the experience, in my
life, with a lot of bad jobs.

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:02.990
And one of the
characters in this book

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:07.367
is a guy whose gig is writing
the side effects on pills.

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:09.200
I'm sure you've all
seen them late at night,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.850
when you see the ads.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.440
So he's the guy.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.870
His claim to fame is that he
came up with the phrase anal

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:21.260
leakage, which is not as easy
as it thinks because you don't

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.110
want to say seepage, which
is what it really was.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:25.610
The side effects
of a lot of drugs,

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.151
including olestra, which was in
a lot of those low cal potato

00:11:28.151 --> 00:11:32.530
chips, it'll be suicidal
thoughts, sweating,

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:35.000
night sweats,
frequent urination.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.709
Enjoy your lunch.

00:11:37.709 --> 00:11:39.750
But you never realize
what's in your fucking head

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.130
until you get plunged in front
of a room full of 40 people.

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.004
And as you can see, I've
prepared extensively

00:11:44.004 --> 00:11:46.600
for this talk because I
tour the world speaking

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:50.340
about this as an
inspirational speaker.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:56.186
Me and Tony Danza, essentially.

00:11:56.186 --> 00:11:58.350
We're like this.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.680
And so this guy's job was
to write these things,

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.891
and he was a failed writer.

00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:05.140
But he came up with anal
leakage, and he got promoted.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.650
So I became obsessed with
the side effects and the fact

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.440
that restless knee syndrome,
for example, didn't exist.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.100
They actually hire
people to invent diseases

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.940
so that they can peddle
cures so that guys

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.600
like him, in this
book, this guy Lloyd,

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.590
can be hired to write the
side effects for a pill

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:30.620
for a disease that was
only created to cure

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.020
the disease they invented
to sell the pill.

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:37.790
Sort of how Monsanto
has developed

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:42.230
a pesticide-resistant
plant, that is now

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:46.090
in all the GMOs, that resists
Roundup, which was developed

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:51.090
by Monsanto, so that they could
sell another pesticide that

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:52.260
will work.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.030
It's just great.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.987
Because basically, we're all
eating pesticides all the time,

00:12:55.987 --> 00:12:57.070
and they're all inside us.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.132
And now every baby's
born with asthma.

00:12:59.132 --> 00:13:01.090
Now, as you can tell, I
have a scientific mind,

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.798
and I'm laser sharp,
and I'm sure you all

00:13:02.798 --> 00:13:07.080
understand that this is a book
about a guy whose first job was

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.830
writing bad side
effects to medications

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:11.710
and making them sound festive.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:12.820
Making it OK.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.800
Because seepage, to get back
to my original point, seepage,

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.570
ladies and gentleman, is nasty.

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:22.630
I mean, around the
house, in your body,

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.110
nothing that seeps can be good.

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:26.950
But leakage, that is a kind
of around the house thing.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:27.970
Tires leak.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.160
Faucets leak.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.070
So he had the touch.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:32.830
And I have had jobs like this.

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:38.040
He also wrote the side
effects for other medications.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.210
He also wrote the
descriptions for marital aids,

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:44.400
which sex toys
used to be called.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.900
Sidebar, not to make
myself look good,

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.420
but before I worked
at McDonald's, I

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.800
got a job-- because
I do have a college

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.139
degree-- I got a job being
humor editor at "Hustler."

00:13:56.139 --> 00:13:57.680
And I was really
young, and I thought

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.070
it would be really exciting.

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.925
And I went to Columbus, Ohio,
and they're giving me the tour,

00:14:02.925 --> 00:14:05.030
and I thought, wow,
this is going to be hot.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:08.890
And they take me down a hall,
and they open this door,

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.410
and there's about--
do any of you

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.290
remember "The Andy
Griffith Show?"

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.800
Anybody?

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.240
No?

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:13.770
Yeah.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:14.690
Aunt Bee?

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.470
There was a room full
of ladies with beehives

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:22.430
who looked like the kindergarten
teacher you had in 1968,

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:27.040
'75, '52, stuffing
dildos into boxes.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.900
And they were just like church
ladies, room full of them,

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:31.810
stuffing sex toys into boxes.

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:33.300
Why do I mention it here?

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:34.280
No reason.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.590
But it came into my head,
and it seemed very relevant

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:38.370
to this book.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.540
Because this is a book
about a guy with bad jobs.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.720
His job after this was writing
the festive descriptions

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:48.180
for Christian Singles,
which was a website, which

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.530
I hope some of you have enjoyed.

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.800
I don't know if any of you
are like JDaters or OK Cupid.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.080
This guy had the job of writing
copy for Christian Singles--

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:01.800
Christian Swingles in the book--
and he didn't like his job.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.110
He ends up getting fired.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.650
He meets a woman,
in a roundabout way,

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:10.240
he meets a woman whose job
she has decided in life,

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.640
she feels fucked
over by big pharma.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.420
She feels like she's
been screwed over.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.570
She wants to have
the most mutant baby

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:24.440
she can have as a protest
against capitalism.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.870
So she is on a mission
to consume every over

00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:35.100
the counter-- see ya-- under
the counter, beside the counter,

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:38.800
from huffing paint, to all the
good stuff we do every day.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.640
For example, forget drugs.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.780
If you're pregnant
and need tomato soup,

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.540
the lining of the can
will deform your baby.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.330
Good news.

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:49.540
But nobody tells you that.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.270
So she decides to consume
everything she can,

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:59.450
every drug, every kind of like
food stuff that is semi nasty,

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.474
like meat, chicken, poultry.

00:16:01.474 --> 00:16:02.640
Watch the movie "Food, Inc."

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.520
It's a great movie.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.230
It shows you how
chickens are treated

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.030
and how cows are treated.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:10.690
God, I sound like
some wild-eyed radical

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:15.080
up here when the fact is,
I would kill for a Big Mac

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.430
right now if I didn't
know what was in it.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.012
So these two people--
it's a love story.

00:16:22.012 --> 00:16:24.220
It's a guy who had this
job-- and they're both heroin

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.039
addicts, because I
did some research,

00:16:26.039 --> 00:16:27.330
and I knew a little about that.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:29.900
And it's really
kind of a metaphor

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:34.200
for the world we live in, which
is one of involuntary drug

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.000
consumption.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.240
And as I say, it's
an interesting read

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.880
for some people because
while I wrote this book,

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.160
I basically couldn't put a
sentence together in my head

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:50.180
and was on this
medication, which

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.670
was so strange because the
FDA hadn't approved it.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:56.610
And in fact, I think-- I'm not
sure if the version I was on

00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:00.330
is the one that was approved,
but it's a very strange thing

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:01.839
to know you're being cured.

00:17:01.839 --> 00:17:02.630
I mean, it's crazy.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.400
I was one of those guys,
I did every-- because

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.837
I'd basically been told
I was dying for 20 years.

00:17:07.837 --> 00:17:09.670
And I wouldn't do the
main thing they wanted

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.520
me to do, which was
interferon, because it

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.130
was a very hard, hard treatment,
and people would often

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:18.490
commit suicide on it or-- it
was worse than the disease.

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:20.400
So I finally get cured.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.869
I'm the guy who rails
against big pharma.

00:17:22.869 --> 00:17:24.950
I get my shit nuked in a week.

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.160
I'm like, the virus
is gone, but I

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.940
have to continue
taking questionably

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:35.350
odd brain-twisting
bad acid for 12 weeks.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:39.330
And so I write
this book, where I

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.630
can utilize all this
information that I'm

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:45.220
learning, what it does to
pregnant women, what happens

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.820
to us just by existing
in this world,

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.350
the fact that we live
in America, where

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:57.069
we get to breathe and eat and
sleep and consume everything.

00:17:57.069 --> 00:17:58.610
I mean, you guys
work with computers,

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:02.650
so I'm sure you know that
all the completely rare earth

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.320
minerals that go
into like the tiniest

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.090
little part of the
iPhone or a Prius

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.550
are mined by like these
poor bastards in Africa who

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.620
are going to be
completely mutant

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.620
and radiated themselves
just from digging it up.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:19.110
And China owns 90% of them
because they own the places

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.480
in Africa where the mines are.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.450
So it's all good news.

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.900
And it's all stuff I
tried to put in this book.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.979
And as you can tell, it's
kind of a light hearted romp.

00:18:28.979 --> 00:18:31.395
Because when you're dealing
with this kind of information,

00:18:31.395 --> 00:18:33.610
you don't want to hit people
over the head with it.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.855
You don't want to repel
them, the way I apparently

00:18:35.855 --> 00:18:41.090
am by driving lunch eaters
out into the hall retching.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.330
But you want to get
the information out.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:47.780
And I've been very lucky because
I get to do this for a living

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:48.280
now.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.650
The thing about writing
is, you're basically

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.750
paid to be a weirdo.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.490
I was a terrible,
terrible student.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.620
I was a terrible
guitar player, which

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.790
I wanted to be a
rock and roll guy.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:03.200
So when I was a kid, unlike
you, who were probably in school

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.290
and doing all these smart
things, I'm thinking to myself,

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:07.270
I want a job.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:10.450
I can do alone, naked,
and fucked up at 4:00

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:12.900
in the morning, and
maybe make a dime.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.520
It's a high bar,
but I went for it.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.490
And now that those
things no longer matter,

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.650
I kind of have that job.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:22.130
But at my age, I don't
parade around naked at 4:00

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.910
in the morning
because complaints,

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:26.470
family, social services.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:27.230
I can't do it.

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.267
I just can't do it.

00:19:29.267 --> 00:19:30.350
Wow, this is a tough room.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:31.974
I'm used to speaking
to people at night

00:19:31.974 --> 00:19:34.310
who are drunk, so forgive me.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:36.120
You may need a drink.

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.580
So the thing I did
before this, by the way,

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:42.390
was a movie for HBO about
Hemingway and Gellhorn.

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.120
If you ever heard
of Martha Gellhorn,

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.540
I'm just going to
ramble here because she

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:50.080
was a much braver-- I'm going to
switch and talk about World War

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:50.580
II.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.580
Martha Gellhorn was a journalist
who was the only person

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.070
to be at the
invasion of Normandy

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.820
while Hemingway was
off drinking in a bar

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.360
somewhere with his buddies.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.980
She disguised herself as
a nurse and got there.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.310
Why do I mention her?

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:08.006
Because in this movie-- and I
got a lot of flack for this--

00:20:08.006 --> 00:20:09.880
I'm switching out of
chemicals because I just

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.260
decided lunchtime is no time
to discuss toxic chemicals.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.290
Little late in the game.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.060
I don't know how much
time we still have.

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.185
But it just occurred to
me, if I were having lunch,

00:20:18.185 --> 00:20:20.040
I wouldn't want to
listen to a guy babbling

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.060
about anal leakage.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.040
I mean, who would?

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.460
Bad choice of
material on my part.

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:28.120
So we're going to switch and
talk about culture now, HBO.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.300
We all love HBO.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.480
I do.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.390
They employed me.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:36.690
I got to-- we all
have dreams, right?

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:39.290
I wrote this movie
about Martha Gellhorn,

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:41.450
and I got to hear
my lines come out

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:45.120
of Nicole Kidman's mouth,
which is pretty exciting.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:50.540
And I got to talk about a woman
who really meant a lot to me

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.560
because she was so much
braver than Hemingway.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.910
And there's actually
a journalism award

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:59.320
in her name in England every
year for the journalist

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.780
who takes the most
physical risks

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.490
in the pursuit of a story.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:06.230
And why do I mention that?

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:09.790
Because if you are a writer,
and if you're wired like me,

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:14.250
you can turn any
triumph into an occasion

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.030
for peculiar and petty shame.

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:17.660
That's how writers operate.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.020
They get more-- it's sort
of like a really lame mass

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.050
metaphor of the
oyster and the sand.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.320
They can turn all
triumph into shame.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.420
So in my case, I got to go
to "con," "can," you decide.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.050
"Cans"?

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:33.020
C-A-N-N-E-S. Experts?

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:33.680
Linguists?

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.560
Keith is a linguist.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.213
He probably knows
how to pronounce it.

00:21:36.213 --> 00:21:37.140
KEITH: "Con."

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.060
JERRY STAHL: Cannes?

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:39.900
Easy for you to say.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.910
Yeah, OK.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:43.800
So I was at "can."

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:48.000
And I'm on the red carpet
for no apparent reason.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.980
It's dream come true.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.563
Here-- I'm dropping
names, by the way.

00:21:50.563 --> 00:21:51.300
Clive Owen.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.655
And it was great
because the shame

00:21:53.655 --> 00:21:56.411
that I managed to attain
here-- and I mention this

00:21:56.411 --> 00:21:58.660
because it's going to be
material for a next massively

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.940
mediocre selling book
that I have in mind.

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.240
I'm on the red carpet.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.310
It's me, Nicole
Kidman, Clive Owen.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:06.310
We're all like this.

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.430
I have my picture taken.

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:09.990
I, of course, popped
a button in my shirt,

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:13.080
so there's like a little
shame bush of chest hair

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.620
just like popping out.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:17.500
All over the world, my
moment in the sun, and I've

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.980
got like the bush of death, the
very untrendy '70s chest hair--

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.930
ladies-- puffing
out of my shirt.

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.080
And that will be the basis
of my entire new novel.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.210
And I just wanted to mention
the fact that even though,

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:35.520
OK, you're here listening to a
guy babbling about anal leakage

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.440
and how everything
you eat will kill you

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.240
and babies will be born mutant
and America is in trouble,

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.510
but you know what, he had
his moment in the sun,

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:45.390
and it was eclipsed by
a thatch of chest hair.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:47.990
And I think we can
all learn from that.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:55.900
Another thing I didn't
do when I came up here

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.300
was tell you about a
book I wrote before this.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:00.750
This is "Happy
Mutant Baby Pills."

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:04.320
Most of my stuff is very
high brow, as you can tell.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.790
I wrote a book before
this, where I really-- it

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:09.010
was mostly for academics.

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:13.370
It was called "Bad
Sex on Speed."

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:14.400
Yeah.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:16.980
Where, like this, I
talked about-- they're

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.640
sort of sister
and brother books,

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.376
so I'm not sure which
gender is which.

00:23:20.376 --> 00:23:21.750
And now there are
50 new genders,

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.990
so I really don't
have to decide.

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:26.460
Gender fluid, I think
is what my books are.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:31.380
And also discussing
the plague of drugs.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.280
But in this case,
methedrine, which

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.820
is really big, as some of
you kids may have-- you

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.700
may know somebody with no teeth.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:43.670
I have a friend who is
a paramedic in Missouri,

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:51.840
who told me the most common burn
now is when meth cookers are

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.320
in their labs and get careless.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.650
We've all seen "Breaking Bad."

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:57.390
They don't just
blow off their face.

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.770
They blow off the entire
front of their body.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:02.940
So in effect, they
become Ken dolls,

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.630
if you know what I'm saying.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.670
And it's very hard to repair.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:08.220
But in prison, it's
a badge of honor

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.560
to be a cook with no
genitals and no face.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.230
Don't ask me why.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:13.600
I'm not in prison.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.790
I wanted to mention that.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:15.320
Why?

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.614
Because you're having lunch.

00:24:17.614 --> 00:24:19.280
Because you're having
lunch, and I think

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.405
you need to know that there
are novelists out there

00:24:21.405 --> 00:24:28.020
on the front lines of
really good news for us

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.240
in the millennial years.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:34.760
I mean, I have a baby
who's 20 months old,

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.810
and I have a daughter
who is 24 years old.

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:40.310
Every 23 years, I pop
out another little girl.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:44.040
Because really, you want
a child when you're 59.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.430
I mean, it only makes sense
that I should be sitting here

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:50.200
sweating whether she'll be out
of diapers before I'm in them.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.104
Sidebar.

00:24:52.104 --> 00:24:54.020
You should know a little
bit about the writers

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:54.970
who are talking here.

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:58.690
I know you've had
a lot of notables.

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:02.390
And I wanted you to know
this is the guy standing

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:04.350
before you now.

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:07.710
Because I know when I worked
at McDonald's-- and again,

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:11.310
there I go dropping names--
we didn't get lunch breaks

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.620
so much.

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.710
We had inspirational
speakers once in a while.

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:19.740
And one of the reasons
I'm so happy to be here is

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:24.120
because the last inspirational
speech I heard was

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:25.390
at McDonald's.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:30.030
And they said, you should
smile bright enough

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:32.610
to make your customer
need sunglasses.

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:36.190
I don't know about you,
but it still gets me.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:40.469
I have that on a
pamphlet from McDonald's.

00:25:40.469 --> 00:25:42.135
Because, you know,
we all have bad days.

00:25:42.135 --> 00:25:45.050
And on my bad days, I
just look above my desk

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:46.730
at the McDonald's
pamphlet, which

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:52.990
has a whole section on
NJJ, new job jitters,

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.800
where it talks about how
often we should shower,

00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:02.806
how to shower, why to shower,
and how to smile so brightly.

00:26:02.806 --> 00:26:04.680
Which was a little scary
for me, because when

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:08.162
I was working at McDonald's,
again, at 38, fresh off heroin,

00:26:08.162 --> 00:26:09.370
my teeth weren't even yellow.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:11.440
They were working
their way up to yellow.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.650
There were a vaguely greenish
furry around the edges color.

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:15.640
Enjoy your lunch.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.210
And I couldn't get
that smile to happen.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:20.275
And I got fired.

00:26:20.275 --> 00:26:24.180
And I guess I've mentioned it
twice, so it must still hurt.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:29.340
So ladies and gentleman, the
point is we live in a time

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.480
where to breathe is
to kill ourselves.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:37.170
We live in a time where
essentially everything

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:41.340
we know or think
we know is wrong.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:45.940
My book before this and
before the book before this,

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.970
"Painkillers," was about
the fact that the Nazis won.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:50.330
Why do I say that?

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.680
Because thanks to
these chemicals,

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:58.420
we are essentially, through
no means of our own,

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:02.782
committing mass genocide on
our own people via cancer.

00:27:02.782 --> 00:27:04.740
I'm sure you just saw
that report that came out

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:10.560
that said in 10 to 15 years,
the cancer rate is going

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.920
to keep doubling, to by the time
my lovely little daughter is

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.680
in her 20s, 70% to 80%
of the American public

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.950
is going to have cancer.

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:20.800
Why?

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.520
So that some fuck who
works for big pharma

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.150
can have a second
home and a yacht.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:29.690
Now, I say that with
love, by the way.

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.970
And I know they will
have to bleep me.

00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:33.499
I apparently was
the first person

00:27:33.499 --> 00:27:35.040
from my last Google
lecture-- and I'm

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.502
thrilled they asked me
back, a little surprised.

00:27:38.502 --> 00:27:39.960
I was the first
person who ever had

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:43.120
to be bleeped at
a Google lecture.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.460
Because you just
can't hide class,

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.490
I guess is what I'm saying.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.800
And interestingly
enough, first vegetarian?

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.080
First celebrity
vegetarian, anybody?

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.040
Adolph Hitler.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:54.780
Thank you.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:55.560
Yeah.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.020
He ate veggies.

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.480
Wouldn't undress in
front of anybody else,

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.580
and had one testicle.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.290
Thanks for asking.

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:07.410
Blown off in World War I,
which may explain World War II,

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:09.390
some theorize.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:11.020
Now you say to
yourself, this guy

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.430
is just fucking Nazis
up here babbling.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:16.150
He has no logical structure.

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:17.570
It's all part of a plan.

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.390
You know what that plan is?

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.790
To make you kids feel good.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:24.030
To make you feel that
there is some hope.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:25.050
And there is.

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:26.150
There is some hope.

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.030
We're all going
to die eventually.

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:29.700
We'll be out of it.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.620
That's the hope.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:33.360
The other hope is-- excuse me.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.994
My wife will leave
me after this speech.

00:28:35.994 --> 00:28:38.410
But you know, it's OK, because
Brandy Alexander, according

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:39.900
to Google, is waiting for me.

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.290
And boy, was she hot in 1982.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:43.810
Oh, my, god.

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:46.640
I believe she starred
in "Bad Penny."

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.110
She always turns up.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:51.270
That was her banner vehicle.

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:56.520
By the way, again, not to brag,
when I was a kid in my 20s,

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.140
and I first got to
Hollywood, I wrote a movie

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:01.470
about the effects
of nuclear war.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:06.430
It was around the time of "Mad
Max" and "Liquid Sky" and all

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:10.850
these movies, which were
about the apocalypse.

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:13.400
But we were very
young and naive.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:18.540
And we took money from some
investors who operated out

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.190
of a place on Hollywood
Boulevard that

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:22.530
used to be called The
Cave, which turned out

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:23.470
to be a porn theater.

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:26.160
But it literally had
stalactites and stalagmites.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.380
So it was a realistic cave.

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.050
It was almost like a
diorama in a museum.

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:31.889
And I knew the first
sign we were in trouble

00:29:31.889 --> 00:29:33.680
was when we go to get
our first payment, we

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.170
had to walk through the
theater, 2:00 in the afternoon,

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.450
with guys in their rain
coats hunched in back.

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:40.770
We had to cross in
front of the screen

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:43.760
while they were showing possibly
my ex-wife, who I've never met,

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.970
Brandy Alexandre, who's
really-- apparently

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:47.900
I'm still married to.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.320
But you can't believe everything
you see on the internet.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.970
And I went upstairs,
and we were paid

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:57.570
$25,000 in quarters, which
kind of a dead giveaway

00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:00.630
that you're probably not dealing
with a legitimate entity.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:03.170
But quarters work.

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:06.404
We just walked out like Santa,
with like these big bags

00:30:06.404 --> 00:30:07.070
on our shoulder.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:09.600
I don't know if you've ever
seen $25,000 in quarters,

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.210
but bring a truss if you're
going to be carrying that.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:15.950
Nobody knows what a truss is.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:18.410
Men's magazines used to
have ads for trusses.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:19.430
Ask your grandpa.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:20.410
He probably has one.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:26.150
But the reason I'm mentioning
this is because this movie,

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:28.400
we had to put in
eight sex scenes.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.070
They told us, kids, we love it.

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:32.210
We just want eight
special scenes.

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.595
But because we were punks and
had every badass Hollywood

00:30:35.595 --> 00:30:38.090
punk in Hollywood-- including,
weirdly enough, Richard

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:40.067
Belzer, who wasn't a punk
but was in our movie,

00:30:40.067 --> 00:30:41.900
and I want to drop
another name because it's

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:45.700
been about five minutes since
I mentioned Nicole Kidman.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.900
And anybody can be legit
if you drop a name.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:48.860
That's Hollywood.

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:53.460
So we showed this movie
at the Pussy Cat Theater,

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:57.950
now the-- it's no longer
the Pussy Cat Theater,

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:01.650
it's the Ja-- It's
got a new name.

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:04.050
And it's no longer
catering to women.

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:08.170
And back then-- what
is the name now?

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:11.550
I think it's the Jack of Spades
or something really grotesque.

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:14.280
But the point is, there
were Japanese tourists

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.500
by the bus load who went for
a big night to this theater

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:18.660
when we made this movie.

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.375
We wanted so badly
to be artists,

00:31:21.375 --> 00:31:23.310
but we stuck in
these eight scenes.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:25.680
But we didn't really want
to do a sex movie because we

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.790
had integrity, so we made the
most repulsive sex imaginable.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:34.080
Not repulsive so much as
cold, chilly, distant, odd.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.470
The premise of the movie was
that in the future, which

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:39.030
is coming to pass, there
will be sex negatives and sex

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:39.780
positives.

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:42.910
Those people who can still
have sex perform for those who

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:43.950
can't.

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:45.500
That's the future.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:47.580
And, perhaps the present.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:50.297
But again, I don't mean
to brag, but as an artist,

00:31:50.297 --> 00:31:51.880
this was such a big
moment of my life.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.280
I was pulling up to the
theater just in time

00:31:54.280 --> 00:32:00.192
to see I'd say about 40 Japanese
businessmen running scared

00:32:00.192 --> 00:32:02.400
with their hands over their
mouths out of the theater

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:06.260
and into their tour bus because
apparently we had succeeded

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.540
in writing some really
anti-sexual sex.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:11.800
And the point of that is,
we ended up replacing "Pink

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.210
Flamingos"-- John Waters,
some of you might have heard

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:20.160
of-- as the midnight movie
Friday nights at the Nuart

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.240
Theater.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:21.990
Am I bragging?

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.580
No.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:26.140
I'm only saying,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:29.290
that if my career
is any indication,

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:33.430
the worst possible
shit can happen to you.

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:39.320
And the worst failures-- I'm
tearing up now on the inside--

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.240
can turn into a triumph.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.520
And if you're an artist,
the great thing about being

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.970
an artist-- if I
can flatter myself

00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.260
with that word--
or a novelist, is

00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:54.320
that out of the worst moments
of despair and torment

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.130
is your greatest material.

00:32:56.130 --> 00:33:00.450
Hence the thatch of chest
hair in "con," "can", "cans."

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:01.220
Cannes.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:02.530
Cannes, right?

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:03.110
"Con" man.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:06.590
We've got the "con"
man over here.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:08.930
You really feel
faith in a speaker

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:12.140
when he can't pronounce
Cannes when he's been there.

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:12.851
It's how it is.

00:33:12.851 --> 00:33:14.600
It's not everything
it's cracked up to be.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:19.020
There's about 16 stars and
then 75 blocks of parasites.

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.280
I was in the middle.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.107
I was the chest hair
freak with the brok--

00:33:22.107 --> 00:33:23.190
I'm so obsessed with that.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:24.180
It still kills me.

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:28.590
My big day, and I'm
blast-- Nicole Kidman.

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:30.360
Clive Owen.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:32.865
Either way, I'm not
up to Clive standards.

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:37.730
And that is my
inspirational message.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:40.895
If you're having a bad day,
if you're having a bad life,

00:33:40.895 --> 00:33:43.530
if you're listed on the
internet as having a bad wife,

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:44.650
it doesn't matter.

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:49.970
You can turn it all into triumph
and use that badness and shame

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:56.342
and terror and self loathing
and mortification and agony

00:33:56.342 --> 00:34:00.870
to write a book that will
get you an audience at Google

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:03.020
while people are
eating their lunch.

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.780
Thank you so much for having me.

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:08.449
I hope this meant
something to someone.

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:09.300
And that's it.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.100
Thank you.

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:15.000
I was told there will be a
question and answer period.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.800
I'm not getting a big question
vibe, but if there are, please

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.770
don't be ashamed.

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:21.389
Clearly I have no shame.

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:24.929
I was up here speaking proudly.

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:26.500
The gentleman
asked the question,

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:31.679
how did the lady who took every
known drug who huffed paint,

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:35.060
who ate painkillers,
who took heroin,

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:39.710
who drank, who went
so far as to eat

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:43.060
genetically modified soybeans,
most dangerous of all,

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.380
how did that baby turn out?

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:45.719
It turned out perfect.

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:48.500
Thank you for asking.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:52.159
Because in the end, you
want a happy ending.

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:52.710
Clearly.

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:54.250
Especially in a book like this.

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:57.210
Because a lot of
people say, when

00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:00.800
they categorize a writer
or a novel-- everybody gets

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.670
put in categories.

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:05.240
I'm generally-- I'm
a feel good guy.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.010
That's where I am.

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:06.944
So that's the ending.

00:35:06.944 --> 00:35:07.860
It turned out perfect.

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.120
Thank you for asking.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.430
Do you have children?

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:12.436
They good?

00:35:12.436 --> 00:35:12.935
It all work?

00:35:16.912 --> 00:35:21.150
You know, don't get me started
on how Monsanto caused asthma

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:24.370
by everything they eat
has pesticides in it

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:28.326
now because the anti-pesticides
and the pesticides both--

00:35:28.326 --> 00:35:29.700
because that's
Monsanto, covering

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.700
both sides of the
street-- are in the food.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.680
And every kid now is
being born with asthma.

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:38.304
Scant help for you,
but it's a tragedy.

00:35:38.304 --> 00:35:39.720
All kidding aside,
it's a tragedy.

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:42.260
How are they doing?

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.790
They doing the steroid inhaler?

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:47.167
Yeah?

00:35:47.167 --> 00:35:48.375
You think it's just the smog?

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:55.550
Yeah.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:56.180
Good, good.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.260
I have no medical diploma.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:02.960
So please take your
advice from me.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:05.400
Are there any other questions?

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.330
If not, thank you.

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.413
It's really been an honor.

00:36:07.413 --> 00:36:09.747
And I hope something
here hit somewhere.

00:36:09.747 --> 00:36:10.330
Appreciate it.

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:12.106
Oh, another question.

00:36:12.106 --> 00:36:13.230
Or were you waving goodbye?

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.896
I couldn't tell.

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:25.470
The idea for "Hemingway
and Gellhorn?"

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:28.930
Actually, the director,
Philip Kaufman,

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:30.930
who-- I don't know if any
of you are film buffs.

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:33.350
He did "The Right Stuff," "Henry
and June," "The Unbearable

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:34.183
Lightness of Being."

00:36:34.183 --> 00:36:37.600
He came to me because
Hollywood being Hollywood,

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.450
1 out of every 10
projects goes anywhere.

00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:42.940
I mean, basically
an idea-- ideas

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:44.180
are like sperm in Hollywood.

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:49.090
Like one out of every five
bazillion spermatozoa make it,

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:51.165
and something results.

00:36:51.165 --> 00:36:52.040
So I didn't pitch it.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.640
They came to me with the idea.

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.710
I am, as you can
probably tell, not

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:58.240
the best pitcher in the world.

00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:01.390
But I try not to
have to go anywhere

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:04.000
where I have to sell
myself because you'd rather

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.060
have them call you.

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.110
So this was just one
of those lucky breaks

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:09.340
where the director
brought me in.

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:13.670
And originally, the late James
Gandolfini, who was a producer,

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:17.610
was going to play Hemingway,
which would have given it

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.770
a whole other, insert joke here.

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:25.970
But great guy, and he,
despite his whole image,

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:29.830
had a very deep other
sort of artist side

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:31.410
to him, which is
pretty wonderful.

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:34.120
And that obviously
didn't work out,

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:36.000
and we switched to Clive Owen.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.180
But happily, to
answer your question,

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:39.200
I did not have to pitch.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.574
Did you ask that
because you have

00:37:40.574 --> 00:37:42.240
some ideas you'd
like to-- are you

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.500
a screenwriter, potentially?

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:56.200
You've got to get known.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.780
Yeah.

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.300
I know.

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:04.010
I got really lucky
because literally, I

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:08.210
went from living essentially
on the street with nothing

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:10.560
to I write this
article, which becomes

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.310
a book, which Ben
Stiller picks up.

00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:16.060
And then after we got the
money for "Permanent Midnight,"

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.334
it disappeared, and he
just said to me, hey,

00:38:18.334 --> 00:38:20.000
would you like to
write a movie with me.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.890
And we became friends.

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:26.269
"What Makes Sammy Run," which is
a famous book by Budd Schulberg

00:38:26.269 --> 00:38:28.060
about Hollywood, he
asked me to write that.

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.660
So literally, I'm
on a private jet,

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.080
like Sly Stallone's
private-- I'm

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.890
eating Sly Stallone's
left over tuna sandwiches

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:38.130
on a private jet to Saint Bart
after living in the street six

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:39.720
months earlier, and
I got the bends.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.220
So I just got lucky.

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.150
So I guess my
advice is get lucky.

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:47.460
But you seem like a very smart
individual, so I would say,

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:50.510
eloquent as you seem to be,
just write what the hell you're

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:51.180
going to write.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:52.520
Don't ask for approval.

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:55.810
They'll just give you notes that
will destroy your fucking idea.

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:58.550
So just do what you
want to do, and then

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:01.520
after the first 75
people reject you,

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.370
the 76th one will take you.

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:06.065
It will be a hit, and then
everybody will imitate you,

00:39:06.065 --> 00:39:07.440
and they'll call you derivative.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.430
And that's how it works.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:11.147
And good luck.

00:39:11.147 --> 00:39:12.230
I can say I knew you when.

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:15.790
I feel like a footnote
to film history.

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:17.660
But just finish it.

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:19.900
What the hell?

00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:23.040
Just write something good, and
it'll get-- especially now.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.850
With the internet, people
make movies so goddamn cheap,

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:28.250
you can bypass all the
crap that most people

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:31.250
used to have to go through.

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:34.260
So you're obviously in a
place with all the equipment

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:34.910
you need.

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:37.220
And you have an amazing AV guy.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:40.092
I can tell because I
looked at your monitor,

00:39:40.092 --> 00:39:41.550
and you couldn't
see my chest hair.

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:44.440
So that is the sign
of a good AV guy.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:48.620
Any other questions,
aside from grooming tips?

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:49.120
All right.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:49.910
Thank you so much.

00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:51.960
I really appreciate it.
