00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.670
Let's take a look at the page's structure and

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.790
see if something needs to be changed.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.900
In the instructor's notes you'll find a DOM built from the design.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.080
Check the link.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.490
I'll go ahead and open it here by going and

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.270
opening the file because I have it saved to my local machine.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.030
And we can see the design here.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.050
It doesn't quite look like our original mock up.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.020
Let's see if we can change it so it does.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.210
I'll go ahead and open up the Developer Tools.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.340
For that I'll press Command + Option + i on my Mac.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.070
There will be links in the instructors notes for

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.570
instructions on different operating systems.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.340
Now that I've got my Developer Tools open.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.480
Let's take a look.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.240
First off, let's go ahead and modify the header.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.830
I will open up the div and

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.180
we can see that the header at the top of the screen is highlighted.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.370
And let's go head and make some modifications.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.010
Around the whole thing we need a row.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.690
So, I'll right-click on this div and click add attribute.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.120
I'll type in class equals row.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.740
By adding row here you've changed the way this element on the page looks.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.030
Inside of our row we needs some columns.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.230
So I'll right-click on the first and click at attribute.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:10.850
Here I'll type in class equals column medium 6,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.660
indicating that we want the column here to take up half the page.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.760
This is supposed to be the logo that's on the left side of the header.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.970
I'll press enter and

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.300
we can see that now, this div only takes up half the screen.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.468
Let's do the same for our name.

00:01:25.468 --> 00:01:28.820
I will right-click on the div and click Add Attribute.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:30.600
And, once again,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.860
we wanted to take up half the screen, so we'll type class equals column

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.950
medium 6.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.040
Press enter. And

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.860
now we can see our two divs are each taking up half of the header.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.120
Now, I'd like you to go through the divs for

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.550
the rest of the page and add some classes.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.200
Do your best to make this website look like the mockup.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.710
But be warned, you might have some structural problems.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.210
Make sure you've got all the right divs on the page.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.780
You might find you need to add some divs to this page in order to structure it

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.740
properly for Bootstrap.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.190
What steps did you take to meet Bootstrap's requirements for the page structure?

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.730
Did you add a container div outside of your rows?

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.120
Did you add divs to organize your columns in to rows.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.280
Or did you add columns inside rows to organize your content?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.980
Check all that apply.
