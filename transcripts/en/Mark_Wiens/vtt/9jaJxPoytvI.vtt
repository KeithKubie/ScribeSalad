00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
- Good morning.

00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:01.720
I hope you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.600
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.130
I'm in Trat, Thailand.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.190
This is day six of our
eastern provinces of Thailand

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.606
food and culture and travel tour.

00:00:09.606 --> 00:00:13.990
Today, we are spending
the day at Ban Nam Chiao.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.670
And so, I'm really looking forward to it.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.010
I know the village.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.621
The community is very picturesque,

00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:20.530
and we're gonna do some cooking.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:21.880
We're gonna eat, of course.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.050
I'm gonna take you on a tour

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.230
and walk you around the community

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.552
where we're gonna be
cooking some halal food

00:00:27.552 --> 00:00:30.050
and we're gonna get some fish.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.440
I'm not sure all that we're gonna cook,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.911
but I'm gonna share it all with
you in this video right now.

00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:36.494
(upbeat music)

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.537
(speaking in foreign language)

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.160
This market is very small.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.030
Very, very, small.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.786
There's only like, one
row of vendors right here,

00:00:50.786 --> 00:00:53.070
and there happens to be no fish today,

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.460
so maybe the fishing
boats haven't arrived.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.442
(speaking in foreign language)

00:00:57.442 --> 00:01:00.025
(upbeat music)

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.385
We ended up having to
drive back into Trat town

00:01:14.385 --> 00:01:17.207
to go to the market
because there's no fish.

00:01:17.207 --> 00:01:19.790
She was saying that for some reason,

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.110
the fish vendors never came.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.910
So, it's just a 10-kilometer
drive to get here.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.310
We're at the market,
where we were yesterday,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.476
but this is the central
market of Trat town.

00:01:30.476 --> 00:01:32.583
We're gonna buy some ingredients here.

00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:35.376
(motorbike motor humming)
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:35.376 --> 00:01:39.293
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.990
Since we're at the big market,

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.420
we've asked Auntie to make
a couple of specific dishes.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.780
Well, I'm not totally sure of the dishes,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.160
but a couple of dishes using rakam,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.360
which is the fruit that she's
just buying, which is a...

00:01:58.233 --> 00:01:59.270
(stammering) In English,
I mean, there's two types.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.584
There's the salacca,
and there's the rakam.

00:02:02.584 --> 00:02:04.661
Well, the rakam is in Thai.

00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:06.950
(stammering) They're a
little bit different.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.300
One is, rakam is a little
fatter but it's a sour fruit.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.647
She's gonna make some dishes with that.

00:02:11.647 --> 00:02:13.048
And I also want to try to search out

00:02:13.048 --> 00:02:17.510
probably what is my
favorite single ingredient

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.309
in this region of Thailand.

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:23.226
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.680
We just found the ingredient.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.210
It's called krawan in Thai.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.048
It is cardamom stems.

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:31.375
It's an amazing ingredient.

00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:36.375
(motorbike motor humming)
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:49.840
(loud scraping)

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.410
We got all the ingredients.
(motorbike motor humming)

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.033
I'm very excited for the
dishes that she's gonna make.

00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:56.616
(upbeat music)

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.680
We made it back to Ban Nam Chiao.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.130
This is the community.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.467
We're walking to Kunnal's house,

00:03:05.467 --> 00:03:08.810
and I think we're coming up
on the river right now, too.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.911
We have made it to the
picturesque Ban Nam Chiao.

00:03:11.911 --> 00:03:14.757
It's along the river.

00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:16.870
There are big fishing boats,

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.870
but the main icon of this
community is the bridge,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.050
and what an impressively
steep bridge this is

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.700
that goes over the water,

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.470
and it's so steep because of the boats,

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.361
so the boats can pass through.

00:03:29.361 --> 00:03:31.313
(footsteps echoing)

00:03:31.313 --> 00:03:33.896
(upbeat music)

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.420
The railing is a little low.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.704
It's kind of high up here,
but this is beautiful.

00:03:43.704 --> 00:03:45.430
Oh, this is gorgeous.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.520
The big fishing boats.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.530
There is one of the main
mosques of the village.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.380
It's such a gorgeous little community.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.260
Wow, you wouldn't want these wooden planks

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.959
to break on you now, though.

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.542
(upbeat music)

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.820
This is kind of the community
center area right here,

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.392
and this is where we're
gonna do the cooking.

00:04:14.392 --> 00:04:18.430
They also offer eco-tourism
activities here.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.999
Most of the houses in this community

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:23.070
are on stilts above the water.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.270
And it's a fishing community.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.297
There's big fishing
boats, there's mangroves.

00:04:26.297 --> 00:04:29.150
They're doing all of the cooking in here,

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.150
and we have just this sleepy,
fisherman village view.

00:04:37.016 --> 00:04:40.180
(skin loudly snapping off)

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.300
This is the krawan.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.880
It has a very smooth texture,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.371
but yeah, they look like shoots,

00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:49.410
the shoots of the cardamom,
or cardamom stems.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.520
This really is one of the
kings of the ingredients

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.673
of Trat and this entire
eastern region of Thailand.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:00.933
(pestle loudly pounding)

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:04.770
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.446
(pestle loudly pounding)

00:05:06.446 --> 00:05:10.230
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.040
She's gonna add the krawan to two dishes.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.923
One is the tom sum, which is the soup,

00:05:13.923 --> 00:05:16.850
and then she's also gonna
make a stir-fry with gai ban,

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.650
which is a village free-range chicken

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.586
stir-fried with curry
paste, and also krawan.

00:05:22.586 --> 00:05:26.410
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.180
Some of the rakam, that snake fruit,

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.460
is also gonna go into the soup,

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.810
but another dish that I am
most looking forward to trying

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.435
is she's gonna make a
fried fish with a nam prik

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:40.435
dipping chili sauce using
shrimp paste as well as rakam.

00:05:42.176 --> 00:05:46.093
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.060
She massaged the fruit with her hands,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.810
kind of squeezing out all that juice,

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.650
and then she dropped it into the soup.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.628
And immediately, as
that hit that hot water,

00:05:58.628 --> 00:06:02.563
you can smell how sour the steam is.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.500
The fish goes in, and
at this point, again,

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.550
like normal Thai cooking style,

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.060
you do not want to stir it

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.190
because that will make the
fish a bad smell and taste,

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.810
so it's just gonna boil.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.474
Oh man, the aroma of that fruit
though, it smells amazing.

00:06:24.474 --> 00:06:25.709
(upbeat music)

00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:28.292
(oil sizzling)

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.527
Okay, next, she's gonna fry the fish.

00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:36.778
(upbeat music)

00:06:36.778 --> 00:06:39.361
(oil sizzling)

00:06:47.291 --> 00:06:48.810
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.567
Oh, she's also gonna make
stir-fried noodles with that crab,

00:06:51.567 --> 00:06:53.392
Trat-style.

00:06:53.392 --> 00:06:55.677
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:55.677 --> 00:06:58.580
These noodles are known to be very sweet.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:00.680
So, she added in quite
a lot of palm sugar,

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.030
and she's like, boiling that down

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.471
into a syrup for the noodles.

00:07:04.471 --> 00:07:08.726
(oil sizzling)
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:08.726 --> 00:07:12.643
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:23.764 --> 00:07:27.681
(speaking in foreign language)

00:07:31.811 --> 00:07:34.219
(laughing)

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:36.580
It's quite a complexity of ingredients

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.620
that she added to the noodles.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.625
She first started with
the sugar, the palm sugar.

00:07:40.625 --> 00:07:44.850
Then, she added in coconut
milk, a lot of coconut milk,

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:46.304
and simmered that down.

00:07:46.304 --> 00:07:49.150
Then, she added in some
chili paste, curry paste,

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.220
and she added in some
tamarind, sour tamarind,

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.603
so that's gonna be sweet and sour,

00:07:54.603 --> 00:07:56.410
and then she's gonna add in the crab.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.650
Oh, she added in all the noodles,

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.770
which is woon sen, which
are mung bean noodles.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.032
And then, she's gonna add in the crab.

00:08:01.032 --> 00:08:02.418
(pestle loudly pounding)

00:08:02.418 --> 00:08:05.835
(plastic bag crinkling)

00:08:14.676 --> 00:08:17.259
(upbeat music)

00:08:21.322 --> 00:08:24.940
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.320
Here's where things get exciting.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.670
Often times across Thailand though,

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.809
you use lime juice to make it sour.

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:32.210
But she's making the version with rakam,

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.083
that same fruit, the snake
fruit, to add the sourness.

00:08:35.083 --> 00:08:37.942
Oh, that's a combination
I've never had before.

00:08:37.942 --> 00:08:40.574
(motorboat motor humming)

00:08:40.574 --> 00:08:43.541
(pestle loudly pounding)

00:08:43.541 --> 00:08:45.630
And now, on to the final dish.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.887
She's making the stir-fried
chicken with the krawan,

00:08:47.887 --> 00:08:51.570
with the cardamom stems,
but she's also making,

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.180
wholly from scratch, the curry paste.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.380
So, she's pounding up some garlic.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.090
She's pounding up some chilis.

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.183
She tossed in some krachai in
there, which is finger root,

00:09:00.183 --> 00:09:01.990
kind of similar to ginger.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.470
(oil loudly sizzling)

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.393
(speaking in foreign language)

00:09:08.393 --> 00:09:11.524
(oil loudly sizzling)

00:09:11.524 --> 00:09:14.691
(oil loudly sizzling)

00:09:29.632 --> 00:09:33.248
(speaking in foreign language)

00:09:33.248 --> 00:09:34.710
Oh, it's so good.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.923
Oh, that shrimp paste is so fragrant.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.593
And you've got the sourness of the fruit.

00:09:39.593 --> 00:09:41.994
(speaking in foreign language)

00:09:41.994 --> 00:09:43.410
Wow.
(toddler cooing)

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.820
(speaking in foreign language)

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.290
So, she said we should begin
with the stir-friend noodles,

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:50.130
because then it will get
kind of mushy and dry.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.130
But these noodles, man,

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.870
she added so much coconut milk in it,

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.000
and then it just soaked
up into these noodles.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.127
And yeah, for sure, they're
gonna be quite sweet as well.

00:09:57.127 --> 00:10:00.849
(speaking in foreign language)
(toddler cooing)

00:10:00.849 --> 00:10:01.682
Mmm!

00:10:03.815 --> 00:10:04.648
Mmm.

00:10:04.648 --> 00:10:05.900
Oh, so good.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.280
I mean, it is sweet, but it's so good.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.316
Oh, it's so rich and sticky
from that coconut milk.

00:10:12.316 --> 00:10:13.149
Mmm!

00:10:13.149 --> 00:10:15.430
And it has that balance of sour flavor

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.763
from the sour tamarind.

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.463
Wow.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.490
Wow, I mean, that's amazing.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.323
This one is the soup.

00:10:25.323 --> 00:10:27.480
This one is with fish, with rakam as well.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.060
It's a tom sum soup.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.110
And, oh, she added in the krawan as well,

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:34.070
the cardamom shoots, the cardamom stems.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.280
So, I'm gonna take some of the fish.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.113
I'll put this,

00:10:37.113 --> 00:10:38.120
actually, let me just taste that broth,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.020
but with some of the, a little
bit of everything in there.

00:10:44.581 --> 00:10:45.414
Oh!

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:49.860
Oh, that's so pure.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.440
It's so nice and sour.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.750
It has like, that acidic sourness

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.521
coming from that snakefruit.

00:10:57.521 --> 00:10:59.593
And then, that krawan, I love it.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.420
It's like lemongrass-y, ginger-y, pepper-y

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.840
all at the same time,

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.241
but with a texture that's
similar to bamboo shoots.

00:11:07.241 --> 00:11:11.158
(speaking in foreign language)

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.150
That's absolutely stunning.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.006
The fresh fish, it just like,
dissolves in your mouth,

00:11:17.006 --> 00:11:19.700
and yeah, I'm just
blown away by the rakam.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.010
Next step for the fish, and
this is a pompano, I believe,

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.050
that she deep-fried,

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.440
and there's two different dipping sauces

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.640
that you can eat with it.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.472
Some of the fish.

00:11:28.472 --> 00:11:30.072
Oh, that flakes off beautifully.

00:11:31.283 --> 00:11:36.283
(upbeat music)
(speaking in foreign language)

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:40.880
Sauce is just spectacular.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.080
Again, the shrimp paste is so fragrant.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.140
It has such that
well-rounded umami saltiness,

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:47.890
and then that rakam, that fruit,

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:51.383
that's just blowing me away
today in all of this food.

00:11:54.324 --> 00:11:55.157
Mmm!

00:11:56.555 --> 00:11:57.388
Mmm, mmm!

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.774
Yeah, that's different
from what I was expecting.

00:12:01.774 --> 00:12:05.019
It's oil with chilis, a little
bit of fish sauce in there

00:12:05.019 --> 00:12:06.040
and shallots.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.010
And next up, for the plate of gai ga wan.

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:10.618
This is the stir-fried free-range chicken

00:12:10.618 --> 00:12:13.570
with all of the cardamom stems in here,

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.840
and then, there all the
curry paste she added in,

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.229
and then some green peppercorns.

00:12:18.229 --> 00:12:20.431
This looks spectacular.

00:12:20.431 --> 00:12:23.014
(upbeat music)

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.007
Equally as much as the rakam,

00:12:28.007 --> 00:12:30.890
the snake fruit is blowing my taste buds.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.750
That krawan, those cardamom stems,

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:38.750
and you'll only find them
in this region of Thailand,

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.680
and they're truly spectacular.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.230
It's something you have to eat.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.940
And the actual mix of this
dish is called pad cha.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:51.989
That mix of herbs and ingredients.

00:12:51.989 --> 00:12:53.070
Mmm.

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:54.590
Mm-hmm.

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:56.050
Oh, I got some green
peppercorns in that bite.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.913
It's so good, it's so good.

00:12:57.913 --> 00:13:00.690
But that krawan, that stands out.

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:02.513
And finally, let me grab a
little piece of bitter melon,

00:13:02.513 --> 00:13:05.413
raw bitter melon, and I'm going
straight for the nam prik.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.620
When it's raw, the bitter melon,

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.500
it's crunchy like the
cucumber, or even crunchier,

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.030
but with that sensation
of bitterness, and then,

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.137
contrasted with that salty shrimp paste.

00:13:21.137 --> 00:13:23.720
(upbeat music)

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.420
I'm loving that oil sauce too.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.807
We've come to the end of the meal.

00:13:33.807 --> 00:13:35.350
That was delicious.

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:39.193
I'm full, but I gotta have one
final bite of those noodles.

00:13:44.614 --> 00:13:45.570
Oh, man.

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:47.890
I mean, it's almost sweet like dessert.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:51.570
Well, that's why I wanted
it to be my final bite.

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:52.700
Those are like dessert noodles,

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:57.700
but the richness of that
coconut milk with the sourness

00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.700
and the texture of those noodles,

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.081
that's what makes it so good.

00:14:01.081 --> 00:14:03.664
(upbeat music)

00:14:09.852 --> 00:14:13.769
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.900
Oh, I'm in the ultimate
relaxed mood right now.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.770
And this, this community, it's so cool.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.080
This waterfront community.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.720
We're gonna walk around the community

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.240
for just a little while now,

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.123
but they were saying that
there was an event yesterday.

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:34.448
It was kind of like a county
fair, and so it just finished,

00:14:34.448 --> 00:14:37.860
and so a lot of the community that

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.750
normally would be selling
little snacks or things

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.280
are not doing that today because

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.575
they're resting from that event,

00:14:42.575 --> 00:14:44.470
so I don't know if
there'll be much going on,

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:47.270
but we gotta just at least
take a look at the bridge again

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:49.500
and kind of walk through the community,

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.613
slowly.
(upbeat music)

00:14:57.742 --> 00:14:59.774
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:59.774 --> 00:15:02.203
(motor humming)

00:15:02.203 --> 00:15:05.188
(upbeat music)

00:15:05.188 --> 00:15:09.345
(motorboat motor humming)
(birds chirping)

00:15:09.345 --> 00:15:13.262
(speaking in foreign language)

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:18.260
There's not too much
going on in the village,

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.402
but it's so relaxing and
it's so peaceful like this.

00:15:20.402 --> 00:15:23.604
But, there is an Auntie who
is slicing up pineapple,

00:15:23.604 --> 00:15:26.090
pineapple from her garden,

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:30.410
and you can actually
smell the sweet juiciness.

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.136
You can smell it while
standing up and looking at it.

00:15:33.136 --> 00:15:36.636
(motorbike motor humming)

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:40.503
Oh, mmm.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.256
That's extraordinary pineapple.

00:15:44.256 --> 00:15:45.253
Oh!

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:47.810
Oh, it's not mushy.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:51.000
It's so sweet with a hint of tartness.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.040
It's not stringy, it's silky smooth.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.690
That's like, a perfect pineapple.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:15:58.463
Yeah.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.201
That is how pineapple should taste.

00:16:01.201 --> 00:16:03.784
(upbeat music)

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.373
Definitely one of the highlights
of visiting Ban Nam Chiao

00:16:11.373 --> 00:16:13.150
is that arch bridge.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:13.983
It's impressive.

00:16:13.983 --> 00:16:18.300
I mean, the arch shape, the
wooden planks that feel like

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.750
they might break at any
moment beneath your feet,

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:24.673
the low railing, you just
gotta love that bridge.

00:16:24.673 --> 00:16:28.440
The ricketiness of it, it's
just oozing with character.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.280
We're moving on out of the village,

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.771
and I didn't mention this to you

00:16:31.771 --> 00:16:34.090
at the beginning of the day,

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.660
but we're actually on our
way to Koh Chang today,

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:37.810
which is the island,

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:41.160
one of the main popular islands
right off the coast of Trat.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.260
Well, it's in Trat province,
and that's the plan for today.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.610
We're going to Koh Chang, and
you can actually drive there

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:49.450
and you can take the ferry with your car.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:51.388
Actually, this entire halal cooking

00:16:51.388 --> 00:16:55.150
and visiting Ban Nam Chiao is
just kind of an extra thing

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:56.820
that I thought about, and I was like,

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.560
we have to come here before we leave.

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.530
And so, I'm glad I worked out.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.406
This was fantastic, I
thoroughly enjoyed it.

00:17:02.406 --> 00:17:06.650
(stammering) if you
have some time in Trat,

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.683
definitely, come hang
out at Ban Nam Chiao.

00:17:09.683 --> 00:17:12.266
(upbeat music)

00:17:15.746 --> 00:17:19.016
(car door slamming shut)

00:17:19.016 --> 00:17:20.911
(motorbike motor humming)

00:17:20.911 --> 00:17:23.494
(upbeat music)

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.892
- [Siri] Your destination
will be on the right.

00:17:26.892 --> 00:17:27.880
- Just about a 30-minute drive.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.769
We have arrived to the
Koh Chang ferry pier.

00:17:30.769 --> 00:17:34.686
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:37.812 --> 00:17:40.480
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.790
They charge you by the car,
and then by the person.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:45.423
Our total bill, was that 270 bhat?

00:17:45.423 --> 00:17:48.300
- 280.
- 280, our total bill was 280,

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.160
and now we're lining up.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.300
It doesn't look too busy today.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.530
Think we're gonna get...

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.594
Either get right on, or
wait for the next ferry.

00:17:53.594 --> 00:17:56.177
(upbeat music)

00:17:59.393 --> 00:18:00.821
(key twisting)

00:18:00.821 --> 00:18:02.390
Ah!

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.800
I can feel the sea breeze.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.350
This is gonna be my first time, actually,

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:07.610
to ever visit Koh Chang,

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.850
and it's one of the most
popular islands in Thailand.

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.210
We're gonna do some relaxing
and some touring around,

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:14.570
and it's cool that we're
gonna be able to have

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:16.363
the car on the island.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.133
This is the main upstairs
level, have plenty of seats.

00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:23.716
(upbeat music)

00:18:35.783 --> 00:18:37.424
That was about a 30-minute ride.

00:18:37.424 --> 00:18:39.925
Welcome to Koh Chang.

00:18:39.925 --> 00:18:42.508
(upbeat music)

00:19:03.362 --> 00:19:07.110
(speaking in foreign language)

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:10.710
Oh, check out our elephant
towels. (chuckles)

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:12.923
Koh Chang means elephant island.

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.955
It's pretty cool, Michael loves it.

00:19:16.955 --> 00:19:17.895
(door softly closing)

00:19:17.895 --> 00:19:20.750
I think it was actually
about a 30-minute drive

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.770
from the ferry to get here,

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:25.580
but Koh Chang has really windy roads,

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.010
so you gotta wind around the mountain,

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:30.450
and you gotta make sharp turns,
but it's great to be here,

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:33.300
and I'm gonna end the
video for today right now.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.420
We just plan to get a little...

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.280
just kind of walk around
today for the rest of the day,

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.080
but mainly, today was all
about visiting Ban Nam Chiao,

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.400
and then tomorrow, we'll
go on a tour of Koh Chang.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.540
We're gonna visit some
of the famous sites,

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.800
and also eat some
delicious food, hopefully.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.800
But that will be on the
next video upcoming.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.990
So, thank you very much

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.010

Goodbye from Koh Chang.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:03.853
