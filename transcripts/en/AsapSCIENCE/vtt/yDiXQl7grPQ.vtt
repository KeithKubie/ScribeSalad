00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.640
Do you hear YANNY?

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.780
Or LAUREL?

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.940
A recent Twitter poll found, that 47% of people hear "YANNY", while 53% hear "LAUREL"

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.900
Clearly this has created an internet argument that is dividing the nation

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.940
So what is the science behind the madness?

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.300
One of the first aspects is PRIMING

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.860
If you were to play this clip without providing the option of "YANNY" or "LAUREL,"

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.220
you may have heard neither of these words,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.420
But by reading them, you're primed to hear one or the other.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.620
Secondly when you speak you are producing sound waves, which propagate through the air

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.140
This is a visual depiction of the sound waves of the original YANNY/LAUREL recording

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.480
created by Brad Story, a Professor of Speech, Language, and Hearing

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.280
Here is the depiction of him saying "LAUREL"

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.360
You can see that the acoustic features are very similar

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.240
Here is a depiction of him saying "YANNY"

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.700
The acoustic features are also similar

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.420
So the words "YANNY" and "LAUREL" audibly are more similar than you might think

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.720
Whether you're listening on a laptop, phone or headphones

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.860
will influence what you hear based on sound quality

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.220
But what if you were listening through the same device but you hear different things with someone next to you?

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.840
It might have to do with the age of your ears

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.920
The sounds in "YANNY" play at a higher frequency than the sounds in "LAUREL"

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.600
As we age, our ears are less able to hear higher frequencies

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.220
So if you are hearing "YANNY", you might have younger ears

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.800
Luckily with the help of the internet, we can hear both

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.340
Brilliant twitter user @xxv posted audio of the pitch brought both down and up

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.760
When you listen to it brought down 30%, you will hear "YANNY"

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.500
"YANNY" (played twice)

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.460
But when you listen to it with the pitch brought up 30%, you will likely hear "LAUREL"

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.540
"LAUREL" (played twice)

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:03.640
Your brain has so much stimulus at all times that it uses existing information and precise neurological pathways to focus its attention

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.280
This is why at a loud party you can listen to your friend beside you

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.920
but pop your attention into another convo if need be

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.600
Similarly, your brain is unconsciously choosing which frequencies in the recording to pay attention to so

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.780
So... What is the final answer?

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.660
If you heard "LAUREL", you are correct! The original recording is saying LAUREL

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.260
but with higher frequencies overlaid, creating ambiguity

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.060
**Love learning about amazing and interesting things in the world?

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.640
We actually just started a brand new podcast called "SIDENOTE"

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.300
where we explore the things that are stumping us or making us curious in life

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.260
and then insert all the mind-blowing science behind it

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.220
We'd love for you to check it out on iTunes or whichever podcast app you use

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.540
Your support means a ton to us as we slowly journey into exploring more science in a new medium

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.500
Again it's called SIDENOTE and it's brand new, so we're excited to know what you think

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.800
We'll leave some links below

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.800
