ANGELA LIN: Welcome to our
third episode of Women

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.590
Techmakers Give Back with
Codecademy's Sasha Laundy.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.640
My name's Angela Lin,
and I work on the

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.150
YouTube Education Team.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.300
I work with partners like TED,
Khan Academy, and edX to

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.950
ensure that anybody can learn
anything through YouTube.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.830
Prior to Google, I worked
in entertainment.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.520
I started my career
off at NBC.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.450
If any of you have watched "30
Rock", you can think about

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.330
Kenneth the Page.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.650
I was a page at NBC.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.370
Google's not just about
work, work, work.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.150
I also love to dance and try out
all the good eats around

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.110
San Francisco.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.200
With that, I'll hand it to my
co-host Bridgette Sexton.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.390
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Thank you.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.160
I'm Bridgette Sexton.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.340
I'm on the Google for
Entrepreneurs Team.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.320
My team focuses on how Google
can foster entrepreneurship

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.340
around the world.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.490
We do this through a number of
things, partnerships with

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.390
groups like Startup Weekend, our
own programs, where we do

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.400
educational outreach and
actually help try to figure

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.990
out where entrepreneurs can fill
some white spaces and do

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.910
awesome things on the
web and mobile.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.090
And we also look at our
products, how our products can

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.070
actually help entrepreneurs
grow their business.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.320
Before this, I actually worked
on the Google Africa Team for

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.670
two years, based out of Ghana
and some out of Kenya as well.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.930
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.340
Google [? four ?]

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.820
[? five ?].

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.850
Before that, I just enjoyed
a lot of traveling.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.390
And I also do some things out
of work, running, mainly,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.700
running to work, biking to work,
and a lot of cooking.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.050
But I have been fortunate to
just be surrounded by awesome

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.740
people here and impressive
women.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.200
Today, we're actually
joined by one of

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.980
those impressive women.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.340
Sasha Laundy, who was the fourth
employee at Codecademy.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.130
And Sasha, would you mind
introducing yourself?

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.850
SASHA LAUNDY: Sure.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.980
I'm really excited
to be here today.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.750
This is a really cool series
that you guys are doing.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.040
And I'm really honored
to be invited.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.330
I currently work at Codecademy
in New York.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.000
And I was the fourth
employee there.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.790
We've doubled in size since I
started back in February.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.645
And before that, I lived in San
Francisco and enjoyed all

00:02:31.645 --> 00:02:33.330
the good eats around
San Francisco.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.820
And I worked at Twilio, which
is a telephony API based in

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.970
downtown San Francisco.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.900
Before that, I was developer
intern at this really tiny

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.180
gaming startup, pre-funding,
a very different

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.520
experience than Twilio.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.080
Before that, I was a high
school teacher.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.140
I taught physics and
neuroscience at high schools

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.550
in Connecticut and
San Francisco.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.180
And so I did a big switch into
tech, while I was here.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.430
It sort of was in the water
in San Francisco, I think.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.020
And I'd be happy to talk
about all that today.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.630
So I'm looking forward
to chatting.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.340
ANGELA LIN: Well, you have
a fascinating background.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.310
And we will get into it.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.100
But first of all, why don't you
tell us a little bit about

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.300
Codecademy.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.450
What types of coding
lessons do you use?

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.250
I spent some time on
the site, actually.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.950
Admittedly got a little bit
hooked, myself, with one of

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:13.380
the courses.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.755
I think that's one of the
things you mean to do.

00:03:15.755 --> 00:03:16.110
SASHA LAUNDY: Yeah.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.540
ANGELA LIN: So tell us a little
bit about your target

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.210
market and what you
guys are up to.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.630
SASHA LAUNDY: Sure.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.800
Absolutely.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.840
If you've taken a look at our
website-- now might be a good

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.180
time to do that--

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.110
we offer interactive programming
lessons in HTML,

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.290
CSS, JavaScript, Python,
and Ruby.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.350
And our aim is to get people
hooked on programming.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.750
I think it's really important
that programming is seen as

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.100
something that's interesting
and can solve real problems

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.520
for people.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.710
Because otherwise, young
people won't get

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:40.640
interested in it.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.270
And we've got a big shortage
in developers right now.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.980
So with our interactive lessons,
you're able to--

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.880
we don't make you do any
installation or downloads or

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.260
configuration, which can take a
really long time and really

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.280
isn't very fun.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.480
The fun part is the coding.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.740
So we let you get started
on that right away.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.490
So there's a console on the
front page of our website that

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.870
asks you to type in your name.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.360
And you start using strings
right away.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.230
So you just get going coding.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.580
And we make sure that the
lessons on our site are

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.800
interactive, so you can
actually learn by

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.510
doing, learn by coding.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.490
Instead of having to pick up
a book and read hundreds of

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.740
pages, you can just get
started right away.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.269
We also make sure that the
projects we have people doing

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.890
are really practical.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.810
So instead of doing sort of an
esoteric math problem-- and

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.370
don't get me wrong, I
love math problems,

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.720
definitely love math.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.230
But not everyone does.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.680
And so we make sure that the
projects that people do are

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.580
really practical.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.810
And so they feel like they could
pick this up and use it

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.670
in whatever job they have to
become more effective and

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.360
maybe do things faster
or more powerfully

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.785
than they could before.

00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:45.740
BRIDGETTE SEXTON:
That's awesome.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.970
How many users do you
guys have currently?

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.037
SASHA LAUNDY: We have
millions of users.

00:04:50.037 --> 00:04:51.200
BRIDGETTE SEXTON:
That's awesome.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.170
And how has the teaching of code
evolved over time, from

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.280
10 years ago, 20 years
ago, to what you guys

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.940
are teaching today?

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.190
And how are you seeing that
encouraging more?

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.340
SASHA LAUNDY: That's
a great question.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.240
I wasn't learning programming
20 years ago.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.590
But we have this rise of
interpreted languages that

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.840
abstract away some of the really
difficult parts about

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.180
programming, like memory
management

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.490
and things like that.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.660
And so there are languages like
Python, which are great

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.310
to learn programming with
because They get rid of a lot

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.350
of the syntax that can really
trip up beginners and help

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.280
them really focus
on the concepts.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.960
We're also able to put these
lessons online, which we

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.000
weren't able to do before.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.730
But now we've got this pretty
massive web application that

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:38.200
lets you emulate all
these programming

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.450
languages in the browser.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.751
We can host these sorts of
lessons online in a way that

00:05:44.751 --> 00:05:46.620
we couldn't do 10
or 20 years ago.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.970
So the advances in technology
and the internet are making it

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.680
a lot easier to teach
people in new ways.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.940
So instead of the book and then
computer combination,

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.330
we've merged the two.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.810
So the instruction and the
actual practice and learning

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.790
happen in the same console.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.240
ANGELA LIN: So it seems like you
have a really innovative

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.925
course creator, where, like
you're saying, anybody can

00:06:06.925 --> 00:06:09.620
actually teach a course and
put a course together.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.470
Tell us a little bit more about
that and if you have a

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.390
favorite course that you've
created, that

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:15.770
we should be taking.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.100
SASHA LAUNDY: Sure.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.900
As you say, we've got a
course creator tool.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.920
So anyone out there who's
interested in teaching the

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.470
world how to code can pick it
up and create a lesson that

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.130
looks just like the ones that
we have on our site.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.610
And we've got this system
to help you.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.550
We've got feedback at every
step of the way.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.350
And we've got a few thousand
beta testers who are like

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.080
champing at the bit to get
access to the newest courses

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.710
and test out those courses and
get the bugs out before they

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.070
launch to the mainstream.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.870
So we help you, basically,
learn this new format.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.330
And there are some really
talented people who are great

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.320
at programming, great at
explaining, and this lets them

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.550
reach a huge audience.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.510
Because we've got users in more
than 100 countries, and a

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.710
huge range of people
taking our lessons.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.110
So I'd love to see what you'd
come up with there.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.475
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: I saw you guys
were offering kits for

00:07:02.475 --> 00:07:04.040
after-school classes now.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.580
How is that going?

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.650
SASHA LAUNDY: It's going
really well.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.540
And let me tell you a little
bit about why we did that,

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.550
because I think it's important
to understand that.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.620
Particularly for the sorts of
people who are watching this,

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.820
it's important to understand
what's happening with the

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.680
kids, especially in
the US right now.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.640
We've actually seen a decline
in the number of computer

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.650
science courses, both AP level
and entry level that are

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:26.550
offered in the US.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.040
And teachers are less and less
prepared to teach those

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.700
classes which is a problem,
because the internet is not

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.560
going away any time soon.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.740
Technology is here to stay.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:35.780
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: We hope not.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.760
We hope the internet is not
going away any time soon.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.880
SASHA LAUNDY: And Google is
doing a great job in helping

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.780
it become here to stay and
keeping it useful and huge and

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.640
interesting.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.530
So technology's not
going away.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.360
And it's becoming increasingly
important that people

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.950
understand how technology works
when they use it-- that

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.290
they're not just consuming the
technology, but they have some

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.370
understanding of how
it was made.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.580
And this is impacting field
after field after field.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.390
You've seen what's happened
to the music industry in

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.800
the last few years.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.700
It's going to revolutionize
pretty much every industry

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.860
that we have.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.870
And so to become relevant and
valuable in this modern

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.980
society, you have to understand
technology and

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.060
really understand how things
are put together.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.790
Because if you don't, it's very
easy for people who have

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.110
that power and have that
understanding to take

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:26.100
advantage of you and get ahead
in a way that you can't.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.975
So schools.

00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:28.930
Estonia.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.940
Have you heard of this
Estonia news?

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:31.980
It's pretty interesting.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.870
Estonia recently announced that
they're going to teach

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.039
every first grader
how to program.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:40.409
Every first grader is going to
know how to program computers,

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:41.630
which is really interesting.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.039
So Estonia is figuring
this out.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:45.540
And they're like, OK, we have
to get ahead of this trend.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.020
We have to prepare our students
for this modern

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:51.020
world, this brave new world.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.830
And they're taking the
appropriate steps.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.220
But the US is actually cutting
computer science classes.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.340
So we've talked to a lot of
passionate teachers who

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.470
understand that this is a
problem, and they know they

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.540
need to prepare their
students.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.620
And so we, basically, instead of
having them wait a year to

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.620
get trained and maybe wait
another year for their school

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.020
district to add in the computer
science classes, what

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.220
we've done is we made
a computer science

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:15.425
kit club in a box.

00:09:15.425 --> 00:09:16.980
So they can pick this up.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.650
They have all the lessons,
all the curriculum.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.440
We even made like photocopyable
posters, with

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.012
cute robots on them.

00:09:22.012 --> 00:09:24.430
So they photocopy them and put
them around their school

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.040
announcing their club.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.130
Some stickers, because everyone
loves stickers.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.750
And we've made this free for
anyone who signed up.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.030
And we put it up on the web.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.400
We didn't really know how many
people would be interested.

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.910
We made 250 kits and
hoped for the best.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.480
I think we had 2,000 schools
sign up in the first month and

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.390
a half, which blew us away.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.140
So there's clearly a ton
of demand for this.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.210
And this isn't just in the US.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.700
It's all over the
world as well.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.970
But with these kits, teachers
can pick this up, get started

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.360
today, even if they don't know
how to program, which is

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.900
crucial, because since the
students get feedback on our

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.460
website, they don't need to know
how to program, because

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.370
they don't need to be grading
kids homework or

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.090
anything like that.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:06.270
All of the backup support they
need is in the forums or in

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.540
the tool itself.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.150
And it's just a really
useful tool.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.990
So we've been hearing lots of
stories and getting cute

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.510
pictures from teachers who are
using this to teach kids how

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.500
to program.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.220
A lot of really adorable games
have been emailed into us.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.650
Even a few programming jokes,
which always makes our day.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.380
And so we can't wait to see what
people do with it in the

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.420
spring semester.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.080
ANGELA LIN: Are you thinking
about doing some sort of

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.030
hackathon to encourage these
students to compete, maybe,

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.150
internationally?

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:31.920
SASHA LAUNDY: That's
a great idea.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.940
We haven't set that up yet.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.770
But we've been supporting a few
people who are interested

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.140
in putting together hackathons
that are

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.630
more focused on beginners.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.320
So they're starting to see
hackathons, instead of a

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.800
competition, where you go and
you already have skills, as a

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.570
way of acquiring those skills
and meeting new people and

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:49.350
learning new things.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.280
And so it's interesting seeing
how the definition of a

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.010
hackathon is being broadened.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.910
And we're able to support people
in that, because we

00:10:56.910 --> 00:11:01.060
have these lessons that people
can use and teach their folks

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.140
in the hackathons
how to program.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.152
ANGELA LIN: That's
really neat.

00:11:03.152 --> 00:11:03.554
SASHA LAUNDY: Thanks.

00:11:03.554 --> 00:11:05.800
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: How have you
seen the kids who go through

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.590
this program, and also other
people in your courseware use

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.660
that and apply it in their own
lives and create technologies?

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:12.650
SASHA LAUNDY: That's
a great question.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:13.880
We've seen a few different
things.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.150
We've seen people who actually
make the switch from some

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.390
other career to programmer.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.350
So they become professional
developers,

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:22.700
which is really cool.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.520
They start with us and
generally add on more

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:24.980
information.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.600
Because, right now, our
curriculum is really focused

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.640
on beginners.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.190
And we've also seen people pick
this up and add skills to

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.180
their own skill set in their
own field, without becoming

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:36.600
professional developers.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.800
There have been a few groups
that are particularly

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.440
interested in this.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.580
Librarians are very much ahead
of the curve there.

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.860
Journalists and scientists are
also some other groups that

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.490
we'd seen form their own study
groups and apply their

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.240
learning to their own fields.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.450
And there are also two
individuals, two

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:51.310
stories I can tell you.

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:55.290
One is this guy who took our
JavaScript lessons and managed

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.260
to put together an app
that's a workout app.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:59.065
It picks a random
workout for you.

00:11:59.065 --> 00:12:01.600
He based it on our dice game
lesson, which is early in our

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.910
JavaScript track.

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.700
And he put on the app store and
got 100,000 downloads in

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.050
the first few weeks it was up,
which was pretty cool.

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.510
So technology lets you reach
more people than you ever

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.080
could before.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.380
It let's you reach people who
aren't near you, aren't in

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.860
your field.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.570
And so that's another reason
why it's so important to

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.830
understand technology and be
able to create it, not just

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:20.250
consume it.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:22.710
And one other story, which is
this woman named Martha who is

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.730
an 18-year-old in Kenya.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:27.200
And she got an internship and
managed to get a hold of a

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.380
laptop and the internet
for the first time.

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.580
And she found our
lessons and got

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.520
hooked on the Ruby lessons.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.600
So she quit her internship,
saved up enough to buy a

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.580
laptop, and is now working as
a Ruby on Rails apprentice

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.550
developer in Kenya.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.600
And so she's been helping us
out with, actually, some of

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.910
our code on the site, which
is pretty cool.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.040
So we hope to hear many more
stories like that.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.460
And if you've got one, please
share it with us.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:52.110
We'd love to hear it.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.540
ANGELA LIN: So right now, I'm
just curious, the lessons are

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.450
very interactive.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:59.460
And it's basically more
focused on text.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.670
And I have to ask the YouTube
question, because I'm asking

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.120
from YouTube point of view.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.040
Are you guys thinking about
incorporating video, at any

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.520
point, into the product?

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:08.070
SASHA LAUNDY: We
would love to.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.180
I think there's a
role for video.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.380
Just watching videos,
I think, is a step

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:14.160
in the right direction.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.840
But combining it with video plus
being able to interact

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.310
with the material could
be really cool.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.780
So let's talk about
that afterwards.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.130
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: And also
besides having courses on the

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:27.280
web technologies, which is
awesome, do you have any plans

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.480
of moving more towards having
some mobile programming

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.430
classes, like potentially
Android?

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:32.320
SASHA LAUNDY: Android.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.070
We would love to.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:34.860
And to do Android, we'd
need Java, right?

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:35.790
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Yes.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:36.520
SASHA LAUNDY: We
would love to.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.720
The tricky part about putting
Java in the web is that it's

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.280
compiled language, right?

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.600
So that adds some technical
hurdles for us, in terms of

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.310
implementing it.

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:47.830
But we would love to.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.510
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: We had an
emulator at one point.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.480
We still do.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.192
So maybe that's a potential way
that you could write it.

00:13:53.192 --> 00:13:55.280
SASHA LAUNDY: OK, let's talk
about this [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.740
It's certainly very requested.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.160
Lots of people are writing
and asking for Java

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.090
and asking for Android.

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.340
ANGELA LIN: So Sasha,
you gave us a

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.490
brief bio in the beginning.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:05.290
You sound like you have a really
interesting background.

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.820
Tell us a little bit more about
what got you into tech.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.770
Maybe even when you
were a teacher--

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:14.840
are there things that
Codecademy's enabling now that

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.590
you feel like, if only I had
this tool when I was teaching?

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:18.910
SASHA LAUNDY: That's
a great question.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:24.320
Yeah, I think my story is a
good example of why I'm so

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.190
passionate about what Codecademy
is doing and why I

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.490
made the leap to move to New
York and work for this company

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:31.980
when it was so tiny.

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:34.570
Someone, I still, to this day,
don't know who, added

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:36.460
programming to my sophomore
year of high

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.200
school course schedule.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.990
And I was like, OK, why not.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:41.390
I don't know what this C++ is.

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.420
But I took this class.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.430
It was in C++.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:45.150
And I really enjoyed
writing programs.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.180
I got really into it.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.510
It was like solving a puzzle.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.020
But the projects we did
were so boring.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.540
It was like formatting
a receipt from

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:53.440
your restaurant bill--

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.880
that I was just like, why would
I do this when I could

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:56.670
do physics?

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.680
And so I went off and I studied
physics and I ended up

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.950
majoring in physics at
Swarthmore College.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.640
And that was great.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.610
But as I got to know people
who were in the computer

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:07.140
science program there-- and
there's a great computer

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.010
science program there--

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:11.160
I got to see that they were
doing really interesting work

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.435
and solving really interesting
problems.

00:15:12.435 --> 00:15:15.590
And I took a computer vision
class, where we had to try to

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:18.370
identify faces, just based on
the pixels, and write an

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:19.800
algorithm that found
your eyes.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.670
That's one project we did.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.130
And it was only at that point
that I figured out cool

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:25.940
programming was.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.870
And so I really wish that I'd
had a much more engaging

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:33.020
experience that got me hooked
much younger, because I would

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.230
be much farther along, in terms
of my own programming

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.690
skills, than I am now if I had
gotten started earlier.

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.650
So I'm really excited to get
lots of the new generation of

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.820
kids hooked on programming
really young.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.830
And so, yeah, that's why I think
it's so important to

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.100
make it fun at first.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:49.410
It doesn't have to be fun
the whole time, right?

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:51.030
There are frustrating
bits of it.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.390
But it's really important that
people's first impression of

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:57.770
programming is practical,
interesting, and engaging.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.220
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: You probably
never thought you'd be where

00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.800
you are, right now, today.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.170
SASHA LAUNDY: Nope.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.980
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: It's a pretty
awesome transition from

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:07.790
being a teacher into what
you're doing now.

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:11.140
We love scale at Google, so the
idea of scaling education.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.300
Especially YouTube is
huge into that.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.420
And I think that we look at
great content as being a key.

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.130
How do you guys keep
your content fresh?

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.510
How do you know what
to teach next?

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.870
Or are you really focused
on the basics?

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.210
SASHA LAUNDY: That's
a great question.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:28.020
And we're doing a combination of
refreshing and focusing on

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.580
the basics.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.020
When you get started, you have
to understand a certain number

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.830
of building blocks,
conceptually, in programming

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:37.930
to be able to build anything,
for loops, if...else

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:38.660
statements.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.360
Variables are a really tricky
concept for beginners.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.000
So we need people to learn some
of the basics before they

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.030
can do interesting stuff.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:47.490
So right now, we're
focusing on that.

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:49.140
But we're gradually expanding
it as well.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:49.970
So there are more and more--

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:52.250
we launched projects this past
week, so you can pick up what

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.880
you've learned and build
something cool with it.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:00.920
Sorry, tell me the second part
of your question again?

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.500
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Just staying
fresh, like staying up to

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.000
date, it's such a challenge.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:04.640
SASHA LAUNDY: Thank you.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.069
We do a lot of testing to make
sure that our lessons are

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.849
working for people.

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:09.990
So we have a lot of metrics.

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:11.450
We gather a lot of feedback.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:15.390
We make sure to refresh the
courses, so that they're as

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.550
high quality as possible, and
so that people stick around

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:18.680
and learn as long as possible.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.069
So we're doing a combination
of adding to our curriculum

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:22.940
and refreshing what we
already have as well.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.380
ANGELA LIN: When a new course
is created, is the vetting

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.470
done by the beta testers that
you were talking about?

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.590
Or is there someone on the
team that actually goes

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:30.600
through first?

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.320
SASHA LAUNDY: A combination.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.730
So when you pick up the course
creator tool, and you create a

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:37.280
course, we offer feedback
at a few stages.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.690
Someone from Codecademy
currently looks at your course

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:41.930
and gives you feedback on
it for the first stage.

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.610
And then once it's moved over
to beta testers, we've got

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:48.390
thousands of beta testers who
have signed up to test the

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:51.220
latest courses and give
some feedback on it.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.770
And so they do a great job of
finding any of those rough

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.540
spots, things that might not be
super clearly explained, or

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.760
any bugs in the submission
correctness test.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.510
And they find those and expose
those, before the course goes

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:04.500
out to everyone else, which
is super helpful.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.320
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: We actually
have a question, on our Dory

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.010
here, for what is the best
web languages to learn.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:14.810
This is from New Jersey.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:16.570
SASHA LAUNDY: I think I might
know who that is.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.890
It might be one of
our beta testers.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:20.200
What is the best language?

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:20.710
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Yes.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.620
What are the best languages
to learn.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.360
So this guy seems like
he's just getting

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:27.060
started with [? DOM ?].

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.350
Where should he start?

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:29.770
SASHA LAUNDY: That's
a great question.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:31.090
And I think that's one place--

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:34.260
I know, when I was starting, I
got totally overwhelmed by the

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.320
number of things.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.550
I was like, I have to learn HTML
and CSS and Python and

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.020
Django and Ruby and Rails.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:41.950
And like, oh, why not throw in
some [? Scene, ?] because

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:44.110
that'll teach you memory
management and fundamentals,

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.930
all the stuff I missed
because I wasn't a

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:47.560
computer science major.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.750
And I think it's really easy
to get overwhelmed.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:53.890
But picking one thing that's a
good fit for what you want to

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:56.210
do and just learning that
and like getting to

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:57.520
it, have a good time.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.270
It doesn't particularly matter
what you pick up, as long as

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.160
you pick it up and stay with
it until you learn the

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.620
fundamentals.

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:07.550
And when in doubt, I'm
a Python girl.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.870
Python's a great all purpose
programming language.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.360
It's pretty easy to pick up.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.480
It teaches you the same concepts
that you'll need for

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:14.280
other languages.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.560
So, when it doubt, Python.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.700
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: And
Google loves Python.

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:17.950
We love Python.

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:22.130
ANGELA LIN: I guess related to
the first question, we also

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:23.790
have one around the
best sequencing.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:28.420
So you wee talking about which
ones-- and Python.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.420
There's definitely tracks
that you can go down.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.570
Is there a recommended
sequence of tracks?

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:34.250
SASHA LAUNDY: Sure.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:35.640
You're referring to tracks
on our site?

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.060
ANGELA LIN: Mm hm.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.010
SASHA LAUNDY: Yeah.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.670
So if you take a look at our
site, we've got tracks that

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:40.440
guide you through.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.390
And that's another thing we
do, because we found that

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:43.810
beginners get super
overwhelmed.

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:45.200
And they don't know
where to start.

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.950
And so we've created these
tracks that make a really

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.820
linear path, just to
get them started.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.230
And we find that, once people go
through those tracks, they

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.870
can then understand the choices
they're making much

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:57.830
better and can make better
choices and feel less

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.150
overwhelmed by the choices
that they have.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:01.840
But in terms of going through
the tracks, if you're a

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.660
complete beginner, and you're a
little scared, that's fine.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:05.790
You're not alone.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:06.270
Trust me.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:09.020
We get emails from those
people all the time.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.240
But I recommend starting with
what we call the web track,

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.970
which is HTML and CSS.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:14.530
You'll make a first web page.

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:15.900
It's not technically
programming.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.880
Lots of people would say, hey,
that's not programming.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.480
But it does get you familiar
with a tool.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.720
It gets you understanding that
the thing you write and the

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.300
final product are two
different things.

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.740
And you can make a
cool web page.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.640
And then you can learn
JavaScript, which lets you

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.810
make that web page interactive
and do cool stuff.

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.180
ANGELA LIN: I'm writing
that down.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.190
SASHA LAUNDY: So web track
first if you're nervous.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.000
If you've done some programming
or already made

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.690
websites before, I'd recommend
starting with Python, Ruby, or

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.100
JavaScript.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.370
Oh, and we have a new jQuery
track, which is really cool.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:49.720
Because jQuery is a library
of JavaScript.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.490
So there's all this pre-written
code, all over the

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:53.310
internet, that you can use.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.160
So you don't have to write as
much, but you can do really

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.840
impressive stuff, like fade in,
fade out, like sliding,

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.260
accordion web pages and
stuff like that.

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.920
So that's actually a pretty
fun and flashy way to get

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.240
started if you want to
impress your friends.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.350
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: What are some
of the favorite things

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:09.110
that you've built using
your skills?

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:14.150
Especially transitioning from
neuroscience into coding,

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:15.700
probably bringing some of that
background with you.

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.660
But even just some fun, flashy
website, what are the things

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:20.370
that you've created that you
are proud of, that you've

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.430
enjoyed, that have been fun?

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:24.180
SASHA LAUNDY: And I haven't
managed to work my

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.780
neuroscience skills
into this yet.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.440
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: I was
imagining some digital

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.150
encyclopedia of awesome
neuroscience--

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.030
SASHA LAUNDY: Ah, I'd
love to do that.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.830
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: --tips.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:34.480
SASHA LAUNDY: Unfortunately, I
haven't figured out how to do

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.560
that yet, how to combine
the two yet.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.290
But I'll think about it.

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:41.020
I think one thing that having
technical skills and knowing

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.030
how to program has really
helped me do a lot of

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:46.320
different things in all these
different roles I've had in

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.540
the tech world.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.840
Here at Codecademy, it helps
me understand how hard

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.590
programming languages are both
to implement, for our

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:55.070
engineering team, and for
how hard it is for

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.000
people to learn them.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.820
Because I've learned enough of
them to understand where the

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.730
stumbling blocks are and what
might be an appropriate choice

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:03.780
for a beginner.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:06.720
And it also allows
me to fix things.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.860
We're a really small team.

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.280
We're 12 people now.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.890
And so when there's a bug that's
maybe noncritical but

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:13.910
interfering with people's
learning, I can pick it up and

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:16.980
fix it in our code base and push
a fix that our engineers

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:17.450
can deploy.

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:20.490
So it saves them some time, gets
more done for our users,

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:21.750
and is a hugely useful skill.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:23.770
I'd highly recommend learning
how to program, especially if

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:26.810
you're interested in
the tech world.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:28.905
ANGELA LIN: Tell us
a little bit--

00:22:28.905 --> 00:22:30.620
you founded Women
Who Code, right?

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:31.140
SASHA LAUNDY: Yeah.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:32.470
ANGELA LIN: Tell us a little
bit about that.

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.480
SASHA LAUNDY: Sure.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:35.930
So when I was living in San
Francisco, and I was making

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:37.970
the switch over and learning
as much programming as

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:41.300
possible, I found that it's
somewhat challenging to be a

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.270
woman in the tech community,
especially in the technical

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:48.230
community, because there's
so few women there.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:51.430
And sometimes people would
assume I was a recruiter at

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:54.110
events or what have you.

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:57.100
And so I really just wanted a
place to be where I could talk

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.810
to other technical women, get
to know them, and just talk

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:00.900
about code.

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.120
And so I put this meetup
on the calendar.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.560
This was, I think,
August, 2010--

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:08.150
2011.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:09.990
Sorry, blanking on the date--

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:11.160
just over a year ago.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.700
And I was like, man, I hope 10
people show up and code with

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.990
me, because I'm going to
feel really silly if

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.510
no one shows up.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:18.980
And 100 people signed up
for the first event.

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.730
So I was blown away
by the interest.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:24.440
Basically, the organization
hosts hack-nights and tech

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.350
talks for women in program.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.650
They can be beginners or
professional developers, but

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:30.600
we come and sit in the same
room and share what we're

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:33.200
working on and help each other
and get to know each other.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.800
And so seeing some of the
connections that have come out

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.780
of that have been really cool.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:36.980
People have gotten hired.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.390
They've found mentors
and mentees.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.700
They've found friends.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.120
I know I hired someone
I met through that.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:43.570
So that's pretty cool.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:46.220
And it's really taken off.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:50.660
There are chapters starting up
in Denver, Arkansas, LA, as

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:54.570
well as, maybe, one in Canada,
coming soon, to be TBD.

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:56.590
And there's a Silicon Valley
branch as well.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.930
So it's nearby if you guys
want to check it out.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:01.350
And we recently hit 2,000 women,
which is pretty cool,

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:05.100
for something that's spreading
by word of mouth on Twitter

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:05.800
and Meetup.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.250
And it's really providing a safe
space for women who want

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:11.750
to meet other women and know
that they're out there.

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:14.000
ANGELA LIN: And what about
inspiring young women who may

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.160
not be in the professional world
yet, but who aspire to--

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.206
or you want to get them
interested in coding and the

00:24:22.206 --> 00:24:22.880
tech world?

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.580
SASHA LAUNDY: It's really
important, because, again, to

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.590
be honest, I think programming,
as a profession,

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:31.950
as a field, as a passion, has
a huge marketing problem.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:35.990
It's seen as something that's
only for really geeky white

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.240
guys in a basement
like typing away.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.700
But it's so much more broad
and interesting than that.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.100
And I think it's really
important to get young people

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.600
interested, especially young
women, just because, for some

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.510
reason, we're not telling
the right story

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:49.140
to them at the moment.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.880
And there are a lot of
organizations that are

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:52.120
interested in doing that.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.860
Women Who Code is focused on
professional developers.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.240
But there are all
sorts of camps.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.180
There's one called Black Girls
Code that runs workshops.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:03.350
There's Girls Who Code
out in New York.

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:05.520
There are a ton of ways
to get involved.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.970
So if you're interested in
teaching high school kids,

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:11.210
even just call up your local
school and be like, hi, I'm a

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:12.200
professional developer.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.750
Is there a computer science
teacher who would be

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.380
interested in like maybe me
coming to speak one day or

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.050
helping out with programming
classes?

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.720
There are tons of people who
could use your expertise, so

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.853
just get in touch.

00:25:22.853 --> 00:25:23.680
BRIDGETTE SEXTON:
That's awesome.

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.895
Well, speaking of this, do you
have any role models yourself

00:25:25.895 --> 00:25:29.420
that have kept you going in
life, like people that you

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.406
aspire to be like or even
mentors along the way that

00:25:32.406 --> 00:25:33.030
have helped you?

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:34.310
SASHA LAUNDY: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:39.220
And so many people who have
inspired me and helped me.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.780
I was thinking about this
question the other day.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.290
And I was remembering my
Halloween costume when I was

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:45.650
eight years old.

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:47.930
I handmade my own costume.

00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:49.180
I was Athena.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:49.910
I was really into mythology.

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:52.280
I went through a mythology
phase.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.570
ANGELA LIN: I think everyone
goes through that phase.

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:54.245
SASHA LAUNDY: Yeah.

00:25:54.245 --> 00:25:55.690
There's this D'Aulaires'
book with the

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.470
colored pencil drawings.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:58.720
It's beautiful.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.630
I apparently identified with
Athena enough to dress up as

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:04.510
her for Halloween.

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:06.540
And she's the Greek goddess
of knowledge.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.820
And she's a bit of a warrior.

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:11.350
So that was, I think, a good
role model for little Sasha

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:12.200
back in the day.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.210
But since then, there have been
so many professionals--

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.650
I wanted to be a scientist
for a really long time--

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:21.420
and people in tech who've
built amazing

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.560
things out of thin air.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.280
That's the thing I love most
about this community and

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:28.060
startups is that you take a
computer and a command line,

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.950
and you build this amazing
product that helps change

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:30.830
people's lives.

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:33.280
So I'm just really excited to
be part of this community.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:39.220
And maybe some other people will
follow me down this road.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.630
ANGELA LIN: What's something
that you have on the horizon

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:42.830
that you want to build?

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.850
Maybe you don't have all of the
skills yet to build it, or

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:49.070
it's just the time
or the energy.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:51.230
What's something that you've
always wanted to do?

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:56.990
SASHA LAUNDY: So I have this
list on my computer of the

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:58.860
things I should program.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:00.750
And it's really long.

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:02.170
Some of them are silly ones.

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:05.860
I've got some chat bots for--
we have this chat

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:06.930
program that we use.

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:08.470
And you can write little
programs in it.

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:09.910
And some of them are
silly like that.

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:12.780
Some of them are major features
on our website.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.920
And some are smaller tweaks.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.980
But knowing how to program
changes the way

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.300
you look at the world.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.880
So that when you know what you
can do with a skill set, you

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.250
start seeing things to
build everywhere.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:27.776
It's like goggles, like
Google Glass.

00:27:27.776 --> 00:27:30.015
And all of a sudden, you can see
all these things that you

00:27:30.015 --> 00:27:30.380
can change.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:31.846
So I have a very long list.

00:27:31.846 --> 00:27:32.302
BRIDGETTE SEXTON:
That's awesome.

00:27:32.302 --> 00:27:37.480
We another question from an
audience member, which is, do

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.670
you have a favorite
code editor?

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:42.300
And he says he's also a beta
tester for you guys.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.015
SASHA LAUNDY: Cool.

00:27:43.015 --> 00:27:43.590
That's awesome.

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:45.450
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: He's a fan.

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:47.310
SASHA LAUNDY: Thanks
for the question.

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:49.950
I really like Sublime Text 2.

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:51.100
It's really beautiful.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.010
It's a program that you can
open and start using right

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:55.480
away, so it's got a very low
barrier to entry, highly

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.010
recommended.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:00.260
I've also been learning Vim
recently, which I stopped--

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.870
this is very nerdy--

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:05.160
learning Vim just because
the keyboard shortcuts--

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.800
you have to use a lot of
keyboard shortcuts to use it.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.500
And I switched to the Dvorak
keyboard, when I was bored one

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.680
summer in college, and I've
never switched back.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.250
So it's really not
optimized for me.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.890
But now, I'm just
sort of like--

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.225
it lets you do so many things
so much faster that I'm

00:28:21.225 --> 00:28:22.030
picking it up anyway.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:25.130
So it depends on how much time
you want to spend learning

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:25.980
your text editor.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.480
If you don't, Sublime Text 2.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.390
If you want to invest
the time, Vim.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:32.500
ANGELA LIN: So you were talking
about, you switched

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.060
over to the-- you
were just bored?

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:35.455
SASHA LAUNDY: Yeah.

00:28:35.455 --> 00:28:37.460
In college, you've got
time in the summers.

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:40.920
And, apparently, I wanted
to type faster.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.470
And so I switched to Dvorak.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:44.520
And here I am, too lazy
to switch back.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.680
ANGELA LIN: Can you buy a
laptop with a Dvorak?

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.440
SASHA LAUNDY: You could.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.700
I just touch type.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.080
BRIDGETTE SEXTON:
That's great.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.030
SASHA LAUNDY: Yeah,
very nerdy.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:54.460
ANGELA LIN: Let's see,
another question.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.720
By the way, you guys should
send in questions, because

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.330
we're actively looking
at the Dory.

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:01.940
I'm in high school in
a data structures

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.040
course that uses Java.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:06.040
What languages should I learn
after Java, and what are

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.530
recommended future routes?

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:09.340
From John in New York.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.400
SASHA LAUNDY: That's
a great question.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.900
And I think it really depends
on what your goals are.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.170
If you want to learn the
fundamentals of computer

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.000
science, Java is
a great start.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.130
There's some others that are
particularly interesting.

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:22.910
You could check out a
functional language.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:25.380
I know Haskell is really
trendy in the hacker

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.770
community right now.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:28.850
If you're interested in more
going to web programming,

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:30.290
there are all these interpretive
languages that

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:30.870
you can learn.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:33.480
So it really depends on
what your goals are.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.970
Sorry I can't give a more
specific answer than that.

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:38.370
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: I actually
would like to go back a little

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:40.930
bit to the schools and talk
about, what do you think are

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:43.930
some of the things that
teachers, educators, people

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:48.080
can do to encourage more kids
to take that first leap into

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:48.600
programming?

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:52.300
Because I know it's a global
concern that we need more

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.050
programmers and developers,
both from a professional

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:57.340
level, but even just sort of
that knowledge base of people

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.875
understanding how code words,
how their computer works, and

00:30:00.875 --> 00:30:04.000
demystifying technology
in that sense.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.040
SASHA LAUNDY: Yeah, I think
that's a great question.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.170
How do we get more people
interested?

00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:12.420
I think it's important to see
how powerful it is and what

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.360
you can do with a little
bit of knowledge.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.650
Because there are only a small
subset of people that like

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:21.060
learning programming for its
own sake and think it's

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.990
inherently interesting.

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:25.560
For the vast majority of people,
they're interested in

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.770
what you can do with it.

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:29.110
So showing people what they can
do and showing people role

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:33.650
models that look like them are
both really important.

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:36.550
ANGELA LIN: And related to
that education question,

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:40.290
there's so much happening in the
ed tech space in general

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.600
right now, how do you
view Codecademy in

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:43.800
that broader landscape?

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:48.770
And have you made connections
with other people who have

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:50.860
that same mission to help
educate students

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:51.920
all over the world?

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.760
SASHA LAUNDY: Absolutely.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.660
There are a lot of people
who are interested in

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:55.850
this space right now.

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:57.390
And there are a lot of people
who are taking different

00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:59.370
approaches, a lot of new
companies who are taking

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:02.110
different approaches to
get to the same goal.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:03.540
There are some people who
are more video based.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.700
There are some that are starting
up in-person classes

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.250
or this hybrid model, where you
do some stuff in-person,

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:10.890
some stuff online.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.380
And then there's the approach
we're taking with an

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:14.130
interactive console.

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:16.400
So it's really interesting to
see which methods will be most

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.130
effective for which people.

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:21.090
So I'm really curious to see how
the next few years go in

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:21.550
this space.

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:24.120
Because there's so much energy
and excitement and venture

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.650
funding there right now, which
is a sign of where people's

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:28.750
attention is.

00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:30.220
ANGELA LIN: I think you hit
on a really good point.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.870
Different people learn
differently.

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:34.990
And so how do you address that
at Codecademy, in terms of

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.770
learning styles.

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:38.620
Some people are more visual,
other are more aural.

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:43.430
SASHA LAUNDY: I think the
research shows that the

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:45.320
learning style, in terms of
audio or visual, actually

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.570
doesn't make a huge
difference.

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:50.980
Because every person uses all
those styles at different

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.070
points and different times.

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.410
So I think it's really a
question of matching the skill

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:55.780
that you're learning to the
method in which you're

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.250
learning it.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:00.160
I wouldn't try to teach someone
to juggle by video on

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:00.820
the internet.

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.480
That's not going to
work-- or like

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.810
cartwheel or dance or whatever.

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:05.640
That's really challenging,
because the medium

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.120
doesn't fit the topic.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.400
But for programming, you
actually learn by doing

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:10.900
programming.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.130
You don't learn by reading.

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:14.060
If you think about it, you want
to learn how to write

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.470
programs, so you read a book.

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:17.000
That doesn't make sense.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:17.890
But if you want to learn how to

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:19.260
program, you should program.

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:24.130
And this gets you as close as
I've seen to melding the two.

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:25.980
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Now,
I think we have one

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:27.310
more question here.

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:31.790
Do you have any plans for
PHP or Java courses?

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:33.260
But I think you already
have them.

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:34.150
SASHA LAUNDY: We don't yet.

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:34.910
BRIDGETTE SEXTON:
Oh, you don't.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:36.780
SASHA LAUNDY: But those are
definitely some of the most

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:37.930
requested languages.

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:39.420
People really want
to learn PHP.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:40.700
They really want
to learn Java.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.720
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Do you
have a date coming out?

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.520
SASHA LAUNDY: I don't have a
specific date, but we are

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:44.780
working on it.

00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:45.312
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Do you
want to launch it,

00:32:45.312 --> 00:32:45.980
right here, right now?

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.120
SASHA LAUNDY: Yeah,
just a second.

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.430
ANGELA LIN: Put that on your
list of things to build.

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:51.120
SASHA LAUNDY: It's on there.

00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.280
Trust me.

00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.360
I'm sorry we don't
have it yet.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.610
We will soon.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.230
ANGELA LIN: Anything else that
you would like to share with

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:02.890
the audience at large.

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:05.680
SASHA LAUNDY: I think
there's a lot of the

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.940
conversation about--

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:10.660
and I'm saying this as a former
teacher, because I see

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.990
both sides of this argument.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:15.690
There are a lot of people who
say that, because all this

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:18.330
content is shifting to the web,
you can learn anything

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.830
you want in these MOOCs and
these video sites and on

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:24.540
Codecademy and all that, that
teachers, as a profession, are

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:27.030
going to be replaced, sort of
become out of date, or shift

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:29.380
to being computerized
in some way.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:30.710
And I think that's really,
fundamentally,

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:32.530
misunderstanding what
teaching is.

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:35.410
Teachers are a lot more than
content delivery robots.

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:39.090
They also get to know you and
push you when you're stuck and

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:43.080
reward you and coach you and
help you and cheer for you

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.530
when you're succeeding.

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:47.050
And they are able to
contextualize all those

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:49.900
generic resources that people
have-- the textbooks, the

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.400
video sites, whatever.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.860
They're able to contextualize
those and put them in a form

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.050
that works for the individual
learner.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:58.040
And that's something that
computers are never really

00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.920
going to get that good at.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.070
The content delivery part is
actually a great help to

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:05.940
teachers, in that they no longer
have to do that as part

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:06.560
of their jobs.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.949
They're able to be freed up to
spend more time, one-on-one,

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:11.569
with students, which is
really their strength.

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:17.500
I would love to see teachers
tell that story and that

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.739
narrative about this change,
so that they can gracefully

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:22.830
make that leap into
the next stages.

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:24.810
Because again, this technology
isn't going away.

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:25.500
It's here to stay.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.469
And it's going to change
and get better.

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:29.900
But teachers definitely have
a place in this world.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.588
And I think it's a really
interesting one.

00:34:32.588 --> 00:34:35.380
ANGELA LIN: Before we let you
go, we have another question

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.889
from the Dory, from Jim,
in North Carolina.

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:40.929
I'm currently making a career
change after being a

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:42.469
journalist for 10 years.

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:44.920
As someone who made the
transition smoothly, what kind

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.460
of advice would you give.

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:48.690
SASHA LAUNDY: That's
a great question.

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:51.110
The transition was super
interesting.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:52.909
I'd love to know actually what
he's transitioning to.

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:54.033
Did he mention that?

00:34:54.033 --> 00:34:55.090
ANGELA LIN: He did not say.

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:59.190
Jim, if you type in your answer
really quickly, maybe

00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.840
we can get to it.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.480
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Sounds like
a transition into at least

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.260
something in the tech space.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.710
SASHA LAUNDY: And I can tell
you, roughly, what I did to

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:07.030
make this transition.

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:09.220
A year before-- because in
teaching you have to give four

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.910
months notice when you
change fields, which

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:13.560
is a long lead time.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.570
So a year before I made the
switch, I started going to

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:17.400
meetups around--

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.190
I had the advantage of being in
the Bay Area, which has a

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:22.450
different meetup every night,
on whatever you want.

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:24.310
There's people here doing it.

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:26.220
And so I got to know people
in the industry.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:29.100
And I learned more about the
field to make sure I wasn't

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:32.010
crazy and that I would have
something to contribute.

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:34.930
And one really important thing
that I did is I built things,

00:35:34.930 --> 00:35:37.160
and I showed them,
so that people

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.485
knew that I was serious.

00:35:38.485 --> 00:35:40.060
I built programs and
showed them.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.240
I worked for free for a startup
for a while, building

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.240
their product alongside
the CTO.

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.810
I started Women Who Code.

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:49.280
People were very impressed by
that, because it's taken off

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.030
so quickly.

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:51.720
I built things to show
that I was serious.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.990
And they were things that were
free and weren't like years in

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.860
the making, but they were
showing that I was thinking

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.900
about the field in
the right way.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.810
So ask lots of questions, listen
hard, and build cool

00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:06.060
things, and take
it from there.

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.215
MALE SPEAKER: Sasha, there was
one question on YouTube that

00:36:08.215 --> 00:36:10.210
goes back to teaching.

00:36:10.210 --> 00:36:12.500
How can teachers who are in
the classroom now leverage

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.595
Codecademy with their
students?

00:36:14.595 --> 00:36:16.460
SASHA LAUNDY: That's also
a great question.

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:19.460
I think one thing that the
lessons really free teachers

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:22.960
up to do is to, again, spend
that one-on-one time with the

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:23.950
kids who need it.

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:26.630
So because the content and
because a lot of the feedback

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:28.660
is actually in the tool, and
teachers don't need to supply

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:31.050
that themselves, they can
spend a lot more time

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:33.310
one-on-one with individual kids
who might be struggling,

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:36.330
or kids who finish our
curriculum in five minutes and

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:39.470
need more stuff to do, which
has definitely happened.

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:42.720
So one model that a lot of
teachers are exploring right

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:46.290
now is the flipped classroom
where they do their reading--

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.630
and what they used to do in
class, the sort of knowledge

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:51.720
absorption step of read the
thing, get it into your brain.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:52.990
They do that at home.

00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:55.000
And when they come in, they work
on homework, they work on

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.080
problems, they write
little programs.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:59.750
And that's when the teacher's
input is actually most useful.

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:03.290
So having this content on the
internet, whenever, available

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:05.050
from wherever you want
is great because

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:05.710
they can do it home.

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:07.080
And then they can use the
classroom time more

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:07.570
effectively.

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.210
So that's one thing we've
been hearing a lot

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:09.990
of good things about.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:12.800
And we'd love to hear more
about how it's working.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.070
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Awesome.

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:14.940
Last good question.

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:19.290
Besides starting amazing
organizations and working t a

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:23.030
world class institution,
what do you do for fun?

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:25.510
What do you do outside
of work?

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:28.210
SASHA LAUNDY: What
do I do for fun?

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:30.790
That's a funny question.

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:32.760
I've been very focused on
Codecademy recently.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:34.530
But I'm pretty athletic.

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:36.060
We're actually a really
athletic office.

00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:39.210
By far the most athletic tech
company I've ever seen.

00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:44.160
We all go for runs, sometimes
together, and go to the gym.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.010
When I lived in San Francisco,
I did a lot of cycling.

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:47.900
That's a little bit harder to
do in New York, because the

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:53.200
roads are little more
interesting.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.000
But I really like sports.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:56.650
I love science.

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:57.790
I miss it a lot.

00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:58.620
I like writing.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:00.300
And I love cooking.

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.610
Don't get to do it
a lot anymore.

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:03.880
It's really hard to
do in New York.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.150
And I actually like knitting.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:07.210
And I see a lot of parallels
between knitting and

00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:08.530
programming.

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:11.540
So I can make pretty much
anything you want.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:12.720
It's a really esoteric skill.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.090
Helps keep my hands busy.

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:17.100
And I have lots of
scarves now.

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:17.700
BRIDGETTE SEXTON:
Yeah, I actually

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.040
started knitting in college.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.180
I ran track in college.

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.210
And I used to knit on the bus,
because there was nothing else

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:23.960
I could do.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.585
And it was hours and hours
and hours of it.

00:38:26.585 --> 00:38:27.950
SASHA LAUNDY: A good
use for it.

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:29.020
That's cool.

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:30.760
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Well, thank
you so much for joining us.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.270
We really appreciate you
taking the time.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:34.900
This has been a really
fun series.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.300
I think, globally, we've
realized how many amazing,

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.530
impressive women there
are out there.

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:41.880
Maybe there isn't a chance for
them to get exposed as often

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:42.680
as they should be.

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.080
And you're doing a great job
bringing that to light through

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:46.620
Women Who Code.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:47.950
So thank you so much.

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:48.640
SASHA LAUNDY: Thanks
for having me.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.870
This was a really cool series.

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:52.120
And I can't wait to see
what other great

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.130
people you have on here.

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:54.225
Thank you for having me.

00:38:54.225 --> 00:38:54.570
ANGELA LIN: Thanks
for being here.

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:55.910
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Viewers,
thank you for joining us.

00:38:55.910 --> 00:39:00.490
We have another session
tomorrow, with Kim Pelosi.

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:02.330
And it'll be here at 2:30.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:05.180
So please, come back
and join us again.

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.430
Thank you.
