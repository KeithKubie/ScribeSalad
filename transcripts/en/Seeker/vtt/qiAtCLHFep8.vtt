00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.830
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away
someone boldly went somewhere or something,

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:06.830
blah blah blah.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.850
But, the coolest part was this moon-thing
made all these lasers that came together to

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.150
make a superlaser!

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.210
Remember that??

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.859
Turns out real life scientists have come up
with a way to join smaller laser beams into

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.769
a super powerful laser thanks to the light
bending abilities of diamonds.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.310
But before we get into that, let’s start
with the basics of lasers real quick.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.289
Lasers are simply coordinated waves of light.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.950
If you could see the waves they’d all be
aligned, going the same direction.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.840
The technology was developed in the 1950s
with no real practical use at the time.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.771
Today, science uses lasers to precisely measure
distances, communicate, etch and cut, cool

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:47.870
gases to near absolute zero, image tiny things
(like bacteria), and hundreds of other world-changing

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.010
applications.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.910
And the more powerful they get, the more possibilities
open up, so it behooves scientists to keep

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.030
upping the power.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.260
Essentially, to create a laser, power is added
into substances until they “lase” or emit

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.620
aligned laser-light either in a continuous
beam, or as pulses.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.830
The average laser pointer that my cat chases
needs a few milliwatts of power to do this,

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.030
and the U.S. military is testing lasers as
powerful as 60 kilowatts!

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.040
The idea is to take out incoming rockets or
mortars or swarms of drones., they’re not

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.250
quite at Alderaan destroying levels yet.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.170
But powerful lasers can be more than just
death-beams, they can be used to image things

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.920
as small as viruses and bits of DNA, and lasers
with even more power could help us ignite

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.250
fusion!

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.960
The problem is, you can’t just build a single
powerful laser willy-nilly.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.840
As lasers get more powerful, the heat of the
laser mechanism can affect the creation and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.120
focus of the beam.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.010
So instead, it might be simpler to just take
a bunch of smaller beams and point them at

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.630
the same spot.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.920
Scientists have been using that approach for
years.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.020
Mostly they use mirrors or lenses to focus
lots of lasers at a single point, but getting

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.880
several powerful lasers to focus at the same
place exactly on top of, say, a virus waiting

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.390
for a selfie… not easy.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.210
It would be better if we could build something
like the Death Star, right?

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.660
Lots of beams combining into ONE BEAM.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.080
Aiming ONE BEAM?

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.369
That’s easy!

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.700
And now humanity’s Galen Erso has appeared
in the form of researchers at Macquarie University.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.400
In March 2017, rather than using lenses and
mirrors, they grabbed a bit of ultra-pure

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.230
diamond and let the crystalline structure
of the atoms do the rest!

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.590
They lined up four lasers, one that would
shoot straight through the crystal and out

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.650
the other side, that they called the “seed
beam,” and three that would enter the crystal

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.099
at an angle, called “pump beams.”

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.770
When they were all fired at once, the crystal
transferred most of the power of the pump

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.530
beams to the seed beam, upping its power by
almost 4.6 kW!

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.110
Yeah, that’s a lot less powerful than that
60 kW missile stopper from earlier, but this

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.709
was just a proof of concept.

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.630
The researchers are optimistic that using
diamonds to combine lasers can raise the power

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.380
barrier because the ultra-pure diamond doesn’t
heat up the way traditional technology does.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.970
According to the researchers, this technology
could be used to make lasers that could propel

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.610
spacecraft, clean up space junk, or shoot
down missiles and drones!

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.290
It’s so simple it’s actually mind-boggling
we didn’t figure it out sooner.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.959
Just don’t ask them to go to a secret installation
and build a planet-sized one.

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.319
It just it doesn't end well, okay?

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.060
So combining a bunch of lasers through a diamond
sounds pretty cool.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.320
But so does making lasers from jellyfish.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.990
I'm not crazy.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.410
Trace talks all about that right here.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.470
Alright guys do you think this is the best
way to get super powerful lasers?

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.050
Or is there another think we haven't talked
about that you think is just awesome?
