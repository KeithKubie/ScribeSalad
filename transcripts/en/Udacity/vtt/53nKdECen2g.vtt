00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.570
To make the preferences 
appear on the phone,

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.860
we need to modify settings activity. 
In the on-create method,

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.550
we're going to replace 
this to do with some code.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.911
We're going to call 
addPreferencesFromResource

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:16.510
with the pref_general xml that we defined. 
Then we need to bind

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.120
the preference summary to the value 
of the location preference.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.300
This means that when 
the user changes the preference,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.970
the summary value underneath 
the label will be updated.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.060
If you look at the declaration 
of this method,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.340
we see that for a given preference, it sets 
a preference change listener on it.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.860
If you scroll to the top,
you see that the settings activity

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.670
actually implements the interface 
on preference change listener.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.690
That method is found down below, 
where we override

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.570
the on preference change method. 
Remember that our location preference

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.840
is actually an edit text preference. 
So it won't fall into this case,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.720
but it will fall in this case down here. 
Then, in the settings UI,

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.110
you can see that the summary
is now the value.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.060
Make these changes in your app.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.820
See the instructor notes 
for the lines of code you need.
