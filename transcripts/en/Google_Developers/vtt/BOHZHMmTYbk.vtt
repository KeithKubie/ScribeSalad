00:00:01.126 --> 00:00:03.670
Stocker: If you've been hearing
a lot about voice technology,

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.924
artificial intelligence, and how
it's the next big thing

00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:09.301
but you're not quite sure what
that means for you,

00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:10.302
you're not the only one.

00:00:10.302 --> 00:00:12.304
Whether you're a developer
trying to create

00:00:12.304 --> 00:00:15.182
a conversational interface, a
business that wants to know

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:17.518
what this means for the future
of commerce,

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:20.687
or just a human being wondering
why in the world we need

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.898
more robots when we're trying so
hard

00:00:22.898 --> 00:00:26.610
just to connect to each other,
you've come to the right place.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.861
Hey, Sanched.
How's it going?

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:28.862
Sanched: Not too bad.
How about you?

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:29.863
Stocker: I'm so glad you're
here.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:30.864
Sanched: Glad to be here.

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:31.865
Stocker: Seriously, though,
you've been doing this

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:32.866
for quite a while.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.077
Sanched: It's definitely
different, and it's fairly new.

00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:38.747
Stocker: I'm Nandini, and
welcome to this new video series

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:42.084
where we'll explore all things
related to voice tech

00:00:42.084 --> 00:00:44.670
and the rich elements of human
communication

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.463
that will be the key to its
success.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:49.049
Hey, Google, let's talk to
number genie.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.927
computer voice: I'm thinking of
a number from zero to 100.

00:00:51.927 --> 00:00:54.429
Stocker: We're looking for great
apps out there to highlight

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.057
how you're using these elements
to create your own

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:58.642
conversational experience.

00:00:58.642 --> 00:01:00.853
Sanched: What you're building is
a conversation.

00:01:00.853 --> 00:01:02.271
Stocker: What was the biggest
challenge for you?

00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:05.107
Sanched: You realize you have so
many options.

00:01:05.107 --> 00:01:07.484
Stocker: How do you maintain
that variability?

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:09.403
Sanched: So there's a lot of
opportunity here actually

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:10.946
for the developer to be clever.

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:12.573
Stocker: 'Cause cats rule the
internet.

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:13.657
Sanched: [laughs] Right.

00:01:13.657 --> 00:01:15.492
Stocker: So let's talk.

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:18.078
That's kind of where we're
starting today is, hello, world.
