they have been less effective in an era

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:35.090
they have been less effective in an era
 

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:36.730
they have been less effective in an era
of globalization rather than more

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:36.740

they've been less effective since 1970

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:38.780
they've been less effective since 1970
 

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:41.680
they've been less effective since 1970
than prior second they are most

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:41.690
than prior second they are most
 

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:43.210
than prior second they are most
effective when you can get everybody to

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:43.220
effective when you can get everybody to
 

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.920
effective when you can get everybody to
join in obviously so you don't have an

join in obviously so you don't have an
 

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:47.560

alternative place to go and finally the

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:47.570
alternative place to go and finally the
 

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:49.570
alternative place to go and finally the
most effective where you are pressuring

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:49.580
most effective where you are pressuring
 

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:52.180

some interesting matters being discussed
right now which could see some

right now which could see some
 

01:22:32.289 --> 01:22:34.890
right now which could see some
involvement in those directions but I it

direct information about that the figure

01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:45.070
direct information about that the figure
 

01:22:45.070 --> 01:22:47.850
direct information about that the figure
as I suggested to you early is facing

01:22:47.850 --> 01:22:47.860
as I suggested to you early is facing
 

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:49.229
as I suggested to you early is facing
some interesting pressures on the hill

01:22:49.229 --> 01:22:49.239
some interesting pressures on the hill
 

01:22:49.239 --> 01:22:51.390
some interesting pressures on the hill
as well to see an augmentation of

beyond I'm not at liberty to say
 

01:22:55.630 --> 01:22:56.910
beyond I'm not at liberty to say
anything more about that because their

01:22:56.910 --> 01:22:56.920
anything more about that because their
 

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:58.140
anything more about that because their
budget discussions but we're certainly

01:22:58.140 --> 01:22:58.150
budget discussions but we're certainly
 

01:22:58.150 --> 01:23:00.629
budget discussions but we're certainly
not in a position where there's a lot of

01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639
not in a position where there's a lot of
 

01:23:00.639 --> 01:23:02.819
not in a position where there's a lot of
pressure to push it down if I can react

01:23:02.819 --> 01:23:02.829
pressure to push it down if I can react
 

01:23:02.829 --> 01:23:04.259
pressure to push it down if I can react
to the other two things and then leave

01:23:04.259 --> 01:23:04.269
to the other two things and then leave
 

01:23:04.269 --> 01:23:06.299
to the other two things and then leave
it at that or do you want to do okay the

01:23:06.299 --> 01:23:06.309
it at that or do you want to do okay the
 

01:23:06.309 --> 01:23:08.040
it at that or do you want to do okay the
philosophical goal it seems to me and

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:08.050
philosophical goal it seems to me and
 

01:23:08.050 --> 01:23:10.560

that's many of our core positions and I

ansible one finally the question of
development sustainability it's very

01:23:40.990 --> 01:23:41.000
development sustainability it's very
 

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.419
development sustainability it's very
interesting that question I hope it

01:23:43.419 --> 01:23:43.429
interesting that question I hope it

any reason why we wouldn't see a

fully agree with you yet if we could get

01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400
fully agree with you yet if we could get
 

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:36.669
fully agree with you yet if we could get
a civil society in every one of the

01:24:36.669 --> 01:24:36.679
a civil society in every one of the

of human beings then these aid programs
 

01:24:56.570 --> 01:24:59.860
of human beings then these aid programs
have a real meaning and I say

01:24:59.860 --> 01:24:59.870
have a real meaning and I say
 

01:24:59.870 --> 01:25:01.240
have a real meaning and I say
particularly they have a real meaning

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:01.250
particularly they have a real meaning
 

01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:03.180
