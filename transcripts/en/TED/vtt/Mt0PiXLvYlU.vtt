00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.976
What if an African girl
from a traditional family

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.136
in a part of future Africa

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.896
is accepted into the finest
university in the galaxy,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.200
planets away?

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.840
What if she decides to go?

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.040
This is an excerpt
from my "Binti" novella trilogy:

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.576
I powered up the transporter
and said a silent prayer.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.856
I had no idea what I was going
to do if it didn't work.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.296
My transporter was cheap,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.896
so even a droplet of moisture
or, more likely, a grain of sand,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.776
would cause it to short.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.056
It was faulty, and most of the time
I had to restart it over and over

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.296
before it worked.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.536
"Please not now,
please not now," I thought.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.176
The transporter shivered in the sand
and I held my breath.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.496
Tiny, flat and black as a prayer stone,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.760
it buzzed softly and then
slowly rose from the sand.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.256
Finally, it produced
the baggage-lifting force.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.816
I grinned.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.920
Now I could make it
to the shuttle on time.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.696
I swiped otjize from my forehead
with my index finger and knelt down,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.576
then I touched the finger to the sand,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.056
grounding the sweet-smelling
red clay into it.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.960
"Thank you," I whispered.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.016
It was a half-mile walk
along the dark desert road.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.800
With the transporter working
I would make it there on time.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.816
Straightening up,
I paused and shut my eyes.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.736
Now, the weight of my entire life
was pressing on my shoulders.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.976
I was defying the most traditional
part of myself for the first time

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.576
in my entire life.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.736
I was leaving in the dead of night,
and they had no clue.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.416
My nine siblings, all older than me
except for my younger sister and brother,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.456
would never see this coming.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.840
My parents would never imagine
I'd do such a thing in a million years.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.416
By the time they all realized
what I'd done and where I was going,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.960
I'd have left the planet.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.536
In my absence, my parents
would growl to each other

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.416
that I was never
to set foot in their home again.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.016
My four aunties and two uncles
who lived down the road

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.016
would shout and gossip amongst themselves

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.720
about how I had scandalized
the entire bloodline.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.960
I was going to be a pariah.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.735
"Go," I softly whispered
to the transporter,

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.576
stamping my foot.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.816
The thin metal rings I wore
around each ankle jingled noisily,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.400
but I stamped my foot again.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.776
Once on, the transporter worked best
when I didn't touch it.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.840
"Go," I said again,
sweat forming on my brow.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.856
When nothing moved,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.496
I chanced giving the two large suitcases
sitting atop the force field a shove.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.576
They moved smoothly,
and I breathed another sigh of relief.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.600
At least some luck was on my side.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.776
So, in a distant future part of Africa,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.576
Binti is a mathematical genius
of the Himba ethnic group.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.296
She's been accepted
into a university on another planet,

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.720
and she's decided to go.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.936
Carrying the blood
of her people in her veins,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.736
adorned with the teachings,
ways, even the land on her very skin,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.280
Binti leaves the earth.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.336
As the story progresses,
she becomes not other, but more.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.536
This idea of leaving but bringing
and then becoming more

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.456
is at one of the hearts of Afrofuturism,

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.440
or you can simply call it
a different type of science fiction.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.056
I can best explain the difference between
classic science fiction and Afrofuturism

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.000
if I used the octopus analogy.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.896
Like humans,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.096
octopuses are some of the most
intelligent creatures on earth.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.056
However, octopus intelligence evolved
from a different evolutionary line,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.576
separate from that of human beings,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.976
so the foundation is different.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.800
The same can be said about the foundations
of various forms of science fiction.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.456
So much of science fiction speculates

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.696
about technologies,
societies, social issues,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.736
what's beyond our planet,
what's within our planet.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.736
Science fiction is one of the greatest
and most effective forms

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.416
of political writing.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.800
It's all about the question, "What if?"

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.736
Still, not all science fiction
has the same ancestral bloodline,

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.736
that line being Western-rooted
science fiction,

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.560
which is mostly white and male.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.696
We're talking Isaac Asimov, Jules Verne,

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.279
H.G. Wells, George Orwell,
Robert Heinlein, etc.

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:34.280
So what if a Nigerian-American
wrote science fiction?

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.896
Growing up, I didn't
read much science fiction.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.616
I couldn't relate to these stories

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.216
preoccupied with xenophobia,
colonization and seeing aliens as others.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.680
And I saw no reflection of anyone
who looked like me in those narratives.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.376
In the "Binti" novella trilogy,

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.696
Binti leaves the planet
to seek education from extraterrestrials.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.456
She goes out as she is,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.136
looking the way she looks,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.776
carrying her cultures,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.240
being who she is.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.776
I was inspired to write this story

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.976
not because I was following
a line of classic space opera narratives,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.336
but because of blood that runs deep,

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.976
family, cultural conflict

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.640
and the need to see an African girl
leave the planet on her own terms.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.616
My science fiction
had different ancestors,

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.840
African ones.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.696
So I'm Nigerian-American.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.216
I was born to two
Nigerian immigrant parents

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.376
and raised in the United States,

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.096
one of the birthplaces
of classic science fiction.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.416
However, it was my Nigerian heritage
that led me to write science fiction.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.960
Specifically I cite those family trips
to Nigeria in the late '90s.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.936
I'd been taking trips back to Nigeria
with my family since I was very young.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.536
These early trips inspired me.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.280
Hence the first story that I ever
even wrote took place in Nigeria.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.696
I wrote mainly magical realism and fantasy

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.296
inspired by my love of Igbo

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.960
and other West African traditional
cosmologies and spiritualities.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.976
However, in the late '90s,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.216
I started noticing
the role of technology in Nigeria:

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.096
cable TV and cell phones in the village,

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.896
419 scammers occupying the cybercafes,

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.336
the small generator connected
to my cousin's desktop computer

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.640
because the power
was always going on and off.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.136
And my Americanness othered me enough

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.120
to be intrigued by these things
that most Nigerians saw as normal.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.320
My intrigue eventually
gave birth to stories.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.480
I started opening strange doors.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.560
What if aliens came to Lagos, Nigeria?

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.240
This is an excerpt
from my novel, "Lagoon."

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.296
Everybody saw it,

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.920
all over the world.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.296
That was a real introduction
to the great mess happening in Lagos,

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.880
Nigeria, West Africa, Africa, here.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.456
Because so many people in Lagos
had portable, chargeable,

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.896
glowing, vibrating, chirping, tweeting,
communicating, connected devices,

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.616
practically everything was recorded
and posted online in some way,

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.136
somehow,

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.360
quickly.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.960
The modern human world
is connected like a spider's web.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.440
The world was watching.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.456
It watched in fascinated horror

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.800
for information,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.160
but mostly for entertainment.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.736
Footage of what was happening
dominated every international news source,

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.776
video-sharing website, social network,
circle, pyramid and trapezoid.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.360
But the story goes deeper.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.816
It is in the mud,

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.376
the dirt,

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.136
the earth,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.680
in the fond memory of the soily cosmos.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.536
It is in the always mingling
past, present and future.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.616
It is in the water.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.536
It is in the powerful spirits
and ancestors who dwelled in Lagos.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.880
It is in the hearts and minds
of the people of Lagos.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.136
Change begets change.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.960
The alien Ayodele knew it.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.560
All her people know it.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.056
So, this is a voice of Udide,
the supreme spider artist,

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.416
who is older than dirt

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.016
and lives in the dirt
beneath the city of Lagos,

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.976
listening and commenting

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.320
and weaving the story
of extraterrestrials coming to Lagos.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.856
In the end, the great spider
who was the size of a house

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.816
and responsible for weaving
the past, present and future

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.559
decides to come forth
and be a part of the story.

00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:47.936
Like Udide, the spider artist,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.135
African science fiction's blood runs deep

00:08:51.159 --> 00:08:52.360
and it's old,

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.216
and it's ready to come forth,

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.816
and when it does,

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:01.760
imagine the new technologies, ideas
and sociopolitical changes it'll inspire.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.520
For Africans, homegrown
science fiction can be a will to power.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.040
What if?

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.000
It's a powerful question.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.816
Thank you.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.960
(Applause)
