00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.945
Many lessons ago, we've talked about how to develop the public interface of the

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:08.947
class, the methods that one might want to call on objects of the class. But

00:00:08.947 --> 00:00:12.605
we've always pretty much given to you the instance variables, because it turns

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:18.617
out that picking the right instance variables isn't all that simple. While now,

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:22.771
the time has come for you to do more of that yourself. And I'd like to give you

00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:27.564
a few rules of thumb, on how you might discover instance variables. To see how

00:00:27.564 --> 00:00:31.009
those rules of thumb work, let's have another look at the Car class from Lesson

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.555
three. That class had an instance variable to hold the amount of gas in the

00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:43.508
tank. That was a method to add gas where the parameter value would be added to

00:00:43.508 --> 00:00:48.034
the gasInTank. Now the point that I want to make is that there is a certain

00:00:48.034 --> 00:00:54.474
pattern here. You have a quantity here. Here you make that quantity bigger. It

00:00:54.474 --> 00:00:59.220
also gets smaller when the car is driven. I like to call that pattern keeping a

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.055
total. And it occurs in many classes, not just the car. So then lots of times

00:01:05.055 --> 00:01:08.410
we have some class and you have some variable, which may be called total or

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:16.354
not. And then there's some methods that add to the total. Maybe some methods

00:01:16.354 --> 00:01:21.938
that clear the total, or subtract from it. I'll give you a few situations, and

00:01:21.938 --> 00:01:27.210
I'll ask you whether the pattern of keeping a total applies. So, would you keep

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.590
a total to model the account balance in a bank account? Friends in a social

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.816
network? A car odometer? Stripes in a flag. Check all where you think the

00:01:39.816 --> 00:01:42.000
pattern makes sense.
