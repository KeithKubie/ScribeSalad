00:00:03.296 --> 00:00:06.246
&gt;&gt;So, here I thought I was
studying videogames, and I still am,

00:00:06.246 --> 00:00:08.716
but it turns out video games
are just a Trojan Horse

00:00:08.716 --> 00:00:10.396
for studying interest-driven learning.

00:00:10.946 --> 00:00:12.716
So, in fact, is it about the games?

00:00:12.716 --> 00:00:13.676
I don't think so.

00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:16.946
I don't think it's about the games at
all except that games are very good,

00:00:16.946 --> 00:00:19.756
they're very well-designed,
both for learning,

00:00:19.756 --> 00:00:23.466
but also to capture interest,
to be captivating, motivating.

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:27.726
And in schools, for example, we
have the luxury of ignoring interest

00:00:28.336 --> 00:00:30.946
because we simply say, "Well
you must," rather than,

00:00:30.946 --> 00:00:33.046
"Here's why it's inherently
compelling."

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:34.736
So, is it about games?

00:00:34.776 --> 00:00:35.426
I don't think so.

00:00:35.426 --> 00:00:37.946
It's really funny to me that
I'm still a game scholar.

00:00:37.946 --> 00:00:40.656
I run a games conference, I do
everything around video games,

00:00:40.716 --> 00:00:44.706
but really games are just an easy
context to look at what it means

00:00:44.706 --> 00:00:47.976
when kids actually are engaged
and care about the subject matter.

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:58.566
&gt;&gt;I study thinking and learning
in the form of online games.

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:02.186
So, it's an interesting
intersection between video games,

00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:05.086
and online cultures, and
social networks like Facebook.

00:01:05.086 --> 00:01:07.136
It kind of has ramifications
for both,

00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:10.526
but I do large empirical
studies of what kids are doing

00:01:10.526 --> 00:01:14.186
and what's the nature of the
intellectual side of online play

00:01:14.186 --> 00:01:17.776
of all forms, how do games
matter, what matters about them,

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:19.566
and how do we save the world.

00:01:27.456 --> 00:01:29.546
&gt;&gt;So, we ran a two-year
afterschool program.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:32.856
And before we even had to recruit
kids, we had a waiting list

00:01:32.856 --> 00:01:35.636
of parents who had heard about it,
heard we were interested in doing it,

00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:37.176
and were sending us their kids.

00:01:37.176 --> 00:01:38.996
It turned into being all teenage boys

00:01:39.346 --> 00:01:41.836
and now that's become a
real interest focus of mine.

00:01:41.836 --> 00:01:45.866
My PhD is literacy studies,
and yet until I had two boys

00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:48.556
of my own I had never
even paid attention

00:01:48.556 --> 00:01:51.046
to the literacy crisis with boys.

00:01:51.446 --> 00:01:53.466
And it's been around
for the last 30 years,

00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:55.196
but no one's really
ever called it out.

00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:58.106
And the more you investigate
it, the more troubling it is.

00:02:03.476 --> 00:02:07.466
&gt;&gt;Teenage guys in America
are really suffering.

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:12.216
And they're definitely falling out of
school and disaffiliating with school

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:14.116
at a rate that's really alarming.

00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:16.356
So, I've become really
interested in that,

00:02:16.356 --> 00:02:20.886
mostly because if you study
video games a large swath

00:02:20.886 --> 00:02:23.396
of your population is teenage guys.

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:27.856
So, for me, when I started doing
studies around science, and literacy,

00:02:27.856 --> 00:02:33.236
and civic engagement, around online
games, when the biggest population

00:02:33.646 --> 00:02:37.946
of those games is teenage guys and
they're not faring well in school,

00:02:38.326 --> 00:02:43.276
it begs a real question, what's
happening in this space between kids

00:02:43.276 --> 00:02:46.286
and their school world, and
their school identities instead

00:02:46.516 --> 00:02:49.296
of their game identities and their
work they're doing around games.

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:55.186
&gt;&gt;So, when we first started
I had this great idea.

00:02:55.346 --> 00:02:58.516
I wanted to create what I was
calling a bridging third place

00:02:58.716 --> 00:03:00.246
between school and games.

00:03:00.306 --> 00:03:04.846
I thought maybe we can create a
world in which kids will play games,

00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:07.956
they'll do intellectual practices
around games, but I can play kind

00:03:08.086 --> 00:03:12.666
of a translator and help them
understand how that relates to school

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:16.666
and sort of trying to buoy up
that connection between reading

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:18.266
around games and reading in school.

00:03:18.786 --> 00:03:20.016
So, I had this fabulous idea.

00:03:20.016 --> 00:03:22.256
It was so naÃ¯ve and so hilarious.

00:03:22.256 --> 00:03:25.116
First semester we were going to build
a guild website and we were going

00:03:25.546 --> 00:03:27.876
to learn digital media
design, we were going to write,

00:03:27.876 --> 00:03:30.596
we were going to read, we were
going to do all this complicated,

00:03:30.596 --> 00:03:32.926
multimodal website stuff.

00:03:33.586 --> 00:03:37.186
Had this great idea, kids came
in, it took a whole one month

00:03:37.186 --> 00:03:40.816
until I realized this was the dumbest
approach in the entire universe.

00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:51.636
&gt;&gt;The first big meeting we
had I start rolling out, like,

00:03:51.816 --> 00:03:53.176
"We're going to build
a game website."

00:03:53.176 --> 00:03:57.096
And I talking about all the
structured curricular kind of stuff.

00:03:57.096 --> 00:04:01.026
And these were not
heavy-handed, lame activities,

00:04:01.026 --> 00:04:02.506
I thought these would be really cool.

00:04:03.186 --> 00:04:07.386
And literally the guys, I
called it the "let me know

00:04:07.386 --> 00:04:10.716
when she stops talking" problem,
because literally they went

00:04:10.716 --> 00:04:12.676
from totally engaged,
leaning forward,

00:04:12.676 --> 00:04:15.616
to the moment I started
talking they leaned back

00:04:15.616 --> 00:04:19.486
and they pulled their hoodies up over
their head and they sat like this,

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:24.356
like, let me know when
she stops talking.

00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:28.456
And then when I stopped talking and
we got to game, hoodies came back

00:04:28.456 --> 00:04:31.576
and they totally plugged
back into playing WoW, right.

00:04:31.576 --> 00:04:33.626
And I thought this
isn't going to work.

00:04:33.716 --> 00:04:36.786
If they don't care about any of
the stuff I'm yakking at them with,

00:04:37.546 --> 00:04:39.976
this entire lab is
going to fall apart.

00:04:46.646 --> 00:04:49.336
&gt;&gt;So, I took all of our plans, I
threw them out the window and I said,

00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:51.926
okay, structured stuff --
not going to work.

00:04:52.276 --> 00:04:54.896
If it smells like school,
they're not going to touch it.

00:04:54.896 --> 00:04:57.536
If I talk at them, they are
not going to listen to me.

00:04:57.646 --> 00:05:00.416
So, we're just going to do
this weird, radical thing.

00:05:00.746 --> 00:05:03.326
We're going to sit back, we're
just going to resource them,

00:05:03.396 --> 00:05:05.526
meaning that we're going
to play next to them.

00:05:05.846 --> 00:05:09.366
When an interest comes up we'll
be like, "Hey, well, you know,

00:05:09.506 --> 00:05:11.866
the place to read more
about that would be X."

00:05:11.866 --> 00:05:14.306
So, when kids got interested
in the WoW graphic novels,

00:05:14.726 --> 00:05:17.876
lo and behold, we ran out to Borders,
bought a whole bunch of them,

00:05:17.876 --> 00:05:19.996
brought them back and we're
like, oh, look at that.

00:05:19.996 --> 00:05:21.896
It turns out we have
WoW graphic novels here.

00:05:21.896 --> 00:05:23.026
You could read that, right.

00:05:23.326 --> 00:05:25.356
And once we turned it
around to resourcing,

00:05:25.356 --> 00:05:29.026
and much more of a follow-
their-interest kind of model,

00:05:29.416 --> 00:05:30.976
everything shifted and it worked.

00:05:39.426 --> 00:05:43.966
&gt;&gt;For example, we had a reader
that was in tenth grade who read

00:05:43.966 --> 00:05:47.046
at the sixth-grade level, was
not faring well in school.

00:05:47.106 --> 00:05:51.086
I handed him a fifteenth-
grade-level text from the game

00:05:51.086 --> 00:05:53.626
and he's reading it with
absolutely fine comprehension,

00:05:53.676 --> 00:05:56.006
94- 96 percent accuracy.

00:05:56.996 --> 00:05:59.966
So, we had this massive disparity,
why suddenly are they reading,

00:05:59.966 --> 00:06:03.496
if you let them choose the
text, why are they reading

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:07.356
at this incredibly -- much higher
level of comprehension and performance.

00:06:07.636 --> 00:06:10.626
What it came down to was something
called self-correction rates.

00:06:11.196 --> 00:06:13.146
When they choose the text,
when they care about it,

00:06:13.396 --> 00:06:15.956
they actually fix their own
comprehension problems more

00:06:15.956 --> 00:06:20.046
than two times as often as when
they don't care about the text.

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:22.896
It's kind of stating the obvious, but
we forget it in schools all the time

00:06:22.996 --> 00:06:26.306
that if you care about
understanding the topic, you will sit

00:06:26.306 --> 00:06:29.616
and work through, you will persist
in the face of challenge in a way

00:06:29.616 --> 00:06:31.966
that you won't do if you
don't care about the topic.

00:06:38.716 --> 00:06:42.426
&gt;&gt;What I'm trying to say is rather
than treating kids' interests

00:06:42.426 --> 00:06:45.066
as a means toward your
educational goals,

00:06:45.526 --> 00:06:47.706
trying to treat your
educational materials

00:06:47.976 --> 00:06:50.066
as a means towards their goals.

00:06:50.956 --> 00:06:55.176
So, the model of pedagogy
behind it is really radical.

00:06:55.176 --> 00:06:57.496
It's to say that teaching
would look a lot more

00:06:57.526 --> 00:07:02.656
like community organizing, where
the first question is "What do you

00:07:02.656 --> 00:07:04.406
as a community want to accomplish?"

00:07:04.876 --> 00:07:08.476
And then your job is to figure
out how do I marshal resources

00:07:08.476 --> 00:07:14.206
to help you accomplish that
and along the way to tool you

00:07:14.206 --> 00:07:18.106
up with practices,
knowledge, dispositions,

00:07:18.516 --> 00:07:20.506
that you keep for a lifetime.
