00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:00.390
OK.

00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.890
I want to show you
the new emulation

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.110
feature in Chrome DevTools.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.485
And it's great for understanding
how your content's going

00:00:05.485 --> 00:00:06.860
to look across
different devices.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.901
So I'm going to start here
on the Wikipedia site.

00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:10.810
And you can see when I
resize the site down,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.350
that it doesn't scale well.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.590
I don't get any sense of
how this site would play out

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.680
if I were viewing it on
a phone, for example.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.990
So if I open up DevTools,
and I bring the console using

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.140
the Escape key on the
keyboard-- and you can also

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.230
use this icon up
here-- you'll see

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.142
that there's a new
tab called Emulation.

00:00:25.142 --> 00:00:27.100
Now there are lots of
really interesting things

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.930
inside of here, like screen
resolution, device pixel ratio,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.697
user agent strings, and other
fun stuff like geolocation.

00:00:33.697 --> 00:00:36.030
Now Emulation is going to let
me set all of these things

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.270
individually and have total
control over how Chrome's

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.470
going to present itself
to any given site.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.110
But to make life a
little bit easier,

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.160
we've also included a
bunch of device presets.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.635
So I'm going to go ahead
and choose the Nexus 4 here.

00:00:47.635 --> 00:00:49.260
Now that sets a bunch
of these features

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.982
on, which you can see now have
this blue check next to them.

00:00:51.982 --> 00:00:53.440
Because the Wikipedia
site actually

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.231
serves different content
to mobile devices,

00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:57.210
I'm going to need
to refresh the page.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.419
And now you'll see that
we're served the mobile site.

00:00:59.419 --> 00:01:01.210
Now we've done a bunch
of work to make sure

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.700
that the Emulation behaves as
close to reality as possible.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.160
And one of the things
you're going to notice

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.014
is that my cursor has
turned into this dot.

00:01:07.014 --> 00:01:08.430
And that's because
we're emulating

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.950
touch, including
proper touch events.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.930
If I hold Shift and
click Drag, you'll

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.352
see that I'm also able
to mimic pinch to zoom.

00:01:15.352 --> 00:01:16.810
This whole experience
is far better

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.770
than simply spoofing
the user agent string.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.520
You can really start
to get a sense of how

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.230
your project's going to
react for any given device.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.830
I also want to
show you this demo

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.130
to give you a bit more
detail on device pixel ratio.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.872
You'll see that my desktop has
a device pixel ratio of one.

00:01:29.872 --> 00:01:31.580
And if we take a peek
at the source file,

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.850
you'll see that
we're using image-set

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.440
to choose the most
appropriate image.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.450
Right now, that's the 1x image.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.390
If I turn on Emulation
inside of Dev Tools

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.510
and set the device
pixel ratio to 2,

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.754
you'll see that we're
now serving the 2x image.

00:01:42.754 --> 00:01:44.420
This is super useful
when you're looking

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.350
to test serving the right assets
based on device pixel ratio,

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.640
whether you have access to
a high DPI device or not.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.866
So that's just a taste of
emulating mobile devices.

00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:54.990
Please take a look around,
use it in your workflow,

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.430
and head to devtools.chrome.com
to learn more.
