00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.630
In the situations where a database is involved and we have to be concerned about

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.660
transactions, that is making sure that the data that we store and

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.940
retrieve is consistent with respect to

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.600
the overall database we have to deal with transaction processing, and

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.300
in particular with what are called the ACID properties. The primary concern is

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.500
reliable database access, particularly when there are multiple readers and

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.450
writers. That is parts of the application reading from the database and

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.960
other parts writing into the database, particularly on in addressing

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.610
a particular, a specific record. Imagine that you were in a situation,

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.330
maybe you were doing airline reservations or something like that,

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.360
and you need to understand the information in the database, but

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.480
you may want to update it if you're making that reservation. Okay? So

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.860
you have to read it, examine it, change it, and then write it back.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.720
What happens if another application changes the record after you've read it,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.300
but before your change version has been written back. So we'd like to have

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.580
database transactions that satisfy the ACID properties, and ACID is an acronym.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.730
The A stands for Atomic. That means that your transaction, these four steps,

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.430
reading, examining, changing, and written, are all treated by the system as if

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.142
they were one step with no intermittent activities going on. The C stands for

00:01:26.142 --> 00:01:31.430
consistency preserving, in the sense of database integrity. Okay. That is

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.230
if the database satisfied all its integrity constraints before your transaction,

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.230
it will also satisfy them after your transaction. Third, the letter I stands for

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.880
isolated. Okay, that, what that means is that other transactions can't see

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.650
into any intermediate states in the processing of your particular transaction.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.880
And finally D stands for durable, and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.120
that mean that once your transaction commits then it's persisted.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.811
That means it, it is a permanent record that the system is aware of.
