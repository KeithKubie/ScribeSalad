00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I need one or more leading digits, and then there's a sort of

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
a compound optional part, so I'll use parenthesis.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We may have a dot and to really mean the dot,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm going to use the backslash to escape the dot because remember

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
it has a special meaning in regular expressions, any character.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And then I can have zero or more digits afterwards.

00:00:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And then that whole grouping is optional.
