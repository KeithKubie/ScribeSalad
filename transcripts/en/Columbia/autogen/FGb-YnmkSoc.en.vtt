faculty things that are both historical

01:51:41.540 --> 01:51:41.550
faculty things that are both historical
 

01:51:41.550 --> 01:51:45.290
faculty things that are both historical
and contemporary and every semester we

01:51:45.290 --> 01:51:45.300
and contemporary and every semester we
 

01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:47.419
and contemporary and every semester we
try to do something different somebody

asked me earlier or yesterday why we

01:51:50.180 --> 01:51:50.190
asked me earlier or yesterday why we
 

01:51:50.190 --> 01:51:54.740
asked me earlier or yesterday why we
picked dealing with the past the choice

01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:54.750

of which historical model you wish to

01:51:56.750 --> 01:51:56.760
of which historical model you wish to
 

01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:00.260
of which historical model you wish to
promote analyst tration and I guess the

01:52:00.260 --> 01:52:00.270
promote analyst tration and I guess the
 

01:52:00.270 --> 01:52:02.270

answer is because it was there now what

01:52:02.270 --> 01:52:02.280
answer is because it was there now what
 

01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:04.970
answer is because it was there now what
we thought of it we figured that it was

01:52:04.970 --> 01:52:04.980
we thought of it we figured that it was
 

01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:06.260
we thought of it we figured that it was
going to have much more of an impact

01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:06.270
going to have much more of an impact
 

01:52:06.270 --> 01:52:08.959
going to have much more of an impact
than it's having today simply because of

01:52:08.959 --> 01:52:08.969
than it's having today simply because of
 

01:52:08.969 --> 01:52:12.229
than it's having today simply because of
the political atmosphere in Poland and

01:52:12.229 --> 01:52:12.239
the political atmosphere in Poland and
 

01:52:12.239 --> 01:52:13.609
the political atmosphere in Poland and
we also thought that this would be a

01:52:13.609 --> 01:52:13.619
we also thought that this would be a
 

01:52:13.619 --> 01:52:16.700
we also thought that this would be a
good time to explore and compare what is

01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:16.710
good time to explore and compare what is
 

01:52:16.710 --> 01:52:19.280
good time to explore and compare what is
going on in countries in the region and

01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:19.290
going on in countries in the region and
 

01:52:19.290 --> 01:52:21.919
going on in countries in the region and
we learned a lot one of the things that

01:52:21.919 --> 01:52:21.929
we learned a lot one of the things that
 

01:52:21.929 --> 01:52:24.200
we learned a lot one of the things that

in the room is the information on the
 

01:52:28.679 --> 01:52:30.979
in the room is the information on the
opening of the check archives which is a

01:52:30.979 --> 01:52:30.989
opening of the check archives which is a
 

01:52:30.989 --> 01:52:33.680
opening of the check archives which is a
very recent development and which may

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:33.690
very recent development and which may
 

01:52:33.690 --> 01:52:37.700
very recent development and which may
have an impact on how those people the

how they should pursue access policies

01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:46.350
how they should pursue access policies
 

01:52:46.350 --> 01:52:49.220
how they should pursue access policies
in their respective countries and as we

01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:49.230
in their respective countries and as we
 

01:52:49.230 --> 01:52:50.810
in their respective countries and as we
listened over the last couple of days we

01:52:50.810 --> 01:52:50.820
listened over the last couple of days we
 

01:52:50.820 --> 01:52:53.510
listened over the last couple of days we
all know that there's no one simple

01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520
all know that there's no one simple
 

01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:55.700
all know that there's no one simple
answer for for everyone and that

answer for for everyone and that
countries are going at different speeds

01:52:57.290 --> 01:52:57.300
countries are going at different speeds
 

01:52:57.300 --> 01:53:00.890
countries are going at different speeds
so we may very well expect to see under

01:53:00.890 --> 01:53:00.900
so we may very well expect to see under
 

01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:03.229

and it was a useful exercise to remember

01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:39.190
and it was a useful exercise to remember
 

01:54:39.190 --> 01:54:42.930
and it was a useful exercise to remember
that people didn't start doing this when

the catching ski twins took over they
have been doing this the whole time so

01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:46.470
have been doing this the whole time so
 

01:54:46.470 --> 01:54:49.470
have been doing this the whole time so
these are useful exercises for people

01:54:49.470 --> 01:54:49.480
these are useful exercises for people
 

01:54:49.480 --> 01:54:51.750
these are useful exercises for people
who are in the business of addressing

01:54:51.750 --> 01:54:51.760
who are in the business of addressing
 

01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:54.120

explain what's going on today based on
information that they may have forgotten

01:54:58.650 --> 01:54:58.660
information that they may have forgotten
 

01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:00.390
information that they may have forgotten
or that they're just learning from their

or that they're just learning from their
 

01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:02.490
or that they're just learning from their
colleagues and it was very nice to have

01:55:02.490 --> 01:55:02.500
colleagues and it was very nice to have
 

01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:04.770
colleagues and it was very nice to have
somebody talk about what's going on in

01:55:04.770 --> 01:55:04.780
somebody talk about what's going on in
 

01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:09.470
somebody talk about what's going on in
Romania and a decent discussion about

01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:09.480
Romania and a decent discussion about
 

01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:12.690
Romania and a decent discussion about
both historical politics in Germany and

01:55:12.690 --> 01:55:12.700
both historical politics in Germany and
 

01:55:12.700 --> 01:55:15.210
both historical politics in Germany and
also illustration in Germany and of

01:55:15.210 --> 01:55:15.220
also illustration in Germany and of
 

01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:16.830
also illustration in Germany and of
course we could have covered many more

01:55:16.830 --> 01:55:16.840
course we could have covered many more
 

01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:19.470
course we could have covered many more
countries in Europe and also placed the

01:55:19.470 --> 01:55:19.480
countries in Europe and also placed the
 

01:55:19.480 --> 01:55:21.330
countries in Europe and also placed the
East Central European region into a

01:55:21.330 --> 01:55:21.340
East Central European region into a
 

01:55:21.340 --> 01:55:23.310
East Central European region into a
larger context but that would have taken

01:55:23.310 --> 01:55:23.320
larger context but that would have taken
 

01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:26.250
larger context but that would have taken
of course more time and that's something

01:55:26.250 --> 01:55:26.260
of course more time and that's something
 

01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:28.410
of course more time and that's something
that we really didn't have the

01:55:28.410 --> 01:55:28.420
that we really didn't have the
 

01:55:28.420 --> 01:55:31.140
that we really didn't have the
possibility to do so I want to thank all

01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:31.150
possibility to do so I want to thank all
 

01:55:31.150 --> 01:55:33.560
