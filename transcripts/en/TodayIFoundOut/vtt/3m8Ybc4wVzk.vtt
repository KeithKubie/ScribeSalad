00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:13.679
On 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.930
Christmas Eve, 1971, just a few hours after
attending her high school graduation, 17 year

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.349
old Juliane Koepcke and her mother, Maria,
got on a flight from Lima, Peru to Pucallpa.

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.460
The two were headed out to join Juliane’s
father, Hans-Wilhelm, a famous German zoologist

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.450
who was working at a remote research station
in the rainforest.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.880
Approximately 30 minutes into the flight,
the plane entered very thick, black clouds.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.700
“The clouds became darker and darker and
the flight became more turbulent.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.660
Then we were in the midst of pitch-black clouds
and a proper storm with thunder and lightning,”

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.660
said Koepcke.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.680
“It was pitch-black all around us and there
was constant lightning.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.570
Then I saw a glistening light on the right
wing…

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.190
The motor was hit by lightning.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.190
”

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.440
While planes get struck by lightning all the
time with no real problems ensuing, this time

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.190
there was a big problem.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.420
Directly after the wing was struck, the aircraft
was ripped apart, largely thanks to the fact

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.420
that the Electra aircraft they were on wasn’t
built for flying in heavy turbulence to begin

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.860
with, due to its very rigid wings.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.660
Contrary to what is often reported, Koepcke
states the wing “definitely didn’t explode.”

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.460
Rather, the plane was simply ripped apart
in the air after the wing fell off.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.520
The last words Koepcke ever heard from her
mother were when the lightning struck the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.630
wing, “it’s all over”…

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.630
LIES!!!

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.570
Well, at least for her daughter (and technically
not the immediate end for her mother either,

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.570
as you’ll soon see).

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.570
Still strapped to her seat, Juliane Koepcke
was ejected from the aircraft and fell approximately

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.570
2 miles into the dense Peruvian rainforest.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.890
I heard the incredibly loud motor and people
screaming and then the plane fell extremely

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:39.890
steeply.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.360
And then it was calm—incredibly calm compared
with the noise before that.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.850
I could only hear the wind in my ears.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.530
I was still attached to my seat.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.440
My mother and the man sitting by the aisle
had both been propelled out of their seats.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.260
I was free-falling, that’s what I registered
for sure.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.050
I was in a tailspin.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.940
I saw the forest beneath me—like ‘green
cauliflower, like broccoli,’ is how I described

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.070
it later on.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.390
Then I lost consciousness and regained it
only way later, the next day.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.390
Koepcke became the sole survivor of Lansa
flight 508, all 91 other passengers and crew

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.390
died.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.390
It isn’t known what exact factors played
into Juliane’s surviving the fall.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.390
Some have speculated that her fall was slowed
by the row of seats she was strapped to rotating

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.390
like a helicopter, and then helped cushion
her landing thanks to striking the dense forest

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.390
on her way down.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.390
The actual cushion of her seat itself also
likely played a small role.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.390
Whatever the case, over the next 19 hours
or so, Koepcke lapsed in and out of consciousness

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.390
and at some point unknown to her, she managed
to unstrap herself from her seat and crawl

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.800
under it, she thinks as a response to rain.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.230
Finally, at 9am, she became lucid and in somewhat
of a daze took stock of her situation.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.680
She was lying on the ground, dressed in only
a sleeveless mini-dress and was missing one

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.510
of her sandals and glasses.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.920
While she didn’t realize all her injuries
at the time, she had survived the fall with

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.569
a broken collar bone; a torn ACL; one of her
eyes swollen shut; her capillaries in her

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.210
eyes had popped (due to rapid decompression
from the plane); a strained vertebrae in her

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:55.849
neck; a partially fractured shin; and several
deep cuts on her arms and legs.

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.959
It took her half the day just to be able to
stand without getting too dizzy, but eventually

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.170
she managed it and at first set out to find
her mother, searching for a full day before

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.220
giving up.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.110
During her search for her mother, though,
she did find a bag of candy, which was her

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.260
only food she had during her journey, and
more importantly, a stream.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.819
Her father had once given her the very good
advice that if she were ever lost in the rainforest

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.500
and came across a stream or river, she should
follow it downstream; because people tend

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.810
to live on or near water, following a river
long enough, should get you to civilization

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.810
eventually.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:30.890
She then set out.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.739
She knew from experience that snakes particularly
liked to lay camouflaged under dry leaves,

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.989
so when she wasn’t walking in the water,
she used her one shoe, thrown before her,

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.840
to test the ground for snakes and the like
(she couldn’t see very well due to missing

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.890
her glasses).

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.153
Luckily, she never encountered any, that she
saw at least.

00:03:48.153 --> 00:03:52.170
She walked as much as possible in the river
as it was an easier way to go, rather than

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.300
through the dense foliage.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.160
Of course, this came with hazards of its own.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.069
Within a couple days, she started hearing
King vultures around her, the sound of which

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.620
she recognized from living at her parent’s
research station a year and a half before,

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.430
only about 30 miles from where the plane crashed.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.260
Because King vultures usually only land when
there is carrion around, she figured there

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.920
must be dead bodies about that they were feeding
on, but at first didn’t encounter any.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.669
On the fourth day, she finally spotted some;
three other passengers still strapped to their

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.809
seats and rammed several feet, headfirst into
the ground.

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:26.219
I couldn’t really see that much, only people’s
feet pointing up.

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:28.059
I poked their feet with a stick.

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:29.749
I couldn’t touch the dead bodies.

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:33.749
I couldn’t smell anything and they hadn’t
been eaten yet or started to decay.

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:37.150
I mean, sure, decay must have started, but
I couldn’t notice it.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.439
I could tell it was a woman because she had
polished toenails and the others must have

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:44.300
been two men, judging by their pants and shoes.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.279
I moved on after a while, but in the first
moment after finding them, it was like I was

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:50.789
paralyzed.

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:55.330
During her trek, several of her wounds became
infected and a large cut on her right arm

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.050
was infested with maggots.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.639
This is something she’d seen happen to her
dog before, with near disastrous results for

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:02.639
the dog.

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.331
Try as she might, though, she couldn’t manage
to get the maggots out as they were too deep

00:05:06.331 --> 00:05:07.331
in the wound.

00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:12.830
“I had this ring that was open on one side
that you could squeeze together, and I tried

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.830
with that.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.990
It didn’t work because the hole was so deep.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.879
So I tried with a stick, but that didn’t
work either.”

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:22.880
On the tenth day she came across a boat, which
in her delirious state at this point, she

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.830
thought was a mirage until she finally came
up to it and touched it.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.400
Next to the boat was a path, which she crawled
up (at this point being extremely weak, making

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.919
walking up the path somewhat difficult).

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.289
At the end of the path was a small hut that
was being used by lumbermen.

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.300
Empty at the time, she found an outboard motor
and some diesel fuel in a barrel.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.469
She used a tube to suck out some of the fuel
from the barrel and put that on her wound

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:48.129
that was maggot infested, something her father
had done to her dog, though with kerosene.

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:52.509
Albeit extremely painful, this worked and
most of the maggots, while initially trying

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:56.539
to burrow deeper into her arm, eventually
came to the surface and she was able pick

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:57.539
them out.

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.259
She then tried to sleep in the hut, but found
the ground to be much too hard, so she went

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:03.819
back down to the river side and laid in the
sand.

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:08.240
The next day, she woke up and, hearing frogs
all around her, tried to catch some to eat.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.669
Luckily for her she was unable to as they
were poisonous dart frogs.

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.210
At this point, she was debating whether to
take the boat or not, something she didn’t

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.149
want to do as it was stealing, but ultimately
decided to spend the night at the hut.

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:26.289
She ended up not having to do so alone, though,
because she soon heard voices, “like hearing

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:27.779
angels’ voices”.

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.110
Three people came out of the forest and spotted
her.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.020
At first they thought she was a “Yemanjá”,
a type of blond, pale skinned water spirit.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.129
“When they saw me, they were pretty freaked
out.”

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:41.300
However, she explained what had happened and
how she got there, and they had heard of the

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.520
plane crash, so accepted her tale.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.910
They then fed her and cared for her wounds
as best they could and took her downstream

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.409
on about a seven hour boat ride to a lumber
station/village.

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:51.409
(who says the deforestation of the rainforest
is all bad?

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:52.409
That’s one life that would have ended had
there been no lumbermen about) 😉

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:55.080
Once there, a local pilot knew of some missionaries
nearby running a hospital in Pucuallpa.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.409
The pilot took her on what must have been
a freaky, for Juliane, 15 minute flight to

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:02.360
the hospital and the day after her rescue,
she was reunited with her father.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.059
She then helped the search parties locate
the crash site.

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:08.259
On January 12th, they finally discovered her
mother’s body.

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:11.089
Like Juliane, her mother apparently survived
the fall.

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:15.909
However, her injuries prevented her from moving
and she ended up dying several days later.

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:21.219
Now known as Juliane Diller, she has a PhD
in Zoology and is a librarian at the Bacarian

00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:23.919
State Zoological Collection in Munich.

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:28.819
