00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.630
&gt;&gt; Gosh it quiet really fast,
you guys make me nervous sheesh.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.410
I think Dr. Hayden said
it well, it's like we're

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.740
in a library [laughter] welcome.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.670
I'm Lee Ann Potter, I direct
Educational Outreach here

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.630
at the Library of
Congress and welcome

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.040
to this very, very special day.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.270
It's special for a number
of reasons for starters,

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.420
it's special because it's here
at the Library of Congress

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.950
and that as many of you know,

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.710
the library is the largest
library in the world,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.570
but did you know, and I've got
good notes here, did you know

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.940
that the libraries collections
contain almost 164 million items

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.420
in a wide variety of formats,
languages and subjects?

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.610
And did you know that these
collections are the single most

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.630
comprehensive accumulation of
human expression ever assembled?

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.250
And if that doesn't
give you goose bumps,

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.690
then maybe the weather did.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.690
[Laughter] the collections are
broad, they are broad in scope

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.210
and they include
materials in more

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.030
than 470 different languages,
more than 35 different scripts

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.430
and many different media
formats from photographs,

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.220
to maps to drawings,
to manuscripts to,

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.870
sound recordings, and more.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.490
The collections even
include books I say

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.290
that because sometimes we
assume and not the others.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.700
Today's event though is also
special because we are here

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.170
in the Members Room not your
typical meeting room, huh?

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.130
The Members Room in the
Thomas Jefferson building

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.250
of the Library of Congress is
a good reminder to all of us

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.850
that the Library of Congress
is the main research arm

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.900
of the United States Congress,
and today is extra special

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.440
because today's event
is not the kind of event

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.480
that happens every day in fact,

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.650
it only happens once
every two years.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.310
Today, as you know,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.680
we are inaugurating the
new National Ambassador

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.190
for Young People's Literature
who will serve in this position

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.160
until January of 2020.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.770
As you probably know,
an ambassador someone

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.030
who is authorized to
be a representative

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.440
or a messenger of something.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.580
A great ambassador is
smart, knows what he

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.750
or she is talking about, is a
champion of an important cause

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.430
and is a supporter and
a promoter of others.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.680
You could almost say
that the Librarian

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.880
of Congress is an
ambassador of sorts.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.840
I am honored to introduce you

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.650
to Dr. Carla Hayden the
14th Librarian of Congress,

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.200
she earned her Ph.D. from
the University of Chicago,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.570
she began her career as
a Children's librarian,

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.320
she led the library in
Baltimore, was the President

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.870
of the American Library
Association,

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.080
and is absolutely aware
of the power of reading,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.460
she knows the magic
of a good story

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.390
and is a tremendous
ambassador for the Library

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.510
of Congress, Dr. Hayden.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.550
[Applauding]

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.480
&gt;&gt; Well, good morning
and thank you, Lee Ann.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.930
I was all ready to sprint

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.400
and you started doing what
my mom always loves to hear,

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.150
they never tire that
accent, they never tire that.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.610
This is a wonderful event and
I just want to say, welcome.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.630
I'm especially happy
to see the young people

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.460
from Brooklyn Middle School,
the orange [applauding]

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:06.220
in their wonderful shirts, the
orange sixth grade and teal,

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.820
seventh grade, so you should
know that and that welcome

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.730
and we hope you come
back many, many times.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.270
One of the many pleasures of
being Librarian of Congress is

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:23.980
to host events like this, I have
to say though, this one is very,

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.520
very special, the inauguration
of our new National Ambassador

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.510
for Young People's Literature
is Jacqueline Woodson.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:40.410
[Applauding]

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.460
Now, I've been a fan of Ms.
Woodson's for a long time

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.470
and in my ten year at the
Enoch Pratt Free Library,

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.280
I was very fortunate to
work with someone who was,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.560
talk about an ambassador,
a champion,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.510
a mentor for Young People's
Literature, Ms. Deborah Taylor.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.270
[Applauding]

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.040
She had been an advocate,
and still is,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.530
for respecting young people
by giving them the best

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.180
in literature and being the
person who also was able

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.510
to spot talent early on.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.280
She was the one and the young
youth ambassador, Gene Yang,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.870
I remember when she
said, oh, my God Carla,

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.920
he's going to be the youth
ambassador and this is

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.780
and she had been following him
and then Jacqueline Woodson

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:49.200
in 2004, Deb Taylor
selected Miracles Boys,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.880
and I had my copy, to
be Baltimore's book

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.900
and the library purchased copies
for all young people in the city

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.870
and this was the book in 2003.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.670
She also, and I'm going to
embarrass her a little bit,

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:12.030
was the person who gave
Tupac Shakur his first award.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.620
He won, at 16, Deb Taylor,
took her car and picked

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:25.260
up Tupac Shakur at home,
he was 14, to attend,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.960
and young people please don't
laugh, there was a Boogie

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.630
to the Book Beat Contest
[laughter] you should see their

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.030
faces, Boogie?

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.410
Yes a library rap
contest, right?

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:48.010
It was the '80s, it was
'80s we were all Boogie ing,

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.730
Michael Jackson, it
was boogie, okay?

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:56.690
And Deb Taylor had a library
rap contest and they she picked

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:01.280
up young Tupac Shakur
in her car, he was 14,

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.940
and he performed his library
rap which is now in a vault

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.270
at the library because
it's in his own hand

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.070
about the libraries cool
and he won the contest

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.110
and he also was very smart

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.920
because he put a C
for copyright on it.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.760
So Deb Taylor, thank
you, thank you,

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:29.820
thank you because [applauding]
now, I mentioned Gene

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.120
because he's here with us
today and thanks to John Cole,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.830
the center for the
book, we've had five

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:41.330
and this would be the sixth
youth ambassador's and I

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.200
to want thank John Cole for
having the vision to say

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.830
that this is something that
Library of Congress should do

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.270
and also showing that
respect for our young scholars

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:58.610
who are coming up so, John
we thank you for that.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:04.420
[Applauding] so we
are so fortunate

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.030
to have the Children's
Book Council support

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.570
and Every Child a Reader
Foundation support,

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:17.640
you have been wonderful to help
the library expand this reach

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:24.050
and, Gene I have to tell you, I
have samples of graphic novels

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:28.120
from the Folger Library and
from other places that we'd love

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.850
to see the Library of
Congress through, just saying,

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.160
we're going to still use it.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:37.960
So please let me hand this back
over to Lee Ann, but thank you,

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.760
thank you all for being here.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:50.050
[Applauding]

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.220
&gt;&gt; Dr. Hayden mentioned that
Gene is here, but sitting next

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.640
to Gene is also one

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.350
of our National Ambassador's,
Jon Scieszka.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.510
I think Gene and John ought
to just stand up, please.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:13.220
[Applauding] [laughter]

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.140
I think she slipped in the other
door, I think that's marvelous,

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:19.360
so thank you, Dr. Hayden.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.040
Next, it is my pleasure
to welcome Carl Lennertz

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.560
up here to the podium.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.730
Carl is executive director of
the Children's Book Council

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.380
and of Every Child a Reader.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.350
He is busy, he oversees the
development and expansion

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.570
of both organizations
programming

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.670
and that programming includes a
few things you've probably heard

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.120
before, how about
Children's Book Week

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:49.300
and the Children's
Choice Book Awards?

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.620
As well as, The National
Ambassador

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:56.510
for Young People's
Literature, Carl come on up.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:01.410
[Applauding]

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:06.850
&gt;&gt; I have a B in psychology
[laughter] but I went straight

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:08.610
to work at a bookstore
and that was my education,

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.110
but thank you all.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.810
Okay. Who likes magic?

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:14.110
Good answer.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.650
John not that one, no, no, no.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:18.320
All right give me three to four
minutes to say some thank you's

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.350
and then I have a magic
trick, Shawn is going, oh, no.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:24.730
Thank you to all the
young people here,

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.330
from the Brooklyn Middle
School to the school librarian,

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:32.640
thank you so much for
doing this [applauding]

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.900
but the room is full of a
lot other young people adults

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.750
who are young at heart,
young at spirit and we are

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.670
that day every day because we
read, write, illustrate, publish

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.390
and share books with
children and teens every day

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.260
and that keeps young at heart
and that's a joyful thing.

00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:52.220
We say we go to work, we love
going to work, it is work,

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.210
but it's a joy every day to
do our work to bring books

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:55.900
to young people everywhere.

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:59.740
So I'm going to take a moment
like minute or half or so or two

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.210
or three, to talk about
the hundreds of thousands

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:07.340
of people every day who bring
books to readers everywhere.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:10.110
Some of us here today and
watching on live stream,

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:14.490
not too nervous, book publishers
who discover talented writers,

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:17.960
print their works and get them
to readers, there's a lot more

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.520
than that, but I only
have five minutes.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:22.180
The book publishers
also support the work

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.540
of Children Book Council
and Every Child a reader,

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.170
including the Ambassador
Program,

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:28.330
thank you all here today,
thank you for the board members

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:29.740
who made it and thank you

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.790
for all the Children Book
Council Members watching

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:33.370
at work.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.780
Some of us here today are
librarians those amazing,

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.740
amazing people in every
town, city in America,

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:42.950
I'm a library kid from a small
town, I went there every day,

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.900
bringing books to kids
and adults everywhere,

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.010
but special thanks to the
super hero of librarians,

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.660

Gale, Benny all of you, it's
been a joy, thank you so much,

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.430

which I'll come back
to in just a moment.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.370
Some of us here are independent
booksellers for real, former,

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.930
present and the in spirit,
those passionate people

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.790
who were librarians in a
community, they're the roots,

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:21.220
they are in touch with
everybody in America more

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.520
than all of us can ever be.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.320
Hundreds of thousands of
booksellers and librarians

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.610
who read the books ahead of time
and reach to the heart and soul

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.250
of communities across America,

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.450
we would not have the country
we have now, the diverse spirit,

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:34.750
the talent, the literature

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.010
without independent
booksellers and librarians.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:40.480

Okay. This one's underlined

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.450

your professions as important

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.200
to the health and well being
of our kids and to us as much

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.570
as doctors and nurses.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.110

I'm coming to the end.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.940
I'm here on behalf of

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:44.800
and for Jacqueline, for your
time giving the interviews it

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.900
was just so wonderful,
it's stressful.

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.500
It's say something different
to each person, but thank you

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.820
for doing that, we've got major
coverage across the country,

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:54.370
we're the Library of
Congress, I think we're talking

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.620
about a one hundred million
dollar media impression story

00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.920
about books, reading, love
of books, it was wonderful.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.790

and now for the magic.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:24.730
No, not my trick, just a second,
to the magic makers the writers,

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.660
illustrators everywhere
who create the word

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.770
and picture stories that
delight us every day and yes,

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:33.920
talking back to the young at
heart thing, Jon Scieszka,

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.890
you make me smile
every time I see you,

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:38.740
your books make me smile,
Gene Yang, you brought me back

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.200
to the world of comic
books I left that world

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.090
in a shadow here, brought
me back, thank you.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:47.730
And Jacqueline Woodson, what
a gift to the world you are,

you teach us, you guide us, you
make us wiser, better, stronger,

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:55.010
this last [inaudible] work the
summer was just the coolest

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:59.500
phone call ever, it was just all
about the love of books and art

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.630
and illustration
and the highlight

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.560
of the last year was your
selection as the ambassador.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.650
We're happy for you, your
family, for us and mostly,

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:09.580
for the young people you'll
reach with your message

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.700
and energy and the
power of storytelling.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.620
Thank you all of you and the
children of the book world,

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.080
you make a difference every day.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.380
We'll see again soon

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.090
in Children's Book Week
the first week in May,

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:23.280
The National Festival of Book,
Jackie's on the road talking,

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.600
selling her books,
doing her thing

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.850
and doing for us along the way.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.150
All right.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.620
Time for my magic act I
am going to disappear back

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.620
to my seat [laughter] and let
the real magic makers take

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.420
the stage

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:43.040
[Applauding]

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Carl.

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:45.670
Very nice.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:49.400
Next it is my pleasure to
be reminded that I'm shorter

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:54.160
than Carl [laughter] it is my
pleasure to welcome Gene Yang

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.140
to the stage, but I'm going
to tell you a little bit

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.350
about him just in
case you didn't know.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:01.580
For the past two
years Gene has served

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:05.550
as the 5th national Ambassador
for Young People's Literature.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:08.320
He was born and raised in
California and is the son

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.880
of Chinese immigrants,

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.350
he has been drawing
comics since the 5th grade.

00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:18.330
In 2006, his book, American
Born Chinese was published

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:21.260
and it became the first
graphic novel to be nominated

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.790
for a National Book Award
and it was the first

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:28.070
to win the American Library
Association's Prints Award.

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:32.430
In 2013, his two
volume graphic novel

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.310
about the Boxer Rebellion
entitled:

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.930
Boxers and Saints was
not nominated as well

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:41.800
for a National Book Award and
won the L.A. Times Book Prize.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.360
In addition and I could go on
but, in addition to cartooning,

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.560
he is also a teacher,

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.810
he is currently teaching
creative writing

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:53.930
and he has been a tremendous
National Ambassador.

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:58.410
His platform, Reading Without
Walls has challenged all of us

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.510
to stretch our reading habits
in very important ways, Gene?

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:11.040
[Applauding]

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.900
&gt;&gt; Good morning everyone.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.200
&gt;&gt; [All together] Good morning.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.550
&gt;&gt; I am so excited to be here.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:19.130
Two years ago in this same
building in a different room,

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:23.700
but the same building I got
the fanciest thing that I own,

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:28.030
got the National Ambassador for
Young People Literature medal

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.730
from the Library of Congress,
from ever Every Child a reader,

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.560
from the Children's
Books Council

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:36.290
and the last two years have
been among the most amazing

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:37.590
of my life.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.690
I want to thank Dr. Hayden and
Carl and Shawn and everyone else

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:41.990
for all of your support.

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:46.330
I want to especially thank the
librarians and the teachers

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:49.600
and the booksellers that have
made these past two years

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.900
so magical.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.020
For the last two years I've
gotten to go around the country

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:57.680
to talk to young people from all
different communities in America

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:01.990
and what I've discovered
is that kids love books,

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:05.930
despite what some adults
might lead you to think,

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.890
kids still love books,
and they love books

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:11.690
for the same reason
we all love books it's

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:16.540
because stories help us
make sense of our lives,

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:22.520
stories help us make sense of
the world and that's why I am

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.380
so excited to be here
today because today,

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.040
we all in this room,
we get to witness one

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.460
of the greatest storytellers
of our time,

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:36.490
receive the National Ambassador
for Young People's medal,

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:43.150
Jacqueline Woodson is one of
my heroes, she is a person

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.860
that I deeply admire, I admire
her, not just as a writer,

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:48.370
but also a human being.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.960
In many ways I believe that her
ambassadorship is simply going

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.850
to be an extension of the
work she's already doing.

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:59.080
If you've have had the
pleasure of reading one

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.250
of Jackie's books, if you
had the pleasure of sitting

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:03.830
in on one of her speeches,

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:07.440
you know that through her
words whether they're spoken

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:12.290
into a microphone or written
on a page, she teaches us

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.470
about the world, she helps
us make since of life

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:19.590
and make sense of the world,
her words bring us hope,

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:22.570
her words bring about change.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:25.500
Like I said, she's one of my
heroes and if she isn't one

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.130
of yours yet, give her a few
minutes, wait until she gets

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.710
up here, she'll be
one of yours too.

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:36.400
Thank you all for being here, I
know you all are just as excited

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.430
as me to celebrate
Ambassador Jacqueline Woodson.

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.230
Thank you so much.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:51.430
[Applauding]

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:55.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you Gene and thank you
for your last two years, really.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:21:05.180
[Applauding]

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.370
I ask Gene to stay here
with me and now I'm going

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:12.530
to ask Dr. Hayden to join
us because we're going

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:17.200
to start telling you
really cool things

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.670
about Jackie [laughter]

middle graders, and children.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:33.570
Her books address important

and kindness, incarceration,
identity,

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:43.240
mixed race experiences,

For some specifics, Gene or Dr.
Hayden, either way [laughter]

&gt;&gt; In 2014, she received
the National Book Award

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:10.040
for your New York Times
bestselling memoir,

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.910
"Brown Girl Dreaming"
you all read this book?

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:13.930
You haven't read this book, you
should be a little bit ashamed,

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.730
it's an amazing book
[applauding]

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:23.330

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:06.470
should we get a drum in here?

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:11.010
She officially becomes the
6th National Ambassador

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:14.120

to make it official as
soon as Jackie gets up here

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.510
and places the medallion
around her neck.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:31.240
[Applauding]

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.600
&gt;&gt; The Olympics [laughter]

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.820
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.160
[Applauding]

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.460
Get a three some.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.160
[Applauding]

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.290
&gt;&gt; Okay. Our photographer
is right there waiting

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:52.150
for a great picture and then
I'm going to get out of it.

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:53.450
Okay. Now of you three.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:54.750
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:56.050
&gt;&gt; [Laughter]

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:57.350
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:01.380
&gt;&gt; Nice. Okay, Shawn do
you need any other shots?

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.680
You're good.

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.980
All right.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.330
Excellent, now Jacqueline
and Dr. Hayden are going

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:09.180
to have a little conversation
and about ten minutes

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.490
into the conversation,
Jacqueline's going to come

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:15.440
up here and make some remarks,
especially for all of us,

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.360
and then we'll open
it up for questions

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.880
from the audience
starting with our students

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.380
from Brooklyn Middle School.

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:24.680
Thanks.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.660
&gt;&gt; Well, this is just
an honor for all of us

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:30.570
and a special pleasure?

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:31.870
&gt;&gt; Yay [laughter]

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:36.180
&gt;&gt; Special, special,
pleasure yes, my copy.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:41.210
Yes, my copy [laughter]
just saying,

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:44.300
but you have been
such an inspiration.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.660
&gt;&gt; Oh, so have you,
Dr. Hayden, thank you.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:52.200
&gt;&gt; Now, I remember my favorite
book was called, "Bright April"

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:57.900
and it was the first time that
I could see myself in a book,

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:02.150
little girl, she was brown,
she had pigtails, all of that

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:05.640
and you're talk about not
seeing yourself reflected

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.760
and that's why "Miracle's
Boys" was one of the books

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.170
that people say,
wow I see myself,

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:13.550
what does that mean
to see yourself?

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:16.250
&gt;&gt; Well, I think it's so
important looking back

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:20.420
on the work of Dr. [Inaudible]
who talks about the importance

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.620
of young people having
both mirrors and windows.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:28.640
So they have books where they
can look in and see a brown girl

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:34.980
or a young Latin boy or an
Asian girl and see some part

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:37.790
of their identity in the
book and that's a mirror

00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:42.110
and it makes them aware of
their presence in a bigger world

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:46.800
and I think we also talk about
books having windows so you see

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.920
into other worlds and for me,
as a young person growing up,

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:54.190
I had many, many windows into
white worlds and very few books

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:59.020
where young kids of color
were reflected on the pages

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.650
until I think one

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:06.170
of the earliest books I remember
reading was Virginia Hamilton's

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.500
oh, which Virginia "Zeely"

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:09.800
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.910
&gt;&gt; And "Zeely" and it was about
two kids and they were going

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:15.480
down south and there was
so much of me on the page

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:19.800
and another one was Mildred
Taylor's, "Thunder Hear My Cry"

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:25.320
and it was so eye opening to see
a reflection of myself in Cassie

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.970
and suddenly realize that
there I was on the page

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:31.570
and that I could be on the
page and not only could I be

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:37.010
on the page, but I could grow up
to be a woman of color who wrote

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:39.070
because here was,
Mildred Taylor,

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:41.130
here was Virginia
Hamilton who were women

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:43.310
of color telling stories.

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:46.690
So I think it legitimizes
us in this way

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:50.810
that we don't realize
our absence until we see

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.880
that presence on the page.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.630
&gt;&gt; Now, you mentioned
wanting to write

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:58.090
and seeing you could write, how
young were you when you said,

00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:59.580
boy, I like this writing?

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:00.930
&gt;&gt; [Laughter]

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:03.700
&gt;&gt; Reading, but writing
and I want to produce.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.970
&gt;&gt; I's known I wanted to write
since I was seven and I remember

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:10.080
as you young person loving
the physical act of writing,

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.190
of holding a pencil and seeing

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.240
that putting letters
together made words

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:17.330
and words made sentences and
sentences made paragraphs

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:19.830
and that writing was just
that organic, you know,

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:22.330
that all you needed was
that pencil and that paper

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:26.480
and an imagination and
the rest was there,

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.180
you didn't need any
expensive paraphernalia

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.300
to be able to create art.

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:35.600
&gt;&gt; Wow. Turning to
the students here,

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.920
in terms of paraphernalia
[laughter] and things like that

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.990
because there are so many
distractions and things

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:46.800
and so people have said, you
know, reading is disappearing

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.030
and what's going on with
young people what do you

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:56.590
&gt;&gt; I don't think I think we
see fewer books sometimes,

00:28:56.590 --> 00:29:00.290
but I don't think
people are not reading,

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:02.940
I think sometimes we
have to wrestle them

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:08.140
and get their paraphernalia
[laughter] out of their hand

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.730
and remind them of the glory
of reading, but I think,

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:16.420
as Gene said, young people
love story and they love

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:23.010
to be engaged that way and there
are many ways in which we read;

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:25.840
so I think even though we're not
always seeing them with a book

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:28.040
in their hand, sometimes they
have a book in their ear,

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.740
sometimes they're
reading on a tablet,

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:32.820
sometimes someone is
telling them a story,

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.770
sometimes they're creating a
story in their head in some way.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:39.780
So I think it's definitely
gotten more challenging,

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.930
but we're a country that
has always had this shift

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:49.950
and so we figure out ways of
engaging people where they are

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:53.300
and if they are in a world where
there's a lot of technology,

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:57.160
then what are we going to do
to shift them toward reading?

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.550
How do we engage with that
technology to get them

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:03.730
where they're engaging
with narratives?

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:08.620
&gt;&gt; Poetry has another
way, a gateway into that.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:13.200
Now, when did you start with
poetry as another extension of

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.890
&gt;&gt; You know, I didn't I
was very afraid of poetry

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:20.000
when I was a kid, I always
thought it was this, kind of,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.100
secret code that I was emit
to understand and it wasn't

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.390
until I remember
hearing an album,

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:31.600
my mom was playing this album
and it was Nikki Giovanni

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.800
and so it was early spoken word
and I was like, what is that?

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.510
And I think it was my
sister that said, "you know,

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:40.060
that's Nikki Giovanni, that's
poetry" and I'm like, "no,

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.190
that's not, like,
I understand that,

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:43.490
that's not poetry" [laughter]

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:44.790
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:48.860
&gt;&gt; And then later on,
writers like Langston Hughes

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:51.650
and Claude McKay and
all of these poets

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.980
who suddenly were speaking
a language I understood,

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.000
unlocked it so that
I could begin

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.750
to understand other
poets the more, kind of,

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:06.570
incomprehensible poets
[laughter] by poetry, you know,

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:09.250
I learned to do the work
of deconstructing poetry

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:11.100
because I had the
gateway into people like,

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:18.710
Langston Hughes and, you know,
and Nikki Giovanni, Audre Lorde,

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:22.720
Gwendolyn Brooks, Angelina
Weld Grimké and so many

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.300
of the writers who
helped me figure that out.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:29.400
&gt;&gt; I remember my grandmothers,
Paul Laurence Dunbar

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.290
and I was like, how
could you do the dialect?

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:33.930
And she said, "I know it"

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.230
&gt;&gt; I know it.

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:36.530
&gt;&gt; I could do it, I
know what this is.

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:37.830
&gt;&gt; Had a real big
party in the house

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:39.130
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.430
&gt;&gt; the other night.

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:41.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:43.030
&gt;&gt; I love him.

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:45.230
&gt;&gt; Right. Now, Tupac, we mention
and rap is another way or

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:49.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah. He was an amazing poet,
I mean, Tupac when you look

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:51.660
at The Rose That
Grew From Concrete

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:56.450
and just the he was not only
a poet, he was an activist

00:31:56.450 --> 00:32:01.200
and I think that's what was so
phenomenal about him and so many

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.350
of the young people
who were rapping,

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:07.450
they were telling stories,
they were telling history,

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.870
they were breaking down
where we are in the moment

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:12.740
and they were doing it in a
way, going back to shifting,

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:15.780
where young minds could
understand what they were trying

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.970
to say and they were
asking big questions

00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:20.530
and I think that's what
all good literature does,

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:23.820
is ask questions of the
reader, of the listener

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:25.990
about the moment they're in.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:31.480
&gt;&gt; Speaking of the moment, your
platform, "reading equals hope

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:37.690
and change" for your time,
how do you see that evolving?

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:42.210
Because this is an interesting
time to be an ambassador,

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:44.070
to work with the young people,

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:48.170
to ask questions,
to answer questions.

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:54.030
&gt;&gt; So "reading equals hope
times change" is the platform

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:57.500
that I came up with, that
we came up with that speaks

00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.860
to the fact that reading
does allow we go into a book

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.790
because we're hopeful for
something, we're hopeful

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:05.230
for a good story, we're
hopeful to meet some mirrors

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:09.210
on the page, we're hopeful
for great characterization

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:13.540
and when we come out of
a book, we're different

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:17.870
and that difference is because
we've met the writer half way,

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:20.780
and I'm going to talk more
about this in my very short talk

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:24.290
after this, but I think
that books can change us,

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:28.030
they can help us begin to
have the bigger conversations,

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:35.060
they can help us see worlds
and identities and ideas

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.030
that we've never
thought about before

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:39.760
until they've been brought to
the page and we've met them

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.120
on the page; and so I think we
come out of a book different

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.620
than we were than
when we went in it.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.860
&gt;&gt; Now, one of the
questions I had here

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:51.130
that you've been
applauded and criticized

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:54.360
for tackling tough
issues, getting back

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:58.640
to respecting young people,
that they can handle discussions

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.840
about tough issues, they're
looking to books sometimes

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.110
to help them through it where
they don't have foster care

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:09.930
and incarceration and why is
that important that we have it?

00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:12.970
&gt;&gt; I think the first thing is
I'm not trying the hear the

00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:15.950
haters so, you know,
they from the beginning

00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:18.060
of time people who have had

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:19.450
&gt;&gt; Listen to this.

00:34:19.450 --> 00:34:24.160
&gt;&gt; who've tried to create change
have been blasted against,

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.460
right?

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.140
And I think it's because
people are afraid.

00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:29.890
When we look at the issue
of mass incarceration

00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:34.970
in our country I think it's a
sin not to speak to it and not

00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:39.050
to let the young people
who have people who have

00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:41.480
in their families,
in their lives

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:45.440
who are incarcerated let them
know that they're not alone

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.470
on that journey and that
there is nothing wrong

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:52.550
with their family makeup and
there is nothing, you know,

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:56.880
when I wrote, "Visiting Day"
it was because I had grown

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.970
up with my uncle in prison
and it was this, kind of,

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:03.220
thing we weren't suppose to talk
about and I never understood

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.540
where the shame came from
and looking at it now, again,

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:09.740
going back to mass
incarceration, how can we try

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:13.910
to hide something that's
so visible in our society?

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:17.620
And if we don't talk about it
we can't begin to change it,

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.350
we can just, kind of make
believe it doesn't exist

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:23.940
and so I think any
writer who's going to try

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:27.570
to have harder conversations,
is going to get criticized.

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:34.170
I remember writing, "If You
Come Softly" where, you know,

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:38.320
an African American boy gets
killed by cops in a case

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:42.780
of mistaken identity, I remember
people saying this would never

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.100
happen, you know?

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:48.750
Is and this was twenty years ago
and at some point you're kind

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:51.680
of questioning your own
reality because you think, oh,

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:56.650
maybe this doesn't happen, but
you know it does and that kind

00:35:56.650 --> 00:36:00.260
of gas lighting can happen
when you don't have the proof

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:04.480
of books and experiences in
the world so that you can go

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.900
to that book and say, yeah, you
know, I'm not alone in this,

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.650
yeah, I was right in
thinking about that

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:10.730
because someone else
is thinking this too.

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:13.950
&gt;&gt; And young people can
see it and discuss it,

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:16.510
and they can handle it.

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:18.080
I think they can too.

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:23.370
Now, you also said, "brilliance
is passion recognized"

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:26.050
which is a wonderful
phrase and in terms

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:28.650
of encouraging young
readers and young authors

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:32.070
and young poets that
they see that.

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:33.370
&gt;&gt; Yes that they know.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.070
I think it's so important,
I mean, I was talking

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:40.060
to my Brooklyn friends and we
were talking about their talents

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:46.080
and their plans for going to
Duke Ellington and what they do

00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.400
and it is, I think,

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.210
that sometimes people
think there's just one way

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:54.940
to be brilliant, there's maybe
only academic brilliance or

00:36:54.940 --> 00:37:01.560
but I think our brilliance
is our passion recognized

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.310
and celebrated, right?

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:08.870
When I know that I'm kind of
a good writer and it's nice

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:14.320
because it's also what I love
to do and I think because I love

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:18.260
to do it, I want to do it
the best that I possibly can

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.590
and I remember having
a teacher say,

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:22.930
when you chose a career choose
something you love doing

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:25.540
because you're going to be doing
it for the rest of your life.

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:26.840
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.360
&gt;&gt; And I think that those
words stayed with me

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:31.240
because I thought hopefully
I would live a long life

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:35.820
and the idea of waking up
every day and being unhappy

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:39.040
with the work you're doing
was heartbreaking to me

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:44.430
and so I honed the thing
that I felt was my brilliance

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:48.380
and worked at it until it became
the thing I wanted it to be

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:50.620
in the world, the
stories I wanted to tell,

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:53.550
and I think everyone much has
that, everyone has that thing

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:56.960
that they're really good at,
that they really love doing

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.170
and our work as adults,
is to not kill that fire,

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:06.510
your work as young people, is to
not let that fire get murdered

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:12.930
and then we get to see all of
that brilliance in the world

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:16.670
in a way that transforms
it and transforms us.

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:19.260
&gt;&gt; Can writing help with that?

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:22.100
As you said, look
through moments in time

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:25.260
into a more hopeful
place, about writing it,

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:28.810
expressing it, music,
another way.

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:30.110
&gt;&gt; I think writing can help

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:33.850
with everything [laughter]
I think writing is, like,

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:38.370
is the bomb [laughter]
I talk about writing

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:42.630
because I questions and I
do think that there is a way

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:45.900
where we can sit and begin
to figure out who we are,

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.040
and who we're becoming, and
what the questions that we have

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.720
through writing and
through reading.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:55.970
So I believe deeply,
deeply in writing and I love

00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:59.960
when young people want to be
writers because I know I'm here

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.880
because of Nikki Giovanni, I'm
here because of Toni Morrison,

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.460
I'm here because
of Langston Hughes,

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.040
I'm here because
of Gwendolyn Brooks

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:10.550
and if they had not come
before me, I wouldn't be here

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:14.850
and I feel like the same thing
the young people are here

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:18.710
because of us, because of, you
know, Gene and because of John

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:22.720
and because of Catherine
and me and let

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.820
that circle be unbroken,
you know what?

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:28.460
People keep coming and telling
their stories because now,

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:31.210
I mean, y' all must have
some amazing stories to tell

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:33.330
about this moment in time.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.700
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see you're nodding.

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.270
Do we have time for a few

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:41.790
&gt;&gt; I think you've
got some remarks.

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:43.090
&gt;&gt; Remarks.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:44.630
&gt;&gt; If you want to go ahead
and then we'll respond

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.310
to questions, how about that?

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:47.610
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:48.910
&gt;&gt; Is that

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:50.210
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:51.510
&gt;&gt; Gene has my speech.

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:52.810
&gt;&gt; [Laughter]

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:54.110
&gt;&gt; Thank you, this one.

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:58.620
&gt;&gt; And I am going to exit.

00:39:58.620 --> 00:39:59.920
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Dr. Hayden.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:03.020
So I'm not going to
be long because I am

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:06.480
so much more interested in your
questions maybe I'll answer a

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.910
few of them and what
I have to say,

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:13.120
but I love when young
people ask me questions.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.770
But I was told I
needed to say something

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:18.490
about becoming ambassador.

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:20.990
So is it still morning?

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:23.720
Because I start it with
saying good morning.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:27.790
Okay. Oh, I have the
lavalier so people

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:30.350
who are live streaming is
it okay, is my sound okay?

00:40:30.350 --> 00:40:31.930
I'm good, I could
keep using this?

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:33.230
I could use both of them?

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:34.930
Thank you.

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:39.460
So it's an amazing honor to
stand before you in the Library

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:43.760
of Congress this morning, it's
also an honor to be living

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:47.160
in this time to bare witness
to our countries beautiful

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:51.230
and complicated history
and its immense possibility

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.980
because I do believe we're
living in a time of great,

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:56.190
great, great possibility.

00:40:56.190 --> 00:41:00.890
What an honor to
follow the footsteps

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:04.930
of groundbreaking ambassador's
that came before me, Gene Yang,

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:07.460
who is not only my
absolute hero,

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.380
so which makes me
think he read my speech

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:16.580
because he called me his hero
[laughter] but he's also a hero

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:19.720
to both my children
and to many children.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.970
Kate DiCamillo, who is
the inspiration for us,

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:27.670
naming our cat Fred after Bink
and Gollie, who never fails

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:29.390
to make me laugh
or make me choke

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:30.800
up with each book she writes.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:34.560
Katherine Paterson one of is one
of the kindest people I know.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:37.650
Walter Dean Myers, who came
into the world and left it

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:41.030
with his untimely passing
filled with a body of work

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:46.730
that changed consciousness of so
many young men and boys of color

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:51.830
and so many others as well,.

00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:55.380
I miss Walter.

00:41:56.430 --> 00:42:00.350
Walter, who during his time
as National Ambassador,

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:04.440
tirelessly traveled and spoke
to the many who had not thought

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.660
of themselves as part
of a bigger world

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:10.790
or deeper narrative; and of
course, our beloved pioneer,

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:14.990
Jon Scieszka neighbor,
friend, and awesome writer

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:18.510
who is sitting among us this
morning I would not be here

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:20.570
without y' all.

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:22.810
First and foremost, I
want to thank the people

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:24.800
who have worked beyond
hard to bring me

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:28.510
to this moment the not
fabulous Library of Congress

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:31.380
and Dr. Carla Hayden, my sister

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:35.470
from another mother
and history maker.

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:40.020
My dear friend, Debbie
Taylor and all of my people

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:45.460
at Enoch Pratt Library it
was here doing a reading

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:48.690
for my first novel,
"Last Summer with Maizon"

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:53.750
that I rediscovered the
breath and depth of libraries.

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:56.980
Readings, conversation,
children's programs,

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:00.700
programs for young mothers,
adult literacy classes,

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:05.050
passport renewals, puppet
making, all of it was,

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:11.450
is happening at the libraries,
Enoch Pratt and nationwide.

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:18.270
As I began to travel, I saw in
every single state the enormity,

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:22.330
both large and small,
had to offer anyone

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:24.560
who stepped through their doors.

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:28.500
I rediscovered that libraries
aren't just for some people,

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:30.040
they're for all people.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:34.350
I'd like to thank The
Children's Book Council,

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:38.440
Every Child a reader and
the committee that chose me

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:44.410
to succeed, Gene, DeAndra,
Sarah, Earl, Travis,

00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:50.500
Starr and Ellen and of course,
Gene, I love your faith in me

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:58.440
and I'm grateful, I
think [laughter] for it.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:03.290
I wouldn't be standing here
without my Penguin family,

00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:08.520
my long suffering editor Nancy
Paulsen [laughter] Jen, Ellis,

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:13.900
Jocelyn, Felicia, Cecilia
and the rest of the crew.

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:16.870
A writer writes in solitude
and then steps outside

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:19.910
of the solitude to get the help
they need to shape their work

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:24.000
into something that the rest
of the world can understand.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.880
When I wrote "Brown Girl
Dreaming" they were 31 rewrites

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.750
before it became the book
so many of y' all have read

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:33.770
and some tweaks between the
first and second addition,

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:36.060
so if you have that
first addition,

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:41.620
hold on [laughter] my eyes
in the world are my own world

00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:44.870
and the eyes of those who
I trust deeply, Nancy,

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:48.120
thank you for being my second
set of eyes in the world.

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:51.220
I am thankful too to my
amazing family, my partner,

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:55.960
Juliet our children, Toshi
and Jackson Leroi and all

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:59.140
of my sisters from other mothers
including Linda Velarosa,

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:01.380
Genna Welch, Jane
[inaudible] and the ones

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:04.510
who couldn't be here with us as
well, there are a lot of them,

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:08.580
y' all be sitting here
forever [laughter] and I want

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:12.380
to thank those who have
been with me on this journey

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:17.030
from it feels like the moment it
began, including Katie Horning,

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:21.770
Dr. [Inaudible] Rita
Auerbach, Dean Snyder.

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:25.450
In this room with us
this morning are those

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:31.550
who guide us now as ancestors,
Robin Smith, Virginia Hamilton,

00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:34.060
my mom and grandmother.

00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:36.390
Let us each take a moment
and remember someone

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:39.930
who has left this place for
the next one, who continues

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:42.730
from that place to walk with us.

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:45.520
In the African American
tradition there was the calling

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:49.730
of names where we call our
ancestors back into the room,

00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:53.710
where we acknowledge that
because of them we are.

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:58.200
Let us take a moment and
remember friends, loved ones,

00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:03.980
relatives, anyone we can think
of, writers who have left us

00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:08.510
and who remain important
and call out their name.

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:53.240
[Inaudible]

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.540
Thank you.

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:02.360
"Your world is as
big as you make it.

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:07.150
I know, for I used to abide in
the narrowest nest in a corner,

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:09.830
my wings pressing
close to my side.

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:12.070
But I sighted the
distant horizon

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:16.050
where the skyline encircled
the sea and I throbbed

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:19.550
with a burning desire to
travel this immensity.

00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:23.250
I battered the cordons around
me and cradled my wings

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:31.840
on the breeze, then soared
to the uttermost reaches

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:35.660
with rapture, with
power, with ease!"

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:40.330
I wish I had written that
poem because I didn't.

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:44.520
It was written by the poet
Georgia Douglas Johnson

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:48.350
who for more than 40 years
hosted a salon right here

00:47:48.350 --> 00:47:53.290
in D.C. on Smith Street S.W.
for those you who don't know,

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:58.530
a salon is basically a gathering
where you come and eat food,

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:03.110
drink about wine
and organic milk,

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.470
young people [laughter] read
your work and read the work

00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:11.930
of others, maybe get a
cipher going and share ideas

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:15.820
about the world and through
the sharing of these ideas,

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:18.180
you begin to change
your own way of image

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:24.630
and the way others think,
but it starts with gathering.

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:29.220
Through Douglas' salon came some
of the most influential writers

00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:34.540
of the Harlem Renaissance from
Alain Locke, to Langston Hughes

00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:38.760
from Angelina Weld Grimké, to
Jean Toomer poets that I hope

00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:40.110
by the end of my ten year

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:44.050
as National Ambassador I'll
know how to pronounce the word

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:48.950
and we will all know them.

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:52.600
Reading equals hope
times change.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:56.680
When Georgia Douglas Johnson
began those writing salons no

00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:00.690
one knew that the Harlem
Renaissance would take a very

00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:03.600
important place in history.

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.510
No one knew that one day
Mildred Taylor would write,

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:10.300
"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"
that Gene Yang would write,

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:14.010
"American Born Chinese" that
Simon J. Ortiz would write

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:15.570
"The People Shall Continue"

00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:19.490
or Sherman Alexie would one day
write, "The Absolute True Diary

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:22.670
of a Part time Indian"
these books,

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:26.920
these writers were decades
away from that moment,

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:29.580
many were not even born yet.

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:34.050
The people in Douglas'
salon walked into that room

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:37.090
with a books they were writing
and books they were reading,

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:41.350
they walked into that salon with
hope, they read, they talked,

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:43.600
they laughed, they
drank, their wine

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:48.000
and milk [laughter] they sang
and they changed the world

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.430
because of them I am, because
of them we are gathered here.

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:57.430
Yesterday my family and I spent
the day at the American Museum

00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:00.470
of African American
History and Culture; again,

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:04.180
right here in D.C. it took
over one hundred years to make

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:06.810
that museum a reality.

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:10.380
First it was dreamed,
then it was built,

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:13.480
then people open their trunks
and suitcases and books

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:18.020
and pulled history of African
Americans in this country

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:21.370
from the crevices into which
that history was delicately

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:23.950
and lovingly packed away.

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:25.790
They knew a time would come

00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:31.160
when that history need
a home now is the time.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:33.420
As National Ambassador,
my hope is

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:36.600
to begin conversations
our country is hungry,

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:39.190
but off times, afraid to have.

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:42.910
Some days this place feels
like a country divided,

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:48.430
a country in despair, a country
hungry for a way out of no way,

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:52.310
but what the books will tell
us and continue to show us is

00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:56.290
that there is magic in this
moment we're living in now.

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:58.580
There is so much possibility

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:00.960
and to the young people
gathered here today,

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.960
that power to create
change is in your hearts,

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:09.320
in your heads, in your hands.

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:12.040
I am often asked
about my writing,

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:13.690
when you write this
book or that book,

00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:16.120
what were you trying to teach?

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:20.470
And my answer is always the
same I don't write to teach,

00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:24.410
I write to learn, I write
because I have so many questions

00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:27.690
that only I can answer and
the way can I answer them is

00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:29.720
by putting pen to paper,

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:32.140
the only way I can find
the hope I'm looking

00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:36.130
for in a particular moment, is
to put that hope on the page

00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:39.430
and when I'm done, like many
writers, my hope has been

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:42.180
that the reader will
meet me halfway.

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:45.780
Bring their own ideas
and experiences and hope

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:47.860
to the narrative I've created.

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:51.230
So my hope for the next two
years is that we come together

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:55.520
in many rooms to talk, that
we meet the authors halfway

00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:58.440
and talk about what our
hopes are for the future,

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:03.200
your equations, our plans for
change, that we hold salons

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:08.420
and classrooms and libraries and
book stores and living rooms,

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:10.760
around kitchen tables
and playgrounds,

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:13.490
at hair salons and barbershops.

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:16.630
That we find the books that
tell the stories we need to hear

00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:19.590
and use those stories to
write the next chapter

00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:22.090
in this country's history.

00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:24.110
That we remember
that there was a time

00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:27.920
when people were not
allowed to learn to read

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.800
because reading led to freedom.

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:38.840
It's a lot of things being
in this room, at this podium,

00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:44.380
in front of the all of you in
this moment in time, it's scary,

00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:46.460
it's thrilling, its
mind blowing,

00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:49.150
it's imagining the unimaginable.

00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:51.740
The writer, the activist
Audrey Lorde said we can sit

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:53.810
in our corners mute as bottles

00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:56.520
and we will still
be no less afraid.

00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:01.150
I believe that reading equals
hope, hopes times change,

00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:04.960
I believe that me plus
you equals a conversation,

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:08.560
I believe that hope
minus fear equals change,

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:13.110
I that believe listening plus
hearing minus judgment equals

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:17.380
friendship, these are
just a few of my equations

00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:23.510
in the next two years I'm
eager to gather and hear yours.

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:59.060
[Applauding]

00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.360
&gt;&gt; You did good [laughter]

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:01.940
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:03.480
&gt;&gt; Outstanding.

00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:05.220
Well, now it's time
for some questions

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:09.930
and my audio visual team has
told me that there are two mics

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:13.070
that we float around the room,
if you've got one in your hand,

00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:14.810
would you let me see it?

00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:16.110
Awesome, perfect.

00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:18.140
So how about one of you come
over on this side and one

00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:19.490
of you stay on that side,

00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:21.710
and then if you guys
could raise your hands

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:24.150
when you've got a question,
we'll make sure you get the mic

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:27.350
and the reason we need to make
sure that you use the mic is

00:54:27.350 --> 00:54:30.700
so that our audience that's
watching the live stream

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:34.000
and our recording can
hear your question, okay?

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.300
All right.

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:37.380
&gt;&gt; That's better.

00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.680
&gt;&gt; And if you could
say your name

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:40.760
when you ask the question
that'll be so helpful.

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:42.640
&gt;&gt; My name is Christian
Strickland.

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.070
&gt;&gt; Hey, Christian.

00:54:44.070 --> 00:54:49.460
&gt;&gt; And what do you plan to
do after your term is over?

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:54.570
&gt;&gt; [Laughter] thanks Christian.

00:54:54.570 --> 00:55:00.040
Oh, man [laughter] oh, I think
it's going go so fast and I plan

00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:05.520
to rest [laughter] you know,
I don't plan to stop writing

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:13.150
because I talked about how
much I love writing and I plan

00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:17.080
to be right here all
willing putting this medal

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:19.380
on the next ambassador.

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:32.730
&gt;&gt; Okay. My name is Lucia
Brisbane my question is, okay,

00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:34.870
what do you plan to do
while your ambassador?

00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:38.670
&gt;&gt; So what do I plan to
do while I'm ambassador?

00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:44.310
I plan to do a lot around
trying to get people to gather,

00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:48.880
I don't one thing that I have
to do as ambassador is to travel

00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:51.480
around the country, you
legitimately only have

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:54.610
to travel five times, right?

00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:56.530
[Laughter] that was
one of the promises

00:55:56.530 --> 00:56:01.280
of being ambassador [laughter]
but I think there are all kinds

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:03.090
of ways to gather, I
think we can Skype,

00:56:03.090 --> 00:56:10.540
I think people can come to book
festivals, I think we can gather

00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:15.270
in classrooms; so I
plan to help, kind of,

00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:18.490
get the conversation
going from wherever I am.

00:56:18.490 --> 00:56:21.380
I hope to meet a lot of people,
I hope to travel to a lot

00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:26.650
of juvenile detention centers
and group homes and places

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:28.190
like that to meet people

00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:30.810
who might not otherwise,
have met authors.

00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:35.020
My family's going to Mississippi
in April so I'm planning to go

00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:36.880
to some of the play
schools and libraries

00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:40.080
in rural Mississippi while
I'm there and really,

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:42.400
really just begin
having the conversation

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:45.970
that I hope will become a
very nationwide conversation.

00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:51.590
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:52.890
&gt;&gt; My name is Cameron Jackson

00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:54.800
and I was wondering do you
guys have anybody in mind

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:56.100
to be the next ambassador?

00:56:56.100 --> 00:56:57.400
[Laughter]

00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:00.490
&gt;&gt; Cameron's all ready
to push passed me.

00:57:00.490 --> 00:57:04.660
He's like, do y' all
have someone in mind

00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:07.320
for the next ambassador?

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:09.620
Cameron, I'm sure they're
taking requests [laughter]

00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:15.340
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Deon Odem and
my question is how old were you

00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:16.900
when you first published
your first book?

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:20.730
&gt;&gt; So my first book was,
"Last summer with Maizon"

00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:24.500
and that was published
when I was in my 20's,

00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:28.450
my early 20's it took me about
four years to write that book

00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:30.960
because I didn't know what
I was doing so unlike,

00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:33.130
the many years it took me to
write "Brown Girl Dreaming"

00:57:33.130 --> 00:57:34.610
when I thought I knew
what I was doing,

00:57:34.610 --> 00:57:36.650
I just didn't know
what I was saying,

00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:40.980
but it was finally
published in my early 20's.

00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:43.010
The first book that
there was a book

00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:47.610
that was published before that,
that was really badly written

00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:50.290
by me and really badly
illustrated by Floyd Cooper

00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:54.210
and that book is not
in existence anymore.

00:57:54.210 --> 00:57:59.610
Sometimes a librarian and pull
it out and say, I got that book,

00:57:59.610 --> 00:58:02.290
but "Last Summer with
Maizon" was my first novel.

00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:08.630
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Justice
Bel Perry and my question is,

00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:11.470
out of all books that you
have read and the characters

00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:14.400
that you have met in
those books, what book

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:17.360
or character is most like you?

00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:21.200
&gt;&gt; That's such a great question.

00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:22.730
Oh, my goodness.

00:58:22.730 --> 00:58:27.110
You know, like, it's so funny
because I feel like the person

00:58:27.110 --> 00:58:31.330
that comes to mind that when I
first said that's me was Cassie

00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:35.890
Logan in "Role of Thunder,
Hear My Cry" you know,

00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:40.910
I feel like also Franny in
"Daddy Was a Number Runner"

00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:45.130
and Francis Nolan in "A Tree
Grows in Brooklyn" like,

00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:48.950
anytime there was a girl
around the age I was

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:51.320
when I was reading it, who
had something so for me

00:58:51.320 --> 00:58:53.580
in "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"
the mirror was Brooklyn

00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:56.430
because that's where I live
and so everything Brooklyn

00:58:56.430 --> 00:58:58.010
about that book I
was like, you know,

00:58:58.010 --> 00:59:02.370
I know this even though it
took place probably forty years

00:59:02.370 --> 00:59:08.780
before I began reading it, but
I did and still, do find myself

00:59:08.780 --> 00:59:13.880
in so many characters and don't
have to, you know, be the same,

00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:16.130
you know, as you're
preferred gender, right?

00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:20.040
I found myself in
characters like, you know,

00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:22.780
"Ghost" Jason Reynolds book like
I read that book and I'm like,

00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:25.550
yeah, I was a runner I
could probably beat him,

00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:32.060
but so I really, there
were a lot of characters.

00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:37.310
&gt;&gt; My name is Jocelyn
and my question is,

00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:38.610
have you ever thought

00:59:38.610 --> 00:59:40.620
about having another
career instead of writing?

00:59:40.620 --> 00:59:44.970
&gt;&gt; So I don't know if everyone
heard Jocelyn's question,

00:59:44.970 --> 00:59:47.860
have I thought of having another
career besides being a writer?

00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:51.520
No, I don't think so.

00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:56.190
I would probably to be
a singer, just kidding.

00:59:56.190 --> 00:59:57.490
[Laughter] my family's laughing

00:59:57.490 --> 01:00:01.930
because they've heard
[laughter] yeah, no.

01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:03.230
[Laughter]

01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:09.010
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is
Judea Hercules.

01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:13.250
Did you have a secret
place to go

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:14.750
when you wanted to
write a story?

01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:16.580
&gt;&gt; Do I have a certain
place to go?

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:18.990
So once my family leaves the
house I'm usually writing

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:22.690
at the kitchen table,
but I have tend to I

01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:25.680
like writing downstairs in my
office because it's quietest.

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:31.860
Every time I write I put head
phones on so it helps me round

01:00:31.860 --> 01:00:36.080
out the rest of the world,
so even though I don't have

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:39.430
to physically leave a place,
I do have to, kind of,

01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:42.830
cover up my ears so that noise
isn't coming, but I've been able

01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:46.220
to write on subways, I've
been able to write in cafes,

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:47.660
I've been able to write
in libraries as long

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:49.730
as I have my earphones
on because I don't want

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:52.660
to hear other people's
conversations.

01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:55.870
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Schkiya
Wright and did you ever expect

01:00:55.870 --> 01:00:57.450
to be the Ambassador

01:00:57.450 --> 01:00:59.810
for National Young
People's Literature?

01:00:59.810 --> 01:01:01.110
&gt;&gt; Nope [laughter]

01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:10.620
&gt;&gt; Hi my name is Leah
Redman and my question is,

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:13.060
did you have any
challenges becoming an author

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.880
and how did you overcome them?

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:16.490
&gt;&gt; You know, it's
a good question.

01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:22.050
Why I always quote Katherine
Patterson who says the main rule

01:01:22.050 --> 01:01:23.670
of writing is BIC, right?

01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:27.400
Butt In Chair and, you know,
because basically you have

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:31.210
to be disciplined to be a writer
and I think the older I got

01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:34.880
and there are more and more
things that, as Dr. Hayden

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.600
and I were talking about.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:40.530
There are more things that
distract you from writing land

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:44.250
so as a young person I didn't
know writers, I didn't know

01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:46.070
that someone it wasn't like now

01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:48.740
where you could actually meet
a writer and hear them talk

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:51.940
or go online and see them
talk, or even look at the back

01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:54.800
of the book and see their photo
and know stuff about them,

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:58.540
it was a very different time and
writers seemed really far way

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.890
in something that was
unattainable something you

01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:06.970
couldn't do, but for some reason
I knew I always wanted to do it

01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:09.370
and I wasn't sure
how I was going to.

01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:11.610
So I think the first
huge challenge

01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:12.920
for me was faith, right?

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:15.450
Believing that I could
write these stories

01:02:15.450 --> 01:02:17.560
that might someday
get published.

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:20.260
But in the process of
writing the stories,

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:23.500
I realized that writing
made me happy so even

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:26.850
if they one day didn't get
published, I loved writing them

01:02:26.850 --> 01:02:30.660
and then the big challenge
was finishing stories

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:33.260
and then the big challenge
was rewriting stories

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:34.560
because you write something

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.050
and you think it's done,
right, Jackson Leroi?

01:02:36.050 --> 01:02:38.810
[Laughter] and then you
realize you have to rewrite it

01:02:38.810 --> 01:02:42.470
and rewrite it and rewrite
and so that was a challenge

01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:45.740
and then once realizing how
rewriting made it a better

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:51.000
story, but I think there are
always going to be challenges

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.550
and the question is when
you get to the challenge,

01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:55.390
what you do with it
because there's always going

01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:57.110
to be the book that falls apart

01:02:57.110 --> 01:03:00.370
and you could either just stop
writing and start a new book,

01:03:00.370 --> 01:03:03.000
which is going to fall apart,
and you stop writing that one

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.230
and start a new book, which
is going to fall apart

01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:07.570
or you could push through when
it's falling apart and get

01:03:07.570 --> 01:03:11.520
to the end of it, because I ask
my fellow authors everything we

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.660
write falls apart and that's

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:18.930
when we know the real work
is about to get started.

01:03:18.930 --> 01:03:22.750
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Loren and
my question is how do you come

01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:25.030
up with the topics
for your book?

01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:27.740
&gt;&gt; How do I come up with
the topics for my books,

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:30.650
so there's a saying that if you
survive Kindergarten you have

01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:32.930
enough to write about
for the rest of your life

01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:35.920
and I think it's true I
think so many things happen

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.770
to us every day and
I'm sure John

01:03:38.770 --> 01:03:42.840
and Gene will tell you this,
it's hard to not write,

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:45.820
it's hard not to find material.

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:49.840
So, you know, thoughts I
have, conversations I have,

01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:51.420
sometimes things I read,

01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:55.510
sometimes other books inspire
me, sometimes questions a lot

01:03:55.510 --> 01:03:57.080
of times it's the
questions I have

01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.690
that I'm trying to figure out.

01:03:58.690 --> 01:04:01.090
When I wrote the book "Feathers"
that was actually inspired

01:04:01.090 --> 01:04:04.050
by a story called "The
Selfish Giant" by Oscar Wilde

01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:07.940
and the book was originally
called "The Jesus Boy"

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:10.610
because that's what I
called the main character

01:04:10.610 --> 01:04:12.830
in the selfish giant
and it began to change,

01:04:12.830 --> 01:04:16.400
but it was inspired by something
I first read in the third grade.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.510
So I think that's
where the whole,

01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:21.970
the longer you live the more
stories you have to write.

01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:33.890
&gt;&gt; Is there a specific theme

01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:35.190
&gt;&gt; What's your name?

01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:36.720
&gt;&gt; oh, Justice, my
name is Justice.

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.020
&gt;&gt; Okay.

01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:40.090
&gt;&gt; Is there a specific
theme or topic in all

01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:43.750
of your books are they,
like, different in each one?

01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:45.840
&gt;&gt; They're pretty different.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:51.140
I don't write series because
I get bored after, like,

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:53.750
the second book I've
aspired to do it

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:57.080
and then I either kill
the characters off

01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:02.350
or [laughter] have them move
away or let them a happily ever

01:05:02.350 --> 01:05:07.690
after or something, but I do I
have, I write realistic fiction,

01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:11.830
so that's the genre and
write it both in verse

01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:16.770
and as narrative so, but usually
my characters are different.

01:05:16.770 --> 01:05:21.100
I've written a trilogy, I've
written books that have sequels

01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:26.280
but that's about as
long as I can get.

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:29.630
&gt;&gt; I'm Deon and my question
is, out of the all the books

01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:32.790
that you've written, which
one is your personal favorite?

01:05:32.790 --> 01:05:36.500
&gt;&gt; You know, and
I'm sure, again,

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.220
my fellow ambassador's
will say the same thing,

01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:41.490
I like them for different
reasons, you know,

01:05:41.490 --> 01:05:43.510
I don't have a do y'
all have favorites?

01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:45.380
I mean, because you're

01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:48.070
when writing it it's the
experience you're having

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:52.710
with the book and then sometimes
if the book is old you get tired

01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:55.120
of it, so I have books I
like less than other books,

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:58.070
but I don't have a favorite yet.

01:05:58.070 --> 01:06:00.220
Last question?

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:01.520
Okay.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think so if someone's
missed out of the room,

01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:05.320
want to jump right in.

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:07.230
Your questions have
been terrific kids.

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:08.530
&gt;&gt; Carl.

01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:11.990
&gt;&gt; Oh, you need a
mic, Carl sorry.

01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:13.310
Its coming, its coming.

01:06:13.310 --> 01:06:14.610
There you go.

01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:16.310
&gt;&gt; Carl. When you
first started writing,

01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:19.010
did you show it to a friend?

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:21.540
You seem pretty confident
and you knew what you put

01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:24.580
on paper was good, but what
was your first validation

01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.760
and my point being,
if one of these people

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:28.340
from Brooklyn starts writing,

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:31.840
what would you tell them just
go ahead or show it to a friend?

01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:33.850
&gt;&gt; Well, I would say
it's a good question.

01:06:33.850 --> 01:06:35.530
Who do you show your writing to?

01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:38.230
I think you show it
to people you trust

01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:41.840
because there two kinds
of criticism, right?

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.700
There's constructive criticism
that makes you go running back

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:46.000
to your work and want
to make it better

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.990
and there's destructive
criticism,

01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:50.310
which makes you just want to
throw it away and you want

01:06:50.310 --> 01:06:53.480
to show it to the people who
are going to say, you know,

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.180
here's all the things I love
about this and here are some

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.750
of the questions I might have.

01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:59.770
You know, because that's
helpful and that makes you

01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:03.950
to want go back to it, but
if someone says, you know,

01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:06.430
I don't know this
sucks or, you know,

01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:07.840
you should never
write again, like,

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.420
that's destructive criticism,

01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:14.230
I don't even know why you're
writing that [laughter]

01:07:14.230 --> 01:07:17.900
but one thing I do is
I like I always think

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.160
that is really important
when you have something new

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.420
and you show it to someone
you trust just say to them,

01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:24.570
ask me three questions, like,

01:07:24.570 --> 01:07:27.780
what three questions
do you have?

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:30.010
You know, tell me something
positive and me three questions.

01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:32.850
Oh, I love that character,
I wonder why he to the store

01:07:32.850 --> 01:07:37.080
in the corner, I wonder
why he decided to do this,

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:39.170
I wonder what's going
to happen to him next

01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:41.490
and that gets you
excited and makes you want

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:45.440
to write the next
draft or add to it.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:49.260
So questions not
destructive criticism.

01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:50.560
Thanks Carl.

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:52.210
&gt;&gt; All right.

01:07:52.210 --> 01:07:54.600
I think we're going
to wrap things up.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:55.960
That was awesome; you
have to stay right there

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.260
for a couple more minutes.

01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:58.560
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:59.860
&gt;&gt; So we can clap some
more [laughter] really,

01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:01.560
students from Brooklyn
Middle School thanks

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.860
so much [applauding]

01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:11.370
&gt;&gt; Can I just say one thing?

01:08:11.370 --> 01:08:12.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:13.970
&gt;&gt; So I am sorry.

01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:15.750
I just wanted to give a plug
for We Need Diverse Books

01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:18.380
which has changed the
narrative of literature and I

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:25.890
to want thank them
[applauding] for being

01:08:25.890 --> 01:08:30.140
in the room even though
they're not in the room.

01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:31.730
&gt;&gt; Outstanding.

01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:33.530
Okay. Well, I am confident

01:08:33.530 --> 01:08:36.210
that our Young People's
Ambassador our ambassador

01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:41.050
for Young People's Literature is
well on her way to making lots

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:45.230
of friends in the next couple
of years and getting all of us

01:08:45.230 --> 01:08:51.180
to think very thoughtfully
about reading and writing

01:08:51.180 --> 01:08:52.560
and I really can't say enough.

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:55.550
This has been a terrific
conversation and really,

01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:57.610

at the library don't
just happen magically,

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:36.280
they happen when people come
together and make things happen

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:38.270

blessed at the library
