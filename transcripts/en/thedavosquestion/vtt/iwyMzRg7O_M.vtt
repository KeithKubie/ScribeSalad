00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.240
&gt;&gt; As we know, role model isn't working as
much as it works in other places. Role models

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:22.110
in Amiris have some problems such as [pause]
social values such as religion. Such of the

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:36.000
communities like Islam, as you know Amiris
has many religions, Islam, Judaist, Christianity,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.890
and other religions. It is a kind of problem
for successing role models. And also, countries

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:55.190
in Amiris have many problems to plan economy
plans such as role models. They have many

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:04.080
problems in social issues. They have tries
in their country using, many tries in one

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:16.139
country, that they can't use and they can't
plan economy care plans for their future.

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:24.299
I think that it is a problem but is not complexity
problem for the countries. With the remainder

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:34.369
of the time we can have role models for the
future. And it is far away from year end.

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:42.720
We have a lot of time to plan such pans in
our country and do it in the best way. Thank

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.779
you.
