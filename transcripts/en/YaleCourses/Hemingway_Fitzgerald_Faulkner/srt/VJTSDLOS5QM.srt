1
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,550
Um, about the film, um,
those of you who were there,

2
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,890
we realized that, um, the film
is very, very different. Uh,

3
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,240
um, on the book, um, uh, is, is great. Uh,

4
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,270
uh, Brit rating on the
quote of five, in fact,

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,440
as, uh, the, uh, many
clever transformations,

6
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,080
as long as they pull it out,
the lawyer,

7
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:43,710
he lives in denial,
uh,

8
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,840
becomes the occasion for
low joke about the eat and,

9
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,270
uh, how [inaudible] thing you really, uh,

10
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,640
the carry about half full steam.

11
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,180
That job there was repeated
throughout there. Really. Uh,

12
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:02,310
so it's a very clever transformation

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,560
to see a movie on your own just to

14
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,110
swing later. Um, Faulkner is, um,

15
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:18,230
is actually very impressive to know that
he could write something like this arm

16
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:20,510
if you're read.
Uh,

17
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:25,460
but he can also rate the screenplay for
the half and half, not five. So He's,

18
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,910
you know,
just kind of a,

19
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:32,000
almost two sides of his
background in terms of rating. Uh,

20
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:36,830
so this is just the, just to
alert you to, um, this, the,

21
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,020
the existence of the film.
Um,

22
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:45,260
but I also wanted to use this as an
occasion to talk about a remark that,

23
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,100
uh, Howard Hughes at Howard
passed, um, made about, uh,

24
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,280
devote that to half and half
not, and, um, in many ways,

25
00:01:56,281 --> 00:02:01,020
adding insult to injury there was
completely changing the plot line of the

26
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,330
novel.
Uh,

27
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,630
but he also had some
generous things to stay, uh,

28
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:11,180
about the novel and
about Hemingway. So, uh,

29
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,730
because it was working with
having way and having a,

30
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,340
it was on record as being quite unhappy
with the way that his novel, uh,

31
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,000
was transformed. So how the last claim
to have clear from having way, um,

32
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,210
they had to have and have
not a with junk and tally,

33
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,450
that was the excuse for his
completely changing the novel arrive.

34
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,080
It started out being really
took nothing silly, um,

35
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,570
should have the freedom to,
uh, change, uh, as he saw fit,

36
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:46,700
which he did a two or a staggering degree.

37
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,400
But however else we made in the tradition
of people saying negative things about

38
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:58,000
to happen and help nurse, um, and uh,

39
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,350
we can look at a few other instances are
people expressing a lot tells about the

40
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:06,430
novel. Um, this is, um,

41
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,850
one of the most extreme down wash was
to have and have not is stupid and

42
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:17,340
foolish,
both a disgrace to a good radar,

43
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,460
a boat which should
never have been printed.

44
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:27,330
It contains passages of golden writing
and the pause of three good show stories

45
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,090
when one of these was up here
and ask why as the short story.

46
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,550
It was much better there
and not broken up by the,

47
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,640
in the concision of the
chapter. Um, so you know,

48
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:47,641
about as as hostile a review
as one could get a auto.

49
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,120
I should also say that,

50
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:54,150
but we've used our Jamera in themselves
and I often book reviewers feel the need

51
00:03:55,361 --> 00:04:00,340
to be critical so itself is
completely within their convention.

52
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,270
Um, a book reviewing.
Um, here's another, uh,

53
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,110
to my mind much more,
uh, much as the Muslims,

54
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,870
more perceptive of, um, and
much truer to the spirit of, uh,

55
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,480
to have an half,
not from a great critic,

56
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,590
Alpha Kaizen in new having way,

57
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,270
not altogether.

58
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,930
They have passages and passages in which
the old ac ruins comes through with the

59
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,610
slippery rhythm,
the virtual assonance,

60
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:39,140
that awful ways of phases fused with
sessions before he is cleverness that the

61
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:42,120
click clack of the bead is like a hits.

62
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:48,010
And also unusual awkwardness for this is
a Hemingway who is rather less sure of

63
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:53,620
himself than usual and a
good deal more into hence.

64
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,920
So this to my mind catches very well,
uh,

65
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,120
both with his good about the novel and
what makes it worth reading in my mind.

66
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,770
Uh,

67
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,770
we'll also obviously points to some
really clear the facts about the novel is

68
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:16,111
also a very good pressurization of
Hemingway in terms of I see really means,

69
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,660
um, and the, the [inaudible] and uh,

70
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,500
having weighs pros that makes it
almost like poetry at many moments are.

71
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,140
So it's just a very good overall
calendar pending where, uh,

72
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:32,950
but also the special, uh, tig and, um,

73
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,350
I think very true to the spirit of
Hemingway and thinking that it's both less

74
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:42,100
well crafted, uh, but maybe
closer to Hemingway's hot,

75
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,230
one more quote from another critic.

76
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,710
And very understandable given
the subject matter of uh,

77
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,131
to half and half,

78
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:59,131
not saying that Hemingway was one of
the least of work whenever co writers in

79
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:02,510
this generation,
I think it's very interesting statement.

80
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,510
He was one of the least overtly political.

81
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,860
Does that mean that even though
he's not overtly political, um,

82
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,760
that actually, uh, there's a time
of deep politics in the novel.

83
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,920
So I would like to not over,
but something that once we look deeper,

84
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,220
further into the novel or get to see
that there's some hard experience. Um,

85
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:27,350
so I would like to take that
as a starting point, um,

86
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:32,410
and to ask whether or not to have
and have not is a political now.

87
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,200
Um, and as is the custom in this
class, I like to think about it, um,

88
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,880
on a number of,
on two different scales.

89
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,840
One is through the macro history,
uh,

90
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,580
that is the background to a novel.
Um,

91
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,030
and we know that because Harry Morgan,

92
00:06:51,031 --> 00:06:56,031
there's so much to do with Cubans were
tied to get to United States in part one,

93
00:06:56,061 --> 00:07:00,810
and then Cubans wanted to get
act of Anna and par three. Uh,

94
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,340
we know that Q and markets
is very much there. Um,

95
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:07,490
and along with that and Paolo of that,

96
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,380
that is also the Great Depression in the
United States that this is very much a

97
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:17,290
novel of the 1930s. These
are the macro context, um,

98
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,510
that make up the context of the novel.
Um,

99
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,690
and moving to a somewhat different
scale and the scale of character,

100
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,060
um, character and narrative technique. Um,

101
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:35,230
I like to think about a novel
as a different permutations
of half and half now.

102
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,990
So that sense is really the theme
and variations on a title itself.

103
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,450
Um, and I'll be talking
about Harry, um, as a half,

104
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,260
not in several ways,

105
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,090
linking that to the macro
history of the novel. Uh,

106
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,240
but then what I really would like to make
a case for in the rest of the lecture

107
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,950
is Harry as a special,

108
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:05,951
kind of have what I would call a
mediated kind of have that is he becomes,

109
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,820
even though he's so obviously have not,

110
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,500
he becomes a half true,

111
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,330
the presence of somebody else.

112
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:22,390
So this is what I mean by mediated has
through the presence of another person.

113
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:29,120
Either it could be Marie or it could
be some suddenly like Richard Gordon.

114
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,830
Um,
Harry gets to become a habit.

115
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,400
So this is the argument about
Harry not being a half on his own,

116
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,510
but becoming a,

117
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,520
have by virtue of either a
handling process by way of
Norwegian and is channeled

118
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:55,770
through the reef of because
of the weight she, about him.

119
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,350
And also because of the
way he looks at her.

120
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,030
And he contrasted with visual and both
because of the way Richard looks at Emory

121
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,470
because of the way which have gotten
hot stoves on wife Helen. So, um,

122
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:12,450
is there much a permutation or kind of,
uh, a dance really among characters?

123
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,010
Um, in order for Herrick to
emerge as half of the very app.

124
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,840
So first of all,

125
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:23,910
let's go back to the macro
history of Cuba in the 1930s.

126
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,680
Um, and as you can see, um,

127
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:34,320
the colleagues with Cuba was
incredibly complicated in the 30s. Um,

128
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,940
there were six presidents in
three years. Um, so I'm not even,

129
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,340
you are under no obligation to remember
the names of the residents. Um,

130
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,550
I will even an announcement
where there's one of,

131
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:49,350
they give you a sense of how
long they were presidents. Um,

132
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,460
so most of the residents were
residents for just a few months.

133
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,250
This days, less than a month, um,

134
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,860
less than just a few months.
Um,

135
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,570
in the case of Ramon Grau,
um, just for three days, um,

136
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,940
in the case of others via,
um,

137
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,830
and this is this beat every name.

138
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,150
He was president for just one day
when you're okay. Sterling. Um,

139
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,480
and then, okay, slightly longer, uh,

140
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,070
a few months as a record
and, uh, a few months.

141
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,290
So, um, I think that it's
just really clear, you know,

142
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,960
just from looking at the list
of presidents of Cuba, um,

143
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,490
in the [inaudible] 33 and
then the, with the sex, um,

144
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,200
that the politics was just
incredibly hard to figure out. Um,

145
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,670
and as I mentioned last time,

146
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,760
having way was actually knocking
cure when he was waiting to happen.

147
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,010
I was in The Bahamas.

148
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,820
So it's highly improbable that he would
have been able to figure out the pilots

149
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,690
of Cuba in, in any intimate way. Um,

150
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,640
he would have been looking at
it very much from the outside.

151
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,180
He probably understood the politics
of the status who wore a that he was

152
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:07,330
covering much,

153
00:11:07,331 --> 00:11:11,670
much better than the actual
politics can kill it dead setting.

154
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,470
Um, so instead of feeling us
out, so that as a consequence,

155
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,020
the president of Cuba,
whenever never mentioned,

156
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,250
we all even know who was
president. Um, then, um,

157
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:27,760
instead of what Hemingway
feels us is the generic type.

158
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,620
This is the young boy, Emilio, um,

159
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,050
who was one of them passengers.

160
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,130
They have to be carried back to
Havana after the bank robbery. And so,

161
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,190
um,
the very dangerous trip for Harry.

162
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,520
Um,
but he gets to talk to the boy.

163
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,030
Quite a Ben on also kills him.
Uh,

164
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,030
but this is a generic type
Revolutionary Moffa his speech pattern.

165
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:02,310
We are the only true revolutionary quality
deploys that we want to do away with

166
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,270
all the Ohio patients with
all of American imperialism.

167
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,210
This trend goes as the
tyranny of the army.

168
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,230
We want to start clean and
give every manage hands.

169
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,710
We want to add this way every other
go heroes. You know, it hasn't,

170
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,480
we just raised money
now by double his head.

171
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:27,460
To do that we have to use
means that they never use.

172
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,800
Also we have to use paypal.

173
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,550
We will not employed later
but ends with the means.

174
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,400
Emilio is in any way.
Uh,

175
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,050
but he talked like a much older person.

176
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,560
There's actually a lot of authority
and I don't think that Hemingway's just

177
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:50,350
giving this to us as the caricature,

178
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:56,140
that's a certain kind of authority
that comes from the sermon for Cabo are

179
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,440
certain speech pattern.
The boiler was,

180
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:04,441
didn't have to think in order to say all
those things because he's so familiar

181
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,410
with that kind of phrasing
and kind of idiom. Um,

182
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,170
he's considered conditioned in that idiom.
Um,

183
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:17,280
so that it really is second nature to
him and we can think a little bit about

184
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,190
what it means to have that
kind of second nature.

185
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,520
I think that most of us tend to think
that it is not good to have that kind of

186
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,110
language real into our,

187
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,100
so there's almost a kind of brief last
action clear to come out. Just like that.

188
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,410
I think we tend to be very suspicious
of people who talk in this kind of, um,

189
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,200
very dogmatic and a generic
kind of language. Um, you know,

190
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,880
that were, you can, you can
hear two sentences and you know,

191
00:13:45,881 --> 00:13:50,620
it was man is a radical and is wearing
his medical and some only asleep.

192
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,880
Um, so this is a man
who, um, in many ways he,

193
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,680
we don't even know if his
true name is Emilio. Um,

194
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,330
he just says to Harry,

195
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,540
you can call me from Jojo who's going
back to that famous line in Raleigh.

196
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,310
They call me Ishmael.
Many,

197
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:13,000
many characters in American literature
would say save another character,

198
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,260
hobby something. This is a very,
very minor local innocence of this,

199
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:22,310
but we all know his true name.
He's just known by name Millie.

200
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:27,340
Um, and that in itself is emblematic
of the kind of character that he is.

201
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,510
Um,

202
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:33,460
but I want to go back to the point about
what it means to have a second nature.

203
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,740
The second linguistic Asia.
Um,

204
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,800
and even though our instinct,

205
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,660
our gut reaction is to be very
suspicious of someone like that.

206
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:49,200
I actually want to make the point
that having a second nature like that,

207
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,610
it's probably not the worst
thing a human being can have.

208
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,290
You know, it is probably not the
best thing a human being can have,

209
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,800
but if Holly is not the worst thing,
um,

210
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:10,050
because if is a sort of religious faith,
um,

211
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:15,370
that is gas in Sephora language and to
the extent that we've named that human

212
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:20,490
beings need some kind of fair,
it actually is very,

213
00:15:20,491 --> 00:15:24,680
very good to have that second
nature. So I, you know,

214
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:29,120
I think they've done anyways,
politely caricature in that style.

215
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,920
But you're showing us what it means
to have with being within that kind of

216
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:38,180
language isn't problematic.
Kind of being,

217
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,220
most of us would be Jacqueline,

218
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:45,230
but it is kind of a Bible
kind of being as in contrast,

219
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,560
we can look at Harry and this is the
first instance when I would like to make

220
00:15:51,271 --> 00:15:54,080
the case for Harry as a have not,

221
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,400
is that it just doesn't have that
kind of political conviction.

222
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:03,670
He doesn't have the stake and the Azure
that is second nature to neo and as a

223
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:09,110
consequence, as public
talks, I want to trend.

224
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,440
Harry was thinking,
what the hell do I care about?

225
00:16:12,441 --> 00:16:17,441
Is Revolution at Worker's revolution to
have a working man who rast the band and

226
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:19,550
kills a fellow,

227
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,610
works for them and then kills that who
are them hours and never did any harm as

228
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,990
a working man,
he kills you.

229
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:31,310
Never things about with the
family is the Cubans run fever.

230
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,200
They are double cross each other.

231
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,580
They sell each other that
they get what they deserve.

232
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:42,060
The hell of the revolutions I got to do
is make a living for my family and I can

233
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:43,424
do that.

234
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,690
Then he tells me about his revolution
to hell with his revolution.

235
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,600
Um, is the reaction of Holly
knows who us, we'll have, uh,

236
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,590
you know,
the Cubans,

237
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:59,780
especially in the 30s a that sort of
revolution with feel that way to most

238
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:01,250
people who are outside of it.

239
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,660
But the point remains that feeling
that way about the revolution gifts,

240
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,870
Harry,
no alternative moral grounding.

241
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:19,510
This speech is almost leave me and
of any kind of moral confusion,

242
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,740
any conflict or conviction,
um,

243
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:31,160
I can say is I want to
drink at this moment. Um,

244
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,470
and um, that, you know,

245
00:17:33,471 --> 00:17:36,560
I want to make a living with
my family and I can do that.

246
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:42,070
So it is almost a kind of a toto mission
of this feed without having the dubious

247
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,480
saving ways of some sort of
local conviction that can one,

248
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:55,260
two sons with excellent this
horrible condition that you are in.

249
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,543
Um,
um,

250
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:01,590
nausea that familiar represents a
superior alternative to Harriet.

251
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:07,670
Quite the hydrating is diluted.
Um, you know, having waves,

252
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,250
not leaving a lot of bell
about that ability is diluted,

253
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,120
but as some point in one's life,

254
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,440
a certain degree of growth of illusion,

255
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,500
it's actually very
necessarily fiction there. Um,

256
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,220
loss of human beings need and um,

257
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,960
is probably about for the oil to die,

258
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,730
still clinging to that
political conviction. Um,

259
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:36,420
and this is what happens to Harry where
he cannot claim when there's really

260
00:18:36,421 --> 00:18:38,570
nothing for him to claim too.
Um,

261
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,760
when he's relying completely on his own
mental resources and this not all of

262
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:47,743
him,

263
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,990
he's pretty empty person
left to his own devices.

264
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:57,060
Um, so this is, I would argue that this
is the first instance of Harry as a half,

265
00:18:57,061 --> 00:19:02,061
not only in the sense that he doesn't
have that do yours but redeeming kind of

266
00:19:02,281 --> 00:19:04,530
stagnation. Um, I,

267
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,660
we also know that the Cuban
Revolution's such as they were,

268
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,060
um, without the only reference
point for the novel, um,

269
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,520
fair to have and have nice,

270
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,800
very much about key west key
west during the great depression.

271
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:25,390
This is Hemingway's house house in key
west that he spent a lot of time in

272
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:29,760
later, actually much, much
later. Not at this point. Um,

273
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,940
but this would have been what
people in key west with seeing,

274
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:39,780
uh, during the great
depression, the rent minds. Um,

275
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,780
and this is one that was actually
or Fargo historical archives, um,

276
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:49,460
most likely key west,
um, because keywords,

277
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,070
which is very profitable recently
before the Great Depression,

278
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:55,890
and this especially hardly
hit by the depression.

279
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,770
So the unemployment rate was 80%,

280
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:03,860
80% of the citizens were actually on
leap and you see the hours who was on the

281
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,710
week. So, um,

282
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,750
this is about the most acute case study
after the Great Depression that we get

283
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,870
in American literature,
except that having ways,

284
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:19,700
not really talking about the Great
Depression in the frontal way. Um,

285
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,860
and we can look at the way in which even
the word Greg depression without giving

286
00:20:25,361 --> 00:20:28,620
them the great [inaudible]
is a suggested to us.

287
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:32,530
But that is that historical context.
Um,

288
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,320
so this is how the great
depression is register by Harry

289
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,660
other bruises.
Boat Harry had the last sack over.

290
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,740
Give me the first night,
he said to the neighbor is gone,

291
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,420
Harry depressed the self starters
and started the two engines.

292
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,710
He put his second engine in her,
he went back to running.

293
00:20:56,711 --> 00:21:01,360
They occur whether the depression
had put charter boat fishing.

294
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:02,973
Um,

295
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:08,790
so this at is two ways in which
Harry as a smother of their color.

296
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,920
Two ways in which that gets potentialize.

297
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,540
First we don't know about is
we all can only conjecture

298
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,700
and hard to um,

299
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,020
Harry is both reviewed
who us as his mother,

300
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,820
but uh, we just think that maybe
that's just suddenly he chooses to do,

301
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,560
but then it comes out in the context of
the Great Depression that he goes back

302
00:21:43,481 --> 00:21:45,160
to it because the,

303
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:50,260
your passion has made the much more
profitable Charterhouse charter boat

304
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,910
fishing. Um, in hospital in part one,

305
00:21:54,911 --> 00:21:55,950
he was still doing the,

306
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:01,020
to go fishing when he was cheated out
of inner and play $5 on is to dance.

307
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,250
That was still the title fishing.
Uh,

308
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:09,140
that is no longer operative and the
only way he could make a living as by

309
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:11,710
smuggling records to
me, United States. So,

310
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,390
right then that is the way
that this very old league, um,

311
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:21,450
very elusive way as the
way Hemingway in the axes.

312
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,500
Um,
the Great Depression.

313
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,520
And I think there is really useful to
think of the technique that Hemingway is

314
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:29,830
using as a kind of,

315
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,390
in that sense it's not a front or a
food trends description of the great

316
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,590
depression is just,
um,

317
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,760
a kind of very ACAB equal appearance
that puts the depression in the index,

318
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:47,710
so to speak of the novel. Uh, but it's, it
doesn't engage in or put it into format.

319
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:52,580
Um, and we can, I hope that you guys
were talking about it in session,

320
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,040
why chooses not bar the depression in
that way? And it's very ugly passion.

321
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,000
Uh,

322
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
but in this passage we can also
see that Harry is a half not,

323
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,890
um,
for these three reasons.

324
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,470
One is that he's lost his
original occupational,

325
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,170
although there's also the reference who's
going back to having, they go to, so,

326
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:20,680
you know, he must've been doing that as
well. We all know why it was going at.

327
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:25,681
All we know is that he had been law
abiding for quite a while as a owner of a

328
00:23:25,841 --> 00:23:27,420
child vote.
Um,

329
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:31,600
and now has been something that is
illegal because of the Great Depression.

330
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:34,960
So he loses his legal occupation.
Um,

331
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:40,290
right now we know also know that he's
losing naturally all this liquor because

332
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:44,420
he's so the cousins are, uh, on him,

333
00:23:44,421 --> 00:23:49,220
so he has to get rid of eyes
that has a lot of money.

334
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,960
Uh,
but not only that,

335
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:56,020
even as more detail about
this fish even that is gone.

336
00:23:56,501 --> 00:24:01,501
And so in many ways to have and have now
is a very detail from the macro to the

337
00:24:03,291 --> 00:24:04,124
micro,

338
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:09,320
have a lot of odd things that
are being taken away from hairy.

339
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:12,990
Um, it really is it in injury
when he was in a big way,

340
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
laws and loosen the group as well as
within the landscape of laws there anyway

341
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:24,140
has created for Harry Morgan and um,

342
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,280
just one other,
um,

343
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:32,330
watering of him as the have not,
and this is Harry thinking about,

344
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,830
he knows that those Cubans,
that one,

345
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:42,190
the Cubans who want to get back to Havana,

346
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,580
he knows that they're going to rob
a bank because every time you lost,

347
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,750
then he doesn't want to look at the bank.

348
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,900
So he actually knows that that's
what's going to happen. Uh,

349
00:24:51,901 --> 00:24:56,150
so gullible as now to know
the purpose of that trip.

350
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,470
Um,

351
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:02,470
but he is not in a position to make
any other choices at that point.

352
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,290
So I was here.

353
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:11,290
This is the ultimate measure
of hairy as have not,

354
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
is knowing that he should not be doing
this or having no other choice open to

355
00:25:17,241 --> 00:25:21,080
him either stay here now
and I'll be all of them,

356
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,820
but what the hell are they?

357
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:27,350
Where's the money coming from to keep
Maria and the girls have got no boat,

358
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,830
no cash.
I've got no education.

359
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,220
What can have one army men [inaudible]
I've got [inaudible] power.

360
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:42,180
Um, so this is the kind
of the ultimate, um,

361
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,600
low against someone who would like to
operate as an individual is to be able at

362
00:25:49,221 --> 00:25:52,730
least to make the decision
based on your own judgment.

363
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,240
Everything in Harris Jasmine tells him
to know this is not something to do.

364
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:04,850
His judgment is not at fault.
This hand on top,

365
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,650
it has to do,
go against his judgment and do something.

366
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:14,651
But every thing in him what require
against and warned him against.

367
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,680
So this is the ultimate.
And he,

368
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,900
every decisional process has been taken
away from Carrie [inaudible] boat.

369
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:34,450
The boat was confiscated by customs
after he was found to be illegal,

370
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:39,380
smuggling bigger that was confiscated
something away from him. Um,

371
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,000
and now we know he has no
money in legal education.

372
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:47,880
Business Visit [inaudible] oh,
so is at this moment,

373
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,230
this is the absolute low
point, I would say, uh,

374
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:56,100
for Eric and now I want
to go to a slightly

375
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,940
trajectory with,

376
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:05,120
I let her suggest is actually the
beginning of an upward to Jeffrey.

377
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:10,140
And the beginning of this upward
podiatry is going to be very,

378
00:27:10,141 --> 00:27:14,010
very stark is Harry as a rough,

379
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,650
ironic have.
Um,

380
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:21,210
this is the moment where we know
that Harry is by has been one that,

381
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,480
you know,
all the Cubans would feel good by Harry.

382
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,430
And Harry was also failing when the girl,

383
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:32,610
the big Cuban art. So all of them, uh,

384
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,090
with iron on the boat, but
herrings can last to die. Um,

385
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:40,560
and he, this is the
moment before his dad, um,

386
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,040
where he has at that moment he was on
his back now with his knees drawn out and

387
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:52,860
there's a head to water
of the lake that was,

388
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:54,750
his valley was very cold,

389
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,080
so cold that when he stepped in his edge,

390
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:03,310
it known Tim and he was extremely cold
now and everything tasted of their

391
00:28:04,201 --> 00:28:09,120
solving as though he'd been
sucking on a hose to siphon a 10.

392
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,400
Can you?
There was no to him,

393
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:17,660
although he would feel a coal rubber
pose the same to have answered his mouth

394
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,350
and now was called big coat
and heavy or down through him.

395
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:27,270
Each time he took a breath
to host called Koden,

396
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,880
firmer in his lower abdomen.

397
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,330
And you could feel it like a big smooth
moving snake in there about the sloshing

398
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:38,603
after me.

399
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,720
This is a chapter 20 chapter 20
verse you to read that chapter.

400
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,810
The beast,
the couples attitude is great.

401
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,740
Ray Wendell clinics, um,
admitted to having, um,

402
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,630
really impressive pros and
to have and have not been,

403
00:28:57,631 --> 00:29:02,150
must have been thinking of. Chapter
20 is just rich chapter. Um,

404
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:07,100
and it's about the vote with dead
men and the fish. I mean to, uh,

405
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,490
fish under turpines from wounds on them.

406
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,160
Uh, but is, is a way the
friction of human mortality,

407
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:22,650
uh, against the sea. Very [inaudible],
honestly living sea creatures.

408
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,670
Um,

409
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:28,670
but the passage right here is the
description and I think that it maybe is a

410
00:29:30,511 --> 00:29:32,360
challenge from anyway,

411
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:36,600
although I wouldn't want
to push this too much. Um,

412
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:41,690
is a challenge to us to think about
what it means to die and what exactly do

413
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:47,800
when you have at the moment of death.
Um,

414
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,130
Harriet doesn't have something,

415
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:54,400
although it's not anything
that anyone would want to have.

416
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,120
It has this rubber hose
that is inside him,

417
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,320
that's making him colder and colder.
Um,

418
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:06,470
it is not a possession that
we would bond to you for is,

419
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:12,230
it was if most of us would like to
have taken all but is the possession

420
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,100
nonetheless.

421
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,880
So I would like to at least
put forth the possible,

422
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:22,150
uh,

423
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:27,150
argument are bad because of the
kind of life that Harry has lived.

424
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,430
Um, even though there's so
many strikes against him,

425
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,290
even though all the odds are against him,

426
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:42,210
the bone of that Ashley is his own
moment in a sense that he's living his

427
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:49,710
physicality to do this is not a dying
without knowing that you are dying off if

428
00:30:51,671 --> 00:30:56,671
he doesn't lose consciousness after that
it is experiencing that too is pull us

429
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,870
expand. Um, and uh,

430
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:07,410
and just having that register
on every fiber of your being.

431
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:13,870
I don't know how much we want
to push on this point. Um,

432
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,960
but I like to see this as the beginning
of the kind of upward swing of the

433
00:31:19,631 --> 00:31:24,631
narrative that this is the moment
where we can begin to start thinking of

434
00:31:26,441 --> 00:31:29,150
heralded as a half now.

435
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,720
And you start thinking of him as a half,

436
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,000
although have in a very ironic sense,

437
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:40,060
having a possession that most of
us would much rather than I have.

438
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:45,570
But from this point I like make like to
make a Muslim ward systematic arguing

439
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,650
about Harry as the have.

440
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,210
Do they have anyways,
great deliberate fashion.

441
00:31:55,211 --> 00:31:59,500
So I would very much want to argue that
this is actually the basic structure of

442
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:01,000
to happen, has not, um,

443
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:06,060
is to show airy as a half
should immediated presence
of other people looking at

444
00:32:07,121 --> 00:32:10,950
him through the reef and
looking at him through ritual.

445
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,200
So what Marie and things parent,

446
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,620
I'm lucky she was thinking those girls,

447
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:25,390
they don't know what they look at.
I know what I've got and what I've had.

448
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,710
I've been lucky.
I've been lucky woman.

449
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:34,180
They ain't no other man like that.
He will never find them. Don't know.

450
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:39,560
I've had plenty of them. I've
been lucky to have him. Um,

451
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:44,090
is suggested to us that um,

452
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:48,580
movie was a spoiling Logan,
um,

453
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,020
as a profession.
Um,

454
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:55,190
so she's had lots of men in
her professional capacity.

455
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,540
Um,

456
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:01,540
and it is from that wealth of
knowledge of man that she can stay,

457
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:08,270
that Harry is really,
is at that point.

458
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,850
It's the best,
uh,

459
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:14,510
this child more and
there's just no one hammer.

460
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:17,170
So it's a dubious kind of confidence.
You know,

461
00:33:17,171 --> 00:33:22,171
you don't want to have a positive time
saying that testimony to the fact that

462
00:33:22,331 --> 00:33:26,390
you're the best, um, when that
happens to be your wife. Um,

463
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,650
so once again,

464
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:32,120
having ways really taking away with
one hand what is doing with another,

465
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:37,520
but there is no question that heroin
has made Marie's my life that she's

466
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:45,650
enjoying that moment that
she's having a good one,

467
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,580
she's having a good life
only because of him.

468
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,790
He is the thing that
gives her a good life. Um,

469
00:33:55,310 --> 00:34:00,310
and that is the measure of what Harry has.

470
00:34:00,381 --> 00:34:02,470
So it's very much more complicated media.

471
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:07,490
He has something because of the good
life that Marie has because of him.

472
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:12,110
And without Marie, we wouldn't
have been able to say that. Um,

473
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:17,030
so this is the first upward
swing of that trajectory to us,

474
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,400
Harry,
as a possible have.

475
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,770
And I would like to add that it is not
just because of the way that he's treated

476
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:29,780
Marie and the way that [inaudible] has
is now having a lot because of him but

477
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:33,320
also because of the way he looks at me.

478
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,720
So there is actually
coming from him as well.

479
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:41,050
We can sort of understand why
Maria is having a good life now.

480
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:45,440
Um, and was, he has made all
the difference to her life.

481
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:50,970
So here the wreath Harry is going
on is dangerous for the humans.

482
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:56,210
After when he knows that it's the bank
robbery that his estate and re wants to

483
00:34:56,211 --> 00:35:00,230
go with him just to take care of the
jobs and your ticket because he has only

484
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,220
one arm at this point.

485
00:35:01,221 --> 00:35:05,060
You want to do something for him on
a boat and she wants to come along.

486
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,880
So he says,
all right.

487
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:11,660
He told her as she got into
beside him a big woman long,

488
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:16,550
they get big handed,
they can still handsome.

489
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:22,290
Had the boat over the beetle
one hair you wrote about Harry?

490
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:27,410
I don't know. I'm just worried. Listen,
are you letting her hair grow out?

491
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,290
I thought I was,
the goals have been asking me,

492
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:35,510
how will you keep it like it is? Do
you really want me to yes, he's had.

493
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:38,000
That's the way I like him.
You don't, they look to you,

494
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,720
you look better than any of them.

495
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:45,710
So that's why that's why we has a good
life is because of the way how each

496
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,490
resort and we see exactly
how he treats him, um,

497
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:55,620
that he liked the way
she is. And um, you know,

498
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,330
and he tells her that was worried but he
doesn't want to tell her the full span

499
00:36:00,331 --> 00:36:01,770
of it,
of his worries.

500
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:05,680
He changes the subject when she
wants to find out from the um,

501
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:10,320
all this make Maria's
life the good life 10.

502
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,370
It is all encapsulated in
this one small passage.

503
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:20,150
And the contrast of that comes
out in that previous passage.

504
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,720
We know that is probably big
woman and she has a of long,

505
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,980
they big hands, hips and so on. Uh,

506
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:35,090
we don't know exactly how big she is until
we get to see her through the eyes of

507
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,010
Richard Gordon.

508
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:45,850
And then is the kind of a
shock to see this passage, uh,

509
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:49,790
coming through the eyes of neutral,
uh,

510
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,080
hospital observer. Other than that,
I believe apple is in your top. Um,

511
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,710
but a very unkind,

512
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,460
neutral observer riding his bicycle.

513
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,440
It has a heavy said,

514
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:06,590
big blue eyed woman with bleach blonde
here showing under the old man's belt,

515
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:10,500
have her n across the row,
eyes red some crime.

516
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,850
Looking at that,
look at that big arcs with that.

517
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:18,390
What is it was a woman like that, things
that are well disciplined. She goes,

518
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,740
she does in bed.

519
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:24,030
What does your husband feel about
her when she gets their size?

520
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:29,270
In today's chapter, he was going to
use the big woman, but it's here.

521
00:37:29,271 --> 00:37:33,540
And I would, the scene on
the way home. Her husband,

522
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:37,750
when he came home at night, he'd
ever hated the way she, of course,

523
00:37:37,751 --> 00:37:42,150
and grown heavy sleep.
Hell, I had bleached hair.

524
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:47,360
The two big breasts he has
seen in the last of perception,

525
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:52,020
the whole inner life of death to happen.
Let.

526
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:57,620
So Hemingway is both dramatizing
the process of labeling
people making of social

527
00:38:00,631 --> 00:38:05,310
types and
showing considerable,

528
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:10,450
uh, doubt whether that is at
the practice to say the least.

529
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:15,660
I'll get this really interesting
that Richard Gordon is a writer.

530
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:16,441
So,
you know,

531
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:20,250
I think the Hemingways probably thinking
about himself as well and where there

532
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,600
is an entirely ethical practice even to
populate his novel with Social Types of

533
00:38:27,161 --> 00:38:27,331
thing.

534
00:38:27,331 --> 00:38:32,100
Right now he's actually creating another
social type of writer who doesn't care

535
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:35,460
about subjects and wants to use them,
um,

536
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:40,450
to wreck novels to someone's
heart attack. Um, so, um, this is,

537
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,490
uh, he's both make talking
about, which of course may be

538
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,750
expressing a little bit of wearing
that himself as well. But in any case,

539
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:54,930
if we move away from Hemingway's
on investment and his psychology,

540
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,650
um, possible psychology, including
someone like Richard Gordon,

541
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:05,250
we can say that this is a
dry rag affirmation of what
a kind man Harry Morgan is

542
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:14,170
and is not just kindness
that enables him to look.

543
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,370
How's thickness of Maria is,

544
00:39:16,371 --> 00:39:19,810
is probably the largest clients
on is understating the case.

545
00:39:19,811 --> 00:39:24,811
It's something else are
there truly doesn't bother
me that she's so big when it

546
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:30,820
probably work, most people will
have noticed that about her. Uh,

547
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,430
so it says something about,
uh,

548
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,900
that relationship,
whatever we call it,

549
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,490
it is one that turns the big
woman to have you for one. Um,

550
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:47,610
and to the extent that Harry is able to
do that years ago in petitions so much,

551
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:54,810
he has a kind of emotional magic that
changes the re into something else.

552
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:01,210
And in the process of that transformation,

553
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,590
he also acquires an identity.

554
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:10,830
He is the person who's being able
to do this to me and do this for me.

555
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:16,810
This is the ultimate measure or someone
who has magic in his hand and it is the

556
00:40:18,101 --> 00:40:23,101
lab of magic that makes me supporting
the water rather than he is Richard

557
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,140
Garland is, is, was probably once a
very, very good way. He, here's an IRA,

558
00:40:29,141 --> 00:40:33,730
this was seat. We're thrilled to meet
him. Um, but at a point where meeting him,

559
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:38,490
he's waiting the crap around
you to be on the wane. Um,

560
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:43,600
and we begin to see those are
what a bad way that he is.

561
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:48,780
And this supposedly neutral a
portrait of Marie is that all,

562
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:52,210
you know, business is the size of this
woman. She doesn't want to listen to.

563
00:40:52,211 --> 00:40:57,211
The most important fact about Marie is
that her eyes are red from prior to his

564
00:40:57,691 --> 00:40:59,060
soul.
It if you're asking,

565
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:03,680
so the imagination that he
misses the central fact,

566
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:06,190
this is we're reading
knows that Eric is dead.

567
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:11,700
And that was why the eyes are to hear
random reticle is not a poor rhino.

568
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:18,190
Then he can ask you the most obvious
thing about from the way in this

569
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:24,750
eagerness to turn into a social time and
in this exchange views on why we see,

570
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:30,440
um,
that the fact that he's a bad driver.

571
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:35,300
I'm also always seems to spill out.
And as a kind of analogy,

572
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:40,100
uh, and his relation with his
wife Helen who leaving him. Uh,

573
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:43,730
and this is, um, this is actually
one of the great moments.

574
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:48,050
I'm not calling you with full
extent of, um, of Helen speech,

575
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:51,220
but go and look at page one wanting,

576
00:41:51,221 --> 00:41:55,450
we filing this long,
long speech about love and um,

577
00:41:55,610 --> 00:42:00,610
the is dripping with irony about what she
feels about lovely coming from Richard

578
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:05,120
Gordon. Um, but that is the end
of that conversation. All right,

579
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:09,430
I'm through with you and I'm
through with love. Your can pick,

580
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:14,180
knows love you.
Random you loan mix nuts sloughed.

581
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:18,740
Don't call me names. I know
with you all right. No,

582
00:42:18,741 --> 00:42:22,970
not are all wrong. Ryan, if
you would, just a good writer.

583
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:28,370
I understand. Stand all the rest of it.
Maybe the last scene you bitter, jealous,

584
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:31,190
changing your politics
to suit the fashion,

585
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:36,050
sucking up to people's faces and talking
about them behind the Bads I've seen

586
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:40,610
you do on the city. Um,
so what kind of person,

587
00:42:40,611 --> 00:42:45,611
which of course is can always
be register in full buyer.

588
00:42:46,301 --> 00:42:48,650
Someone who's fired site all the time.

589
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,940
That is the most accurate picture of
Michigan and kind become person here.

590
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,580
So it is,
unfortunately,

591
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:59,950
they're completely cleans out
everything that we lose everything. Um,

592
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:05,080
his claim to fame is
claimed to craftsmanship is
cleaning to right region is

593
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:08,120
planes in Greg romantic Glover.
Um,

594
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:13,220
all those things have been emptied
out by Helen in this moment.

595
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,100
If we think about the
cemetery, the change, uh,

596
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:22,930
Harry channeled through Murray and
Richard Gordon channeled through Helen is

597
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,760
very quiet not to come to the conclusion
that we need to have an alternative

598
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:36,470
definition of what means to be a
half and what it means to be a,

599
00:43:36,471 --> 00:43:38,330
have not,
um,

600
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:43,110
it's not so easy to add a label,
you know,

601
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:47,780
to what the criteria might be for cat,

602
00:43:47,781 --> 00:43:52,781
for someone to can't have the criteria
on the much too complicated to be

603
00:43:54,141 --> 00:43:56,910
captured as by one word.
That's really the point. Uh,

604
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:59,570
descends as way to put it as that,

605
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:04,900
in order to be a have you have to make
somebody else or have the read house of

606
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:11,861
her life because of Harry and Harry has
something because Marie has a good life.

607
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:18,390
This is symmetrical construction
of house in Hemingway's novels.

608
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:23,430
Um, so I would say that actually
this is, I'm having ways,

609
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,520
I often criticized for being the very
poor writer when it comes to women.

610
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:33,270
And that is true.
And I was with his mom,

611
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:38,500
his own imagination for what
my feel to be a woman. Uh,

612
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:42,950
but this is actually an
exception of Disney, how fall,

613
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,220
um, depiction of the human condition
from the woman's point of view.

614
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:51,360
And so, um, I, with in conclusion,

615
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:56,390
I like to bring up one celebrated a
passage for is writing a total from the

616
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:02,910
standpoint of a woman's point of view
and have just a little anecdote that

617
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:06,330
[inaudible] aeration for James Stores.

618
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,760
He saw James Joyce in Paris,
uh,

619
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,710
[inaudible] eating the sandwich and
they were all speaking Italian in Paris,

620
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:19,570
was very, very impressed. Um,
but so it was not an fitting, uh,

621
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:24,650
to compare him with choice in this most
famous passage in joy's Malia Soliloquy,

622
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:30,960
that [inaudible] of us'.
And I thought,

623
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:34,200
well as well him as another.

624
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,980
And then I asked him if
my eyes to ask again. Yes.

625
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,750
And then he asked me would I yes.
To say yes,

626
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:47,130
my mountain flower. And first
I put my arms around him. Yes.

627
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:52,710
And threw him down to the so he could
feel my breasts all perfume. Yes.

628
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:57,900
And his heart was going like man
and yes. I said yes, I will. Yes.

629
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,870
So this lovely blue thinking
of how long time ago, you know,

630
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:06,620
marriage has really gone sour
many ways. Um, [inaudible] um,

631
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:11,810
but thinking back to that moment when
she agrees to marry lyrical loo and um,

632
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:18,150
obviously whilst Angeles's from that note,

633
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:23,240
that very early romance we from to a
woman's love from man and a man slash

634
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:27,360
woman,
this is not quite,

635
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:32,770
not quite,
that is the opposite of that,

636
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:37,790
but I would argue is just as powerful
as well known as Molly Soliloquy.

637
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:43,050
Um, it was, how do you get through
it? Nice. If you can sleep,

638
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:47,390
I guess you find out that you
find out how it feels. How can,

639
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,560
I guess you find out all right.

640
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,790
I guess you find out everything and
discount them life I guess you do already

641
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:57,730
because I'm probably finding out
right now you just go dead inside and

642
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:02,160
everything is easy. You just get that.
Like most people are. Most of the time.

643
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,020
I guess that's how it is.
All right.

644
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:08,660
I guess that's just about what happens
to you. Well, I know the thought.

645
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,310
I've got a good star.
If that's what we have to do.

646
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,490
I guess that's where you'd have to
do. All right. I guess that's it.

647
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,820
I guess that's what it comes from.
All right.

648
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,480
I've got the start done and
where you're living now, um,

649
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,880
having all the sounds like Gertrude
Stein and other obvious favorite few,

650
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:33,140
and then it also sounds a little bit
anyway [inaudible] he really does sound

651
00:47:33,371 --> 00:47:37,330
like, which is nice. Um, this
is kind of senseless repetition.

652
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:42,331
This is not elephant in compulsive
repetition on [inaudible] had a good life

653
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,440
taken away from her and so forth.
And the fact that

654
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:05,220
she's had a good life and in the fact
that it's just going hysterical when dad

655
00:48:05,221 --> 00:48:10,221
is [inaudible] to come from him
and he doesn't want slowly yes,

656
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,520
social time.
