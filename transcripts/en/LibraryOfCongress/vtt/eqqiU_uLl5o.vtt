00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.300
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:22.630
[silence]

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.090
&gt;&gt; GRANT HARRIS: Good evening, and
welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.740
I am Grant Harris.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.960
I am Chief of the European
Division here at the library.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.820
The European Division and the
poetry and literature center,

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.020
in partnership with the Embassy
of the Republic of Malta,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.460
and greatly supported by the Arts
Council of Malta in New York,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.190 position:56%
present tonight a poetry reading and
conversation with Immanuel Mifsud.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.970
The European Division is
responsible for providing reference

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.020
and for developing the
Library's collections relating

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.960
to continental Europe.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.290
We hope you have a pleasant time
at the Library this evening,

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.620
and please come back
to use the collections.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.420
For almost every country, we think
we've got the largest collections

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.420
outside of those countries.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.780
Please turn off your
cellphones and recording devices

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.350
for the duration of the program.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.730
Also be aware that this
event is being recorded

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.480
as a Library of Congress webcast.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.910 position:56%
In a few minutes my colleague,
Lucia Wolf, our specialist for Malta

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.950
and Italy, will introduce
poet Immanuel Mifsud,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.580
and after the poetry reading,

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.510
Lucia will interview
Mifsud up here on the stage.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.240
Now, however, I have the
privilege of introducing

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.600
to you the Ambassador of Malta.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.670
This is His Excellency
Ambassador Pierre Clive Agius.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.970
Thank you for being here.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.670
[applause]

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.870
&gt;&gt; AMB. AGIUS: Thank you very
much, Mr. Harris, Mrs. Wolf, Ruth.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.820
It's a big privilege and
honor to be here, really too.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.130
I want to thank you for braving
the cold weather and coming

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.480
to the Library of Congress.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.890
You'll be rewarded,
because you're going

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:35.350
to discover a very fine intellect,
some very measured words from one,

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.180
I think, of the best
authors we ever had in Malta.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.230
He's the winner of the European
Prize for Literature of 2011,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.330
and you'll discover
he's all enveloped

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.310
in this very human
and humble persona.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.590
You'll come to discover
something, another aspect of Malta.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.080
Probably he's going to be a
better ambassador than I am.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.760
He's going to take you to
Malta, and you're going

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.290
to feel his words really
coming from the heart,

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.950
which I think conveys
the best spirit of Malta.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.020
But, before I make space for him,
there is something which I want

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.550 position:56%
to share with you out of conviction.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.450
This is the sheer fact that
we are in this institution,

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.140
in the Library of Congress.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.550
This is, for a country like
mine, this is very historical.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.800 position:56%
It's the first time that a Maltese
writer, a Maltese author, comes here

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.050
and he shares, within this
institution which houses humanity.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.800
I say this houses humanity,
the history of humanity,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.120
the dreams of humanity,
philosophy, the discoveries.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.020
The discoveries of diseases,
and so on and so forth.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:00.770
There is, in this institution,
there is a part of every corner

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.230
of the world, of all of us.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.260
It's common heritage of
mankind in its own right.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.820
I'm extremely, extremely touched
and humbled by this evening,

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.500
and I will take this memory with me

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.870
when I finish this term
here in Washington.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.730
I want to thank you very much
for the space you've given us,

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.480 position:56%
and what you've given to my country.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:47.860
But, now it's time to make space
for the real star of this evening.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.980
Thank you very much.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.980
[applause]

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:56.560
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Good evening.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.050
I am Lucia Wolf, the European
Division Reference Specialist

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.020
for Italy and Malta.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.390
Welcome to the Library of Congress
for this wonderful event dedicated

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.340
to Malta, and to Immanuel Mifsud.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.650
Before going any further, I want

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.380
to thank the Arts Council
of Malta in New York.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:22.930
Without their support we would not
have had this successful event.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:31.670
And I especially want to think
Dr. Laura Falzon, there she is,

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:37.010
who is here, and will come to the
podium at the end of the program

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.260
so you can say a few
conclusive words.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.560
Thank you.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.120
Also I want to thank from the
bottom of my heart, His Excellency,

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.320
the Ambassador of the
Republic of Malta.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.510
Thank you for your patience and
your full support throughout

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.220
this coordination.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:01.890
But, let us move on to the star of
the evening, Dr. Immanuel Mifsud.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.740
Immanuel Mifsud was
born in Malta in 1967.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.040
He has published eight poetry
collections, including a collection

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:18.310
of travel poems, Km, kilometer, in
bilingual edition with translations

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.690
by Maria Grech Ganado,
and Confidential Reports,

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.780
which was published in
Ireland with translations

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.950 position:56%
by Maurice Riordan and Adrian Grima.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.020
I'm sorry for my pronunciation.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.960
He has also published 10
collections of short stories,

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.320
including Sara Sue
Sammut's Strange Stories,

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:47.400
which won the National
Literary Award for 2002,

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.050
and was later short-listed
for the Premio Strega Europa.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.760
Of course he is very
well-known internationally

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:01.400
for his award-winning novel, In
The Name of the Father and the Son,

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.510
which won the European
Prize in 2011.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:09:34.050
[music]

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:38.340
&gt;&gt; IMMANUEL MIFSUD:
That was the Trio Noir.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.930
It's a jazz combo from
Malta, of course.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:45.300
That was the launch
of their last album.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:51.830
As you can see, it was
performed in a former chapel.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:56.180
I chose this because I collaborate
with Noir, and there are two tracks

00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.130
from this album which
includes some poems of mine.

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:03.630
And well I thought
it would be very nice

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:09.980
to have them here via
technology this evening.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:16.030
Before I start, I share the
Ambassador's excitement,

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.060
and also a huge sense

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:24.990
of responsibility being the
first Maltese writer to come

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.030
into these walls to read.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:31.640
For me it's a huge thing, and
I will, like the ambassador,

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:36.140
this will be a day which, of
course, I will never forget.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:42.020
But, I would like to thank all of
you for braving the cold weather,

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.620
and the traffic I have to say,
and come here this evening.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.010
Thank you very much.

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:52.230
I'm going to start reading
a poem, given that a couple

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.550
of days ago it was
St. Valentine's day,

00:10:54.550 --> 00:11:01.130
which it seems is being
celebrated, how should I say,

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:04.340
quite regularly now
year in, year out.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.430
It's a love poem divided
into different pieces.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:14.540
When you dress in black
you spread the night

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:19.170
over your breast, and
hide the full moon.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:25.520
Which, however, comes out
to peep through your eyes.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.210
Your hair pulled back is
a wind that doesn't steer.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:34.340
Your hands are folded in a caress.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.920
You're thinking that
tomorrow the sea will rise

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.810
to take you, you don't know where.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:48.230
Maybe it will take you where eyes
have never seen, ears never heard.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:53.230
Your fingers grasp the leaf
you spread the dream on,

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.220
which was born once
while you were sailing

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.930
with your loved one still
hidden in your embrace.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:06.420
Your eyes read the horizon he
painted for you, the hidden one

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:10.510
who loves you in the
depths of your breast.

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:15.740
Your eyes wish to cry in the
middle of a smile as soon

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:20.220
as you finish reading the poem.

00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:26.660
Your lips are a long night
which scarcely wants to end,

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:29.310
dreaming with the movement
of violence

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:33.740
on boundless expanses
of green grass.

00:12:33.740 --> 00:12:38.400
A blue night, which turns
silently melancholic,

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:43.620
lost among large expanses
of white sheets.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:49.250
Your lips are the small
island which is drowning.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:53.720
Slowly the water rises, sweetly.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.910
This drowning becomes
sacred as it ends.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:02.150
Its very peaks are
covered by the blue sea,

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:06.600
the island which is lost in memory.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.940
Your lips are the stillness
falling slowly, slowly.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.970
Soon they'll be heard crying.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:17.260
They'll soon be silent.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:23.440
When you come down to
lie on the sea's surface

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.830
and you forget the corners
one by one because you wish

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.610
to get quickly to the sand.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.480
You wish to hear your
own voice reply

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.100
to the call you throw
to the restless sea.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.740
When you come down to lie

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.340
on the sea's surface your
face touches its face,

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:50.490
its body your body, while
you fly far away in order

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:55.180
to forget these corners
which have risen one by one,

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.120
people's unintentional
bumping into you.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.110
You wish alone to approach the
sand where your clothes fall

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:08.210 position:56%
in a heap while you still walk,
nude as the sea, as is this silence,

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:11.940
this bay which has
hidden in early morning.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.990
You wish to forget, to feel alone.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:20.270
You wish to sleep to the naked
sound of water rising on you.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:24.950
You wish to sleep,
to dream, of silence.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:30.310
And then you look at the
earth with shut eyes,

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:36.430
and see black pictures
coming towards you.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.400
Of course that was a translation,

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:44.580
and all the poems I will be reading
were originally written in Maltese.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:50.830 position:56%
I would like to thank my translators
for making it possible that I read

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.820
to people who do not
understand my language.

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:59.260
Speaking of my language, I would
like to read just a snippet

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:06.090
in Maltese so that you
will hear the language.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.550
So, this is just the beginning

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:13.310
of a poem I shall be reading
right after this excerpt.

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:20.510
It is called Macedonia Square, the
main square in Skopje, Macedonia.

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:58.270
[reading in Maltese]

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:03.490
&gt;&gt; So, that was Maltese.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:09.170
Now the same poem, but the whole
lot in English translation.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.740
Macedonia Square.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:24.420
I always meet you, you spirits of
old cities, ghosts playing violins,

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:31.540
the same songs old and
dim, always about loves

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.040
that have tried and failed.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:40.100
Always the same death in
the middle of the square.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:44.290
By now I'm used to having you
appear out of nowhere to bestow

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.280
on me your solitary welcome.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:52.360
Strings, destined to play
only images familiar,

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:57.390
like the same sweaty embrace,
and tears of silver dropping

00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:00.880
on our lapels and running
everywhere.

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:05.250
It's raining, but you keep
on rambling through streets

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:10.840 position:56%
that are bursting with lore of kings
and queens, who sketched a map that,

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.580
silently, we can't help but follow.

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:23.870
Just for tonight, we shall sit at
table, smoke a cigarette together,

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:30.040
and then we'll cry, and feel the
tears give us pleasure only we two

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.660
can understand.

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:39.740
Because there is no one else
left in this old city like us.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:48.700
[pause]

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:53.040
&gt;&gt; Since I came here
I forgot my name.

00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.530
I slept in seven different beds,

00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:01.630
climbed up mountain tops,
dipped my feet in lakes.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:07.560 position:56%
I spoke some four languages I didn't
know, browned in the blazing sun,

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.110
froze under the biting hail.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:13.760
I met people whose
name I never learned,

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.300
I ate and drank all they gave
me and heard their stories

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.800
and those of their ancestors.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.810
I rode cars of every
shape and color.

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:28.510
And then they drove
me to the city's end.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:33.800
I asked them where I
was, but no one answered.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.320
This is another poem from Skopje.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:47.140
And rain starts falling
heavily again.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.800
Again, that song we heard six
months ago when we were alone,

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.460
looking shyly at each other,

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:58.920
undecided whether to
make love or not.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.580
And then you said, "Better not,
because tomorrow you're leaving."

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:07.110
Then you cried, and I stared,

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:11.870
lost my eyes along the
edges of your hair.

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:16.730
Again, that stuffy weather
and humid, dropping loads

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:20.210
of leaves before they died,

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:24.030
and again that song
we heard six years ago

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:29.000 position:56%
when we were alone together, looking
with nostalgia at each other,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.010
and decided what should or next
words be after, "How's it going?

00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:35.830
It's been ages."

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:41.940
And after a few uneasy seconds
I spot the strange marks,

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.190
sad and silent, that
the rain left scattered

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:48.560
in the corners of your face.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:53.620
Against your wishes you have to
tell me again, "Hurry, run now.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.190
The plane is waiting."

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:59.400
Everywhere I go I seem
to find someone waiting.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.630
If it's not the plane then it's
a strong gust of wind rising up

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:07.300
and pouncing from behind every
corner, with tearful eyes,

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.460
with sure marks of aging.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:14.660
I look up, and the lights
turn to green again.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:22.740
I would like to read two
poems about my mother.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:27.400
My mother was a very
religious person,

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.770
and when you say a
very religious person

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:34.600
in Malta, it means very Catholic.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.060
The first poem I'm going to read,

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.460
I was told that this ritual is
no longer allowed in churches,

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:47.450
but up to a few years
ago, right after the end,

00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:52.110
or just before the end of
the mass, before internment,

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:58.870
relatives could go and read
a message or something.

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:04.880
And when my mother died, which
was on the eve of Christmas,

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:09.430
one of my nieces read this poem,

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:12.870
which I wrote specifically
for my mother's funeral.

00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:18.500
I have to tell you, it's never
been read, not even in Maltese,

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:23.570
except on that particular day,
so this is really a premier,

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.580
because I've never read
this poem in public before.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.570
It's called of course,
A Poem for Your Funeral.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:39.770
Mom, I remember you sitting out in
the yard peeling tangerines for me,

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:44.980
and telling the lovely stories
which you always knew how to weave.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.290
And Mom, I remember
you telling me once

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:52.610
that you'd seen the stars fall
one by one, and there were

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:57.000
so many that the sea lit up.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.460
Before I went to bed
you always told me

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.610
that the rain was only
Our Lady's needles.

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:07.970
If you touched them they
wouldn't prick, as they were holy.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:13.550
The wind was nothing but the voice
of God singing, and the lightning

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:19.090
and the thunder were the toys which
Jesus dropped while he was playing.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:21.230
I remember you, Mom.

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:27.890
Beautiful as red roses, as orange
blossom, Narcissus, or as daisies.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:31.860
I remember, Mom, your
voice like violins playing

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:35.250 position:56%
or stopping according to their wish.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:42.930
Then, they stopped once, for all.

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.490
Everything ended.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:50.850
And now even flowers feel the
muted silence, and the sea,

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:55.720
which once lit up,
has been switched off.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:01.490
So go, Mom, because the candles
have been lit by someone.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:06.190
Someone awaits you with
a bouquet in his arms.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:16.200
And make sure you smile
Mom, and have a happy feast.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:21.790
I saw the fresh water
running among the trees,

00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:25.550
carrying the remains of my mother.

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:30.540
From afar they were
carried, by frosty wind

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.710
that blew over the grave.

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:37.320
By the sheer waters
searching for a foreign land.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:43.160
By happy dolphins, by strong waves,
by icy rivers crossing mountains

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.240
and resting for a while in valleys.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.210
The fresh water runs
gracefully among the trees

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:56.840
which waited centuries for
my coming, and when I arrived

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.840
to greet the fresh
water approaching,

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:05.500
I saw it had brought me
the remains of my mother.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:09.080
Her bones, and her hair.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.050
Her blue dress with white motifs.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:15.320
Bits and pieces from her coffin.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.760
For 100 lira we had bought it.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:23.610
Now bearing some dizzy worms
which had been feasting upon her.

00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:30.860 position:56%
While bathing my feet in this fresh
running water, against my bear skin,

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.770
the remains begin rubbing.

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:38.990
Then they all gather gently
to rest just below me,

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.930
looking me straight in the eye.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.860
I'm not sure if they
understand my smile,

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:50.240
whether they think its pleasure,
or whether they take it as a sign

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.940
that the end is near,
and it's summoning me

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:56.940
to slide into the water.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:11.440
This is a poem from
Portugal, from Lisbon.

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:16.930
So there'll be no more death
now, it's just passion, you know.

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:22.480
It's called "St. Nicholas
Street in Lisbon."

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:28.420 position:56%
You'd figure that from under her jet
black hair would stream the sound

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.420
of an old guitar.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:35.300
That from her matching eyes would
tumble the songs of fishermen,

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:41.690
and tall tales told on the way
back home with a full catch.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:49.730 position:56%
You think it was her painted fingers
that parted your hair like a breeze,

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:53.430
and you think it was
her voice that woke you

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:56.440
when there was no one
left to hear you.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:02.680
You think that in her handbag she
pegged your last remaining years

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:07.270 position:56%
until your bones fall to the ground,
and you won't have the strength

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:10.840
to pick them up and
put them back in place.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:17.420
You spot her walking toward you
languidly, looking up and down,

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:21.240
smiling as she notices
you noticed her,

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:25.520
and your heart starts beating
harder, and your forehead,

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:31.230
that's the fresh rash
from the Atlantic.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:36.050
But then you feel your legs wobble.

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:37.810
You're scared.

00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:44.060 position:56%
For so long you've been craving this
encounter; now she's here right next

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:49.070
to you, close enough to smell the
perfume creeping along her neck.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:53.890
You can see stray wrinkles
sauntering about her face,

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:57.600
and her heart pulsing
underneath her shirt.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.310
You can touch her too.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:02.740
She's right at your fingertips.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:06.070
But now your strength
has completely left you.

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:10.050
You stand there staring like
a kid waiting to be punished,

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.800 position:56%
like a kid waiting for some present.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.780
"Let's have a coffee,
and then we'll go."

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.100
And it's true.

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.820
She has cords circling
around her head.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:26.310
Her eyes, the sole
voice of the fisherman.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:27.610
"Want to come?

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:33.730 position:56%
I have a cottage on the shore, a bed
where you can lie, bread and water,

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:38.210
a large window through which you'll
see the sea staring at night,

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:40.360
crashing, waiting for us.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:47.470
In my bag I hold the waves, strong
and cruel, just like my hair.

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:50.290
So, you want to go, right?"

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:52.750
So, you really want to go right?

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:55.430
You really want to go with her.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:57.630
You want to have your
wish come true,

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:03.070
see the dream unfurling
sweetly into reality.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:04.850
But you can't.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.860
You're too scared.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:11.310
And you tell her, "No," because
you still have your mother's milk

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:12.860
beneath your teeth.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.120
"Some other time," you say.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:16.890
"I'll come again to wait for you.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:18.190
I'll catch a plane.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:19.560
I promise I'll be back.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.760
I'll sail against the wind again.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:26.670
I'll walk, climb hills, rappel
cliffs, to get back to the city.

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:29.910
I'll sit once more in
this very same spot

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:32.880
to make sure that you can see me."

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:40.540
But now you see her far away,
no more than a tiny speck.

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:46.570
She's left you savoring just her
scent, and said she won't be back.

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:52.140
Because a gust of wind
blows only once.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:05.470
All right, some more
passion from Spain.

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:10.910
There is this beautiful
square in Cordoba,

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:16.000
it's called Plaza de la
Corredera, and it's been used

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.890
for different purpose
throughout the years.

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:22.210
It was a market, it was a place

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:27.210
where there were bullfights
once, et cetera, et cetera.

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:31.090
So, this is Plaza de la
Corredera in Cordoba.

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:39.400
Imagine yourself starting
to cross the square,

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:43.970
naked as God upon the seventh day.

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:49.430
Underfoot the bull's
blood is still boiling.

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:54.280
A slightly moist red
rose is in your hair.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:58.460
In your left hand, there's
a black fan the color

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:02.100
of sweet wine that's
been poured cold

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:06.610
and which your full
lips can still savor.

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:12.700
You are crossing the square without
your noticing that out of sight,

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:20.320
behind a half-closed door, staring
at you, there is this foolish poet.

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:27.000
Imagine that you've reached
the middle of this square,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.120
naked as God upon the seventh day,

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:36.250
the spilt blood's reek
is growing slowly rusty.

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:42.220
In your hair, a dry
red rose is wilting.

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:47.410
In your left hand you now carry
a suitcase with folded cloths

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:49.270
which have begun to crease,

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:53.960
and letters you've
received but never opened.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:58.770
You're there right in the
middle, and you notice under one

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:03.850
of the arches there's
a poet studying you.

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:08.370
His look is a bull's look.

00:31:08.370 --> 00:31:11.270
Imagine that you're
right across the square,

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:14.670
naked as God upon the seventh day.

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:18.270
The rain is pouring down
and cleansing everything.

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:22.280
Your eyes, your lips and
hair, are leaking dye.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.480
Your left hand moans.

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.040
Your navel's lost within
a troubled sea.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:31.520
Fatigue from the long walk
weighs down your legs.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:35.970
You reach the edge and
turn to look behind.

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:43.680
An aging poet, on his life's last
day, prepares at last to enter you.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.200
Come down here to Plaza
de la Corredera.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:51.560 position:56%
Stare at the dark women and the men.

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:53.720
Smile only with your lips.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.360
Keep your eyes hard.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.090
Stop up your ears.

00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:59.130
Ignore the noisy crowd.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:04.520
Instead, just listen
to the sudden paces

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:08.820
of that man standing
right there opposite you,

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:15.160
the man who's fully armed to wound
the bull, his eyes two tiny swords,

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:20.950 position:56%
two sharpened daggers, his lips
shutters ajar to the night's depths.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:22.720
The bull appears.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.050
The crowd's murmur fills out.

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:30.370
The man who holds himself right
opposite raises his swords aims his

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:31.670
daggers well.

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:36.730
You sit and smoke, sitting
at your black coffee,

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:41.030
your big green eyes
blending well with the hue

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:46.940
of blood rusting the tiles where
the bull's writhing soul was spewed

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:52.670
as five bombed out of
upon that afternoon.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:59.020
40 degrees, and thirst,
and sweat, and lethargy.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:06.410
You take the sandals off, place
your bare feet upon the empty chair

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:12.190
where opposite you, a little while
ago, the wary toreador rested,

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:16.050
dazed by the hefty
cheers of the crowd.

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:17.850
40 degrees.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:21.420
You draw your hair into a bun.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:25.820
There's sugar in the bottom
of your cup, and ashes.

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:27.500
40 degrees.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:32.110
The moon prepares to rise and hides
the blood which is still there,

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:35.040
soiling the grooves
between the tiles,

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:38.350
spreading a sheet which
can shroud death.

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:43.140
You turn your head to look at
the old woman, lovely still,

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:46.500
sitting upon a stool
selling her fans,

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.760
and in her chestnut
eyes you see the crowd,

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.350
orgasmic at the blood
that's being shed.

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:59.520
And there, under the arches, mark
the man still searching for you,

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.840
his hand smeared with blood.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:05.840
Let your eyes remove his clothes.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:09.940
Raise your head as you
divest him of his cares.

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:11.940
Bewitch him with your own.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:19.550 position:56%
Spell within spell, mystery entwined
with mystery, gaze locked in gaze.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:22.340
The bull is ready for the fight.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:26.750
40 degrees, and your
dress clings to you.

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:32.420
An immense fly teases your neck,
and you pull out another cigarette

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:36.900
to smoke in the silence
of afternoon, of the gaze,

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.860
in the silence of vapor drifting

00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:43.120
from the cup towards
your green eyes,

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:47.690
melting like the bull's
cry, stretched in the rot.

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:53.310
His eyes seeking an elegy in
yours, late in the afternoon.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:56.600
His eyes turn dry.

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.550
40 degrees.

00:34:58.550 --> 00:35:04.440
This square buries a bull,
but forgets to wash its blood.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:09.230
And so, as you sit with
your black coffee, smoke,

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:13.390
the green of your big
eyes mingles with memories

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:16.490
which reach into the corners.

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:18.550
40 degrees.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:23.440
But as you rise to make your way to
bed, your body, drenched in sweat,

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:29.360 position:56%
suddenly shudders, your lips tremble
a bit, and your teeth chatter.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:32.780
You're leaving one
fully armed man behind,

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:36.490
leaving a whole population
soaked in the blood

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:41.940
of an abandoned bull stretched
full-length in a square.

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:45.790
I can still savor the taste
of those green olives,

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:49.590
the spidery cuttlefish
swimming in lemon blood.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:53.530
I can still feel the
sun dry up my hair.

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:58.040
I can still feel my body
quicken to flamenco,

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:01.150 position:56%
with inviting glances of the dancer.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:06.280
They taught her body,
now it could live death.

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:13.020
Tonight, in this four-star hotel,
she'll steal into my room for us

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:18.760
to spend this night in
celebration of running water.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:23.930
Take me. Take me with you where
you're not meant to take me.

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:27.330
Carry me with you where
you're not meant to carry me,

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:30.990
into the corner there
is reserved for others.

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:34.490
entangle me unawares
inside your web.

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:38.530
Kiss me over and over
until I'm out of breath,

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:43.550
and let that fan conceal
me with its shade of death.

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:48.580
Your eyes seem to have
grown while I undressed.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:53.170
I felt them, slightly
damp, climb up my bodies.

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:57.240
My toes first, then my legs,
up to my waste, up my thighs.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:03.540
A moonless night was in your eyes,
a hurricane embracing stormy seas,

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:10.080
both rising, moving further, up to
stroke my navel, to hang suspended

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:12.040
from the nipples of my chest.

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:15.760
But see, they never,
never reach my eyes.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.850
Tell me, how scared are
you of my lewd gaze?

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:25.260
Lie down. There are no webs in me,
nor does death lurk behind the fan.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:33.020
Let me take you, and make you
what you feared to be, my darling.

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:44.790
&gt;&gt; I would like to
read one last poem.

00:37:44.790 --> 00:38:01.880
It is a poem which I wrote after
the nth case of people leaving

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:13.980 position:56%
from northern Africa heading towards
Europe to try to make a new living,

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:17.250
fleeing their troubled countries.

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:21.630
As you know, many of these
people, unfortunately,

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.760
they never make it
ashore, and they end

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.720
up drowning in the Mediterranean.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:32.890
So, yes, there was the
passion of the Mediterranean,

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:36.100
but now there is the
other side of our sea.

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:42.400
We Mediterraneans are
very full of our sea,

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:48.850
very proud to be Mediterraneans,
but we are also very sorry

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:52.290
with what is happening
with these people.

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:57.390
This poem is called,
Will This Boat Arrive?.

00:38:57.390 --> 00:39:03.370
It is based on two things: first,
on the account of one survivor

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:08.950
in Lampedusa, which is
an island far from ours,

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:12.250
but it's part of the
Italian archipelago,

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:16.890
and I'm sure you've seen that image

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:21.830
of that little child
washed ashore, lifeless.

00:39:21.830 --> 00:39:23.780
So, Will This Boat Arrive.

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.370
Will this boat arrive?

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:35.530
Will it? Or will it lose breath,
seizing just before the sea stops

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:42.260
and land begins, a land
that does not know us?

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:48.080
I walked through alleys,
I walked through streets,

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:51.460
through hamlet, town, and city.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:57.480
Everywhere, sweeping crooked
steps just to keep on moving.

00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:02.620
I crossed rivers and
valleys, climbed mountains

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:06.780
which swore they'd return
to crush me beneath them.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:12.600
Still I walked on through
fickle suns, phasing moons,

00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:19.570 position:56%
reaching out to pluck a bright star,
blow it, and send it back home,

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:26.530
so it might, through the window,
warmly kiss my mother, my father,

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:34.040
my sister, that is if they
still are, if they are still.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:43.980 position:56%
Before me, wave upon wave of sand, a
yellow, fishless, and waterless sea.

00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:50.450
I walk on, counting all
the steps and notes,

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:54.520
holding the white plastic
bag in my hands.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:41:00.810
A bottle of water, a cluster
of dates, a handful of photos,

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:05.830
some travel sickness pills,
old papers folded certifying

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:12.700
that I'm a learned one, a jacket, a
jersey, and of course the passport.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:21.750
I got burned, frozen, terrified
most by the dark; that is,

00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:27.530
till the Ghibli blew
in, taunting and cruel,

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:34.920
its searing hot winds burning
down, tearing skin with fine dust,

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.890
and swearing one day it
would return to crush,

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:44.090
bury me, secretly, its gusts.

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:50.910
I wept mightily, prayers rolling
where there once had been tears.

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:53.800
Prayers to a God full of mercy.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.080
I supposed he would hear.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:42:01.880
I summoned him, calling him
by name more than once, twice,

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:06.960
in the nothingness surrounding me.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:13.850
When I dozed off, I dreamt of
voices I used to hear often,

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:17.880
wafting through lush tree branches.

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:25.320
I dreamt of the voices of old folks
I knew, maundering on for hours.

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:30.690
I dreamt of the voices
of apples, ripe melons,

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:34.990
of milk sauntering freely
through my mother's full breast,

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:40.300
and spicy voices rising from
Latakia leaves, pungent,

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:43.740
being smoked by olive dark men.

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:50.410
Then I dreamt again,
of sweat, and of bones,

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:56.590
of cold black holes piercing
me, pleading me, "Don't go!"

00:42:56.590 --> 00:43:00.960
Telling me to turn back,
"get away from the shore,

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:05.170
pay no attention to men with boats.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:10.170
Beware the water,"
they say, "It's cruel."

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:15.730
The voices cry out
danger, warning me sure,

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:20.560
"Don't step on another man's land."

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:23.240
I woke with a jolt.

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:30.620
And so before me descends a blue
carpet unfurling to that cold land,

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:34.940
a land that's afraid of,
yet doesn't even know me,

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:38.580
a land that I'm no less
determined to set foot on,

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:42.360
so I walk on towards the boats.

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.930 position:56%
I carry this bag that I have chosen,

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:49.190
packed it with my whole
story, one bag.

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:55.990 position:56%
And even that will soon get
lighter once, at gun or knife point,

00:43:55.990 --> 00:44:00.010
I pay my passage to climb
into their sea craft,

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:04.220
challenging voices
urging me to stop.

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:05.660
Will the boat make it?

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:13.070
Will it? Once upon a shore
there were children playing,

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:16.680
chasing a ball, running
and laughing.

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:21.140
Someone from afar, someone
from afar gunned them down,

00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:24.050
and there was no one left
on the beach save the ball,

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:25.710
which stood there waiting.

00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:29.370
I remember that ball
bouncing across and back sand.

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:33.640
I remember my cousins laughing,
running, the ball bouncing,

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:37.920
speeding faster than us, then
the wind joined in playing

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.080
with the ball, and it
started playing with us.

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:44.130
We were trying our best
to outrun that wind,

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:46.650
reach the ball it had
cruelly snatched,

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:49.230
racing to see who might
get it first.

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:51.280
Of course I was the last.

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.990
I ran the slowest.

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:54.760
I couldn't beat the wind.

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:57.660
But I ran, I ran, we all did!

00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:01.700
The taunt of the wind, the
sound of laughter, and then,

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:06.670 position:56%
then someone from afar, someone from
afar gunned us down, and no one,

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:09.450
not one of us reached the ball.

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:12.820
Still the wind stayed
on, having already won,

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:15.910
kept playing on its
own, but with my face

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:20.650
to the ground I see nothing
at all, only darkness.

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:28.960
Now I have no idea how long
I've been here waiting.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:31.210
A day, two, three?

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:34.510
More? I wait.

00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:37.150
Locked up with strangers
locked up with me.

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:43.030
And we look, and we look at the
dark blue sea, and we count.

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:48.410
Counting every strange, and
very strange numbers of, sounds,

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:51.640
bank notes for the guy
with the Kalashnikov,

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:57.110
steps we take wasted deep
into the water to get

00:45:57.110 --> 00:46:01.640
to this fragile boat
meant to transport us,

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:05.960
and I see that my bag is
swelling with the sea.

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:10.030
My passport inside,
close to tatters.

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:13.960
Faces of my loved ones
now drifting in water,

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:18.270
my pills one by one
melting and dropping.

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:23.470
My dates have lost their
sweetness, quickly turning salty.

00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:28.980
The jacket and the jersey
threadbare, I lose all my story.

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:33.830
Now drenched, watch it dissolving.

00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:40.390
Like caught fish packed in
crates, we set off for the unknown.

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:44.230
Behind me, ashore with damp sands,

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:47.700
there's no one left
there save a gust of wind

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:53.950 position:56%
and heavy silence you always hear as
you close one book to open another.

00:46:53.950 --> 00:47:00.990
There is a curious white
blot, and it's spreading,

00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:05.240
carried neither by
wind nor by water.

00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:10.010
But I can see clearly, there's
a child in a red top face

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:16.140
down kissing the sand, washed by
the sea, a cleansing for burial.

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:21.590
And the wind begins to blow as
it always does when it wakes,

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:25.860
but the red-shirted
child does not stir.

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:30.680
And the boat carries
us off now, away, away.

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:35.630
Maybe we'll get there, maybe.

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:39.040
And we ask, will this boat make it?

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:43.880
Will it? Or will it
lose breath, seizing,

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:47.610
just before the sea stops, and ...

00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:54.020
The waves, the sand, mountainous,
crushing, screams, darkness, cold,

00:47:54.020 --> 00:48:01.580
thirst, cries, and suddenly ...

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:16.860
Thank you very much.

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.160
[applause]

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:23.170
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: So, we will watch
a video, a beautiful video,

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:29.090
produced in the Czech Republic
with Dr. Mifsud as a protagonist

00:48:29.090 --> 00:48:32.570
in it, on the sea, in a boat.

00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:33.930
I won't say more.

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:39.240
We will give Dr. Mifsud some
time to transition into a part

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:42.330
of our program which
is a conversation,

00:48:42.330 --> 00:49:34.830
a briefer conversation, but a
conversation between the two of us.

00:49:34.830 --> 00:50:17.980
Thank you.

00:50:17.980 --> 00:56:11.090
[video]

00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:14.350
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: I would like
to take advantage of the fact

00:56:14.350 --> 00:56:19.410
that you're here, and have you
read also a couple of passages

00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:24.780
from In The Name of the
Father, rather than me doing it.

00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:26.080
&gt;&gt;IMMANUEL MIFSUD: Sure.

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.380
Right.

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:28.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Because it is
inherent to a question that I wanted

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:32.790
to ask you, which is
very much tied to a video

00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:40.090
that we have just seen, The Sea.

00:56:40.090 --> 00:56:45.840
Starting to, when you
get home, you collapse.

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.610
&gt;&gt;IMMANUEL MIFSUD: To?

00:56:48.610 --> 00:56:53.240
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: To The Tower,
"I'm afraid of a lot of things."

00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:56.510
"I'm afraid of a lot of things" ...

00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:58.830
Yes, "I'm afraid of
a lot of things".

00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:00.440
&gt;&gt;IMMANUEL MIFSUD: Yes.

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:03.670
When you get home you
collapse onto the nearest chair

00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:06.060
and then lace your boots.

00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:10.370
You always unlace the left
boot first, and you ask me

00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:13.220
to pull your boots off for you.

00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:17.820
Once they're off, they feel heavy
in my hands, and you tell me

00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:20.630
to line them up neatly
under the bed.

00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:26.100
And you roll along like
a boat on a rough sea.

00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:30.290
And the sea gets rougher
once your boots are off.

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:34.940
No shortness of breath in spite
of all the cigarettes you smoke.

00:57:34.940 --> 00:57:40.660
You dive to the very bottom of
the bay below [inaudible] to bring

00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:45.510
up sea urchins, scores of sea
urchins in the wicker basket.

00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:49.480
They reek of the sea.

00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:53.440
The smell of sea urchins is
alien to me, and I've never been

00:57:53.440 --> 00:58:01.520
down to [inaudible], and
those dark depths scare me.

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.820
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Beautiful.

00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:08.020
I have another passage related
to the question we are going to,

00:58:08.020 --> 00:58:16.270
and this time it is about the
father drawing squares in the sand.

00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:17.570
&gt;&gt;IMMANUEL MIFSUD: Okay.

00:58:17.570 --> 00:58:19.950
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: If you
could please read from,

00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:25.440
"You call me, and I
come next to you"?

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:26.740
Should I show you?

00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:28.040
&gt;&gt;IMMANUEL MIFSUD: Yes, please.

00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:30.520
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: I'm
sorry, we didn't prepare.

00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:34.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt;IMMANUEL MIFSUD: That's all right.

00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.620
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: It's improvised.

00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:36.920
You call me ...

00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:39.540
Read it from [inaudible].

00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:40.840
&gt;&gt;IMMANUEL MIFSUD: Okay.

00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.140
Pardon me.

00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:44.510
You call out to me because
you want to take a picture,

00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:46.900
but I've got a castle to build.

00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:48.890
I've no time for pictures.

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:51.300
You take your pictures
one after the other.

00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:55.650
I want to build a sand castle so
that I can enjoy tearing it down.

00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:58.290
Then, just as I'm finishing
the castle,

00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:01.020
you get up and walk away, alone.

00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:06.230
Not far from where the foam boldly
laps the shoreline, you call me

00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:10.770
and I come next to you and
with a dead twig in your hand,

00:59:10.770 --> 00:59:16.460
you etch a square in the wet sand
littered with lifeless jellyfish.

00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:18.560
"Look at the square," you say.

00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:20.690
"Now we'll wait for the
sea to come closer."

00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:25.510
And the sea does come closer,
and when it ebbs away I realize

00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:28.530
that the square has disappeared.

00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:34.470
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: So, Dr.
Mifsud, from your writing,

00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:39.360
from the poems you have
read, from the video,

00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:44.580
it seems you have an ambivalent
relationship with your country,

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:51.320
and you don't mention your country
very, very often in your works.

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:55.250
The images of the sea
conjure up your country

00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:58.030
and show this ambivalence.

00:59:58.030 --> 01:00:01.640
I wanted to ask you if ...

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:06.590
In your works the sea seems
to be synonymous with,

01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:11.620
or a metaphor of Malta, and
the sea is at times the father.

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:15.140
It takes away and forces
you to be brave,

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:17.740
just like a nation would also do.

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:24.220 position:56%
Or the mother, in a poem of yours,
Wariness, free-falling into the sea,

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:28.970
is like falling into the embrace
of the mother, letting go.

01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:34.620
The sea is isolation, as you
were saying, but also the route

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:40.720 position:56%
for travelers, colonizers, at once
full of possibilities or entrapment.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:45.330
I understand this, I am from a
coastal town in southern Italy.

01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:49.220
I don't come from northern Italy,
I come from southern Italy.

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:58.540 position:56%
And you were saying something about
the sea before, that Mediterraneans,

01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:02.690
who have the sea, are full of
this pride of having the sea,

01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:06.380
but at the same time it is
something that takes away

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:10.080
from us because it isolates.

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:15.650
It made me think a lot about an
Italian songwriter, Pino Daniele,

01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:21.940
from Naples, who talks about
the sea in these terms.

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:24.710
My Neapolitan isn't good
either, but [foreign language].

01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:33.800
This is what it means: "Those
who have the sea are happy fools.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:39.130
Those who have the sea know
they do not have anything."

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:45.780
What is your relationship
with the sea?

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:48.580
&gt;&gt;IMMANUEL MIFSUD: Well, I think,
as year old pointed out earlier on,

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:52.200
it's an ambivalent relationship.

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:55.390
Partly because I think I have
an ambivalent relationship

01:01:55.390 --> 01:01:56.740
with everything.

01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:04.160
There is always this need to
relate to something, or to someone,

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:08.700
but at the same time there is
also an inability to do it,

01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:17.440
because there is this
natural tendency to isolate.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:21.270
At this time I'm isolating
myself most probably.

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:25.000
What is my relationship to the sea?

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:31.410
I think people who live on islands,
especially small islands ...

01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:37.400
In Malta, basically you can see
the sea from practically anywhere.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:43.140
It's that small, and also it's
hilly, so it makes it more easy

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:46.080
to look down and see the edge.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:51.060
And I think the sea
is, on the one hand,

01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:56.520
something which gives us an
identity, so we love the sea

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:59.790
of course, but we are
also very conscious

01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:05.230
that the sea is isolating
us, so it angers us maybe.

01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:08.150
So there is this love
and anger at the sea.

01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:12.050
Once I was talking to a
fisherman, and you'd expect

01:03:12.050 --> 01:03:15.300
that a fisherman would
take the sea for granted

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:19.990
because they are all the time
working near or on the sea.

01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:23.850
But it transpired from
our short dialogue

01:03:23.850 --> 01:03:30.010
that fishermen too have
this ambivalent relationship

01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:32.410
with the sea.

01:03:32.410 --> 01:03:34.690
Because it gives them their living,

01:03:34.690 --> 01:03:37.860
but at the same time they know
they are risking their lives

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:39.160
when they are on the sea.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:45.940
So, I think this ambivalence
is quite natural.

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:52.100
It is also an issue with me
and my country as a whole.

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:58.480 position:56%
At one point you feel you belong, at
one point you feel you don't belong.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:03.430
I had all the opportunity
to leave, and when I was 16,

01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:05.700
I remember I was obsessed
with leaving,

01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:08.840
with emigrating, like
my brothers did.

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:12.250
When I had the opportunity,
I did not.

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:17.130
Not even that, I am married to a
foreigner, and I got the foreigner

01:04:17.130 --> 01:04:19.690
to Malta rather than
I leaving Malta.

01:04:19.690 --> 01:04:24.820
So, life can be quite
ironic sometimes.

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:30.850
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Yes, could this also
explain your love, your fondness,

01:04:30.850 --> 01:04:37.090
for countries in eastern
Europe, in northern Europe?

01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:40.980
&gt;&gt;IMMANUEL MIFSUD: Yes, but
my love for those countries,

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:46.260
it started when I was
still very, very young.

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:50.370
I was maybe, what, 11, 12.

01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:54.800
The love started on
a linguistic level.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:58.370
Because I used to hear the news,
and I used to hear these words

01:04:58.370 --> 01:05:02.790
which rang so beautifully in my
ears, like, "Czechoslovakia,"

01:05:02.790 --> 01:05:04.670
for example, such a beautiful word.

01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:09.600
Or "Romania," I don't
know, or "Yugoslavia."

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:15.560
These, somehow they attracted
me more than, I don't know,

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:19.880
France, Netherlands, Germany.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:24.120
I don't know why, but I
remember, it was the sound.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:27.210
Of course I was too young
to know what Yugoslavia

01:05:27.210 --> 01:05:31.170
and Romania, et cetera, et cetera.

01:05:31.170 --> 01:05:35.370
I told before how religious
my mother was,

01:05:35.370 --> 01:05:39.740
and I remember every Saturday she
used to receive this newspaper.

01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:43.900
I'm sure the ambassador will know
which paper, it was published

01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:48.020
by the church, [inaudible],
devoid of truth.

01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:55.620
I was young, and I used
to leaf through it,

01:05:55.620 --> 01:06:00.420
and there was always some
page, even two pages maybe,

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:07.700
demonizing the communist east,
because they are killing priests,

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:11.470
or because they are
this and this and this.

01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:16.880
So in my mind I had this
conflict, in a young boy's mind,

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:20.950
I had this conflict that I am
so in love with these words,

01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:26.760 position:56%
Czechoslovakia, et cetera, but then
the church is teaching me to be wary

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:29.210
of them, you know what I mean.

01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:30.510
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: The devil.

01:06:30.510 --> 01:06:31.810
&gt;&gt; IMMANUEL MIFSUD: Of course
growing older I realized

01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:37.650
that Yugoslavia, simply across the
sea, it's so near us and the rest

01:06:37.650 --> 01:06:40.570
of this eastern Europe,
then of course when I grew

01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:47.450
up I started reading, and
I realized how in love I am

01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:50.490
with the arts of these countries.

01:06:50.490 --> 01:06:55.480
Of course it was very sad for
me what happened in this region,

01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:00.860
et cetera, et cetera, but that is
a different discourses altogether.

01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:02.750
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Yes.

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:07.320
Going back to this, your book of
poems, your collection of poems,

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:12.210
Polska And Slovenska, talks
about Poland of course,

01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:15.730
and also Slovenia,
and talks about ...

01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:18.400
refers to, sorry, it does not talk.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:25.430
It refers to it, conjures up the
holocaust, and it also refers

01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:29.170
to the communist regime
in these countries.

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:31.840
Can you talk more about
this collection

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:37.120
of poems, and what led you?

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:41.630
&gt;&gt; IMMANUEL MIFSUD:
Well, the Slovakia part,

01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:47.530
my wife comes from Slovakia, so by
now it's my second adopted country,

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:55.040
because we visit the country quite
often: two, three times a year.

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:59.100
Of course it was one of these
words which I fell in love

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:01.540
with when I was a little boy.

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:11.780
Poland is a country which
produced so many artists I admire.

01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:24.270 position:56%
Kieslowski when it comes to film,
Herbert and Szymborska and Ruzevich,

01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:29.210
and Kantor and [inaudible]
and Grotowski,

01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:37.320
it's such a rich country,
with such a sad history.

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:42.780
Because if you were to
look at just the map

01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:44.900
of Poland throughout the years,

01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:49.970
geographically Poland
is never the same.

01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:53.460
At one point it even
vanishes from Europe.

01:08:53.460 --> 01:09:00.630 position:56%
That book was, basically it marked
my first visit to the two countries,

01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:03.000
and the impression
they left upon me.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:11.110
In the Slovak part, when we
are there we live in a region

01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:15.320
which is very well known
for having been the core

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:21.020
of the partisan activities
during the war, the revolution

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:24.610
against the fascist regime there.

01:09:24.610 --> 01:09:29.640
And so, you can feel
in the woods, you know,

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:33.000 position:56%
every so many meters there is a slab

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.000
which commemorates
some event, et cetera.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:43.980
As with Poland of course, as
well, the history of the country,

01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:51.000
the collective identity of the
people as a people who suffered

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.830
from Nazi Germany, from
communist Soviet Union.

01:09:55.830 --> 01:10:02.710
I have this, maybe morbid, I
don't know, tendency to identify

01:10:02.710 --> 01:10:06.680
with countries and
people who have suffered.

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:11.730
I feel I am obliged to show
empathy towards these people.

01:10:11.730 --> 01:10:15.790
On the other hand, as we were
saying yesterday, in another event

01:10:15.790 --> 01:10:19.220
which we had yesterday, I
always have this problem,

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:24.500
it's an ethical problem, whether I
have the right, being a foreigner

01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:28.550
to both these countries, and
others I've written about.

01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:34.510
And the ethical problem comes
from, do I have the right

01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:39.700
to tell the story which is
not mine, which I had never,

01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:42.910
ever anything to do with it?

01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:46.200
Do I have the right to do it?

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:50.060
It's an ethical problem
which I haven't yet resolved.

01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:51.360
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Beautiful.

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:54.020
I have prepared two poems
from Polska and Slovenska,

01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:59.270
but I did not bring it over
here, but one was about a child

01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:02.580
in the Holocaust, children
in the Holocaust.

01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:11.640
That was extremely tragic, because
I remembered being in Prague,

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:18.760
and being in the Jewish cemetery,
and this woman just kneeling

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:22.980
on the ground and looking
at children's drawings,

01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:27.120
children from the Holocaust,
and she was just crying.

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:30.670
So, it somehow brought
me back to that image.

01:11:30.670 --> 01:11:35.170
Another one was about a
woman in Czechoslovakia,

01:11:35.170 --> 01:11:39.390
a stranger on a train
maybe, or even on the road.

01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:42.880
But, I would've liked
to talk more about that.

01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:47.550
I am insisting on these countries
because in the European Division

01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:52.850
in particular, we start off
as a Slavic center of study,

01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:57.620
so I was very curious about your
relationship to these countries.

01:11:57.620 --> 01:12:02.230
But let's return to Malta, I
don't know how much time we have,

01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:06.000
but about Maltese literature
and language.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.980
They are both relatively new,

01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:15.140
in the sense of Maltese
language becoming recognized

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:18.270
as a national literary language.

01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:24.160
Although Malta had this long
history, and was colonized by many,

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:28.690
as you were saying, and in any
similar circumstance the language

01:12:28.690 --> 01:12:35.060
of the colonizer became your
language, the language of Malta.

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:40.110
It started to appear as a
recognized national language

01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:45.140
in the 19th century, and
it started to be valued

01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:49.240
as a literary language
short after that,

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:58.140
but really in the post-independence
period of history in your country?

01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:05.560
&gt;&gt; IMMANUEL MIFSUD: The language
itself is much, much more ancient

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:09.910
than this, because as you know,
the language has a Semitic base,

01:13:09.910 --> 01:13:15.170
coming from Arabic of course,
and then there's romance.

01:13:15.170 --> 01:13:20.590 position:56%
In our case, by romance we mean
Italian and Sicilian superstructure,

01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:24.250
and eventually an English
superstructure to that.

01:13:24.250 --> 01:13:27.890
Of course this reflects
the history of the island.

01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:32.510
So, as for language, language
is a very ancient thing,

01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:38.440
and our Romantic poets
were very proud saying

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:42.830
that this language is
an ancient language.

01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:45.070 position:56%
I can understand the Romantic poets,

01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:50.000
because one of the magnificent
things about this language is

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.640
that it basically braved
through all the foreign rules.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:00.420
As for literature, although
we have a poem going back

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:04.160
to the 15th century, but
it's a solitary thing so far.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:09.540
So when we talk of our
literature we go back only

01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:12.220
to the end of the 19th century.

01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:16.990
That's when literature
started to be properly written.

01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:21.820
Remember that although the
language is an ancient language,

01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:24.600
it was officially recognized

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:28.490
as the official language
of Malta in the 1930s.

01:14:28.490 --> 01:14:33.130
Of course it was a very
cunning political move

01:14:33.130 --> 01:14:36.690
from the English government

01:14:36.690 --> 01:14:40.800
to basically put aside
the Italian influence.

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:44.520
It's not that they wanted
the Maltese to be, you know.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:51.990
Then eventually, for us one huge
thing was having the European Union

01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:54.230
recognizing Maltese as one

01:14:54.230 --> 01:14:57.310
of the official language
as the European Union.

01:14:57.310 --> 01:15:03.120
Something which our romantic
poets would not have dreamt

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:04.420
in a million years.

01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:08.440
I always make with my students
that if they were alive,

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:13.420
they would be so happy they
would drop dead there and then.

01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:14.720
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Wonderful.

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:18.110
I think we have Time for
one very short question.

01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:21.080
I'm sorry we have to ...

01:15:21.080 --> 01:15:26.250
But okay, I will ask you a little
bit, maybe lighter, I'm not sure.

01:15:26.250 --> 01:15:27.550
&gt;&gt; IMMANUEL MIFSUD: Okay.

01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:33.260
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: When did you
decide to become a poet, and why?

01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:37.020
&gt;&gt; IMMANUEL MIFSUD: I always
tried to avoid this question.

01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:40.140
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Yes, I know, but
that's why I'm putting it to you.

01:15:40.140 --> 01:15:42.880
&gt;&gt; IMMANUEL MIFSUD: Now you
know why when I answer it.

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:49.140
But, the first time I answered it
was in Romania, because In The Name

01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:54.090 position:56%
of the Father was published in
Romanian some two years ago I think,

01:15:54.090 --> 01:15:55.390
and there was this journalist,

01:15:55.390 --> 01:15:59.710
and I thought that off the record
she was asking me this question.

01:15:59.710 --> 01:16:06.140
I answered her very honestly,
and not only was it published,

01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:12.330
but it was even translated into
English, and I said, "Oh goodness,

01:16:12.330 --> 01:16:13.860
no, this I shouldn't have said."

01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:16.100
Anyway, now it's public
so I can tell you.

01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:23.840
It's a very unpoetical
reason why I became a writer.

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.910
Basically, when I was
in high school,

01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:32.900 position:56%
and with us high school is 16, I
used to go to the state high school.

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:36.830
At the time we used to
call it the New Lyceum.

01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:39.400
It was a two year course
before entering the university.

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:47.880 position:56%
In Malta there is this, although
it's changing now, but from 10 years

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:56.320
until 15 they used to segregate
students between boys and girls.

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.080
Now it's changing.

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:03.480
Although I went to a church school
and I can't see that changing

01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:07.080
in church schools,
although you never know.

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:11.920
Of course after spending all
your adolescence just with boys,

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:15.090
and suddenly you start seeing
girls in your classroom,

01:17:15.090 --> 01:17:18.310
now it was a very beautiful
experience.

01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:20.920
Let's put it that way.

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:25.950
You start flirting, you start
dating, that usually is ...

01:17:25.950 --> 01:17:29.240
In my time now, of course.

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:30.540
Now things have changed.

01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:32.210
I'm looking at the ambassador,

01:17:32.210 --> 01:17:34.620
because we were undergraduates
together,

01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:39.910
so it's like I'm trying
to confer with him.

01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:46.310
It was the time when usually
boys, in my generation,

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:49.060
started dating, et cetera.

01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:56.420
There was this student in my
group who started dating a girl

01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:59.760
on the grounds that
he was writing poems.

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:07.290
And I said, "That must be something
which impresses girls, it seems."

01:18:07.290 --> 01:18:12.090
And I said, "If he did it,
why can't I do it as well?"

01:18:12.090 --> 01:18:14.320
So I started writing poems.

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:18.000
You can imagine what
kind of poems they were.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.080
Ironically this other
person stopped writing soon

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:28.190
after when most probably
the purpose was reached.

01:18:28.190 --> 01:18:33.180 position:56%
He became a prominent politician, so
of course I'm not mentioning names,

01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:36.450
and a member of parliament as well,

01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:39.370
whereas I continued
writing poetry and prose.

01:18:39.370 --> 01:18:41.430
Basically that was the story.

01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:43.030
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Thank you
very much, Dr. Mifsud.

01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:44.330
&gt;&gt; IMMANUEL MIFSUD: Thank
you for this invitation.

01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:45.630
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Thank you everybody.

01:18:45.630 --> 01:18:46.930
This was wonderful.

01:18:46.930 --> 01:18:48.230
&gt;&gt; IMMANUEL MIFSUD: Thank you.

01:18:48.230 --> 01:18:49.530
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: I would have liked

01:18:49.530 --> 01:18:58.650
to ask a lot more questions
and have you read.

01:18:58.650 --> 01:19:00.490
&gt;&gt; IMMANUEL MIFSUD:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:19:00.490 --> 01:19:01.790
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Maybe another time.

01:19:01.790 --> 01:19:03.090
&gt;&gt; IMMANUEL MIFSUD:
Maybe another time.

01:19:03.090 --> 01:19:04.390 position:56%
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: All right, thank you.

01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:05.690
&gt;&gt; IMMANUEL MIFSUD:
Thank you very much.

01:19:05.690 --> 01:19:09.070
Thanks. [applause]

01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:15.000
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Dr. Laura Falzon,
I would like you to come up here

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.760
and say a few words, because this
is a small way of thanking you

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:22.520
for everything that you've
done for this occasion.

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:28.880
&gt;&gt; LAURA FALZON: Thank you so much.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:33.520
First of all, I'd like to echo
the same feeling as the Ambassador

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:40.730
and Immanuel, just voice that it
is an honor for me, but also really

01:19:40.730 --> 01:19:44.480 position:56%
for the Arts Council of Malta in
New York, as that is who I represent

01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:49.280
to be partaking in this event,
and to be sponsoring it.

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:53.570
Also of course it was
the Ambassador's idea,

01:19:53.570 --> 01:20:04.240
and he convinced us basically, so I
really want to thank the Ambassador

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:08.140
for making this happen, really.

01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:15.520
I also want to thank everyone
who came today, braving the cold.

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:19.580 position:56%
I mean it's not as cold as New York.

01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:25.410
And for your support and interest
in Immanuel's work, and for showing

01:20:25.410 --> 01:20:27.190
such interest and enthusiasm

01:20:27.190 --> 01:20:31.840
for contemporary Maltese
literature and art.

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:37.530
Which, as here tested, is not
only exciting and dynamic,

01:20:37.530 --> 01:20:40.020
but one that continues
to sustain a long line

01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:42.240
of oral literary traditions

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:48.630
that define our own sense
of being, us Maltese.

01:20:48.630 --> 01:20:51.710
As someone who is very
proud of being Maltese,

01:20:51.710 --> 01:20:53.560
but of course also American,

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:57.960
I consider this event
a very special one.

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:01.710
In a way it is a landmark
of recognition.

01:21:01.710 --> 01:21:06.040
We would be the first to claim the
ancient truths of our language,

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:09.810
like you were discussing.

01:21:09.810 --> 01:21:13.500
But we are also very much
aware that more often than not,

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:18.620
a lot of times we have to
explain, where is Malta,

01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:24.380
and what language do you speak?

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.940
All sorts of things.

01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:31.490
So, being an expert, I know how
even a country like Britain,

01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:36.060
where I lived for 17 years
before I came to America,

01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:42.250
and of course you know
Malta considers England

01:21:42.250 --> 01:21:45.590
as the colonial motherland.

01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:50.210
Even there I always have to explain
where Malta is, what Malta is.

01:21:50.210 --> 01:21:54.670
According to them, they only
heard of Maltesers, the chocolate.

01:21:54.670 --> 01:21:59.460
And the Maltese dog.

01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:03.400
Everybody says, "You're the first
Maltese musician I've ever met."

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:10.830
Or, my husband, he's an
academic and a writer as well,

01:22:10.830 --> 01:22:16.570
so in the United States I've
also often had to do this.

01:22:16.570 --> 01:22:22.900
And these quick explanations, I
must say that we tend to take a lot

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:26.700
of pride, us as Maltese,
not just being Maltese,

01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:29.100
but also Mediterraneans.

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:33.110 position:56%
Because we often feel that we have
been privileged with a story that is

01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:36.020
at the crossroads of history.

01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:39.830
So, indeed, being Maltese and being
Mediterranean is complimentary

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:43.780
to us, and that as we speak our
own language, we invoke the North

01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:45.720
and the South of the sea.

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:49.300
Whereas you have noticed
from Immanuel's reading,

01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:53.790
our language sounds at the
same time Romance and Semitic,

01:22:53.790 --> 01:23:00.840
and we are very proud of that.

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:07.320
I've prepared probably a little bit
too much, but I just very quickly.

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:10.670
Somehow, as a musician I realize

01:23:10.670 --> 01:23:16.430 position:56%
that without this aesthetic identity
I find myself at a loss as well.

01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:20.010
Playing music that is inspired
by a constellation of cultures

01:23:20.010 --> 01:23:25.850
and sounds is not that
dissimilar from speaking a language

01:23:25.850 --> 01:23:29.820
which represents a collective,
basically, of cultures.

01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:38.400
So, Malta's artistic heritage
is very much a product

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:46.270
of this collective, between
the local and universal.

01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:52.090
We are attached to the sea, as you
identified in his writings as well,

01:23:52.090 --> 01:23:59.710
and in a way Maltese literature
claims Beckett's cosmopolitanism

01:23:59.710 --> 01:24:04.800
in the ancient times, which
have made our imaginary.

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:08.700
We all feel proud, I speak for
myself, but I know that I speak

01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:12.110
for all Maltese, especially
the ones in this room,

01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:16.730
Immanuel and the Ambassador.

01:24:16.730 --> 01:24:20.160
You know, we are very proud
when Maltese arts, language,

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:23.430
and literature are heard
in cosmopolitan setups,

01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:25.820 position:56%
like for instance those of New York,

01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:30.100
where a lot of people heard
Immanuel a few months ago

01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:36.420 position:56%
when we had him there to participate
in this literature festival,

01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:40.570
and he captivated the audiences
and everybody was so interested

01:24:40.570 --> 01:24:43.250
in his books and his writings.

01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:46.880
And of course now here
in Washington,

01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:53.640
DC and this wonderful institution,
the Library of Congress.

01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:59.430
So, I want to say thank you
all for engaging and sharing

01:24:59.430 --> 01:25:08.080 position:56%
and being here today, and this would
not happen unless we have a master.

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:13.460
Of course having somebody
like Immanuel, especially,

01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:18.340
as the first Maltese
to ever be invited

01:25:18.340 --> 01:25:23.580
to the Library of Congress,
it's great.

01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:30.340
Without the mastery of somebody
like him, maybe you wouldn't think

01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:33.640
so highly of the Maltese language.

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:41.710
He's taken it all over Europe
and all over the world,

01:25:41.710 --> 01:25:48.960
and his writings have been
translated into not just English

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:52.970
but several other languages,
as he has told us.

01:25:52.970 --> 01:25:58.910
So, this is just a little
fraction of what he's written,

01:25:58.910 --> 01:26:08.120
so hope this would tempt you into
looking at his other writings,

01:26:08.120 --> 01:26:11.640
all the books that are translated
and his forthcoming ones,

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:18.210
and also to introduce you to
Maltese arts and literature,

01:26:18.210 --> 01:26:22.770
and hopefully you might also
visit Malta at some point.

01:26:22.770 --> 01:26:32.970
Just to finish, I hope that
tonight's event is the first one

01:26:32.970 --> 01:26:38.780 position:56%
of many that would feature Maltese
arts and culture here in Washington,

01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:43.280
DC and especially at
the Library of Congress.

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:49.270
Of course I've already thanked
the ambassador and Immanuel.

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:56.740
I want to also thank Ruth Ward who,
she's very passionate about Malta,

01:26:56.740 --> 01:27:02.700
Maltese literature, and especially
Immanuel Mifsud's writing.

01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:09.900
And ten, special thanks
to Lucia Wolf.

01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:22.000
I know that, her incessant work,
belief in Maltese literature,

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:29.900
and belief in Immanuel's work, and
commitment to make this happen.

01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:37.000
I'm sure that you had to go against
a lot of odds for this to happen,

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.030
and I thank you very much.

01:27:40.030 --> 01:27:44.050
I understand there is a display.

01:27:44.050 --> 01:27:48.320
&gt;&gt; LUCIA WOLF: Have a display
outside, and I would like everybody

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:54.210
to enjoy, and we have also a
reception, so please partake.

01:27:54.210 --> 01:27:56.070
&gt;&gt; LAURA FALZON: Thank
you very much.

01:27:56.070 --> 01:28:00.250
[applause]

01:28:00.250 --> 01:28:03.910
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
