00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.560
Natural Selection, the driving force of evolution, takes a population of

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.651
organisms, and selects, only for those which are fit enough to survive. For

00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:16.306
example, after a drought in the Galapagos Islands that leaves tough dry seeds

00:00:16.306 --> 00:00:21.874
for bird food, only finches with big, durable beaks can crack open and eat the

00:00:21.874 --> 00:00:30.166
seeds to survive. The rest will die. Thus, those genes that produces the big,

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:34.099
durable beaks are naturally selected for and passed down to the next

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:39.820
generation. Hopefully allowing their offspring to survive a drought as well.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.346
This process of natural selection is responsible for shaping the genetic

00:00:44.346 --> 00:00:50.953
information and development of every species as they evolve, including humans.
