00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.580
So, now that we have seen how the

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.190
conditional MOV instructions work, let's do a quiz

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.620
about how to use them. Let's say that the code we have is this. If R1

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.483
is zero, we branch here and increment R3. Otherwise,

00:00:15.483 --> 00:00:20.505
we stay here and increment R2, and then either way, we go to the

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:26.330
end. After if conversion, we will have something like add

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.242
one to R2 and put the result in R4. Add 1 to R3 and put the

00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:34.762
result in R5, followed by what instruction in

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:38.750
order to properly make this equivalent to this code.
