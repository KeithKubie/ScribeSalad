00:00:00.304 --> 00:00:02.887
(lively music)

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.170
- Having a baby is an
exciting and special time,

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.050
but labor can be painful.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.630
And it's important that
you be well-informed

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.430
about your options for pain control.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.310
You have many choices for
pain relief during labor,

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.050
which include unmedicated methods

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.590
such as breathing techniques or massage,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.330
and medicated options such
as IV pain medication,

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.183
breathing in nitrous oxide,
or getting an epidural.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.890
The decision is personal,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.550
and you may choose a
combination of methods.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.290
An epidural involves
putting a local anesthetic

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.000
or numbing medication like what you get

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.440
when you go to the dentist

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.573
into the epidural space in your back.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.810
The epidural will deliver
a continuous infusion

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.060
of medicine that works
directly on the nerves

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.560
in your back and numbs the
lower half of your body

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.820
in contrast to systemic medications,

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.130
which act on your brain and sedate you.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.960
An epidural acts locally at
the nerves that transmit pain

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.330
from the uterus and the vagina.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.430
And since the epidural
medicine works directly

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.230
on the nerves in your back,
very little medicine gets

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.650
to your baby; and you
can safely breastfeed

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.510
after having an epidural.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.420
You can get an epidural at any time

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.100
once you've gone into labor.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.230
Typically it'll take about 30 minutes

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.200
to get the epidural catheter started,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.480
and then an additional 15 minutes or so

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.733
for the medicine to work.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.810
If you have obesity or scoliosis,

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.030
it may take slightly longer.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.160
We're not actually gonna
place the catheter today

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.250
because the patient here
is not quite at that stage,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.120
but so what we would do at this point

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.010
is put a little numbing
medication here in the skin.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.350
One thing that's really
helpful is the positioning

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.600
of the spine here, and what we're trying

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.330
to get is a curve right down at the base.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.480
So, Christina, if you can just, yeah,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.350
curve over the baby like an angry cat,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.393
and then curve, push once against me here.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.873
That's beautiful.

00:02:06.873 --> 00:02:09.730
So the curve, this is the
area that we're trying

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:14.130
to get the curve into to
help separate the bones

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.120
of the spine to make the gap bigger

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.550
for the catheter to go in.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.383
Okay.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.510
And then we use another needle

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.350
to help

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:25.183
get

00:02:25.183 --> 00:02:26.760
this

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.520
thin, floppy

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.330
catheter into place

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.640
to drip medication right next

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.200
to the nerves coming out of the spine.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.530
During this part you
should only feel pressure,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.300
sometimes a needle or a catheter
may brush against the nerve

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.470
and cause a brief electric feeling similar

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.200
to when you bang your funny bone,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.740
but nothing more serious than that.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.770
Once the catheter's in
place, we then secure it

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.793
with some tape,

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.740
up the back,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.580
and over the shoulder

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.600
where we can connect it to the medication.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.880
The soft catheter will
then stay in your back

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.320
until you deliver your baby

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.573
with a constant infusion of medication.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.210
The epidural can also stay in place

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.830
and be used in the event that
you need a Cesarean section.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.120
You can expect to slowly
feel your contractions

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.110
becoming less intense and shorter,

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.870
and your legs may feel weak and heavy

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.220
like they've fallen asleep.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.330
You'll also have your
nurse place a catheter

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.780
into your bladder after
you've had your epidural.

00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:32.649
And many studies have shown

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:35.490
that an epidural does not
significantly slow down labor,

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.180
and if it does, it only
increases the second stage

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.250
of labor by a few minutes.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.270
And there's no evidence

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.870
that epidurals increase the likelihood

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.473
of needing a Cesarean section.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.303
Sometimes the epidural
needs some fine tuning,

00:03:49.337 --> 00:03:52.237
and one in every 10 women will
need the epidural replaced.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.390
Even with the epidural, you should expect

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.280
to feel pelvic pressure, especially

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.040
when the baby's head is low,
and you're about to deliver.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.290
And the ability to feel pressure is good

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.640
'cause it lets you know
when it's time to push.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.120
An epidural might decrease
your blood pressure,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.600
which might cause you to
have nausea and vomiting,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.840
so you'll be given IV fluids
to try and prevent this.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.110
And your anesthesiologist
will watch your blood pressure

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.620
closely after you receive the epidural,

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.303
provide treatments if necessary.

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.960
You could develop a fever,
or itchiness, shivering,

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.860
or experience temporary
soreness at the epidural site,

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.880
which may last for several days.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.490
But general back pain is
not caused by epidurals

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.390
though it's common after any delivery.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.530
Rarely, around one in a
hundred or 1% of women

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.440
will develop a severe headache

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.500
called a post-dural puncture headache,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.993
which can last for several
days if not treated.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.960
Serious complications after an epidural,

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.860
such as the misplacement of the catheter

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.970
into a vein, potentially
causing seizures, is very rare.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.900
A block at a higher level than intended,

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.150
requiring intubation and
breathing assistance,

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.493
again, very rare.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.350
Serious nerve injury: one
in 20,000 to one in 200,000.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.330
Bleeding: one in 40,000
to one in a million.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.940
Infection: one in 20,000
to one in 200,000.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.890
Or other life-threatening complications

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.263
are exceedingly rare.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.530
Staying comfortable is an important part

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.593
of a positive birthing experience.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.310
Your anesthesiologist is a
pain-management specialist

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.000
who works with your
obstetrician to help you safely

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.623
through the birthing process.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.440
Feel free to discuss all
your options for pain control

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.840
during delivery with your
obstetrician and anesthesiologist

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.689
so that you can make an informed decision.

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:45.356
