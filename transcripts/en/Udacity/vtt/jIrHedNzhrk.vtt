00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.880
Let's briefly explore the difference between physical and behavioral traits.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.960
By physical, we mean anything that's defined by our material makeup.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.710
&gt;&gt; And behavioral traits describe how we

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.850
act or interact with the world around us.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.180
&gt;&gt; Check out this footage that we shot

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.879
here at Udacity with some of our colleagues.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.920
this is totally awesome.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.050
&gt;&gt; Can I try it?

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.280
&gt;&gt; You bet.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.780
&gt;&gt;

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.119
yuck is there broccoli in here?

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.689
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.230
&gt;&gt; I think I taste broccoli, broccoli is disgusting.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.400
&gt;&gt; Taking the person who really disliked the broccoli. Can you

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.030
name one physical and behavioral trait that they showed in this scenario?
