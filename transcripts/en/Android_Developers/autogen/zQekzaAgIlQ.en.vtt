00:00:00.107 --> 00:00:02.440
 Ian Lake: Welcome to the development of Android models, where 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.460
 We help you design better applications. 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.570
 I'm Ian Lake. 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.510
 Come on to work. 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.930
 Let's think about how you can navigate the app. 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.440
 You move from Main Viewer to Detailed Viewer, 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.470
 Or moving among fraternal models. 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.570
 Here comes the role of tabs and page viewer ViewPagers 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.900
 What is ViewPager? 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.890
 Is what controls the real movement between content pages 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.416
 ViewPager gets its content from PagerAdapter. 

00:00:34.416 --> 00:00:36.630
 This may be a comprehensive symptom 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.880
 - one per page - or for all parts, 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.970
 If you use FragmentPagerAdapter 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.658
 Or FragmentStatePagerAdapter. 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.920
 FragmentPagerAdapter saves each part 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.130
 It is designed in memory, making it very fast when navigating 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.480
 Between tabs loaded. 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.186
 However, this may become costly, in terms of memory, 

00:00:56.186 --> 00:00:59.330
 If you have a huge number of parts. 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.160
 Which is solved by FragmentStatePagerAdapter 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.910
 By destroying and creating parts as needed, 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.230
 Save only the case. 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.060
 There is not much about PagerAdapter 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.750
 You must override getCount to restore 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.630
 The number of pages you have. 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.730
 Then, in the case of FragmentPagerAdapter 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.830
 You will need to instill the getItem, 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.350
 Which retrieves the part associated with each site. 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.680
 Here we will just authorize a simple replacement 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.810
 Choose the right part for each site. 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.252
 But you have the flexibility to choose which route you like. 

00:01:35.252 --> 00:01:36.960
 The other thing we want to overcome 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.830
 Is getPageTitle, restoring a command that describes each page. 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.970
 Why do you need a page title? 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.810
 Well, those page titles will be very valuable 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.620
 If you want to have tab titles linked with ViewPager. 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.840
 Labels for the tab give users a good way to see 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.810
 What exactly those pages contain without need 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.230
 To move through each one. 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.650
 This allows the user to jump between pages 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.216
 By clicking on the tab. 

00:02:03.216 --> 00:02:07.250
 TabLayout value, is part of the Android design support library, 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.308
 Make it easy to embed tabs, in all material designs. 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.740
 And its previous compatibility even Android 2.1 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.660
 To tie all things together. 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.230
 First, we need to link ViewPager 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.890
 To PagerAdapter using the setAdapter 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.820
 Next, connect TabLayout in one way 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.860
 setupWithViewPager. 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.920
 By doing just that, you get tags from the PagerAdapter addresses. 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.390
 Moving between pages will change tags, 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.480
 Clicking on the tags will change the pages, as I expected. 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.130
 Start with TabLayout and ViewPagers 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.980
 By adding a design library. 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.000
 Be sure to check the design rules 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.340
 And detailed training files. 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.800
 Thanks for joining me here in developing Android models. 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.000
 Use Tabs and ViewPagers to design better applications.
