00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
&lt;h3&gt;Overview of the Khan Academy Library&lt;/h3&gt;

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
There's now a lot of content on the Khan Academy

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.610
so I thought I'd give your a quick overview video of how to think about the playlists

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.500
so the most basic playlist is the arithmetic playlist

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.880
arithmetic

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.080
and this is

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.010
it literally starts at one plus one equals two

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.500
and it moves

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.310
about as far as operations on decimals long division

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.620
things like that

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.330
the next most advanced playlist

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.870
is pre-algebra

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.530
if you're starting from scratch you might want to go in this order

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.940
pre-algebra

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.540
and pre-algebra as the name implies covers
a lot of the foundational concepts for algebra

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.130
like adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing negative numbers and fractions and exponents

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.330
and then we have several playlists that address

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.140
actual algebra so there's

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.750
an algebra playlist

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.870
there is an algebra playlist

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.550
there it is an algebra one playlist

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.400
algebra one playlist

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.920
and then there is a

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.920
there is a California

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.930
California standards

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.140
California standards and there's two playlists

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.540
California standards algebra one

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.340
and California standards algebra two

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.170
this just algebra playlist this is the the I would
call this kind of the main

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.000
playlists covering algebra

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.950
when I just make an arbitrary algebra video I put it in this playlist

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.470
and I try to put it in order of

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.970
of of of of I guess advancement or of difficulty

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.930
this starts at the most basic algebraic equations

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.930
but with one caveat that

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.340
the the first few videos in this playlist are old
videos these are some of the very first videos

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.470
that I did when I started making  YouTube videos

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.330
and so they're not in HD, they're kind of
rough I'm using Microsoft  paint

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.730
they're they're not the the smoothest
videos on the planet

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.760
but then obviously it also has a lot of new videos in this

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.930
and this algebra playlist covers both algebra one and algebra two

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.400
and I merged it into one playlist because frankly algebra two

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.310
has a lot of overlap or a lot of review with algebra one

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.930
this algebra one playerlist

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.120
this is worked examples from ck12.org's

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.120
ck12.org's open source algebra one book which

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.220
is a fairly comprehensive for covering the
California standards and for those of you

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.430
who aren't in California what I say is

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.220
this is fairly comprehensive for algebra one and if you know algebra one by these standards

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.180
you're probably going to know the great majority
of what you need to know

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.810
wherever you might be taking algebra

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.620
and frankly if you watch both of these playlists

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.940
I'm pretty sure you're going to be able to
do any type of algebra problem that you might

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.750
see in any curriculum

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.810
math is math

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.740
now this is worked examples that you can and
it's all done recently so all of these videos

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.000
are of of fairly good quality

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.150
and they're all in high definition

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.650
and you could just watch this algebra one
playlist in order

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.190
and i'll just give you a little bit of warning
the first sixteen videos

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.840
sixteen videos

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.220
the very first ones are kind of an overview
so they move a little bit faster so if you

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.620
have a little bit

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.120
if his you're seeing algebra for the first time

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.340
and they seem like they're moving a little quickly

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.030
that's just because they're giving a survey of
the course

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.340
and that's why..

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.210
and I did that just because that's the order that they were displayed in the book

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.240
but after those first sixteen video

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.030
starting with one step equation

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.840
it actually goes at a very moderate pace

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.840
and I do a lot of examples

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.930
and explain the concepts as I do the examples

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.620
so if you're just starting out want to learn
algebra

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.530
what I'd recommend reviewing pre algebra, never hurts

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.220
then these are the two core algebra playlists

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.470
and you could start at either one

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.840
and find where you

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.160
where you feel comfortable

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.460
I would recommend

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.340
if you're some place in between you know a little
bit of algebra, start at the beginning

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.150
watch every video and both of these playlists
and if there's something just

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.440
super duper easy to you then you move on to
the next video

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.840
but just make sure that you have all of your bases covered

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.620
now, these these videos right these playlists right
here the California standards

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.470
these are just worked examples

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.560
based on the California standards

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.550
so after watching these you want to see more examples

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.340
it'll never hurt to watch these two playlists right there

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.120
now once you're done with algebra

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.000
you might want to look at the geometry playlist

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.530
you could probably start on the geometry playlist just with

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.930
pre-algebra but it's good to have that algebraic foundation there

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.930
and in most school systems

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.350
you take algebra one first

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.550
then geometry

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.470
then algebra two

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.670
so this is just a recommended path you might want to
take

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.600
and then after geometry

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.500
you're ready to move into trigonometry

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.120
trigonometry

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.540
and after algebra you are also ready to move

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.930
'cos this playlist as I said it

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.940
goes through algebra two

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.310
after this you're also ready for pre-calculus

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.800
you're also ready for pre-calculus

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.370
and I'll write it at the same level as trigonometry because
in most

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.120
in most

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.470
school systems you take trigonometry and pre-calculus

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.550
in the same year

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.060
usually your junior or your senior year

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.560
and then obviously after  pre-calculus

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.120
and trigonometry

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.370
the next

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.930
you now are ready for calculus

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.930
and this is a fairly extensive playlist

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:07.870
it covers

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.350
calculus one, two and three

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.740
so differential integral and multi-variable and vector calculus

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.350
so in some places even you could almost say

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.160
even through calculus four

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.730
now we have another

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.560
another playlist that has the word algebra in it

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.160
but it is a much more advanced algebra

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.750
even though it might sound like a simpler algebra

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.870
it's called linear algebra

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.360
linear algebra

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.740
and if you've never seen algebra before
do not watch this playlist it might sound

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.970
like "hey linear algebra is easier than non-linear algebra"

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.750
No, this is a mathematically rigorous course

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.940
that normally math and engineering majors take

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.370
in their, probably their sophomore year of college

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.750
and I would say that

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.940
you could start off if you have just a basic
understanding of pre-calculus you could probably

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.970
you could probably start the linear algebra
playlist

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.750
but I would recommend being fairly sophisticated mathematically

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.120
you probably want a little bit of your calculus out of the way, to start it

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.750
even though it is really algebra

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.720
it is mathematically more sophisticated than a lot of what goes on

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.550
in the calculus playlist

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.930
and in the calculus playlist once you're about halfway
through

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:12.180
you don't have to go through the whole playlist

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.730
you're then ready for another advanced playlist that we have

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.120
and that's differential equations

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.740
differential equations

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.930
probably two-thirds of the way

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.250
through the calculus playlist you're probably

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.750
then ready for differential equations

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.160
another usually sophomore level course

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.870
for math and science and engineering majors

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.310
now everything else we have some

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.470
we have some probability and statistics

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.350
algebra is all you really need for that,

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.670
but I'll put it here because it's reasonably advanced

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.930
probability

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.370
there's a probability playlist

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.370
probability

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.740
and then there is a statistics playlist

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.540
they're obviously related

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.350
you might want to do the probability one first

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.180
but you don't have to

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.940
there's probability and there is a statistics

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.560
statistics playlist

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.750
we also have

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.250
a California standards geometry playlist

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.540
and that's worked examples just like that
one over there

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.930
so i'll do that like that we also have

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.550
California

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.370
standards

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.560
California standards geometry

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.980
so you can

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.350
you can look at that if you want to see more geometric

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.180
worked examples

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.680
and then when you think about the sciences

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.750
we have physics

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.980
and the physics this is mainly I call them

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.730
applied algebra problems

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:32.750
so you might want to watch

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.940
physics right around after you finish algebra

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.540
there's only a few videos that require calculus

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.750
I'll eventually make an entire playlist

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.750
on calculus based physics

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.940
most of this it's just algebra based physics

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.750
so you're ready to go if you have a good solid understanding of algebra

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.940
and then the other sciences and the chemistry

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:57.560
uh it'd be nice to have algebra out of the way, pre algebra is probably enough for most of it

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.120
pre algebra is probably enough for most of it but
algebra

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.980
if you have your algebra out of the way

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.120
then you're going to have no trouble at all with

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.980
the chemistry playlist

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:06.930
chemistry

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:08.740
and then biology does deal with a little bit of

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.120
of probability

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.540
and things like that so it wouldn't hurt

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.310
but that's actually that doesn't even require

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.750
too much mathematics or at least the mathematics

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.160
that I've diagrammed here.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.870
we could put biology here

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.370
I guess the big take away is that

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:22.680
algebra's really important for

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.750
pretty much anything you want to do.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.560
there's some genetics problems that require

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.930
some basic level and

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.930
and some population genetics of population

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:32.620
genetics problems that have some biology in it and then

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.120
all the finance and economics that also

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.960
I think it assumes

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.340
a base level of algebraic understandings

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.500
so the things on banking

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.960
things on banking you don't have to have the
super advanced if you just go maybe

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.590
a halfway through one of these playlists you are
probably ready for these

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.360
banking economics

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.750
economics

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.970
and finance

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.480
so hopefully that gives you a good overview of everything
that's

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.970
on the Khan Academy

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.703
and let me know if you have any questions
