00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.190
- [Announcer] Climate change
is forcing us to rethink

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.880
our cities, making it
clear that the challenges

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.530
of upgrading urban areas
and addressing the threat

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.803
of global warming go hand-in-hand.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.690
- Applying green construction techniques

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.170
at the urban block scale is one solution.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.450
That's what we're prototyping
here at the Ecoblock

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.840
in Oakland, California.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.740
We put together a remarkable team

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.930
of partners to tackle the problem.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.564
- This first prototype
will retrofit 30 homes

00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:29.640
in a lower to middle income neighborhood.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.300
By sharing infrastructure
and sharing resources,

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.170
we can drive greater energy
and water efficiencies.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.980
- Retrofitting existing neighborhoods

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.700
with the latest tools and technologies

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.550
is essential to greening our cities.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.050
The Ecoblock offers a
systematic design platform

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.700
that can be adapted to
any city in the world.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.600
- [Announcer] Behind the Ecoblock concept

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.030
are well-established retrofit strategies

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.920
to reduce energy use,
greenhouse gas emissions,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.340
and water consumption.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.030
Costs will be offset by long-term savings,

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.860
while retrofitting will increase comfort

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.123
and offer security against
the effects of climate change.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.210
Installing solar panels on roofs

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.830
will turn the block into
an urban solar farm.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.720
The energy will be stored communally

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.590
and distributed to homes and electrical

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.813
vehicles via DC microgrid,
managed by smart controls.

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:21.940
EV charging stations will be
installed around the block,

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.730
enabling the community to share
EVs, e-bikes and e-scooters.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.030
The energy efficiency gains will reduce

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.690
electricity consumption by over 80 percent

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.130
and lower carbon emissions close to zero,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.220
a valuable feat given that residential

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.510
buildings and private fossil fuel cars

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.630
emit over 50 percent of
U.S. greenhouse gasses.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.660
Rainwater will be collected,
purified, and used

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.580
for washing machines and
new low-flush toilets.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.400
Efficient showerheads and
taps will be installed,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.710
and gray water will be used for gardens,

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.150
decreasing water usage
by at least 50 percent.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.520
Eventually, black water from toilets

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.490
will be recycled for irrigation,

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.600
further maximizing water efficiency.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.890
New permeable sidewalks and pavement

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.800
will solve storm water problems

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.470
and recharge the ground water.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.960
- The key to the success of this project

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.890
is engaging the community residents.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.860
The city of Oakland is
proud to partner with them

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.140
in this experiment in
urban sustainability.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.450
- The Ecoblock is a new model for creating

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.360
resilient and sustainable
cities in California

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.500
Ecoblocks can provide local investment

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.190
in green jobs and green infrastructure,

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.610
revitalize our urban communities,

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.770
and help low to middle income
families improve their lives.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.920
- The Ecoblock confirms California's

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.570
commitment to concrete, scalable solutions

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.730
to climate change.

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.170
Our goal is to build a
model that can be replicated

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.910
and scaled across California,

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.650
across the United States,
and around the world.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.460
- [Announcer] Keen interest from Europe,

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.550
Africa, and Asia confirms the
promise of greening cities

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.067
by means of community scale
Ecoblock retrofitting.
