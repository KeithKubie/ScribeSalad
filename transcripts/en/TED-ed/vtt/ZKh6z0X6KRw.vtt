00:00:08.173 --> 00:00:10.778
Your research team has found
a prehistoric virus

00:00:10.778 --> 00:00:12.689
preserved in the permafrost

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:15.170
and isolated it for study.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.859
After a late night working,

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.489
you're just closing up the lab
when a sudden earthquake hits

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.449
and knocks out the power.

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.449
As the emergency generators kick in,
an alarm confirms your worst fears:

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.734
all the sample vials have broken.

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:32.953
The virus is contained for now,

00:00:32.953 --> 00:00:34.546
but unless you can destroy it,

00:00:34.546 --> 00:00:40.072
the vents will soon open
and unleash a deadly airborne plague.

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:42.640
Without hesitation, you grab
your HazMat suit

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.250
and get ready to save the world.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.041
The lab is a four by four compound
of 16 rooms

00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:54.991
with an entrance on the northwest corner
and an exit at the southeast.

00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:58.412
Each room is connected to the adjacent
ones by an airlock,

00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:03.030
and the virus has been released
in every room except the entrance.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.040
To destroy it, you must enter each
contaminated room

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.480
and pull its emergency 
self-destruct switch.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.540
But there's a catch.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.822
Because the security system 
is on lockdown,

00:01:13.822 --> 00:01:16.111
once you enter the contaminated room,

00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:19.580
you can't exit without 
activating the switch,

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.070
and once you've done so,

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.401
you won't be able to go 
back in to that room.

00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:29.150
You start to draw out possible
routes on a pad of paper,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.324
but nothing seems to get you
to the exit

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:34.410
without missing at least one room.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.341
So how can you destroy the virus
in every contaminated room

00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:40.732
and survive to tell the story?

00:01:40.732 --> 00:01:45.592
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself.

00:01:45.592 --> 00:01:47.036
Answer in: 3

00:01:47.036 --> 00:01:48.890
Answer in: 2

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.843
Answer in: 1

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:54.800
If your first instinct is to try to graph
your possible moves on a grid,

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.960
you've got the right idea.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.310
This puzzle is related to 
the Hamiltonian path problem

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.491
named after the 19th century Irish 
mathematician William Rowan Hamilton.

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.050
The challenge 
of the path problem

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.811
is to find whether a given graph
has a Hamiltonian path.

00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:16.081
That's a route that visits 
every point within it exactly once.

00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:19.541
This type of problem, classified 
as NP-complete,

00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:24.171
is notoriously difficult when the graph
is sufficiently large.

00:02:24.171 --> 00:02:27.752
Although any proposed solution
can be easily verified,

00:02:27.752 --> 00:02:31.461
we have no reliable formula or shortcut
for finding one,

00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:33.542
or determining that one exists.

00:02:33.542 --> 00:02:36.091
And we're not even sure
if it's possible for computers

00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:40.351
to reliably find 
such solutions, either.

00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:43.541
This puzzle adds a twist
to the Hamiltonian path problem

00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:47.602
in that you have to start 
and end at specific points.

00:02:47.602 --> 00:02:50.202
But before you waste a ton of graph paper,

00:02:50.202 --> 00:02:52.672
you should know that a true
Hamiltonian path

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:55.371
isn't possible with these end points.

00:02:55.371 --> 00:03:01.183
That's because the rooms form a grid
with an even number of rooms on each side.

00:03:01.183 --> 00:03:03.442
In any grid with that configuration,

00:03:03.442 --> 00:03:10.222
a Hamiltonian path that starts and 
ends in opposite corners is impossible.

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:12.831
Here's one way of understanding why.

00:03:12.831 --> 00:03:17.562
Consider a checkerboard grid with
an even number of squares on each side.

00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:21.012
Every path through it will alternate
black and white.

00:03:21.012 --> 00:03:25.702
These grids will all also have an even
total number of squares

00:03:25.702 --> 00:03:29.653
because an even number times
and even number is even.

00:03:29.653 --> 00:03:34.243
So a Hamiltonian path on an
even-sided grid that starts on black

00:03:34.243 --> 00:03:36.483
will have to end on white.

00:03:36.483 --> 00:03:40.294
And one that starts on white
will have to end on black.

00:03:40.294 --> 00:03:43.152
However, in any grid with even
numbered sides,

00:03:43.152 --> 00:03:46.112
opposite corners are the same color,

00:03:46.112 --> 00:03:52.753
so it's impossible to start and end
a Hamiltonian path on opposite corners.

00:03:52.753 --> 00:03:54.734
It seems like you're out of luck,

00:03:54.734 --> 00:04:00.644
unless you look at the rules carefully
and notice an important exception.

00:04:00.644 --> 00:04:04.504
It's true that once you activate
the switch in a contaminated room,

00:04:04.504 --> 00:04:07.283
it's destroyed and you can never go back.

00:04:07.283 --> 00:04:11.473
But there's one room 
that wasn't contaminated - the entrance.

00:04:11.473 --> 00:04:14.994
This means that you can leave it once
without pulling the switch

00:04:14.994 --> 00:04:19.978
and return there when you've
destroyed either of these two rooms.

00:04:19.978 --> 00:04:22.034
The corner room may have
been contaminated

00:04:22.034 --> 00:04:24.983
from the airlock opening,
but that's okay

00:04:24.983 --> 00:04:28.618
because you can destroy the entrance
after your second visit.

00:04:28.618 --> 00:04:32.588
That return trip gives you four options
for a successful route,

00:04:32.588 --> 00:04:37.154
and a similar set of options if you
destroyed this room first.

00:04:37.154 --> 00:04:42.755
Congratulations. You've prevented
an epidemic of apocalyptic proportions,

00:04:42.755 --> 00:04:46.169
but after such a stressful episode,
you need a break.

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.587
Maybe you should take up that recent
job offer to become a traveling salesman.
