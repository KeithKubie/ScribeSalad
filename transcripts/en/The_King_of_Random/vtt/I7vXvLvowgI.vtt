00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.110
Welcome back guys, and thank you for joining us here today on the king of random. A little while ago,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.110
I saw a video of something that seemed impossible

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.609
Lighting a fire using water. It's an experiment that I want to try and replicate here today

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.039
And find a recipe that will work every time. I did a little bit of research and found that this chemical mixture is something

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.489
that's called Negative X. Although I couldn't find anything that explained

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.460
why it was called that.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.099
So if you have a source that tells me where the name came from please let me know down in the comments

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.630
I found a recipe for this mixture

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.840
That uses only three ingredients before you add the water ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride, and zinc powder. So first

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.899
I'll talk a little bit about what each of these ingredients are and where you can get them

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.009
And then we'll see if we can make fire from water. Ammonium nitrate is a nitrate salt

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.629
That's frequently used as a type of fertilizer and when it mixes with water it produces an endothermic reaction

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.329
Endothermic means that it gets really cold and that actually has to do with where we can get ammonium nitrate you can buy these

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.589
Instant cold packs that are full of a bag of water and ammonium nitrate beads

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.899
There are a few different types of these cold packs

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.259
So make sure you check on the box to see that it says that it contains ammonium nitrate

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.660
I got these ones at Target in the ammonium nitrate

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.500
And it works really well for this experiment. The next ingredient is ammonium chloride which is an inorganic compound fairly similar to table salt

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.249
It's often sold in blocks like this with a primary use of cleaning the tips of soldering irons. In a few countries like the Netherlands,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.639
You can also find it in a powdered form on the outside of black licorice

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.199
Candy. The box this came in has a warning on it that says to make sure you don't ingest any of it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.860
But because it is used as a food in some places. I'm gonna lick it and see what it's like

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.580
All right, so this stuff is weird it feels like licking salt and a 9-volt battery at the same time

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.699
I don't know exactly what the chemical reaction happening is but it really like buzzes and fizzes on your tongue a little bit

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.960
It's very strange

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.779
I've never had a food product do that before and in case any of you were worried I did look up the safety specs for

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.680
This stuff and I would have to eat a fair amount of this block before I really had to be worried about my health

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.610
The last ingredient we need today is zinc and zinc is a fairly common metal

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.790
But we need it in a very pure form and unless you have just the right equipment

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.690
We need to buy it to get it in this very fine powder. Now we know our three ingredients

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.679
Let's try mixing them together to see if we can start a fire using water. To start

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.350
We'll measure off six grams of the ammonium nitrate next we'll scrape off one gram of our ammonium chloride from the block

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.910
Before we add our zinc we want to grind our first two ingredients together into a fine powder

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.510
In a separate container or on a piece of paper measure out 14 grams of the zinc powder

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.699
Now we haven't mixed the two together yet because as soon as they are combined you have something that's incendiary

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.259
Meaning it can catch fire very easily, and we don't want to do that while we're indoors

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.848
Apparently you're not even supposed to mix this stuff up if it's raining outside or particularly

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.090
humid because it can catch fire just from that so we're gonna take our ingredients outside carefully mix them together and then see if we

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.900
Can light them on fire just using water

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.099
We're going to mix the ingredients

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:06.699
Using what's called the diaper method. Pour all of your powdered ingredients onto a piece of paper and then lift the corners to gently mix

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.700
them together

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.839
These larger lighter colored bits of the ammonium nitrate that probably weren't ground-up quite enough

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.549
We'll see if it will still work even though

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.909
I didn't grind it into quite as fine as a powder as I should have. All right

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.989
I've got our negative X mixture sitting on this piece of foil to protect the ground underneath it

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.159
I'm gonna spray with a little bit of water and then back off because when this burns it releases

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.009
Zinc fumes which are not good for you

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.580
Here goes nothing

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.840
There we go now it's starting I don't know why it took that long

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.160
Wow look at that flame that is such a cool bright green blue color

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.109
Okay look off to the side, you can actually see it's spitting little bits of burning zinc

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.809
That was faster

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.140
Well

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:59.199
Okay, so I had a bunch of the negative x mixed up getting ready to burn it in separate little piles

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.770
But remember my warning about how you're not supposed to mix it up on a humid day

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.378
Today is a little bit humid

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:10.629
There's clouds in the sky and apparently that was enough to set it off. The bowl that it was in was

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.759
Completely dry, no water got sprayed on it whatsoever and hit ignited it

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:22.718
Just burst into flames, and it actually completely destroyed the my mixing bowl as well. You can probably see right here

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:28.599
There's just shards of glass the extreme heat from that just demolished it so gonna have to get a new one of those

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.269
But that worked really well

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.009
So this is what is left over from this mixture if you've seen it on the other pieces of foil as well

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:37.180
This is zinc oxide

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.400
And then of course, little bits of shattered glass

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.539
Everywhere because that's why you don't mix it up until right before you're ready to use it

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:48.218
So I am extremely glad that it took a small precaution while it was just sitting in that bowl

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:53.528
It was originally sitting right next to my phone on the ground and I didn't think it was gonna light on fire

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:57.039
But I thought just in case because in theory this stuff can just sort of spontaneously

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:02.709
combust, I moved it out of the way and kind of behind this pole, so there would be a layer of protection and

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:07.539
Then it lit on fire, and I'm happy to report that my phone was not damaged

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:12.009
I managed to pull it out of the way even though it was about a foot away. It does sort of send little

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.060
sparks of molten zinc through the air. Alright guys

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.719
I've mixed up another batch, and I'm about to start gently mixing it in this plastic bag

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:24.309
And I'm gonna pour it out onto the foil, but it has actually started to rain a little bit

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.240
Maybe I didn't choose the best day to do this

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.919
Experiment so what I think is gonna happen is I'm gonna start pouring this powder out

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:35.348
And it's just gonna start lighting on fire after a couple seconds because there's even water on the foil already

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:37.538
So let's just watch what happens

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.010
Alright, I've poured it out. So far It doesn't look like anything is lit on fire

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.080
It's not raining very heavily

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.429
So it might be that there isn't enough for it to start quickly if it doesn't start in the next few seconds

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.430
I'm just gonna grab the spray bottle and get it going

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.750
Unbelievable, I'm giving it some help

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.779
Doesn't light as well if it's not in a pile new plan. I'm just gonna pile it up instead of leaving it in a snake

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.990
Try not to breathe. Just cooling it down a little bit

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.350
Okay guys, I'm gonna call that a success despite a few hiccups here

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.980
and there

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:42.499
we got the negative X to light on fire using just water. At first it took a little bit longer than I expected so I

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.860
Mixed up a new batch being sure to grind it into a much finer powder

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.629
While we were doing our second test, the bowl with the rest of our batch bursts into flames

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.170
I don't know if it was too humid outside, or if a stray raindrop hit it

00:07:54.170 --> 00:08:00.469
Or if the natural chemical process that takes place in this reaction just started on its own which can happen. To understand

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:06.350
What was going on let's talk a little bit about the chemistry behind this reaction. When the water interacts with the ammonium chloride

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:12.439
It lets the chloride act as a catalyst on the ammonium nitrate. The ammonium nitrate breaks up into nitrous oxide and water

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:20.510
The water continues to react with more ammonium nitrate spreading the reaction. At the same time the nitrous oxide begins reacting with the zinc

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:24.050
Forming zinc oxide and that puts off a zinc oxide and nitrogen gas

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:30.469
So then the whole thing puts out a whole lot of heat, lights on fire, and what you're left with is zinc oxide,

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.030
Nitrogen gas, and water in the form of steam. You can see the residue left over

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:39.229
This is mostly zinc oxide. Of course the nitrogen gas and the water in the form of steam

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.650
dissipated into the air.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:45.229
A word again about the safety of this stuff as I think you've seen it can be pretty dangerous

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:50.569
It takes just a little bit of water and only a couple seconds to light on fire or in the case of what I had

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.100
In the mixing bowl it takes

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.650
I don't even know maybe just humidity in the air

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.709
And there was enough of it in one spot that it just ignited

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:01.400
And it broke my mixing bowl because it was so hot so fast

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.560
So be very careful with this stuff

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.310
You cannot store it even if you have a clean dry jar

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.449
Eventually the ammonium chloride will start to react with the ammonium nitrate

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:14.689
So never make this until you're ready to use it. Also,

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:19.190
Be aware that the zinc fumes are toxic so you want to be upwind from your mixture

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.359
Thank you so much for joining me in this video. I look forward to the next one talk to you then

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.660
Also, you should lick this stuff. It's wierd

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:39.979
Look at that that's your zinc oxide right there, this turns to dust there's also a little bit of wind

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.850
Here goes nothing

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.770
Oh come on

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:52.579
You right there. The one who just watched this video to the end

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.389
You are the reason that we work so hard to make these videos. It's for people like you

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:01.189
Thank you very kindly for being as supportive as you. You keep watching the videos? We'll keep making more
