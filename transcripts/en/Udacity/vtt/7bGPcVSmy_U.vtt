00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay--let's take a step back for a second and talk about

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the major pieces of the web--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
or the major concepts we're going to be discussing in this lesson.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The major pieces are you, your computer running a web browser,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the internet, and servers.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Your browser makes requests via the internet to servers.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
These requests are using a protocol called HTTP,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and the servers respond with files that your browser displays.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Some examples of browsers are Internet Explorer,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Chrome, Firefox.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You're probably running one of those right now.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The servers are computers just like yours,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
except they are optimized for sitting in a closet and hosting files,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
rather than sitting on your desk--you know--

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
browsing these files.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And the protocol HTTP that we're speaking

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
is just a very simple protocol that your browser uses

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
to communicate with these servers.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We'll discuss each of these pieces--

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
well, we won't spend a whole lot of time of the internet, but--

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we'll discuss each of these pieces in turn throughout this lesson.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Okay, time for another quiz.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
What I'd like you to do is take the letters

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that are near each piece of technology we just discussed

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and match them up with their name and definition.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Your options are: HTTP--the main protocol of the web,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
servers--computers that host the files that make up the web,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
the internet--the world's largest computer network,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and your browser--a program that runs on your computer

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to display files found on the web.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Take the letters next to each piece of technology,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.855
and put them in the correct box.
