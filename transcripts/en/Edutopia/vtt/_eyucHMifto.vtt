00:00:09.696 --> 00:00:12.696
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Creating the school
to serve nearly 500 three-

00:00:12.696 --> 00:00:17.046
to five-year-olds might seem
like the recipe for disaster.

00:00:17.846 --> 00:00:19.096
Some days are chaotic here.

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:24.536
Like when the Auburn
University Pep Squad shows up.

00:00:24.536 --> 00:00:26.836
Or when a tornado touches
down nearby.

00:00:27.286 --> 00:00:28.126
&gt;&gt;Principal: Boys and girls,

00:00:28.216 --> 00:00:31.976
please move into your weather
locations at this time.

00:00:32.096 --> 00:00:34.966
We will come around
and check on everyone.

00:00:35.496 --> 00:00:37.146
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But on a typical
day, the students and staff

00:00:37.146 --> 00:00:41.226
at Alabama's Auburn Early
Education Center are busily engaged

00:00:41.226 --> 00:00:45.386
in learning adventures, like sailing
a cardboard cruise ship to Africa.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.766
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, Jordan
and Dylan are going

00:00:48.086 --> 00:00:49.726
to pass your life vests out to you.

00:00:50.286 --> 00:00:53.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Or flying a
plastic plane to Brazil.

00:00:54.046 --> 00:00:54.946
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You go ahead and
give Ara your boarding pass.

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:58.826
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For them the lifelong
learning exploration can't begin

00:00:58.826 --> 00:00:58.976
too soon.

00:00:59.316 --> 00:00:59.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Bon voyage!

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:03.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Just about
everything that goes

00:01:03.946 --> 00:01:08.636
on here involves long-term projects
that students undertake as a class.

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:10.396
&gt;&gt;Sandy: Do you know where
that is, what it's called?

00:01:10.396 --> 00:01:12.336
&gt;&gt;Student: South America, Brazil.

00:01:12.436 --> 00:01:14.546
&gt;&gt;Sandy: It is Brazil
and this is the place

00:01:14.546 --> 00:01:16.146
that you are you are studying about.

00:01:16.626 --> 00:01:18.756
&gt;&gt;Student: That is a big place!

00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:20.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The theme
for each project evolves

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:23.306
out of the natural
curiosity of the kids.

00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.236
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Here is some
information about the camel,

00:01:25.236 --> 00:01:26.716
and it says, "The animal..."

00:01:26.716 --> 00:01:30.066
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Once the students decide
on a theme, teachers guide them

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:32.306
to resources and books
and on the Internet,

00:01:32.656 --> 00:01:34.566
to help focus their efforts.

00:01:34.726 --> 00:01:36.346
&gt;&gt;Lilli: Let's say that
the theme is Brazil.

00:01:36.606 --> 00:01:39.826
And they begin to study
Brazil by going the Internet,

00:01:39.826 --> 00:01:41.006
they look up information.

00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:43.176
Then they decide if
we want to go there.

00:01:43.176 --> 00:01:46.636
And the teachers pose to them,
"Well, how can we get there?"

00:01:46.746 --> 00:01:49.886
&gt;&gt;Student: And if they didn't have
the map, they couldn't get there.

00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:50.876
&gt;&gt;Sandy: They couldn't get there!

00:01:50.876 --> 00:01:53.456
&gt;&gt;Lilli: Then they may decide,
"Well, we're going by plane,

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:56.856
we need to construct some
type of model of plane.

00:01:57.146 --> 00:02:00.446
And the teachers get the Internet
resources, the book resources.

00:02:00.446 --> 00:02:01.666
They take them on the field trip.

00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:03.806
&gt;&gt;Sandy: Where did you get
the information to know that?

00:02:03.976 --> 00:02:09.336
&gt;&gt;Sandy: Well, we went to the Auburn
Airport to see all the instruments.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:13.226
There was instruments inside
planes to make it work.

00:02:13.386 --> 00:02:18.216
&gt;&gt;Student: These make us how fast
we're going, how slow and these...

00:02:18.216 --> 00:02:20.716
&gt;&gt;Lilli: The kids are very
highly motivated to be involved,

00:02:20.716 --> 00:02:22.306
because they're doing
it for a reason.

00:02:22.306 --> 00:02:25.656
It's not just an arbitrary
"cutesy" activity

00:02:25.656 --> 00:02:27.946
that has no real meaning
or value for them.

00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:31.706
So that's why teaching using thematic
curriculum keeps the kids very

00:02:31.706 --> 00:02:33.076
engaged in the activities.

00:02:33.076 --> 00:02:35.746
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You have to have your
passport to get on the plane.

00:02:35.836 --> 00:02:39.896
&gt;&gt;Student: This is your Captain
speaking, we're flying to Brazil,

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:43.886
and we don't expect
a lot of turbulence.

00:02:44.656 --> 00:02:46.896
&gt;&gt;Lilli: All of it involves
developing the plan,

00:02:47.106 --> 00:02:52.176
carrying it through, writing about
it, and cooperation, problem solving,

00:02:52.176 --> 00:02:56.946
critical thinking, are all pieces
to getting that project complete.

00:02:57.326 --> 00:03:00.766
&gt;&gt;Stayce: Remind everybody
what we decided

00:03:00.766 --> 00:03:01.996
that we needed at our funeral.

00:03:02.256 --> 00:03:05.006
&gt;&gt;Narrator: With a bit of
skillful coaching, everyday events,

00:03:05.286 --> 00:03:08.406
like the death of the class
pet praying mantis can trigger

00:03:08.406 --> 00:03:09.756
engaging projects.

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:14.356
&gt;&gt;Stacye: Can you share with
them what you decided needed

00:03:14.356 --> 00:03:16.336
to go on the tombstone?

00:03:16.336 --> 00:03:16.666
&gt;&gt;Student: Bugs' name.

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:17.196
&gt;&gt;Stacye: Bugs' name.

00:03:17.346 --> 00:03:18.766
&gt;&gt;Narrator: After her
students decided

00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:22.046
to give the deceased a
funeral, teacher, Stacy Jones,

00:03:22.046 --> 00:03:25.826
found a way to fold all of their
required curriculum into the project.

00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:30.026
Among other things, they
practiced writing and drawing

00:03:30.026 --> 00:03:33.116
by designing invitations
for the ceremony.

00:03:33.116 --> 00:03:34.286
&gt;&gt;Stacye: I got in science.

00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:35.456
I got in social studies.

00:03:35.526 --> 00:03:37.256
I got in math, I got in writing.

00:03:37.496 --> 00:03:44.556
I got in everything all through
an authentic purpose for learning.

00:03:44.676 --> 00:03:45.886
They were interested.

00:03:46.286 --> 00:03:50.886
And once you have been interested,
they can't get enough information.

00:03:51.166 --> 00:03:55.466
They love school, because they're
interested, because it's authentic.

00:03:55.826 --> 00:03:59.786
&gt;&gt;Student: I went to the dentist for
them to take pictures of my teeth.

00:03:59.786 --> 00:04:00.546
And I got...

00:04:00.546 --> 00:04:04.006
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Since most kindergartners
favorite subject is themselves,

00:04:04.346 --> 00:04:07.296
personal stories are at the center
of the literacy curriculum here.

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:12.386
&gt;&gt;Student: I forgot
that I had a virus.

00:04:12.526 --> 00:04:17.986
And when I went home,
I threw up on myself.

00:04:17.986 --> 00:04:19.976
Are there any questions?

00:04:20.056 --> 00:04:22.936
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Each day, three students
get a chance to tell their story,

00:04:23.026 --> 00:04:25.206
and answer questions about it.

00:04:25.206 --> 00:04:28.416
&gt;&gt;Stayce: At the beginning of the
year, every story is one sentence.

00:04:28.776 --> 00:04:29.896
"I went to the beach."

00:04:30.456 --> 00:04:31.596
"I went shopping."

00:04:31.846 --> 00:04:32.696
"I went to the mall."

00:04:33.236 --> 00:04:37.946
And as the children are asking
these questions, they realize,

00:04:38.206 --> 00:04:41.806
"I need to be sure
to say these details,

00:04:41.806 --> 00:04:43.786
because it's a pretty
important part."

00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:48.596
&gt;&gt;Student: I fell, and then
I hit my head on my table.

00:04:48.596 --> 00:04:53.506
It was a round table,
and it was a coffee one.

00:04:54.456 --> 00:04:55.306
&gt;&gt;Stayce: Journal is great.

00:04:55.496 --> 00:04:59.056
Academically, they're writing,
they're reading every day.

00:04:59.596 --> 00:05:01.786
But more importantly,
they're going to be talking

00:05:01.786 --> 00:05:04.116
to people the rest of their life.

00:05:04.116 --> 00:05:08.386
So that's my big push for it
is learning how to socialize

00:05:08.386 --> 00:05:09.976
and communicate with other people.

00:05:11.026 --> 00:05:12.996
&gt;&gt;Stayce: All right, which
story are you going to vote on?

00:05:12.996 --> 00:05:14.556
Are you going to vote on the teeth?

00:05:14.736 --> 00:05:15.736
Are you going to vote on the sick?

00:05:15.736 --> 00:05:18.716
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The students consider
each story and vote on which one

00:05:18.716 --> 00:05:21.516
to write about and
illustrate that day.

00:05:21.706 --> 00:05:23.886
&gt;&gt;Stayce: Hey, guys, I'm
looking for those periods

00:05:23.886 --> 00:05:25.586
that go at the end of sentences.

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:29.616
&gt;&gt;Stayce: Now I hear
another sound in "hi-s."

00:05:30.016 --> 00:05:30.646
"Hi-s."

00:05:31.236 --> 00:05:31.646
&gt;&gt;Student: "C?"

00:05:32.456 --> 00:05:34.726
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Early student
writing rarely conforms

00:05:34.726 --> 00:05:36.296
to conventional spelling rules.

00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:41.076
But principal Lilli Land sees value
in allowing creative alternatives.

00:05:41.496 --> 00:05:44.056
&gt;&gt;Lilli: A five-year-old
child should not be expected

00:05:44.306 --> 00:05:46.826
to spell every word
conventionally correct.

00:05:46.886 --> 00:05:50.456
Many 35-year-olds may not spell
every word conventionally correct,

00:05:50.456 --> 00:05:52.426
but use "spell check" when
they're on the computer.

00:05:53.106 --> 00:05:56.896
But with a young child, you want
to turn them onto the writing.

00:05:57.196 --> 00:05:59.486
"Man, I can write this!

00:05:59.486 --> 00:06:03.226
You know, I can be an author!"

00:06:03.226 --> 00:06:05.226
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm having a good time.

00:06:05.226 --> 00:06:08.816
&gt;&gt;Lilli: So you get those juices
going, you get the kids interested.

00:06:08.956 --> 00:06:11.706
They write, and then the way

00:06:11.706 --> 00:06:15.046
that they write gives the
teacher very useful information

00:06:15.206 --> 00:06:18.646
about where they are in their
development in the stages of reading.

00:06:18.646 --> 00:06:20.936
&gt;&gt;Coach: I would probably
say you're exactly right.

00:06:20.936 --> 00:06:24.136
Most of the time we're going to see
that "s," it's going to be an "s."

00:06:24.136 --> 00:06:24.366
&gt;&gt;Stayce: Right.

00:06:24.366 --> 00:06:25.746
&gt;&gt;Coach: And we're still
looking at September

00:06:25.746 --> 00:06:27.266
so let's look at where he is now.

00:06:27.526 --> 00:06:27.776
&gt;&gt;Stayce: All right.

00:06:27.776 --> 00:06:31.096
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In addition to
a dedicated reading coach,

00:06:31.096 --> 00:06:34.426
the Center has installed "Smart
Boards" in every classroom

00:06:34.426 --> 00:06:35.926
to enhance their literacy effort.

00:06:36.366 --> 00:06:36.926
&gt;&gt;Sandy: What's that letter?

00:06:37.236 --> 00:06:37.686
&gt;&gt;Student: "b."

00:06:37.906 --> 00:06:38.366
&gt;&gt;Sandy: "b."

00:06:38.536 --> 00:06:38.956
All right.

00:06:38.956 --> 00:06:40.156
Here's what I want you to do.

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:42.996
I want you to pull this
"b" on top of that "d."

00:06:44.156 --> 00:06:45.446
Pull it down.

00:06:46.506 --> 00:06:47.586
Now, are they the same?

00:06:47.586 --> 00:06:47.976
No.

00:06:48.386 --> 00:06:50.076
&gt;&gt;Sandy: Before you
could show it to them.

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:53.686
But the fact that they can bring it
over and put it on top of each other,

00:06:53.686 --> 00:06:58.546
and because they can manipulate it,
makes it so much easier for them

00:06:58.546 --> 00:07:01.586
to learn, and it's so
much fun for them to do.

00:07:01.586 --> 00:07:03.096
And they're actually in charge of it.

00:07:03.096 --> 00:07:04.246
they have the power.

00:07:04.616 --> 00:07:07.306
And therefore, it's more
pertinent to them, I think.

00:07:07.646 --> 00:07:08.146
&gt;&gt;Sandy: What's that letter?

00:07:08.846 --> 00:07:09.266
"n"

00:07:09.596 --> 00:07:10.126
&gt;&gt;Sandy: What's that letter?

00:07:11.066 --> 00:07:11.426
"e"

00:07:11.426 --> 00:07:11.976
&gt;&gt;Sandy: What's that letter?

00:07:12.986 --> 00:07:13.406
"n"

00:07:14.456 --> 00:07:15.446
&gt;&gt;Sandy: Look how smart you are.

00:07:15.636 --> 00:07:17.156
You're so smart, I
can't even take it!

00:07:17.156 --> 00:07:18.186
All right, what comes after...

00:07:18.186 --> 00:07:20.066
&gt;&gt;Interviewer: How do you like
going on the big white boards,

00:07:20.066 --> 00:07:22.776
and going on the Internet?

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:24.166
&gt;&gt;Jared: You can just learn!

00:07:25.306 --> 00:07:30.266
&gt;&gt;Lilli: Technology has really
just taken us to another level.

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:34.896
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It says, "All the
plants or plant life of a place."

00:07:35.026 --> 00:07:37.886
&gt;&gt;Lilli: When kids have questions
about things that they are learning,

00:07:37.886 --> 00:07:40.916
then it's just with a click of
the mouse, and they're there.

00:07:41.236 --> 00:07:43.326
And not only can they
just get information,

00:07:43.326 --> 00:07:44.966
but they can see all
kinds of pictures.

00:07:45.116 --> 00:07:46.876
They can see video clips.

00:07:46.906 --> 00:07:50.106
So it just opens the door
to their world of learning.

00:07:50.106 --> 00:07:50.526
&gt;&gt;Sandy: Look!

00:07:50.526 --> 00:07:51.676
It's not anaconda.

00:07:51.676 --> 00:07:52.746
It's an otter!

00:07:52.836 --> 00:07:57.076
Why do you think the
otter's coming up there?

00:07:57.076 --> 00:08:00.366
&gt;&gt;Student: Because he eats anacondas!

00:08:00.366 --> 00:08:01.366
&gt;&gt;Sandy: He's probably saying, "Look!

00:08:01.366 --> 00:08:02.126
I have dinner.

00:08:02.126 --> 00:08:04.756
I'm going to eat me some
anacondas," isn't he?

00:08:04.756 --> 00:08:06.926
&gt;&gt;Sandy: These kids have a very
authentic, real purpose for learning.

00:08:06.926 --> 00:08:08.766
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Now, Jordan's
going to stamp your passport.

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:12.416
&gt;&gt;Lilli: We're trying to teach
them to be lifelong learners.

00:08:12.416 --> 00:08:13.876
What are resources?

00:08:13.956 --> 00:08:16.166
When you want to find
something out, what do you do?

00:08:16.166 --> 00:08:20.066
You don't go to an adult, and
just have them feed you all the

00:08:20.116 --> 00:08:20.786
information you know.

00:08:20.786 --> 00:08:23.136
You have to learn to
be a problem solver.

00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:24.366
And you have to be resourceful.

00:08:24.886 --> 00:08:28.476
And we have to keep them excited
about the process of learning.

00:08:29.286 --> 00:08:31.696
&gt;&gt;Student: Don't go yet!

00:08:31.966 --> 00:08:36.686
Because there's lots of airplanes
and birds covering the sky.

00:08:36.906 --> 00:08:37.036
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay.

00:08:37.236 --> 00:08:37.976
I'm hanging up.

00:08:40.526 --> 00:08:42.486
