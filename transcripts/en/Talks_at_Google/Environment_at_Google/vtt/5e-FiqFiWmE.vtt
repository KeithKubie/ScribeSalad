00:00:05.284 --> 00:00:07.200
SPEAKER: Gives me great
pleasure to introduce,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.660
Dr. Michael Webster, an expert
in the field of coral reef

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.241
science and
conservation management.

00:00:13.241 --> 00:00:13.740
Thank you.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.626
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:21.630
MICHAEL WEBSTER: Well,
good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.870
I'm just going to jump
straight in to my talk

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.430
today, and begin with really
posing a big question that we

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.490
worry a lot about when we're
working on coral reefs.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.970
And it's this question, which
is, how can we save them?

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.180
And the question here is
framed in a particular way,

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.940
because there really is a
question of, how can we do it?

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.610
And if we don't try,
we actually have

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.361
some pretty severe concerns
we're not going to succeed.

00:00:46.361 --> 00:00:48.110
And so as somebody who
works on coral reef

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.290
conservation on a daily basis
and thinks about these systems,

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.970
we're really trying
to figure out,

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.910
what are reasonable answers
to this big question?

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.910
And I don't know,
has anyone here heard

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.557
about coral reefs in
the news recently?

00:01:00.557 --> 00:01:01.640
Can I see a show of hands?

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.450
Heard anything about--
so pretty much everybody.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.561
Probably had to do with
something like this.

00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:09.560
So in the videos I just
showed you a moment ago,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.180
the corals had color to them.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.270
They were browns, and
greens, and oranges.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.010
These corals in this
photo are stark white.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.580
And this is a process
called coral bleaching

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.634
that's been in the news a
lot in the last few years.

00:01:22.634 --> 00:01:24.050
And what it is,
is it's a response

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.810
of corals to really
extreme stress.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.492
The stress usually is that the
water is too warm for too long,

00:01:30.492 --> 00:01:32.450
and they go through a
process called bleaching.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.700
We'll talk a little bit
more about this later on.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.230
But what's happening is
that people are really

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.604
starting to notice
that something

00:01:37.604 --> 00:01:39.680
is wrong on coral reefs.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.200
And it's wrong on coral
reefs all over the world

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.110
in many different places under
many different conditions.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.610
And it's really
adding up to what

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.820
we see as an existential
threat for coral reefs.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.860
Are coral reefs going
to continue to exist

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.960
in 100 years, or 1,000 years?

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.820
Or are we doing things
today that's really

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.470
going to prevent that?

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.840
As a coral reef
conservation organization,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.930
we want to figure out, OK,
given that all these changes are

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.880
happening, what
can we do about it?

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.199
So what I'll argue
in my talk today

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.690
is that there's
really two key pieces

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.340
we're going to
have to figure out,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.137
in order to save coral reefs.

00:02:15.137 --> 00:02:16.970
To save coral reefs,
we've got to figure out

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.490
mitigation and adaptation.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.590
Mitigation here is
mitigation on climate change.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.440
This means figuring
out the problem

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.020
we're creating on the planet
by putting so many greenhouse

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.390
gases into the atmosphere
and changing our climate.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.010
If we're going to
save coral reefs,

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.630
if we're going to
save any ecosystem--

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.060
if we're going to
save peace on earth--

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.219
we're going to have to figure
out how to solve this problem.

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:42.010
And the good news is,
there's more and more

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.385
action around the
world of people

00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:44.740
trying to solve this problem.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.080
We've got-- I think-- all
but one country in the world

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.840
has now signed onto
the Paris Accords.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.570
That kind of leadership
would have been unprecedented

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.010
a decade or two ago.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.510
We also have
communities, we have

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.120
businesses like this
business, as well as

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.190
other municipalities and
individuals beginning

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.990
to take action on climate.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.580
This is really good
news, because this

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.160
is one of our chief problems
as a species going on

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.150
into the future.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.020
We're going to have to
solve this eventually

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.540
to get things right
for coral reefs,

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.180
as well as to get
things right for so many

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.180
other ecosystems and
things that we care about.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.630
But in the meantime, we're
already locked into change.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.400
We've already put
enough greenhouse gases

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.240
into the atmosphere.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.250
We've already done enough
changes to the planet

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.666
that we've got to deal with
those changes that are already

00:03:26.666 --> 00:03:27.450
underway.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.080
And for ecosystems
like coral reefs,

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.910
those changes that
are already underway

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.280
are causing really big problems.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.690
And we can't just stop them.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.270
Even if we stopped all of our
greenhouse gas emissions today,

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.620
we'd still be locked
into that change.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.760
So one of the key questions
that we have for coral reefs is,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.370
how do we manage that
process of change?

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.800
How are the coral
reefs going to adapt

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.190
to a changing environment?

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.660
And what can we use from the
science of biology or evolution

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.660
that can help inform how
we do conservation work,

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.370
in order to promote
that adaptation?

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.870
That's going to be
the focus of what

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.119
I'm going to talk about today.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.530
Before I go too
far down that road,

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.410
I wanted to introduce
the primary character

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.670
we're talking about.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.680
We're talking about coral reefs.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.277
And coral reefs are defined
by the presence of corals.

00:04:16.277 --> 00:04:18.360
This photo shows actually
a whole bunch of corals.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.029
You can see one in the center
that's roughly vase-shaped.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.060
Pretty much every single surface
on the bottom in this photo

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.760
is covered by some
form of coral.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.657
A lot of people have no
idea what a coral is.

00:04:28.657 --> 00:04:30.990
If you haven't been on a reef,
if you haven't spent time

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.156
around them, you may not
have any direct experience.

00:04:33.156 --> 00:04:34.950
But even if you have,
what is this thing?

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:35.670
Is it a plant?

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:36.510
Is it an animal?

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.980
Is it something else?

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.820
Most people really don't have
that close of an intimacy

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.612
with this organism.

00:04:42.612 --> 00:04:45.111
And I actually want to spend a
few minutes talking about it,

00:04:45.111 --> 00:04:47.490
because I think corals are
one of the coolest organisms

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.610
on the planet.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.443
And I think there's
some things that they do

00:04:50.443 --> 00:04:51.900
that are downright miraculous.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.370
And by understanding
that-- one--

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.828
it's just interesting to know
about the corals, but-- two--

00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:57.630
it helps us think
through what we can do

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.074
to help protect and save them.

00:05:00.074 --> 00:05:01.740
So first of all, let's
take a little bit

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.930
of a closer look at some coral.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.870
So this is a close-up
of a colony of coral.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.540
When you see a coral head like
that one in the last photo,

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.380
it's comprised of thousands of
individual little animals that,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.170
together, constitute a colony.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.180
That colony consists
of these things which

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.560
you see in the image here.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.900
These are called coral polyps.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.360
They're the circular-shaped
structures here.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.160
Looks a little bit
like a sea anemone.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.110
So this organism is an animal.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.140
And it's an animal that
lives in this colonial form.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:36.480
So one animal will settle onto a
reef at some point in its life.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.889
And as it grows, it'll
bud off a new individual.

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:40.930
And then, those two will
bud off new individuals,

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:41.763
and new individuals.

00:05:41.763 --> 00:05:43.980
And they build this
sort of spreading colony

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.825
of clones across the reef.

00:05:46.825 --> 00:05:48.450
And so when you look
at a coral colony,

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.940
it might be thousands of
these individual animals.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.680
But collectively, they're
working together as a colony.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.829
Now, in order to
survive, these animals

00:05:57.829 --> 00:06:00.120
have figured out a couple of
really interesting things.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.970
You can see in this
short video here,

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.890
that there are small
creatures moving around

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.182
in the water column.

00:06:06.182 --> 00:06:08.640
These are little shrimp-like
animals swimming in the water.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.292
And the coral will be
delighted to eat these.

00:06:11.292 --> 00:06:12.750
They've got these
amazing tentacles

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.510
with stinging cells that can
paralyze one of these animals

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.010
if it happens to
run into the coral.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.110
And then, they can quickly
swallow it and eat it.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.110
They're actually formidable
predators on the reef.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.390
But most of their
energy on a daily basis

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.730
doesn't actually come from
being a predator, most of it

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.770
actually comes from small plants
that live inside its tissues.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.672
The corals are
basically farmers.

00:06:34.672 --> 00:06:36.130
And what they
figured out how to do

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.130
is how to grow little
tiny, tiny plants

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.030
inside their tissues that
provide the coral with food.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.130
In return, the coral
provides those little plants

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.380
with its waste products.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.870
And inside the coral, they're
able to recycle that energy.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.910
And both have a nice place
to live, and both can grow.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.580
So let's take a look
at a cross-section

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.240
of one of those polyps.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.660
What you can see here
in the circle blow

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.940
up is some of the
tissues of the coral that

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.430
show it's labeled
as zooxanthellae

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.560
Those are those little
tiny plant-like organisms

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.000
that live inside the coral.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.370
They're actually what
give the coral its color.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.870
Corals are naturally
usually clear.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.440
But they have these algae that
grow in their tissues that

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.700
provide them with the food.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.860
And the color you see
when you see a coral

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.780
is usually those
little organisms

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.910
that are providing the food.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.270
Now, coral reefs grow
in places that tend

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.470
to be very low in nutrients.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.810
They're basically ocean deserts.

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.820
They're in the tropics,
the water is clear,

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.010
and there's very little
nutrient in the water.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.230
Coral reefs have had to be
really, really efficient

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.440
to be able to grow there.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.523
And one of the things that
corals have figured out

00:07:39.523 --> 00:07:42.410
how to do is by internally
recycling those nutrients,

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:44.250
they can be very efficient.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.950
They can also figure out how
to grab space and occupy space

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.801
to compete with other corals.

00:07:50.801 --> 00:07:52.550
And the main way that
a coral will do this

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.160
is by building a
rocky skeleton that it

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.680
uses to overgrow other
corals and take over

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.719
space on the reef.

00:07:58.719 --> 00:08:01.010
You can think about like in
a forest, as trees grow up,

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.690
they grow over other
ones and shade them.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:04.440
The trees are looking
to get to the canopy

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.711
to get up to the light.

00:08:05.711 --> 00:08:07.460
Corals are doing the
same thing on a reef,

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.800
but they do so in a
pretty remarkable way.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.810
They'll take ions
of calcium and ions

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:13.760
of carbon out of
the water column,

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:16.880
and they'll use it to synthesize
what is effectively rock--

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.710
calcium carbonate.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.090
And if you look at the bottom
of this coral polyp, then

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.350
the cross-section, it's
all white under there.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.300
That white is rock that's made
biologically by the coral.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.370
That rock gives it a
solid place to live.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.800
It also gives it the ability
to overgrow other corals

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.070
in that ecosystem.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.309
So in a place where there's
almost no nutrients,

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:36.320
in a place that's
effectively a desert,

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.840
corals have figured out
how to grow pretty quickly

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.580
and to base their
growth on building

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.339
these rocky structures.

00:08:42.339 --> 00:08:43.880
So that when you go
to a coral reef--

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.546
if you ever have a
chance to visit one--

00:08:45.546 --> 00:08:47.370
and you look at the
structures around you,

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:49.329
you'll see structures
like this with huge coral

00:08:49.329 --> 00:08:51.453
heads, all these fingers
growing up to the surface.

00:08:51.453 --> 00:08:53.600
And all these plates growing
off in the background.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.600
All of these structures are
being built by that process.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.210
They're being built by that
interaction between the coral

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.820
and those little tiny
plants inside its tissues,

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.400
in order to build these
massive rocky structures.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.290
This is what makes a
coral reef a coral reef.

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:09.860
This is what makes the habitat
for all the animals and all

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.651
the other organisms
that live on the reef--

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:13.190
the fish, the
turtles, the sharks.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:15.200
Everything are
there because corals

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.840
are building all of this
structure, which creates

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.649
a home for everything else.

00:09:20.649 --> 00:09:23.190
Now, most people tend to think
of corals as very slow growing

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.689
animals.

00:09:23.689 --> 00:09:25.440
And if you were to
sit and watch a coral,

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.290
yeah, you wouldn't see much
growth over a period of time.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.620
But with millions of corals
building rocky structures

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.360
over hundreds, and
thousands, and even

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.220
millions of years,
what they can produce

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.840
is actually quite astonishing.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.150
So you don't just get big
coral heads like this,

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.640
corals also build
entire islands.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.830
This is an atoll, which is
a special kind of island

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:45.520
found in the tropics.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.190
It is special
because that island

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.800
is built entirely out of coral.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.320
And the corals are making
those rocky skeletons

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.570
which pile on top of each
other, on top of each other,

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:55.990
and on top of each other.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.620
And in doing so,
they can keep a reef

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.440
right up to the surface
of the water that can

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.000
exist for millions of years.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.580
And in doing so, the wind, and
the waves, and the currents

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.606
will pile up some of
that broken rubble

00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:09.730
from the coral over time,
and they'll make beaches.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:11.700
And they'll make entire
things like this island

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.849
here, a coral-built island.

00:10:13.849 --> 00:10:16.140
If you pan back further and
look at what corals can do,

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.931
they can build entire
structures like this.

00:10:17.931 --> 00:10:20.170
This is just a section of
the Great Barrier Reef.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:22.440
You can see the greenish
colors offshore.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.270
Every single one
of those reefs is

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.660
made by corals and just a
few other organisms that

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.342
can do this trick of
making rock out of water.

00:10:30.342 --> 00:10:31.800
The Great Barrier
Reef is something

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.700
like 1,400 miles long.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.450
It can be seen from
space by the naked eye.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.670
This is the largest biological
structure on the planet.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.760
And it only exists
because of these miracles

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.430
where coral has figured
out how to work together

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.495
with these little tiny
plants in their tissues

00:10:46.495 --> 00:10:48.870
to build rocky structures in
a place that would otherwise

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:49.430
be a desert.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:57.480
So in my opinion, corals
really are the key to the reef.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.580
They build it, they
maintain it, they

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.130
provide the place for
everywhere else to live.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.470
The problem we're
facing around the world

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.050
is that the corals
themselves are in decline.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:09.210
And we have to ask
ourselves, what

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.340
happens if the corals disappear?

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:12.720
And more importantly,
what can we

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.910
do to make sure that
doesn't come to pass?

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.040
There's a lot riding
on getting this right.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.750
There are all the
different kinds of life

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:21.220
that rely on the coral reef--

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:22.750
millions of different
forms of life.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.490
It's probably the most
diverse place on the planet.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:26.920
There's also
hundreds of millions

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.642
of people who rely on the
coral reef on a daily basis--

00:11:29.642 --> 00:11:31.850
whether they are people who
live in a place like this

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.240
and like to go and see
a reef and experience

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.890
the wildlife there,
or the people who

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.590
live in that place who are
building their economy based

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.210
on that kind of tourism.

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.790
Whether it's people who rely
on a coral reef for fisheries

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:45.580
and the fish that it attracts
and that can live on the reef,

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.250
or islands that exist
only because of the coral

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:50.560
and the reef itself
which protects coastlines

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.037
from things like big storms.

00:11:52.037 --> 00:11:53.620
And then, the last
thing that's really

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.060
super important
about coral reefs

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.150
is it looks like a good
fraction of our medicine

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:59.980
chest of the future
is going to be

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.780
based on coral reef organisms.

00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:03.550
There is huge research
going on right now

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.650
to find new drugs
on coral reefs.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:06.970
They're finding cancer drugs.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:08.260
They're finding antivirals.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.494
They're finding painkillers.

00:12:09.494 --> 00:12:11.410
They're even finding new
classes of sunscreens

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.392
that are coming
from the millions

00:12:13.392 --> 00:12:15.850
of different kinds of organisms
that are found on the reef.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.650
We all have a stake
in this future.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.630
And many, many
people on the world

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.360
have a very direct stake for
their economic livelihood,

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:23.700
and for their food security.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:29.390
And it really doesn't take
very much for coral reefs

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.250
to deliver all of this.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:35.780
All they need is some
clear water that's warm

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:39.110
and that's shallow, and
they're going to flourish.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.450
Every place in the world
in the tropics where

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.000
there's shallow
water that's clear,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.670
we get coral reef formations.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.850
In addition to
that, corals really

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.750
like it when there is some
grazing going on in the reef.

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.460
There's a lot of fish
and other organisms

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.980
that do a really good job
of keeping the reef clean.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.560
In order for the corals
to grow and flourish,

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.140
they have to compete with some
other organisms for space.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.840
In particular, they're competing
with things like seaweeds that

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.310
would otherwise
overgrow the coral,

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.100
so they can grow a lot faster.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:14.130
Fish like this parrotfish scrape
the bottom and keep it clean,

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:16.860
making a much better
environment for corals.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.320
So it's not a very
complex recipe--

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.650
clear, warm, clean, shallow
water with some grazing.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.400
The problem is that wherever
you find people near reefs,

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.250
there are a series
of repeated things

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.740
that people tend to do that
cause problems for the reef.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:40.330
This is a photo on a beach
in Maui after a rainstorm.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.040
And what you can
see in this photo

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.770
is there's this plume of
sort of orangey brown water

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:47.980
that's coming off the land
and flowing into a coral reef

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.090
environment.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:50.940
That water is
bringing sediments,

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:54.310
it's bringing nutrients, it's
bringing toxins, all of which

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:55.620
are very bad for the corals.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.620
It smothers the coral.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.449
The nutrients bring in--

00:13:58.449 --> 00:14:00.490
they cause proliferation
of things like seaweeds.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:03.220
And you can see in this photo,
there's green on the beach.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.803
That's something you might see
in California, which has highly

00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:06.910
productive coastal oceans.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.310
In a coral tropical
reef system that's

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.290
supposed to be something
of an ocean desert,

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.139
this is a sign that
something is wrong.

00:14:13.139 --> 00:14:15.430
The seaweeds are getting out
of control in this system,

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.440
this is bad news for the corals.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.770
This kind of pollution-- whether
it's wastewater, development,

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:24.394
or mining, or any other form of
pollution in coastal waters--

00:14:24.394 --> 00:14:26.560
is something that gets
repeated time and time again,

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.810
when people have
communities that

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.400
are based near coral reefs.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.130
On top of it, people
have a taste for fish.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:37.440
And coral reefs can
support fisheries.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.030
They can also be
easily overfished.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.670
And overfishing
becomes a real problem

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.200
when people begin to take
those grazing fishes out

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.044
of the system.

00:14:44.044 --> 00:14:45.960
Basically, what happens
is that cleanup crew--

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.160
that grazing group of fish
that keep the bottom clean--

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.860
when it's no longer there,
things like seaweeds

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.832
can grow more quickly
and more effectively.

00:14:55.832 --> 00:14:56.790
And they can overshade.

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.515
And they can begin to
take over the reef.

00:14:58.515 --> 00:15:00.390
If you're polluting the
reef at the same time

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.015
and dumping a bunch
of nutrients in it,

00:15:02.015 --> 00:15:04.980
the effect is like putting
Miracle-Gro on the seaweeds.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.090
The seaweeds can grow.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.130
They can take over.

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.755
And if there's nothing
to eat, then you

00:15:08.755 --> 00:15:11.520
get this transition from a
coral reef to a seaweed reef.

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:15.040
And when that happens, it
starts to become game over

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:15.900
for the reef.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.180
Remember, the corals are
building all the structure.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:20.013
They're making everything
for everybody else

00:15:20.013 --> 00:15:21.330
to live on the reef.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.970
Once that process
stops, the reef

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:27.780
begins to simplify and
flatten, lose the diversity,

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.378
and lose those values.

00:15:30.378 --> 00:15:31.370
[COUGH]

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:32.900
Excuse me.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.960
So those two things are
playing out at a local scale.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.870
At the same time, we've got
another set of changes playing

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.320
out at the global scale.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.460
This is a temperature record,
average global temperature

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.980
for the last century or so.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.270
Everybody knows this story.

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.610
The black line here is
average temperatures.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.970
Blue bars pointing down are
years when the temperature

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:54.230
was below average.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.450
Red bars pointing up are
years when the temperature

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:57.602
was above average.

00:15:57.602 --> 00:15:59.060
You don't have to
be a statistician

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.740
to see what the pattern is here.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:03.110
The world's getting warmer,
and warmer, and warmer.

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.360
And this takes us up to 2016.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.150
The most recent
projections for 2017

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:09.650
are that it's going to be either
the warmest year on record,

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.120
or at least in the top three.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.270
The pattern is
continuing going forward.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:20.057
When the water gets too warm,
it is bad for the corals.

00:16:20.057 --> 00:16:22.640
I told you a minute ago that one
of the things that the corals

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.500
want is warm water.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.300
They do want warm
water, but it turns out

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.830
they're a little bit fussy.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.010
They want the temperature to be
between here and here, and not

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:33.050
above it and not below it.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.600
And the reason for that is
that living in the tropics,

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.610
the weather is actually
very predictable.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:40.310
From one year to the next,
from one season to the next,

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.420
it's a very predictable
environment.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.130
And corals over
evolutionary time,

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:45.530
have figured out
how to fine tune

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.530
their relationship with
those little tiny plants

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.180
that live inside their
tissues, so that they

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.070
have it working just perfectly.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.400
They have it optimized to get
the maximum amount out of food.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.730
And everybody is super happy
with that relationship.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:02.846
But that relationship is partly
dependent on the temperature.

00:17:02.846 --> 00:17:04.220
And when the
temperature changes,

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.260
the relationship
between the corals

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.319
and those little tiny
plants begins to break down.

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:11.300
And what happens
inside the coral animal

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.883
is that those little
tiny plants start

00:17:12.883 --> 00:17:15.980
to produce toxins that make
it poisonous inside the body

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.480
of the coral animal.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.000
In a last ditch effort to
survive, what the coral will do

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.339
is it'll actually expel
all those little plants.

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.220
It'll basically
throw away its crops

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.730
in order to survive from the
toxins that would otherwise

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.226
kill it inside its body.

00:17:30.226 --> 00:17:31.850
Now, remember, those
little tiny plants

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.730
are what give the
coral its color.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:36.680
And what you can see here is
that on the photo on the left,

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.570
the colors are a
pretty orange color.

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:40.880
In the central photo,
they've turned white.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.989
That whitening is
called coral bleaching.

00:17:42.989 --> 00:17:45.530
And it's what happens when the
relationship between the algae

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:46.880
and the coral break down.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.130
Now, you think about it,
from the coral's perspective,

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:52.310
most of its food is coming from
this algae inside its body.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:54.350
Once it expels it,
not only is it already

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.940
stressed from the
high temperature

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:59.554
and what's happening inside its
body, now it begins to starve.

00:17:59.554 --> 00:18:01.970
In many cases, what happens
is that those corals will then

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:02.400
die.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.220
And if you see on the
picture on the right,

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.590
these corals have died
from this bleaching event.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.660
And now, they're fuzzy
and sort of ugly colors.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.640
The seaweeds are
beginning to take over.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.590
This has shifted from
a healthy coral reef

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:15.810
to something that's dead in
a very short period of time.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:17.846
This is directly
tied to temperature,

00:18:17.846 --> 00:18:19.220
and we're seeing
this more common

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.424
because the Earth
is getting warmer.

00:18:22.424 --> 00:18:24.590
These things, as they're
playing out on coral reefs,

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.624
are causing major,
major changes.

00:18:27.624 --> 00:18:29.540
You can think about these
changes and say, OK.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.130
Well, maybe this place
or maybe that place.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.504
But if you begin
to actually look

00:18:32.504 --> 00:18:34.680
at what happens to
a reef over time,

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.610
it's not a minor
shift from what reefs

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:39.260
used to be to what
they're becoming

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.180
in places around the world.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.060
This photo was taken
in 1978 by researchers

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:46.340
who were working in
Discovery Bay, Jamaica.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.817
Now in the 1970s, people
weren't really worried

00:18:48.817 --> 00:18:50.150
about the future of coral reefs.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:51.631
Coral reefs were
doing just fine.

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.880
But they were interested in
trying to understand them.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.340
And so what these
researchers wanted to do

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.256
is they wanted to say,
hey, how does this reef

00:18:57.256 --> 00:18:58.940
change over time?

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.045
How do the species change?

00:19:00.045 --> 00:19:00.920
How does this change?

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.370
How does that change?

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.190
And one of the common techniques
that researchers will use

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.070
is they will go and they will
measure the same patch over

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.875
and over again to see
what changes in it.

00:19:08.875 --> 00:19:10.250
And so what they
did in this case

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.230
is they built a
quadrat for counting

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.060
what was inside this patch.

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.937
And they put this little
stainless steel pin

00:19:15.937 --> 00:19:16.520
into the reef.

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.660
Can you see it in
the foreground there

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:19.160
at the corner of the quadrat?

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.876
They drilled a hole
into a living coral.

00:19:20.876 --> 00:19:23.000
They took a stainless steel
pin, and they tapped it

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.580
into that coral so they could
come back year after year,

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.712
and they could put that quadrat
in exactly the same place.

00:19:28.712 --> 00:19:30.170
Now, that's really
useful to us now

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.660
because we can say, OK, what
does that reef look like today?

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.909
If we can go and find that
little stainless steel pin,

00:19:34.909 --> 00:19:37.081
we can see how this
reef has changed.

00:19:37.081 --> 00:19:37.580
Here we go.

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.660
Do you see the pin?

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:50.064
This is the same place
30 or so years later.

00:19:50.064 --> 00:19:51.980
So here it is where it's
got all of its coral.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.376
This was a very typical reef.

00:19:54.376 --> 00:19:55.750
This reef got hit
by a hurricane.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:56.710
It got hit by disease.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:58.510
It got hit by coral bleaching.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.175
And what happened
is that in 30 years,

00:20:00.175 --> 00:20:01.675
it went from this
thriving ecosystem

00:20:01.675 --> 00:20:03.220
that was providing
all these benefits

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.950
to the community and all these
benefits to the wildlife,

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:08.260
to this.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:11.230
Not only is it ugly, it
doesn't provide the structure.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.450
It doesn't have places for
all those animals to live.

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:15.010
It doesn't block the waves.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:16.720
It doesn't bring in tourists.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.919
This is a huge catastrophe
for the community

00:20:18.919 --> 00:20:19.960
that relies on this reef.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.640
It's also a catastrophe
for the wildlife

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.680
that used to rely on that reef.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.770
And this is the story we're
seeing repeated over, and over,

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:28.570
and over, and over
again around the world.

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:31.150
This is why we are so concerned
about the future of coral

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:34.710
reefs, because this is
no longer a coral reef.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.881
It's an ecosystem,
it's got some life

00:20:36.881 --> 00:20:38.130
in it and different organisms.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:42.210
But it does not have what
the coral reef once had.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:45.820
So I might have depressed
you a little bit with that.

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:49.610
The basic narrative around
coral reefs is that one.

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.360
And a lot of people
are pretty freaked out

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.500
about this ecosystem.

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.170
And some people are
feeling some dismay.

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:57.780
I want to shift gears now,
though, and talk about why

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:58.884
we should be optimistic.

00:20:58.884 --> 00:21:00.300
Because I think
there are actually

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.049
some really good reasons
to be optimistic,

00:21:02.049 --> 00:21:04.290
especially if we can use
the information that we

00:21:04.290 --> 00:21:08.844
have to make smart decisions
about how we save coral reefs.

00:21:08.844 --> 00:21:11.010
And so I'm coming back to
my simple equation before,

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.490
mitigation plus adaptation
equals saving coral reefs.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:15.762
I actually want to dive into
the adaptation part now.

00:21:15.762 --> 00:21:17.220
I want to take a
look at what is it

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.910
going to take for adaptation?

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:20.910
I'm going to argue that
it's got four parts.

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:23.850
It's going to take making sure
that we do enough work to save

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:26.370
coral reefs at the
community scale

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:28.680
in a way that protects
the diversity of reefs,

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.810
protects their connectivity,
and is doing it

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:32.280
at an appropriate scale.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.320
So I'm going to go through each
of those pieces one at a time.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.790
And then, I want
to put it together

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.347
in a way that sort of
describes how we're

00:21:38.347 --> 00:21:40.680
thinking about how we're going
to save coral reefs going

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.410
forward.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.660
So the first piece
is communities.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.120
My organization's
mission statement

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.490
is uniting communities
to save coral reefs.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.800
Our specialty is
working with communities

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.590
that rely on the coral reef
for fisheries benefits,

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:55.570
for tourism benefits,
for other benefits, who

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.850
are trying to figure out
ways that they can structure

00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:59.950
their economic
activities, in order

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:01.900
to get those benefits
from the reef

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:05.390
without causing the reef
to decline over time.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.960
The good news is that
communities all over the world

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:08.877
want this.

00:22:08.877 --> 00:22:10.210
They want this kind of solution.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:12.670
They're looking for ways that
they can protect their reefs.

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:14.570
And they're looking
for those solutions.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:16.570
So what we've found is that
there's actually many more

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:18.950
communities that we're able to
work with who are asking us,

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:19.870
hey, can you help us do this?

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:21.700
Can you help us find
this fishery solution?

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.740
Can you help us find
this pollution solution?

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.635
There is an extraordinary number
of people who want to do this.

00:22:26.635 --> 00:22:29.230
This particular
community is in Fiji.

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.570
In Fiji, this community
actually owns their reef.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:33.110
There's a different
property right

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:35.326
history in Fiji, where
the community owns it.

00:22:35.326 --> 00:22:36.700
This community
has chosen to take

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.300
a huge fraction of their
reef and protect it,

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.310
because that's what
brings in the tourists.

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.480
And it also protects their
interests for the future.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.104
They're able to
benefit from fisheries.

00:22:46.104 --> 00:22:48.790
They're able to benefit
from tourism economy

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:49.870
by protecting their reef.

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:51.610
They found this kind
of solution that's

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.500
durable and stable
over time that

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.060
provides them with the
benefits and protects the reef.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.060
This kind of system is
replicable in community,

00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.435
after community,
after community,

00:22:59.435 --> 00:23:01.372
provided those incentive
systems are there--

00:23:01.372 --> 00:23:02.830
provided the interest
in fisheries,

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:07.480
the interest in economic
development around tourism.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.355
That's the raw material
we have to work with,

00:23:09.355 --> 00:23:11.830
with many communities
around the world.

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.530
When we do this kind of
project with the community,

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.431
that community can change
the health of their reef.

00:23:17.431 --> 00:23:19.180
They can make it a
better reef for corals.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.837
They can make it
better for fish.

00:23:20.837 --> 00:23:22.420
They can address
those local problems,

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.910
and in doing so, have more
coral that's healthier,

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.785
that's doing better in
that particular patch.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.660
The next piece is we need to
be working with the diversity

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:34.939
that we've got on coral reefs.

00:23:34.939 --> 00:23:36.480
It turns out, that
coral reefs-- as I

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.855
mentioned before-- are one of
the most diverse ecosystems

00:23:38.855 --> 00:23:39.810
on the planet.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.640
That diversity is
really important

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.920
when you think about going
through a process of change.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.440
If you think about
corals on a reef,

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.060
you can think about
an average coral.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.220
And an average coral is
the coral that's bleaching.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.360
The average coral
is the coral that's

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.950
having trouble as
the environment is

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.326
changing very quickly.

00:23:54.326 --> 00:23:55.950
But the more we look
at reefs, the more

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:58.080
we realize that the
story of coral reefs

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.820
is not about the average coral.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.860
It's about all the diversity
of different corals

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:03.000
that are on the reef.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.985
Some corals are already really
good at living in hot water.

00:24:05.985 --> 00:24:07.860
Some corals are already
really good at living

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.680
in polluted water or
really strong wave forces,

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.180
because they live
on reefs that have

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.400
had those conditions
for hundreds,

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.320
or thousands, or even
millions of years.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.200
The corals in this picture
live in a very strange reef

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.200
in coastal Honduras that sits
at the mouth of a river that's

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.890
got extremely polluted water.

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:26.700
This is one of the clearest
days ever on this reef.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.860
It's entirely covered
with live coral

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.080
in a way that has most
coral biologists scratching

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.406
their head, saying, what in
the world is going on here?

00:24:33.406 --> 00:24:35.280
How can these corals
live in this environment

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.696
where we would
expect them to have

00:24:36.696 --> 00:24:40.160
already died and been gone?

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.240
The true answer is,
we don't know yet.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.670
But what we do know
is the more we look,

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:47.730
the more of these
unusual corals we find,

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:50.510
the more we find corals
thriving in these really extreme

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.470
environments.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:53.660
And what that tells us
is that there are already

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.580
tons of corals
out there that are

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.080
able to live in the
conditions we're

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.420
creating on reefs now and
the conditions that are

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.170
coming for reefs in the future.

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:02.810
So these particular
corals may be

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:05.930
some of the best corals
for future reefs.

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.350
The next piece of the
puzzle is connectivity.

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:13.690
That's all great for
those particular corals

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.690
in that particular place, but
if they're stuck on that reef,

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:18.300
it doesn't help any other reefs.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.300
So when you think
about that reef

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:20.830
that I showed you
in Jamaica that's

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.560
been so damaged by the threats
that have played out there,

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.780
how does that risk get
repopulated with new corals?

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.762
How does it come back and
become a coral reef again?

00:25:28.762 --> 00:25:30.970
Well, if we go back to some
of the biology on corals,

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:34.480
remember, the corals are living
in colonies glued to a rock

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.240
on the bottom sitting
next to clones.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.410
That's a very bad situation, if
you want to reproduce sexually.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:43.270
When corals reproduce
sexually, they've

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:44.930
figured out a solution for this.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.560
And that is they just
release their eggs--

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.230
which is what you see in this
video here, or their sperm--

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:52.780
into the water column
all at the same time.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.970
Corals across a whole reef will
release this at the same time.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.790
And in doing so, their
eggs and their sperm

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.175
mix together in the currents.

00:25:59.175 --> 00:26:01.300
And occasionally, the right
egg and the right sperm

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.030
come together and they make
a little tiny baby coral.

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:06.950
Now, that's important, because
it's happening in the water.

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:08.380
It's not happening
on the bottom.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.930
And those baby corals are pulled
away from the reef in currents.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:12.805
And they might spend a
few days, a few weeks,

00:26:12.805 --> 00:26:15.070
even a few months floating
around in the ocean

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:16.450
before they find a reef.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:18.610
They come down to the
bottom, they glue themselves

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:21.220
to the bottom, and they
begin a new colony.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:23.679
What that means is that those
unusual corals in places

00:26:23.679 --> 00:26:25.720
like that reef in Honduras--
when they reproduce,

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.955
their babies can get to
this reef, and this reef,

00:26:27.955 --> 00:26:30.034
and this reef, and this
reef, and this reef.

00:26:30.034 --> 00:26:31.700
And so if they're
doing something right,

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.130
if they've figured
out something that

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:34.660
allows them to
thrive in conditions

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.400
where other corals
can't, they can

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.486
get their babies who are likely
to inherit that same trait

00:26:39.486 --> 00:26:41.860
onto the next reef, and the
next reef, and the next reef,

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:42.827
and the next reef.

00:26:42.827 --> 00:26:45.160
So if we've got a diversity
of corals that are out there

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.810
and those diverse corals can
get from one reef to another,

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:50.378
we've got the beginnings of
a solution for adaptation.

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:55.500
The next piece of
it is around scale.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.200
If you do something like
this and you protect one reef

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.910
like this community
in Honduras that I've

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:02.250
shown on the yellow dot
here, that by itself

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:03.930
can produce that local benefit.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:07.530
But if that local benefit
can't get to other reefs,

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.420
then that system is
going to be unstable.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.410
It's going to get
hit by a storm.

00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:11.490
It's going to get hit
by a bleaching event.

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:13.156
And that reef is going
to get wiped out.

00:27:13.156 --> 00:27:15.030
It's that process
of recolonisation

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.130
at a big enough
scale that is going

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:18.997
to allow adaptation to happen.

00:27:18.997 --> 00:27:21.330
So this region in the map
here-- thank you, Google Maps,

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:22.380
by the way--

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:26.310
this region in the map here
shows the Mesoamerican reef,

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:28.240
which is part of the Caribbean.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.970
And it connects
Mexico with Belize,

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:33.570
with Guatemala, and Honduras.

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:36.645
These reefs are probably
interconnected with each other.

00:27:36.645 --> 00:27:38.770
The babies from one place
can get to another place.

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:41.103
And so some of the work we've
done in Honduras has said,

00:27:41.103 --> 00:27:42.922
OK, let's move from one reef.

00:27:42.922 --> 00:27:44.880
And let's start thinking
about putting together

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.835
a network of reefs
in Honduras where

00:27:46.835 --> 00:27:48.960
each of those reefs-- each
of those communities who

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.710
rely on those reefs--
are making decisions

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:53.010
about how to manage their
reef that create a better

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:55.830
environment for corals and a
better environment for the rest

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:57.210
of the wildlife on the reef.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:58.800
They can get their
local benefit,

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.380
they can provide that
benefit to that reef.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:03.630
In doing so, we can
begin to build a network.

00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:05.730
That network of
healthy reefs then

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.196
can be a source of baby corals
that can move from one reef,

00:28:08.196 --> 00:28:09.570
to another reef,
to another reef,

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.310
to another reef in that network.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.800
Now, Honduras is probably a
little bit too small for this,

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.230
because Honduras could get
hit by one big hurricane

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:17.407
or something like that.

00:28:17.407 --> 00:28:18.990
But it turns out
that the connectivity

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.690
is pretty good with places
in Mexico, and Belize,

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:22.400
and Guatemala.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.150
And if we start looking
at the work that's

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:26.100
going on in each of
those other places,

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:28.230
you can start to imagine
a networked system here

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:31.110
where there's enough reefs
with enough communities working

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:34.290
to protect them that include
a lot of that diversity that's

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:37.560
present in the system, that's
connected from one reef

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:38.790
to another.

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:41.910
And it's this kind of
solution at this kind of scale

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:44.370
where we're going to get
adaptation on coral reefs.

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:48.690
This kind of network system
has lots of the diversity, lots

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:51.210
of the connectivity,
and it's big enough

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:53.550
to protect it from risk.

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:56.910
We call this system
an adaptive reefscape.

00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:01.050
And it's basically a concept for
how do you build these networks

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:03.120
repeatedly around
the world, in ways

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.270
that allow the reef to adapt
to the change that's coming?

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:12.270
So that's the
in-principle argument.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:14.450
Build the adaptation network.

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:16.490
And the biological
information that's

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:18.948
out there-- the evolutionary
information that's out there--

00:29:18.948 --> 00:29:20.674
all says this should work.

00:29:20.674 --> 00:29:23.090
And we like that, because it
helps give us an idea of what

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:24.530
the solution should be.

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:26.660
But we wanted to go to the
next stage and say, OK,

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.930
can we do better than it should
work based on first principles?

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:31.850
Can we actually begin
to tinker with it

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:33.525
and understand it
in greater detail?

00:29:33.525 --> 00:29:35.900
And so we've worked with a
bunch of different researchers

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:38.480
at different universities
to say, can we take

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:40.310
what we know about corals--

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:42.010
how diverse they
are, how much they

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.510
move from one place to another,
how good they are inheriting

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:46.160
the traits of their parents--

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:50.570
and can we begin to ask very
explicit quantitative questions

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:54.020
about their ability to
adapt to change over time?

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.130
Now, this is a horrible,
ugly set of equations.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:57.755
And I'm not going to
pretend that I can

00:29:57.755 --> 00:29:59.390
explain the equations to you.

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:00.890
But what the
equations have done--

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:02.690
and what the researchers we've
been working with have done--

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:04.850
is they've taken all
of this information,

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:07.040
and they've built a
mathematical coral reef

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:09.980
region that has a bunch
of different reefs,

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:12.230
with different diversity,
with different environmental

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.870
conditions that are connected
to each other in the way

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:16.687
that corals are
connected to each other.

00:30:16.687 --> 00:30:18.770
And we've used that to
begin to ask the questions,

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:23.090
OK, realistically, the world is
changing really, really fast.

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:25.070
Are corals capable
of doing this?

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:28.160
Are they able to actually
adapt fast enough

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.870
to be able to deal
with the conditions?

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.044
Or is it a pipe dream?

00:30:31.044 --> 00:30:32.460
Maybe they can
adapt a little bit,

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:33.830
but it's just going
to be too slow.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.246
And the pace of climate change
is going to overwhelm them,

00:30:36.246 --> 00:30:38.830
and we're going to lose
coral reefs anyway.

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.581
Well, the good news is,
the answer looking at this

00:30:41.581 --> 00:30:44.080
question-- and we've looked at
a variety of different ways--

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:46.250
always seems to
come out to this.

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:48.310
Yup, they can adapt.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:51.230
But there's always an if.

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:55.820
And the if is about
what we choose to do now

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.470
and over the decades to come.

00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:59.480
Basically, the answer
is corals can do this,

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.150
so long as we take action
and we try and find

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:03.980
solutions that can
work for those corals.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.880
And that if contains two things.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.090
One, it says if we are
hell bent on burning

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:10.710
every last ounce of fossil
fuel on this planet,

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:12.660
it's probably not going to work.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.050
We actually have to get on
to a reasonable trajectory

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:17.090
on climate in order
for coral reefs

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:20.570
to really have a good shot
at being able to adapt.

00:31:20.570 --> 00:31:22.430
The other piece is,
we've got to figure out

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:24.150
this local management problem.

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:26.060
And by building these
adaptation networks--

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:28.310
the adaptive reefscape that
I described a moment ago--

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:30.320
that's going to go a
long way toward providing

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.850
the raw material for adaptation.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:34.400
So if we do those two
things, we have good reason

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.210
to believe corals
are going to be

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:36.418
able to make it through this.

00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:41.920
So if we think
it's going to work,

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.170
can we use that same
information to figure out

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.682
the best way to do it?

00:31:45.682 --> 00:31:47.890
Because when we look at
doing coral reef conservation

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:50.530
work in a region, we've got lots
of choices about which reefs

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:52.350
should we work on, which
communities should we work on,

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:53.860
which countries
should we work on.

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.080
How do we deploy our
resources in a way

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.340
that's going to lead us to
the best bang for our buck?

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:00.340
And so it's interesting.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.930
If you go to the coral
reef science literature,

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:03.596
there's a whole bunch
of different ideas

00:32:03.596 --> 00:32:05.490
about how to do this.

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:07.240
The basic question
here is, how do you

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.197
pick your reefs for the
best conservation benefit?

00:32:10.197 --> 00:32:12.280
And so if we're thinking
about building a network,

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.863
we could look at
this network and we'd

00:32:13.863 --> 00:32:16.090
say, OK, let's find the
best reefs in that network.

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:17.320
And let's protect those.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:19.299
That's going to be
our best strategy.

00:32:19.299 --> 00:32:21.340
So one strategy would say,
go to those reefs that

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.629
have really high coral cover.

00:32:22.629 --> 00:32:24.670
If they've got high coral
cover, clearly, they're

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:25.480
good for corals.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.610
Those are probably the
reefs you want to bet on.

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:29.200
That's one thing you could do.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.280
There's another
group of researchers

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.321
saying, wait, wait, wait.

00:32:31.321 --> 00:32:32.214
Hold on a second.

00:32:32.214 --> 00:32:34.630
There's a different set of
reefs we should be focusing on.

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:37.144
Let's go to the ones that
are naturally cooler.

00:32:37.144 --> 00:32:39.060
The cooler reefs are
going to be most buffered

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.018
against climate change.

00:32:40.018 --> 00:32:41.622
If we can protect
the coolest reefs,

00:32:41.622 --> 00:32:43.080
those are the ones
where the corals

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.440
are going to have the
best shot because it's not

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.520
going to get as hot.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:48.036
That's what we should be
doing, climate change refugia.

00:32:48.036 --> 00:32:49.952
Oh, that's an interesting idea.

00:32:49.952 --> 00:32:51.910
There's another group
saying, wait, wait, wait.

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:53.770
No, it's the warm reefs
we should be going for,

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:55.436
because the warm reefs
are the ones that

00:32:55.436 --> 00:32:58.220
already have the corals that
are good at living in hot water.

00:32:58.220 --> 00:33:00.280
Those are the ones you
want for the future.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.863
And then, one of the
things that we've

00:33:01.863 --> 00:33:04.420
been postulating for a
while is that any one

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.940
of these kinds of
strategies that's narrow

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.846
is probably too narrow, given
the uncertainties we're facing.

00:33:09.846 --> 00:33:11.470
And what we've been
thinking is perhaps

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:13.570
we should be looking
at this as a portfolio

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:14.892
of different kinds of reefs.

00:33:14.892 --> 00:33:16.600
That's where we get
that diversity that I

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.030
was talking about earlier.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:20.930
Reefs with different kinds
of environmental conditions

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:24.755
in a diverse portfolio might
give us a better end result.

00:33:24.755 --> 00:33:27.130
So we've been able to use that
same mathematical modeling

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:30.040
framework to evaluate
different strategies like this.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.620
Pretend you're God, and you
can design your conservation

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:33.130
network.

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:35.005
And you can design it
from zero, and then you

00:33:35.005 --> 00:33:38.260
can play out over time
and see how well it does.

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:39.910
So you can do a
bunch of model runs.

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:42.272
These are different tracks
of model runs for what

00:33:42.272 --> 00:33:43.230
performance looks like.

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:45.270
Here, performance is
measured in coral cover

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:47.100
at some time in
the future, model

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.690
runs for those
different strategies.

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:50.160
Each line is a
different strategy.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.757
You've got a hot reef
strategy, a cold reef strategy.

00:33:52.757 --> 00:33:54.840
There's a strategy that
says, no, go hot and cold.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.340
Put those two
together, that's going

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:57.510
to be your right strategy.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:58.926
And then, there's
a series of them

00:33:58.926 --> 00:34:01.440
that are built on some kind
of diversity portfolio.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.350
There's a gradient
strategy which just says,

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:05.679
just evenly space your reefs.

00:34:05.679 --> 00:34:06.970
Don't worry about what's there.

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:08.370
But just space them evenly.

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:09.510
There's another
one that says, look

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:11.250
at how much diversity and
environmental conditions

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:11.833
are out there.

00:34:11.833 --> 00:34:15.138
And deliberately design the best
diversity portfolio you can.

00:34:15.138 --> 00:34:17.429
And then, the last one says,
just pick them at random--

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:19.110
which is another
way of incorporating

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:23.159
a lot of the diversity in
the system just by chance.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:25.400
So the kind of results we're
getting look like this.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.219
We've done this analysis
many, many different ways

00:34:28.219 --> 00:34:29.780
with many, many
different assumptions

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.370
about how corals
can move around,

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:34.370
about how their genes can spread
from one generation to another.

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:37.830
And the answer is basically
always the same answer.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:41.810
The diverse portfolio
strategies perform the best.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:45.020
Given the uncertainties, given
the way things are changing,

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:47.840
whenever you try an out-think
the system and come up with

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.280
a really smart answer--

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.363
it's going to be the hot
reefs of the cold reefs--

00:34:51.363 --> 00:34:54.260
as soon as you pick a narrow
set of predicted winners, that's

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:55.730
when your performance goes down.

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:58.121
When you assume that you
don't get to know the answers

00:34:58.121 --> 00:34:59.870
but that you want
diversity in that system

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:01.310
to cover your
bases, that's where

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:03.726
your performance is the best.

00:35:03.726 --> 00:35:05.100
So now, what we're
doing is we're

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:07.260
taking that kind of
information and we're

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:08.850
overlaying it on real regions.

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:11.210
Remember, this is the
Mesoamerican reef region

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:12.480
in the Caribbean.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.880
Now, we're looking at that
and saying, OK, great.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.640
There are lots of reefs
people are already protecting.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.645
How do we use this information
to identify which places

00:35:20.645 --> 00:35:22.020
and what kinds of
reefs we should

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.460
be protecting going forward?

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.407
How do we build a
portfolio of diverse reefs

00:35:26.407 --> 00:35:27.990
that are interconnected
in this system

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:30.115
and are really built on a
foundation of communities

00:35:30.115 --> 00:35:32.370
who have figured out ways
to protect their reef going

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:33.520
forward?

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.520
We're testing this out
in the Mesoamerican reef.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.353
We're investing a lot
of our time and effort

00:35:37.353 --> 00:35:39.330
there because we've got
a great set of partners

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:40.140
throughout this region.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.514
We've got a lot
of work underway,

00:35:41.514 --> 00:35:44.190
and we think this can actually
be a real model for how

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:46.200
do you design adaptation
networks for coral

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.847
reefs around the world.

00:35:47.847 --> 00:35:49.680
But ultimately, what
we're really interested

00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.015
is in thinking about coral
reefs around the world.

00:35:52.015 --> 00:35:53.640
This is the distribution
of coral reefs

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.452
around the world in a few
different biogeographic areas.

00:35:56.452 --> 00:35:58.410
Each and every one of
these biogeographic areas

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:01.410
includes these same kinds
of coral reef regions,

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:03.710
where people are trying to
find conservation solutions.

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:04.740
And what we're
trying to figure out

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:06.600
is, how do we go from
a lot of good work

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.150
that's happening right
now fairly organically,

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:10.890
to really thinking
about how to organize

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:14.880
that work in a way that drives
the process of adaptation

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.010
and allows reefs
to have an ability

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:20.430
to adapt to the environmental
changes that are coming?

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:22.230
The reality is that
there is a lot that's

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:25.080
riding on our ability
to get this right.

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.580
And it's really pretty urgent.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.890
We've got a few
decades to a century

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:30.840
to solve these problems
because of the pace

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.820
of environmental change.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:34.530
All of the wildlife
that's on reefs--

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:36.630
the millions of different
species from turtles,

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.820
to sharks, to
corals, to shrimp--

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.100
all of them are going
to rely on our ability

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:43.380
to get these solutions
right and continue to have

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:45.210
coral reefs around the world.

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:47.940
And even more importantly,
people in communities

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.850
all over the world are depending
on us getting this right.

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:53.820
And so we feel a really
strong sense of urgency.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.010
We feel a really strong
drive to try and make

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:58.740
sure that we can get
these solutions to scale

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.900
all the way across the
world, because our time

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:04.710
window is the one that's
right in front of us.

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:07.770
So I wanted to close
just on one last thought

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:09.330
before we go to questions.

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.760
And that is, well,
what can you do?

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.962
If you are a diver and
care about coral reefs,

00:37:14.962 --> 00:37:16.670
or if you're thinking
about these issues,

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:19.610
what is it that an individual
can do in this system?

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:22.960
The first is individuals can
do a lot on the mitigation

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.370
side of that equation.

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:27.250
You can make decisions about
your own carbon footprint

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:29.410
or your own use of
greenhouse gases.

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:31.874
You can also make decisions
through your place of work.

00:37:31.874 --> 00:37:33.790
I know Google thinks a
lot about these issues,

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:37.030
around how do they use
energy efficiently,

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:39.970
and how do they develop
the organization

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:42.670
as a good actor in
terms of climate change

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:43.930
around the world.

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:45.870
This is also showing
more and more in policy.

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:47.700
I mentioned that all
countries but one

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:49.130
are part of the Paris Accords.

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:51.230
That one happens to
be our country, which

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:53.380
isn't proving to be
a leader right now

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:55.060
at the national scale.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:58.030
It is proving to be a leader at
the local scale, and the state

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:00.005
level, and at the
level of industry.

00:38:00.005 --> 00:38:01.630
And so there's a lot
of ways of getting

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:04.540
involved in those process
on the mitigation side.

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:08.380
On the adaptation side, the
main kinds of things we can do

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.720
are the kind of work we do
working with communities

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.480
or other organizations do
working with governments to try

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:17.080
and put in place policies
that allow local reefs to be

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.910
well-protected, and
those protections

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:21.190
to exist across these
different networks.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:24.370
That can include supporting
conservation organizations.

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:27.460
It can also include choosing
to go and visit these places.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:30.490
A lot of these places are
dependent on tourism economy.

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:33.257
And so if you're going
to be traveling anyway,

00:38:33.257 --> 00:38:34.840
I would recommend
go to a place that's

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.119
trying to protect their reefs.

00:38:36.119 --> 00:38:36.910
Go see those reefs.

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:37.900
Learn about what they're doing.

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.483
Learn about those
local organizations.

00:38:39.483 --> 00:38:41.230
And see if you can get involved.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.700
You can get directly involved
through those organizations.

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.116
You can get directly involved
through other organizations.

00:38:46.116 --> 00:38:47.650
In protecting those
reefs locally,

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:50.140
they're going to add up to
those adaptation solutions

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:53.740
while we get a
handle on climate.

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.370
And I'll stop there
and take questions.

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:55.870
Thank you.

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:58.474
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:00.199 --> 00:39:00.740
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.690
I had a question about
the adaptive reefscape.

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:05.330
You showed like
a diagram for it.

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.550
But have you started
implementing any of it yet?

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:09.630
Or is it just plans right now?

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:13.320
MICHAEL WEBSTER: So, yes.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.190
The modeling that
I described to you

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:19.110
earlier is a project
that's underway right now.

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:21.110
And what we've done is
an initial set of models.

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:22.670
What we're doing is we're
getting an initial set of what

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:24.140
I would call rules of thumb.

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.297
How do you design these
things in general?

00:39:26.297 --> 00:39:28.130
The next phase is
actually going to say, OK,

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:30.080
let's take a region like
the Mesoamerican region.

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.550
And let's map out
where the reefs are.

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:33.341
And let's figure out
what the design should

00:39:33.341 --> 00:39:34.724
look like for that place.

00:39:34.724 --> 00:39:36.140
We haven't done
that analysis yet.

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.830
That's coming in the next year.

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:39.350
But in the meantime,
we can already

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:42.290
take a look at that region
with a screen for what kinds

00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:43.760
of things are we looking for.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.920
I mentioned our focus
on Honduras and all

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.441
those initial dots in Honduras.

00:39:47.441 --> 00:39:49.190
That's because when
you look at the places

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:51.740
where intensive conservation
actions are going on right now

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:55.100
in that region, they're really
focused on Belize and Mexico.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.480
And what's happening
right now is

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.210
that you've got this giant
hole in that reef system

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:01.952
where you're missing a
lot of the connectivity,

00:40:01.952 --> 00:40:04.160
because those reefs are
well-connected to each other.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:06.290
You're probably also missing
a lot of the diversity.

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:08.180
And there's some very
unusual reefs in Honduras

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.580
that we've already decided
to place some bets on and try

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.410
to make sure that
those unusual reefs are

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:14.250
part of that portfolio.

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:16.010
So in general, absolutely, yes.

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:18.551
We're also working with a lot
of the partners throughout that

00:40:18.551 --> 00:40:20.870
region-- governments,
NGOs, others, funders--

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:24.200
to think about how do we
get this solution at scale.

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.570
And so every step is
in that direction.

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:29.360
The next level is going
to be a tailored analysis

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.830
to that particular
region, looking

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:33.410
at the connectivity matrix,
the distribution of habitat

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:34.192
for that region.

00:40:34.192 --> 00:40:36.650
And then analyzing that compared
to the work that's already

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:39.605
going on, and saying, how
does the current distribution

00:40:39.605 --> 00:40:42.350
of effort perform over time?

00:40:42.350 --> 00:40:44.720
And are there areas where if
we expanded our effort just

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.690
a little bit, we could get
really big bang for our buck

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:51.650
in terms of adaptation
of the system as a whole?

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:55.410
AUDIENCE: Are we talking
something as big as maybe

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:57.282
transplantation?

00:40:57.282 --> 00:40:58.990
MICHAEL WEBSTER: That's
a great question.

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:02.430
I didn't talk about it
specifically in this talk.

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:05.790
But it is an area that's
getting more and more attention

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:07.010
in our field.

00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:10.920
And it's a very direct way of
trying to solve this problem.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:13.440
If the corals are
declining on a reef,

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.060
and you want corals
on that reef,

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.920
what if you just
grow some corals

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:19.297
and put them on that reef?

00:41:19.297 --> 00:41:20.880
And the thinking on
it is very linear.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.210
And we have every reason to
believe that that can be done.

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:26.590
And people have done
it over and over again.

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:29.230
The problem with it
is a scaling problem.

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:32.007
So we did a back-of-the-envelope
analysis on that Mesoamerican

00:41:32.007 --> 00:41:33.840
region, which is just
a little tiny fraction

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.310
of the world's coral reefs.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:38.095
And we looked at how many
corals cover a certain area

00:41:38.095 --> 00:41:39.970
on the bottom, and how
much habitat, and just

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:42.930
said, how many coral
colonies are in that region?

00:41:42.930 --> 00:41:45.715
And the answer ends up
being probably billions.

00:41:45.715 --> 00:41:48.510
So there's probably
billions of these colonies.

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:52.330
To do transplantation is
very expensive per unit.

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:53.994
So if you're going
to collect a coral,

00:41:53.994 --> 00:41:55.410
you're going to
grow it in a tank,

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:57.570
you're going to run the energy
to keep that tank moving.

00:41:57.570 --> 00:41:58.890
You're going to
get it to a size.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:00.600
You're going to take it
as a diver underwater,

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.160
and you're going to
put it on the bottom.

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.576
Each and every one
of those corals

00:42:03.576 --> 00:42:06.900
is going to cost you
$1, or $10, or more.

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:08.970
Most of the
transplantation experiments

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:10.620
that have been done
so far tend to work

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.140
in tens of individual
corals, or hundreds

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.490
of individuals corals--

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:16.860
or at the higher end, thousands.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:19.050
And it's probably
multiple orders

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:21.750
of magnitude off the
scale that's really

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:23.610
going to make a difference
to the population

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:24.680
dynamics in this region.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:27.060
It's kind of like thinking
about humanity, right?

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:29.980
Humanity has got somewhere
short of 10 billion people.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.670
How many new people would
you have to add to the planet

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:34.660
to really change our
population dynamics?

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:36.390
It's not going to
be a few thousand.

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:39.270
It would have to be a much,
much larger number than that.

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:41.070
And so while I think
there's a lot going

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:43.620
on that's promising on
the restoration front,

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:46.862
there hasn't been a real ability
to solve the scaling problem.

00:42:46.862 --> 00:42:49.320
A lot of people are working
at, how do you make it cheaper,

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.730
and cheaper, and cheaper,
so that you can do more?

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:53.684
And I think there's
some promise in that.

00:42:53.684 --> 00:42:56.100
The other side of it that's
interesting on the restoration

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.110
front is that
people are beginning

00:42:58.110 --> 00:42:59.500
to say, wait a minute.

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.310
What if we identify some
of those unusual corals?

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:03.780
And what if we put
those corals out

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:06.757
there, and essentially speed
up the adaptation process?

00:43:06.757 --> 00:43:08.340
Let's pick the winners
for the future.

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:10.650
Let's grow those ones-- like
the really temperature-tolerant

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:11.280
corals--

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:12.960
and put those out on the reef.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:15.450
I think that's more
promising, but one

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:17.100
of the things that
our analysis shows

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.200
on the different
strategies is that when

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:21.540
you start picking a
narrow set of winners,

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:23.370
that's when you start
to get into trouble.

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:25.320
Because that's when
your assumptions are

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.190
likely to be wrong.

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:28.320
What you could do, if you
wanted to pick the most

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.540
temperature-tolerant corals,
is you could essentially

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.610
create a monoculture problem.

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:35.100
You could select those corals
for that particular trait,

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:37.697
but you might be losing
other traits in that process.

00:43:37.697 --> 00:43:39.280
We know how to do
this in agriculture.

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:41.905
And this is one of the problems
we've gotten to in agriculture,

00:43:41.905 --> 00:43:44.880
is by designing plants
or animals for very, very

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.609
specific purposes, they
become bad at other things.

00:43:47.609 --> 00:43:49.650
And so you might be able
to design a coral that's

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:51.540
really good at dealing
with high temperature,

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:53.640
but maybe it's
susceptible to disease.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.526
Or maybe it doesn't
do well in storms.

00:43:55.526 --> 00:43:57.900
And it's the combination of
these different traits, which

00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.316
is probably going
to be what we're

00:43:59.316 --> 00:44:01.387
going to need for successful
reefs going forward.

00:44:01.387 --> 00:44:02.970
So I think we're
just beginning to ask

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:04.920
some of the interesting
questions there about,

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:07.800
can we actually drive
the evolution of corals

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.829
by selecting for
particular traits?

00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:12.120
And can we do that in a way
that protects our diversity

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.079
portfolio?

00:44:13.079 --> 00:44:15.120
What I would say is, for
protecting the diversity

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.300
portfolio in the process, that's
a really good step forward.

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.040
One of my concerns
about this area,

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:23.010
though, is that the
resources we're currently

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:25.650
putting into trying to
solve these problems locally

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:28.106
could shift to trying
to grow corals.

00:44:28.106 --> 00:44:29.730
And if we haven't
resolved the problems

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:32.400
that I was talking about earlier
around things like overfishing

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.230
and pollution, we
don't actually have

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:37.440
good environments to
transplant those corals into.

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.600
So what I would recommend
is let's make sure

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.730
that we're doing that work.

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:43.090
Let's make sure we're creating
those good local environments

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:44.940
that are going to allow
corals to flourish.

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:49.140
And if we want to augment that
by restoring corals actively,

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:49.860
let's do so.

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:53.070
But let's not kid ourselves into
thinking that the costs of that

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:56.407
are going to be small
or easily scalable.

00:44:56.407 --> 00:44:57.240
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.070
So you mentioned
the village in Fiji.

00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:01.170
And a lot of us here
have to influence

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:05.310
either our coworkers,
or outsiders, or users

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:08.400
that there is a
better way to do X.

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.484
But human nature is what it is.

00:45:10.484 --> 00:45:12.150
I wanted to understand
a little bit more

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:15.900
about how you actually go about
from the sort of headline of,

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:19.230
you can do just as well
with tourism than fishing.

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:21.160
How do you actually
implement that?

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.910
A little bit more on
the mechanics of that.

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:26.400
MICHAEL WEBSTER: The
bulk of our program staff

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.470
are what I would
loosely describe

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:30.590
as community organizers.

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:33.300
They are people who live in
Fiji, or they live in Honduras,

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:34.860
and live in Indonesia.

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:37.380
And they're part
of that community.

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:39.030
And what they have
decided on their own

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:42.150
is that they want to
be part of solutions

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:44.820
that are going to benefit the
community for the long term.

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:46.640
How do they manage
their activities?

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.930
How do they have economic
development while continuing

00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:50.755
to have these other benefits?

00:45:50.755 --> 00:45:52.630
And one of the beautiful
things about working

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:55.360
with that particular population
is that that population

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:59.320
is actually quite keyed into
the interests and the incentives

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.970
within that community.

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:04.000
One of the big mistakes of sort
of conservation over the years

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.070
has been the assumption
that people like me who

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:08.142
are Western trained--
grew up in North America--

00:46:08.142 --> 00:46:10.600
that I better know what's best
for a community in Honduras.

00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.120
Or I'm going to know what's
best for a community in Fiji.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.320
The reality is, I don't.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:17.260
I can understand how
coral reefs work.

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:19.690
I can understand what's
been tried in other places.

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:21.580
But the community
actually has to be the one

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:24.770
to think about what they
want for themselves.

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:27.190
The key to making something
like this work usually,

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:29.080
though, is trying
to find the place

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.130
where the incentives line up.

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:34.270
And if there's a strong
incentive within the community

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:36.910
to try something
different or to reinforce

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:38.650
something that's
different, that's

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:39.790
when it's likely to work.

00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:41.420
And if those
incentives don't exist,

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.480
it doesn't matter how
good your idea is.

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.370
The community actually has to
be able to benefit from it.

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:50.140
So in the Fijian
situation, that community--

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:52.469
independently, they
knew they had a problem.

00:46:52.469 --> 00:46:54.760
They knew that they weren't
catching the fish that they

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:55.802
used to be able to catch.

00:46:55.802 --> 00:46:58.010
The fishermen in the community
were saying, you know,

00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:58.810
when I was a kid--

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:00.620
and they sort of
realized, wait a minute.

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:01.511
What's going on?

00:47:01.511 --> 00:47:03.010
At the same time,
that community was

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:05.560
seeing fishers come in from
other villages and fish

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.760
their reefs.

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.471
Now, in that case,
I told you there's

00:47:08.471 --> 00:47:10.720
a property right system,
where that community actually

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.096
owns that resource.

00:47:12.096 --> 00:47:13.720
And they started to
say, wait a minute.

00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:15.560
This has gotten so bad.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.240
How do we solve this?

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.630
How do we take action
for our own reefs

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:22.420
in a way that allows us to
have the kinds of fishing

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:24.512
we used to, and the kinds
of benefits we used to?

00:47:24.512 --> 00:47:26.470
And so they came to us
and other groups to say,

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:28.370
can you help us figure this out?

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:31.330
And so we'd seen, for
example, dive user fee systems

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:33.050
work in other communities.

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:34.600
So a community might
say, hey, we're

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:37.457
going to make this particular
area of reef a protected area.

00:47:37.457 --> 00:47:39.040
And we're going to
allow it to fill up

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.572
with sharks and big groupers.

00:47:40.572 --> 00:47:42.280
But if you want to
come here as a tourist

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.480
and you want to see
that because you're

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.160
interested in that
wildlife, we're

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.290
going to charge you a
nominal fee to do it--

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:50.174
maybe $10, maybe $20, and
then you can go and see that.

00:47:50.174 --> 00:47:52.090
Well, if you're paying
a bunch to be a tourist

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:54.006
and go to a place like
this, it doesn't really

00:47:54.006 --> 00:47:55.180
matter, this small fee.

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:57.730
But those small fees can be
really important to a community

00:47:57.730 --> 00:48:00.460
like this, because in the
case of the community in Fiji,

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:02.920
some of those fees went directly
into community projects--

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.050
like scholarships for
children, or like building

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:06.550
a new community center.

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:09.460
And that community could
then tie their interest

00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:13.720
in protecting the reef with
a direct economic gain.

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:16.456
Those dollars also go
to managing the park.

00:48:16.456 --> 00:48:17.830
And so if you can
create a system

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:19.010
like that where the
community is saying,

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:20.450
hey, we want
something like this.

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:25.210
We want a different set of
access to our resources.

00:48:25.210 --> 00:48:26.920
We see these benefits
on fisheries.

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.760
We see these economic benefits.

00:48:28.760 --> 00:48:31.122
How do you design a
system to do that?

00:48:31.122 --> 00:48:33.580
Well, we've got good models
around the world of communities

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.800
who have been down this road,
who have built these systems--

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.383
who have built out
the business plans,

00:48:37.383 --> 00:48:39.700
who have built out the
enforcement mechanisms--

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:42.820
so that you can apply those
same tools from one community

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:44.020
to another community.

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.720
But it absolutely
requires that initial step

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.450
of a community that wants
to do something about this.

00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:51.490
It's much more difficult--
and frankly, it's

00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:53.470
not necessarily worth it--
to go into a community that's

00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:55.000
not looking to solve
a problem, that

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.820
says everything is just fine,
and try and impose a solution.

00:48:57.820 --> 00:48:59.507
That doesn't make any sense.

00:48:59.507 --> 00:49:01.840
The market out there-- if
you're looking for communities

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:04.720
that want to solve these kinds
of problems-- is really good.

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.367
That's one of the blessings
and curses of our work,

00:49:07.367 --> 00:49:08.950
is that there are
more communities who

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:10.930
want this kind of
solution than we

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:13.960
have resources right now to be
able to help them design it.

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:16.104
If every community has
to do this de novo--

00:49:16.104 --> 00:49:18.020
if they have to figure
it out for themselves--

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:19.520
it's not going to
be very efficient.

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:21.040
It's not going to
be very effective.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.750
If we can take what's
worked in other places

00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:25.900
and compare that to what
the individual needs

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:27.670
of the community
are, we can find

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:30.090
things that are more scalable.

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:34.180
AUDIENCE: So you showed a
map of all the coral reefs

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:35.050
around the world.

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:37.330
And a lot of them
are centralized--

00:49:37.330 --> 00:49:41.950
I saw-- around the coastal
regions for United States.

00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:43.720
Yeah, that one.

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:47.350
And then, you had also showed
a picture of the Maui issue,

00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:51.770
where we had the toxins coming
in, and also the sediments

00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:52.910
and the nutrients.

00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:56.270
But not from this
standpoint, what

00:49:56.270 --> 00:50:00.850
has the alliance done in terms
of legislation and potential

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:04.344
rulings on that to help
curb those bad behaviors?

00:50:04.344 --> 00:50:05.260
MICHAEL WEBSTER: Yeah.

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:09.670
So every nonprofit
organization has

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:12.610
to decide what are the things
that they are going to work on.

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:15.370
And what do they want
to really specialize on?

00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:17.140
We have not made a
decision to specialize

00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:18.100
on things like legislation.

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:20.230
We actually have lots of
great peer organizations

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:22.380
that work things like the
US national government,

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:24.130
or national governments
in other countries

00:50:24.130 --> 00:50:26.230
to try and create
legislation for things

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:28.400
like protected areas,
and things like that.

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:32.080
So our work is much
more community-focused,

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:35.060
which is part of the
overall set of solutions.

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:37.324
It's not everything that
needs to take place.

00:50:37.324 --> 00:50:39.490
What we tend to find in
most places around the world

00:50:39.490 --> 00:50:42.670
is that sort of larger
scale legal framework

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:45.370
is an enabling condition
which can allow conservation

00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:46.480
to proceed.

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:50.129
By itself, it doesn't
usually get us to solutions.

00:50:50.129 --> 00:50:52.420
I would say, particularly,
in developing countries that

00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:55.330
might pass great laws, but
then they don't necessarily

00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:56.950
have the mandate
or the resources

00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:59.680
to really implement
or enforce those laws.

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:02.090
What we find is that in
a lot of these countries,

00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:05.590
communities can then
use that legal framework

00:51:05.590 --> 00:51:08.800
to assert a set of protections
or management systems

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.110
over the resources that
are important to them--

00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:13.810
oftentimes-- through some kind
of co-management structure,

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:15.730
where the government
will say, gee.

00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:17.429
We recognize this is our law.

00:51:17.429 --> 00:51:18.970
But we're not really
implementing it.

00:51:18.970 --> 00:51:20.594
If the community
wants to implement it,

00:51:20.594 --> 00:51:22.750
we'll try and figure out
ways to work with you.

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:25.450
So that's the space that
we work in more than the

00:51:25.450 --> 00:51:27.830
setting the legal frameworks
in the first place.

00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:29.579
A lot of the countries
we work in actually

00:51:29.579 --> 00:51:31.310
have very progressive
laws around this.

00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:33.018
If you look at like
Honduras for example,

00:51:33.018 --> 00:51:36.400
it has some very
progressive laws

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.530
around protecting
coastal resources.

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:40.420
And they've established
very large parks.

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:43.160
And if you just look at that
on paper, you'd say, wow.

00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:44.450
This is great.

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:46.600
The problem is that
95% of the work

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.390
remains to be done after that,
which is how do you translate

00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:53.410
that into a set of durable,
effective practices

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:58.360
that are consonant with
the community's interests,

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:01.755
so that they'll be
maintained moving forward?

00:52:01.755 --> 00:52:03.880
In the US-- you mentioned
some of the coastal areas

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:04.780
in the US--

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:08.740
the US has a mixed record on
this for coral reef protection.

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:13.060
I would say in some cases, we
see more progressive policies

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:15.691
sometimes in developing
countries than, say, Hawaii--

00:52:15.691 --> 00:52:17.440
particularly around
things like fisheries.

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:22.360
Hawaii has a lot of difficulty
in changing fisheries' rules,

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.890
because there's a
lot of user groups

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:26.180
who all currently
access the resource.

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:28.260
And none of them want to
give up that resource.

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:30.093
And that makes sense
from their perspective,

00:52:30.093 --> 00:52:34.000
but it creates an ongoing
problem on the reef.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.707
The US does have some big
coral reef protected areas.

00:52:37.707 --> 00:52:39.790
Hawaii is interesting,
because a lot of the really

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:41.331
degraded reefs in
Hawaii are the ones

00:52:41.331 --> 00:52:45.040
you would see if you went to
Oahu, or Maui, or Hawaii island

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.150
and went snorkeling.

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:48.490
Those are the high islands
of Hawaii, which is

00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:50.230
where most people would visit.

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:51.650
If you go past
those high islands,

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:54.130
there's actually a series
of atolls that go far,

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:56.860
far up into the North Pacific.

00:52:56.860 --> 00:53:00.020
So here are the high islands
of Hawaii right in here.

00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:02.020
And then, there's
this Long Island chain

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:05.920
which is sometimes called the
Northwest Hawaiian Islands.

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:09.740
Actually, George W. Bush turned
it into a national monument.

00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:13.300
It's called Papahanaumokuakea,
which essentially protected

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:15.890
that entire set of islands--

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:18.880
that entire chain of islands--
which is one of the biggest

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:20.800
protected areas on
the planet, and one

00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.055
of the most significant
ones for coral reefs.

00:53:23.055 --> 00:53:25.430
And then, it was expanded
under the Obama administration.

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:28.250
We'll see if it holds.

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:31.180
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned that
you have basically more demand

00:53:31.180 --> 00:53:33.680
for getting your constitution
working with these communities

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:34.520
than you can handle.

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:36.620
So I was just
wondering, what are

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:37.994
your thoughts in trying to--

00:53:37.994 --> 00:53:39.410
I guess-- scale
your organization,

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:42.170
or the number of communities
that you are reaching out to?

00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:44.290
MICHAEL WEBSTER: Yeah.

00:53:44.290 --> 00:53:46.820
There's a number of
different dimensions to that.

00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:49.880
One is, we work with lots
of other organizations.

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:52.280
And we have a fundamental
belief in partnerships,

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.022
that the Coral
Reef Alliance isn't

00:53:54.022 --> 00:53:55.730
going to solve these
problems on our own.

00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:57.554
And it's silly for
us to think so.

00:53:57.554 --> 00:53:59.720
Instead, we work with lots
of different conservation

00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:04.127
organizations to try and get
to this scale collectively.

00:54:04.127 --> 00:54:05.960
Another piece of it is
we need to figure out

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:07.515
how to replicate efficiently.

00:54:07.515 --> 00:54:09.890
Because if you have to start
over in every place and say,

00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:11.150
OK, now it's a new problem--

00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:12.650
let's begin from zero--

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:15.290
then you're using basically
the maximum resources

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:16.836
to get the job done
in any one place.

00:54:16.836 --> 00:54:18.710
And so we're always
looking for opportunities

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:22.310
to take ideas that
worked in one place

00:54:22.310 --> 00:54:25.935
and use them to build sort of
word of mouth momentum, where

00:54:25.935 --> 00:54:27.560
the community next
door looks and says,

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:29.210
hey, I want one of those.

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:30.790
Why can't we do that?

00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:32.660
And at the same time,
build those tools

00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:35.600
that are transportable-- so
that in the next community,

00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:38.120
you have a built in
already interest in trying

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:39.650
the same kind of solution.

00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:42.020
You've got tools and
techniques for doing it.

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.760
You can implement the
same thing more cheaply.

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:47.474
So there's some scalability
that's built around that.

00:54:47.474 --> 00:54:48.890
The other piece
is as a nonprofit,

00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:50.723
we're also always looking
for more resources

00:54:50.723 --> 00:54:52.430
to implement at scale.

00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:54.650
There's not going to be
a silver bullet here.

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:57.770
There isn't going to be just a
viral solution that can cruise

00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:58.854
and expand all on its own.

00:54:58.854 --> 00:55:00.270
At the end of the
day, it is going

00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:02.150
to take a certain
amount of heavy lifting

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:05.180
in a lot of communities to get
to these kinds of solutions.

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.760
The question is, how do we do
that in a coordinated way that

00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.801
takes advantage of all
the different players that

00:55:09.801 --> 00:55:11.750
are out there, and in
each and every instance

00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:13.880
does it as efficiently
and effectively

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:15.970
as possible with the
minimum amount of resources,

00:55:15.970 --> 00:55:18.451
so we can apply those
resources somewhere else?

00:55:18.451 --> 00:55:19.200
Thanks, everybody.

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:22.550
[APPLAUSE]
