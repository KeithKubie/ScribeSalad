00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.450
We've learned about matrix
addition, matrix subtraction,

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.560
matrix multiplication.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.760
So you might be wondering,
is there the

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.150
equivalent of matrix division?

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.460
And before we get into that,
let me introduce

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.220
some concepts to you.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.490
And then we'll see that there is
something that maybe isn't

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.440
exactly division, but it's
analogous to it.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.620
So before we introduce that, I'm
going to introduce you to

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.210
the concept of an
identity matrix.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.350
So an identity matrix
is a matrix.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.840
And I'll denote that
by capital I.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.315
When I multiply it times another
matrix-- actually I

00:00:35.315 --> 00:00:36.960
don't know if I should write
that dot there-- but anyway,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.450
when I multiply times
another matrix, I

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.040
get that other matrix.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.130
Or when I multiply that matrix
times the identity matrix, I

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.230
get the matrix again.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.790
And it's important to realize
when we're doing matrix

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.580
multiplication, that
direction matters.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.810
I've actually given you some
information here that-- we

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.030
can't just assume when we were
doing regular multiplication

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.290
that, a times b is always
equal to b times a.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.095
It's important when we're doing
matrix multiplication,

00:01:04.095 --> 00:01:08.040
to confirm that it matters
what direction you do the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.650
multiplication in.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.350
But anyway, and this works
both ways only if we're

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.810
dealing with square matrices.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.660
It can work in one direction or
another if this matrix is

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.080
non-square, but it won't
work in both.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.670
And you can think about that
just in terms of how we

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.910
learned matrix multiplication,
why that happens.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.910
But anyway, I've defined
this matrix.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.180
Now what does this matrix
actually look like?

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.280
It's actually pretty simple.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.620
If we have a 2x2 matrix, the
identity matrix is 1, 0, 0, 1.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:50.490
If you want 3x3, it's 1,
0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.840
I think you see the pattern.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.140
If you want a 4x4, the identity
matrix is 1, 0, 0, 0

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.490
0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,
0, 0, 0, 0, 1.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.220
So you can see all that any
matrix is, for a given

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.390
dimension-- I mean we could
extend this to an n by n

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.680
matrix-- is you just have 1's
along this top left to bottom

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.390
right diagonals.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.790
And everything else is a 0.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.510
So I've told you that.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.360
Let's prove that it
actually works.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.270
Let's take this matrix
and multiply it

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.220
times another matrix.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.150
And confirm that that matrix
doesn't change.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.480
So if we take 1, 0, 0, 1.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.600
Let's multiply it times-- let's
do a general matrix.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.490
Just so you see that this
works for all numbers.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.670
a, b, c, d.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.440
So what does that equal?

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.970
We're going to multiply this
row times this column.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.870
1 times a plus 0 times c is a.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.340
And that row times
this column.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.590
1 times b plus 0 times d.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.450
That's b.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.370
Then this row times
this column.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.850
0 times a plus 1 times c is c.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.420
Then finally, this row
times this column.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.470
0 times b plus 1 times d.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.140
Well, that's just d.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.400
There you have it.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.630
And it might be a fun exercise
to try it the other

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.100
way around as well.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.430
And actually it's an even better
exercise to try this

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.740
with a 3x3.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.700
And you'll see it
all works out.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.520
And a good exercise for you is
to think about why it works.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.540
And if you think about it, it's
because you're getting

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.420
your row information from
here and your column

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.200
information from here.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.860
And essentially, anytime you're
multiplying, let's say

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.220
this vector times this vector,
you're multiplying the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.940
corresponding terms and then
adding them, right?

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.370
So if you have a 1 and a 0, the
0 is going to cancel out

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.890
anything but the first term
in this column vector.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.630
So that's why you're
just left with a.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.380
And that's why it's going to
cancel out everything but the

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.470
first term in this
column vector.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.190
And that's why you're
left with just b.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.220
And similarly, this will cancel
out everything but the

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.020
second term.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.250
That's why you're left
with just c there.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.960
This times this.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.270
You're just left with c.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.830
This times this.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.010
You're just left with d.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.690
And that same thing applies
when you go to

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.030
3x3 or n by n vectors.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.900
So that's interesting.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.740
You have the identity vector.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.860
Now if we wanted to complete
our analogy-- so

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.440
let's think about it.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.230
We know in regular mathematics,
if I have 1 times

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.750
a, I get a.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.680
And we also know that 1 over a
times a-- this is just regular

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.160
math, this has nothing to do
with matrices-- is equal to 1.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.060
And you know, we call this
the inverse of a.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.800
And that's also the same thing
as dividing by the number a.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.800
So is there a matrix analogy?

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.250
Let me switch colors, because
I've used this green a little

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.860
bit too much.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.580
Is there a matrix, where if I
were to have the matrix a, and

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.600
I multiply it by this matrix--
and I'll call that the inverse

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.650
of a-- is there a matrix where
I'm left with, not the number

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.140
1, but I'm left with
the 1 equivalent

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.930
in the matrix world?

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.785
Where I'm left with the
identity matrix?

00:04:58.785 --> 00:05:01.190
And it would be extra nice if
I could actually switch this

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.780
multiplication around.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.910
So A times A inverse should
also be equal to

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:08.745
the identity matrix.

00:05:08.745 --> 00:05:12.170
And if you think about it, if
both of these things are true,

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.100
then actually not only is A
inverse the inverse of A, but

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.210
A is also the inverse
of A inverse.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:18.330
So they're each other's
inverses.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.520
That's all I meant to say.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.020
And it turns out there
is such a matrix.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.020
It's called the inverse
of A, as I've

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.580
said three times already.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.030
And I will now show you
how to calculate it.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.220
So let's do that.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.290
And we'll see calculating
it for a 2x2 is fairly

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.970
straightforward.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.010
Although you might think it's a
little mysterious as to how

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.090
people came up with the
mechanics of it, or the

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.540
algorithm for it.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.050
3x3 becomes a little hairy.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.480
4x4 will take you all day.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.790
5x5, you're almost definitely
going to do a careless mistake

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.310
if you did the inverse
of a 5x5 matrix.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.970
And that's better left
to a computer.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.170
But anyway, how do we calculate
the matrix?

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.160
So let's do that, and then we'll
confirm that it really

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.660
is the inverse.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:14.250
So if I have a matrix A,
and that is a, b, c, d.

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.765
And I want to calculate
its inverse.

00:06:15.765 --> 00:06:17.915
Its inverse is actually--
and this is going

00:06:17.915 --> 00:06:18.630
to seem like voodoo.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.480
In future videos, I will give
you a little bit more

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.690
intuition for why this works, or
I'll actually show you how

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:24.890
this came about.

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.140
But for now it's almost better
just to memorize the steps,

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.690
just so you have the confidence
that you know that

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.210
you can calculate an inverse.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:38.050
It's equal to 1 over this number
times this. a times d

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.820
minus b times c.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.410
ad minus bc.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:50.970
And this quantity down here, ad
minus bc, that's called the

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.980
determinant of the matrix A.

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.270
And we're going to
multiply that.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.410
This is just a number.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.390
This is just a scalar
quantity.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.660
And we're going to multiply
that by-- you switch

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.560
the a and the d.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.290
You switch the top left
and the bottom right.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.640
So you're left with d and a.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.980
And you make these two, you make
the bottom left and the

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.910
top right, you make
them negative.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:17.590
So minus c minus b.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.700
And the determinant-- once
again, this is something that

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.610
you're just going to take a
little bit on faith right now.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.620
In future videos, I promise
to give you more tuition.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.500
But it's actually kind of
sophisticated to learn what

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.230
the determinant is.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:29.060
And if you're doing this in your
high school class, you

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.270
kind of just have to know
how to calculate it.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.410
Although I don't like
telling you that.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.700
So what is this?

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.810
This is also call the
determinant of A.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.700
So you might see on an
exam, figure out the

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:38.370
determinant of A.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.120
So let me just tell you that.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.460
And that's denoted by A in
absolute value signs.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.660
And that's equal
to ad minus bc.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.760
So another way of saying this,
this could be 1 over the

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.250
determinant.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.540
So you could write A inverse
is equal to 1 over the

00:07:53.540 --> 00:08:02.740
determinant of A times
d minus b minus c, a.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:03.550
Anyway you look at it.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.810
But let's apply this to a real
problem, and you'll see that

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.100
it's actually not so bad.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:12.700
So let's change letters, just so
you know it doesn't always

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.380
have to be an A.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.526
Let's say I have a matrix B.

00:08:15.526 --> 00:08:20.840
And the matrix B is 3-- I'm
just going to pick random

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:28.720
numbers-- minus 4, 2 minus 5.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.060
Let's calculate B inverse.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.770
So B inverse is going to
be equal to 1 over the

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:35.780
determinant of B.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.020
What's the determinant?

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:41.860
It's 3 times minus 5 minus
2 times minus 4.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:48.270
So 3 times minus 5 is minus
15, minus 2 times minus 4.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.950
2 times minus 4 is minus 8.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.333
We're going to subtract that.

00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:52.583
So it's plus 8.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:06.142
And we're going to multiply
that times what?

00:09:06.142 --> 00:09:11.130
Well, we switched these two
terms. So it's minus 5 and 3.

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.770
And we just make these
two terms negative.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.770
Minus 2 and 4.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.110
4 was minus 4, so now
it becomes 4.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.980
And let's see if we can simplify
this a little bit.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:26.060
So B inverse is equal
to minus 15 plus 8.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.700
That's minus 7.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.340
So this is minus 1/7.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.980
So the determinant of B-- we
could write B's determinant--

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.636
is equal to minus 7.

00:09:35.636 --> 00:09:45.400
So that's minus 1/7 times
minus 5, 4, minus 2, 3.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.800
Which is equal to-- this is just
a scalar, this is just a

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.420
number, so we multiply it times
each of the elements--

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.420
so that is equal to minus,
minus, plus.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.210
That's 5/7.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:00.650
5/7 minus 4/7.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:01.710
Let's see.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:02.960
Positive 2/7.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:06.790
And then minus 3/7.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:11.500
It's a little hairy.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.210
We ended up with fractions
here and things.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.470
But let's confirm that this
really is the inverse

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:17.490
of the matrix B.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:18.730
Let's multiply them out.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.565
So before I do that I have
to create some space.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.690
I don't even need
this anymore.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.940
There you go.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:35.260
OK.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:40.450
So let's confirm that that
times this, or this times

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.870
that, is really equal to
the identity matrix.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:43.940
So let's do that.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.390
So let me switch colors.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:53.520
So B inverse is 5/7,
if I haven't made

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.120
any careless mistakes.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.250
Minus 4/7.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.965
2/7.

00:11:00.965 --> 00:11:04.020
And minus 3/7.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:04.745
That's B inverse.

00:11:04.745 --> 00:11:06.610
And let me multiply that by B.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:09.490
3 minus 4.

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:12.090
2 minus 5.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:16.090
And this is going to be
the product matrix.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.066
I need some space to
do my calculations.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.520
Let me switch colors.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:27.820
I'm going to take this row
times this column.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.880
So 5/7 times 3 is what?

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:41.170
15/7.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:45.000
Plus minus 4/7 times 2.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:54.510
So minus 4/7 times 2 is minus--
let me make sure

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:58.030
that's right-- 5 times
3 is 15/7.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.520
Minus 4-- oh right, right--
4 times 2, so minus 8/7.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.910
Now we're going to multiply this
row times this column.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:16.640
So 5 times minus 4
is minus 20/7.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:25.390
Plus minus 4/7 times minus 5.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:32.760
That is plus 20/7.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.710
My brain is starting to slow
down, having to do matrix

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.360
multiplications with fractions
with negative numbers.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.950
But this is a good exercise
for multiple

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:41.730
parts of the brain.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:42.100
But anyway.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.350
So let's go down and
do this term.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:48.800
So now we're going to multiply
this row times this column.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.680
So 2/7 times 3 is 6/7.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.790
Plus minus 3/7 times 2.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:00.410
So that's minus 6/7.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:01.290
One term left.

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:02.330
Home stretch.

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:06.570
2/7 times minus 4
is minus 8/7.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.730
Plus minus 3/7 times minus 5.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:25.300
So those negatives cancel out,
and we're left with plus 15/7.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.370
And if we simplify,
what do we get?

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:31.500
15/7 minus 8/8 is 7/7.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.310
Well that's just 1.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:35.520
This is 0, clearly.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.260
This is 0.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.680
6/7 minus 6/7 is 0.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:42.430
And then minus 8/7 plus
15/7, that's 7/7.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.660
That's 1 again.

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:44.730
And there you have it.

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:47.150
We've actually managed to
inverse this matrix.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.010
And it was actually harder to
prove that it was the inverse

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.980
by multiplying, just because we
had to do all this fraction

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.850
and negative number math.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.610
But hopefully that
satisfies you.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:13:59.430
And you could try it the other
way around to confirm that if

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.010
you multiply it the other
way, you'd also get

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:02.050
the identity matrix.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.110
But anyway, that is how
you calculate the

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.600
inverse of a 2x2.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.950
And as we'll see in the next
video, calculating by the

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:12.310
inverse of a 3x3 matrix
is even more fun.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.850
See you soon.
