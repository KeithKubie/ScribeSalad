Speaker 1:          00:00          Pocket damage. We were terrified. Jamie, you were telling me about w w what was the rap concert where the girl got on stage and she was saying, yeah, the Kendrick Lamar concert, which uh, so I guess this was a song that happens a lot. You can see lots of videos of the crowds singing all the words, which has a lot of N words in it, including white people in the crowd. Correct. Yeah, lots of, well that's the way. Mainly white. Yeah. So, uh, it has videos of Alabama. Yeah, I'll, I'll pull one up. I was never talking about cops in Alabama. The hangout Fest, right. Little girl up on a stage. She was obviously drunk. I like kind of almost set her up to, to do it. And as soon as she said like two or three times he stopped, it stopped the whole thing. Well, what, what did she say reference to? It's in the song. So she sits on [inaudible], she was doing like karaoke, like a song lyric. I'll pull up the videos and then he turned on her. Oh no, no, no, no. That's not for you. That's only for me. Oh wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Yeah. That's meme having her up. I had a bit from 2009 yeah. My a spike TV special. Hold on here. A woman gets on stage.

Speaker 2:          01:10          You ready? Oh, she's going to do it. Oh my God. She's just, he set her up. Yeah. It's terrible. He's mocking her already. Yeah. Wow. She must be so now we play in this. Get pulled. Jesus Christ. Wait, wait, wait. That's terrible. It's crazy, bro. You have to park. You got a bleak one. Single word. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm stuck. Sorry. His ass get off there. They're all of the thumbs down. Get off. You said the noise and he says that we love, you can't say the noise.

Speaker 1:          02:50          That's mostly it. Meme in hilarious and preposterous times. I mean that

Speaker 3:          03:00          is so strange. That is his song. Yeah. He wrote his song. He wrote the words. She loves him. She loves him. She's at his concert. He gave her the microphone, played the song. She's singing the song that he loves that he wrote. Now audience loves and everybody's like, you did the wrong thing. You made the noise. So wow

Speaker 2:          03:24          man. [inaudible] crowd doing it though. This whole crowd is looks mostly white girls screaming.

Speaker 3:          03:35          Okay, so how's that word? Got a double standard. I don't, this is why I stay at home. Wait a minute. How does that work? So there's a lot of people there. Yeah, you can do it. You can do it if there's a bunch of people there. Yeah, but you can't do it if you're by yourself. No. Onstage by herself in front of those people. You can't do it. But if you're in with them you could do it. Yes. And that was mostly white. That was a lot of white there. And of course in that one, white people were ridiculous. So confused. So confused. I mean, this is a strange time. I was going to say I did this, a spike TV special in 2009 and there was a, do you remember that old commercial with a, the girl, the girl comes home and her dog started talking to her like Lindsey, I really wish you wouldn't smoke pot.

Speaker 3:          04:21          You're not the senior. You smoke pot in a, I miss my friend. I had this whole thing where I was like, I was like, first of all, whatever that chick's on, she's not on pot. Cause if you were on pot, you'd be like, wait a minute, my fucking dog can talk. All right, how long have you been able to talk to God? You my whole fucking life. Your whole life. This is the first shit you said, right? You know, and I went through this whole thing and I called my dog a faggot and I'm this guy. This was like in the beginning of political correctness, right? Cause it was 2009 he, this is a gay guy said to me, he goes, you can't say that word. That's our n****r. That's our word. Right? That's what he said. Right. He literally said, I go, wait a minute. What did you just say?

Speaker 3:          05:07          And he said it again. He said, it's our n****r. We're allowed to say it. You can't say it. I go, that's the gay shit I've ever heard. And he started laughing. I go, that's so crazy. I go, I'm talking to a dog. I'm talking, I'm angry at a dog because I've had this dog my whole life. His first words out of his mouth. I tell you I love you every day and, and what do you say? You say, I wish you wouldn't smoke weed. Fuck you stupid. I smoke weed and I go to work and I pay for your food faggot. That was, that was the joke and he got, he got like, I'm like, these rules are preposterous, isn't it supposed to be about intent of kids and it's supposed to be a bike. I'm supposed to be conveying how I feel and the words are supposed to mirror my thoughts. Right? Like when you have magic that you can't say, and in this case with the N word, it's even crazier because it's like some people could say it, you could say it sometimes. Sometimes you can't say it, it's too heavy. But black people could say it, why people can't. But why people can say it if we're in the crowd and they're yelling it out, but as long as it's an a on the end of it.

Speaker 1:          06:16          Yeah, right, exactly. The ER is what gets you in trouble.

Speaker 3:          06:20          Well look, racism is disgusting. All racism, racism against Chinese people, racism against white people. Racism against every, of course against black people, of course against everyone judging someone on something that they have no control over. That's what it is like you are, well you're born whenever you're born, Irish, German, Italian, African, you're born, it's not you. You are just who you are. Right? So racism is disgusting. But is that, is it racism? When you have that girl on stage and she's singing that song that she loves that you sing, it's your song. Like that's not really racism. No. So when she's singing along and everybody's [inaudible] you racist, you fucking Nazi. Like what are we doing? Right? Cause this is what we're doing here is we're we, we've gone into some ridiculous zone where it's not, it doesn't make any sense cause we know that's not her intent.

Speaker 1:          07:16          No, exactly right. This is the, becomes an intellectual exercise. It becomes like a word game. It's a little puzzle kind of thing that we're doing to trap this person. You could say she's very innocent up there. They all know she's a little drunk. It's kind of like setting someone up to do something. Yeah, it's pretty gross.

Speaker 3:          07:33          Weird. But it's weird that it's so universal. Like that crowd that was probably 20,000 people. No,

Speaker 1:          07:40          I had a weird thing on, uh, you know, I'm, I, I'm, I'm on the show live from here, the prayer old Prairie home companion show and uh, you know, I'm the writer for it and stuff, had right around it and appear on it and stuff. Anyway, uh, I'm very involved with the show. Uh, Chris, who's this bluegrass guy who plays a mandolin, who's a amazing, kindest person you'd ever meet, like super, super sweet, sweet person, like, like Mr. Rogers in a way. Like it's to that level of kindness and he sings everybody's birthdays and stuff and he sings different songs. And uh, as a tribute to everything, he loves all music. He loves everything. He sang a Kendrick Lamar song, he sang a little bit of it, uh, in like, cause it was his birthday that week and he got so much hate online that a white person can't be singing that song. What is the song about? It's a, I don't know, but it wasn't, that wasn't the thing. It was the word. It was that he was, um, what's the thing that you take some cultural appropriation that he's not allowed to sing and meanwhile he's singing bluegrass Indian music. I mean the from all around the world. This is a kind soul celebrating and it

Speaker 3:          08:56          really freaked him out cause he is so nice. He couldn't believe the hate that he got from it that now he's super sensitive about singing that music at all. It's not logical. It's not when you have to put your foot down and you consider the source culturally we have to put our foot down because we're going down this very strange, illogical road where you can just decide what's evil and what's bad and it doesn't have any bearing on the thought or the intent behind it is, look, they went after Bruno Mars. Like get in the, just get the fuck outta here. Yeah. They accused Bruno Mars of cultural appropriation. What culture. He's everything. He's everything. Meanwhile, what is he doing where anybody would accuse him of cultural appropriation. He sings these beautiful fucking songs. Oh, he's a lightless world. He's amazing. Yes. I love that guy. The guy's amazing voice is fantastic and his songs are fun and they're catchy and the, I love listening to them.

Speaker 3:          09:47          I saw him in Vegas in concert. It was just the most uplifting, bright thing. You know what made me happy though is that a bunch of black artists said, fuck you. He's great. Like what was the original charge? Just fucking social justice warriors. We're going after him for cultural appropriation. All these like super progressive, angry fuck heads. We decide culture, whatever, man. It doesn't have to make sense. This is the thing. They're just looking for targets. It doesn't have to make sense. This is not a, it's not like a logical progression. Like, Oh, Bruno Mars is steep. It's not like, Oh, he's stealing from these old blues singers and he's not crediting them. And he's, Oh, come on, white guy from Kentucky. That's not what we're dealing with you. Right? We're dealing with a multiracial guy who sings these beautiful songs that they don't, they're not cultural appropriation.

Speaker 3:          10:35          Even if he was white and yet, no, exactly. It's just a joy of music and music is a mix of everything. It's a mix of all of us of everything that is good. Right. Coming out saying like his style. But if that's the case then here's the case. I'm a fucking huge fan of the black keys. The black keys. Oh a lot of their shit is blues. A lot of that is old blues. Like it sounds so similar to some great old blues. Sure. Is that cultural appropriation? I mean I love them. I mean you saying they should stop doing what I what? I love to hear. No come on. I mean what are we doing? Yeah, that's crazy. But what is, what did you know what the other part of it is? How many people are really complaining about that stuff? It's a very small amount but it's so small but it's enough where your friend got scared.

Speaker 3:          11:21          He did get scared and it literally amounts to probably three tweets. You know what I mean? It's like, but those people, that's the only noise. People aren't saying wow I love that version. Cause they just like it in the normal people. It's these haters that just want to do it and but the people in control of it have to calm him and make him realize we've got your back days wrong. They'll fucking fire him if it gets loud enough. It doesn't have to make any sense. That's where it squirrely too. They fired speaking to Prairie home companion. They fired Garrison Keillor. I know they fired him, removed his name for everything because he hugged a lady and her his hand went down her back and then he apologized, sent her an email. She said it's fine. They went back and forth with it. Didn't do anything else. No history of sexual harassment, sexual assault, no history of anything. Terrible. Years later when all this me too stuff comes out, she comes out with that. Yeah, it was dirty business. Yeah, it was dirty. It's dirty, but it's doesn't, it's not logical. It's like there's this fever feeding frenzy that goes on with these things. It's a mob mentality.

Speaker 1:          12:25          Yeah. It just want to tear people down. They want to tear up. I really believe that you have to in all these situations is consider the source. Like you really have to consider, it's like when the steroid thing went down, there were like people came at Barry bonds harder than everybody else because he had a rap for not being a good guy. He people did not like him regardless of that. So when it happens, people kind of come after him harder than they came after Sammy Sosa. Uh, yes and yeah. And much harder than like Andy Pettitte or you know, these letters. He's a pitcher for the Yankees and it's just like a nice guy and they don't care, you know. But if somebody is a problem, Jose Conseco Jose can say it was a problem cause he ratted everybody out. Oh yeah, that's right. That book called Joost. Yeah. Boy. Everything that can made him persona non grata. Like he just kinda disappeared. He got written off from that book. Yeah. Like people just decided, fuck you. Yeah. That's interesting. Right? It is. It is.

Speaker 3:          13:20          Yeah. Too much of a snitch, I guess. Yeah man. People just didn't respect him after that because there was so many people that were also doing it and he was the one that ratted everybody out and profited off of it. Yeah. There's some, there's some justice, some street justice in that. I just think that there's, we have to be really careful with call, but it's just, there's also an issue that everyone has access to social media and everyone has the ability to complain about things. Yeah. So there's a world, right. So there's a lot of noise. Yeah. You get the real sound like, like there are things that happen that are really bad, and when something happens, it's really bad. Yeah. The Twitter mob and the, all the people that go after these people for something that's legitimately awful. Sure. It makes sense. Yeah. I mean it's, there's, there's justice to it, but there's also like this constant looking for targets.

Speaker 1:          14:16          Yes. That it seems like there, that's kind of like a hobby of some people. Yeah. Like that is the thing.
