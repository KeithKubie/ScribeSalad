00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.330
So we're given the following
equation, that 5 times the

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.860
absolute value of x plus 3
minus 3 is equal to 7.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.020
It's always a little daunting
to see an equation with an

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.310
absolute value sign.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.620
And when you only have one of
them, like this, what I like

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.710
to do is isolate it, and just
kind of think it through from

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:19.290
that point.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.570
So let's try to isolate
the absolute

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.140
value of x plus 3 here.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.250
Let's try to isolate that
part of our equation.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.960
So the first thing we might want
to do is add 3 to both

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.000
sides of the equation.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.270
That'll get rid of this minus 3,
or this negative 3, on the

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.520
left-hand side.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.190
So let's add 3 to both sides
of this equation.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.690
And this'll turn the equation
into-- do it in that same pink

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.270
color --the left-hand side
will still be 5 times the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.810
absolute value of x plus 3.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.280
The minus 3, or the negative
3 plus the 3,

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.440
those will cancel out.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.770
That'll just be 0.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.230
And then that will be equal
to 7 plus 3, which is 10.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.610
Now, we have 5 times the thing
we want to isolate.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.380
The best way to isolate it
completely is to divide both

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.030
sides of this equation by 5.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.800
So if you divide that side
by 5, and then the

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.630
right-hand side by 5.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.390
We divide it by 5 so that these
guys will cancel out.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.050
5 times something divided by
5 is just that something.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.930
So these cancel out.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.810
That's 2.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.590
So we're left with the absolute
value of x plus 3 is

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.860
equal to 10 divided
by 5, which is 2.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.350
So we've simplified the equation
a good bit, now we

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.580
just have to put our thinking
caps on a little bit.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.180
If the absolute value of
something is 2, what does it

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.060
mean that that something is?

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.620
What are the two numbers that,
if I were take it's absolute

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.805
value, I could get 2.

00:01:51.805 --> 00:01:53.450
I'll do a little thing
on the side here.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.740
We know that the absolute value
of 2 is equal to 2.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.160
So maybe this thing
was equal to 2.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.300
So maybe x plus 3
is equal to 2.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.600
If x plus 3 is equal to 2, and
you take its absolute value,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.150
you're going to get 2 again.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.960
But we also know that the
absolute value of negative 2

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.700
is also equal to 2.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.560
So maybe x plus 3 is equal
to negative 2.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.480
Because if x plus 3 is equal to
negative 2, and we take its

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.300
absolute value, then we're
going to get 2 again.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.990
So we could also write or x
plus 3 could be equal to

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.900
negative 2.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.570
That's what I mean
about thinking

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.410
about it a little bit.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.280
Another way to think about it--
I've said this in other

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.500
videos --is absolute value
means distance from 0.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.420
So if we were to draw a number
line here, that is 0, this is

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.420
saying that, whatever this
quantity is inside the

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.550
absolute value sign, its
distance from 0 is 2.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.140
So what numbers are
2 away from 0?

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.690
Well, you have positive 2.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.640
I'll write a positive
there explicitly.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.500
And you also have
a negative 2.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.170
So this thing here could be a
positive 2, or it could be a

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.980
negative 2.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.120
Either way you take the absolute
value of a positive 2

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.020
or a negative 2, you're
going to get a 2.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.980
So let's solve these.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.680
So over here we can subtract
3 from both

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.210
sides of this equation.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.670
So if you subtract 3 from both
sides, you get-- The left-hand

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.250
side, you're just
left with an x.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.650
These 3's cancel out.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.105
That's the whole point
of subtracting the 3.

00:03:31.105 --> 00:03:36.060
x will be equal to 2 minus
3 is negative 1.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.580
So that is one solution to our
absolute value equation.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.560
And what's our other solution?

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.450
Well here, once again, let's
subtract 3 from both sides.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.540
So you subtract 3
from both sides.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.520
The left-hand side just
becomes an x.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.200
The right-hand side, negative
2 minus 3 is negative 5.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.000
So this is our other solution.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.570
And let's verify that
they both work.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.640
So if x is equal to negative
1, what does

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.370
this equation become?

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.320
We have 5 times the absolute
value of negative 1

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.060
plus 3 minus 3.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.790
And if this really is a
solution, then this should be

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.600
equal to positive 7.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.899
So let's see.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:26.700
This is 5 times negative
1 plus 3 is 2.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.510
So it's 5 times the absolute
value of 2 minus 3.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.920
The absolute value
of 2 is just 2.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.670
So this is 5 times 2 minus 3.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:43.740
5 times 2 is 10 minus 3, which
is, indeed, equal to 7.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.030
So this is definitely
a solution.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.110
Let's try the other one out.
x is equal to negative 5.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.320
Running out of some real estate,
but I could clear some

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.090
up right here.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.570
If x is equal to negative
5, same drill.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:03.900
5 times the absolute value of
negative 5 plus 3 minus 3.

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.300
This again should
be equal to 7.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.480
Negative 5 plus 3
is negative 2.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.110
Since there's 5 times the
absolute value of negative 2

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.970
minus 3, the absolute value of
negative 2 is positive 2.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:24.840
So this is 5 times 2 minus 3,
which is 10 minus 3, which is

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.110
again equal to 7.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.580
And notice, in this situation,
the thing in the absolute

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.260
value sign became a negative 2,
because we said, oh, x plus

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.960
3 could be equal
to negative 2.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.940
In the magenta situation, the
thing in the absolute value

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.690
sign was positive 2, because
this was a situation where we

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.760
assumed that the thing in the
absolute value sign was a

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.950
positive 2.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.910
Now if we were to graph these
solutions on the number line,

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.380
if we were to graph the two
solutions on a number line--

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.580
I'll draw a new number
line here.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.510
Let me draw a new number
line, just like that.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.910
Both of these are less than
0, so I'll put 0 all

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:01.520
the way over here.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.050
Maybe 0, 1, 2.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.820
Let's go negative, negative
1, negative 2, negative 3,

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.320
negative 4, negative
5, negative 6.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.100
This solution right here-- x
is equal to negative 1 --we

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.450
could plot on the number
line right over there.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.650
And then the other solution-- x
is equal to negative 5 --we

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.430
can plot it right over there.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.980
Hopefully you found
that enjoyable.
