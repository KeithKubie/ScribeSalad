00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.520
So what happens, exactly, within an iteration? In

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.680
almost every iteration, developers perform the following activities.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.830
So they identify which pieces of functionality this

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.450
iteration will develop, will implement. After doing that, they

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.240
will create a design, for the considered use

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.640
cases, and they will do that guided by the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.334
chosen architecture. So the set of use cases

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:25.666
plus the architectural guidelines will result in a design

00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:29.035
for the selected use cases. Once the design is defined,

00:00:29.035 --> 00:00:32.060
then the developers will implement the design, which will result

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.430
in a set of software components. They will then verify

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.992
the components against the use cases to make sure that the

00:00:38.992 --> 00:00:41.740
components satisfy the use cases, they suitably realize the use

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.995
cases. And they will do that through testing or some

00:00:43.995 --> 00:00:47.730
other verification and validation activity. Finally, after verifying that the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.320
code actually implements the use cases, they will release a product,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.840
which also represent the end of the iteration. And notice that

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.370
what I put here is an icon for the world,

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.330
in double quotes. Because in many cases the release will be

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.050
just an internal release or maybe a release that will just

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.813
go to some of the stakeholders so that they can provide

00:01:04.813 --> 00:01:07.040
feedback on that. Okay. So it doesn't have to be an

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.080
external release. It doesn't have to be a release to the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.270
world. But it is, nevertheless, a release of a software product. .
