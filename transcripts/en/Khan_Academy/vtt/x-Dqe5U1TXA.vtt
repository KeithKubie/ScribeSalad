00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:08.850
What is the place value
of 3 in 654.213?

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.200
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.110
And to do that, let me rewrite
the number, and I'll write

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.620
each digit in a different
color.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:31.760
So we have 654 point-- we get
the decimal point-- 213.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.610
Now we're pretty familiar, I
think, with what goes on to

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.920
the left of the decimal point.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.670
We know that this right here--
let me do this in a neutral

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.590
color-- is the hundreds place,
or we could view that as 10 to

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.730
the second.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.620
Let me write that a little
bit bigger down here.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.590
So this right here that is the
hundreds place, or you could

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.800
view that as the 10 to the
second's place, which is the

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.350
same thing as hundred.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.100
This right here is the tens
place, which is the same thing

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.030
as 10 to the first. This right
here is the ones place, which

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.190
is the same thing as
10 to the zero.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.440
Then if you go one place to
the right of the decimal

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.200
point, this represents tenths.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:25.910
This represents tenths, or we
could view it as 10 to the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.170
negative one.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.220
Then, if we go to this magenta,
if we go two places

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.670
to the right, this represents
hundredths, or 10 to the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.500
negative two.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.060
And then finally, this 3
represents thousandths.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.870
This represents thousandths, or
10 to the negative three.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.780
Now, just to answer the question
what is the place

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.970
value of 3 in 654.213?

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.520
The place value is
thousandths.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.010
That would essentially answer
their question.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.650
But to make sure that we really
understand what this

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.810
means, I'm going to rewrite
this number.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.840
We can rewrite this
number as 600.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.800
We have 6 hundreds plus 5 tens,
or you could say plus 50

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:48.630
plus 4 ones plus 2/10, plus
1/100, plus 3/1,000.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.380
Or we could write this, just
to really make sure we

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.960
understand what we're talking
about when we mean place

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:02.170
value, we can rewrite this
number as 6 times 100, plus 5

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:10.020
times 10, plus 4 times 1-- I
keep doing that in the wrong

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:28.190
color-- plus 2 times 1/10, plus
1 times 1/100, and then

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.940
finally, plus 3 times 1/1,000.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.540
So hopefully, when you write it
out like this, it gives you

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.630
a sense of what it means
we say place value.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.350
The 6, three digits to the left
of the decimal, is in the

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.110
hundreds place, so it represents
6 hundreds.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.190
This represents 5 tens because
it's in the tens place.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.820
This represents 4 ones.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.640
You go to the thousandths
place, this 3 literally

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.686
represents three
one-thousandths.
