my co-author our peony and I noticed

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090
my co-author our peony and I noticed
 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.990
my co-author our peony and I noticed
what we thought was a pattern that every

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000
what we thought was a pattern that every
 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.999
what we thought was a pattern that every
time there was some great disaster or

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:13.009
time there was some great disaster or
 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.220
time there was some great disaster or
catastrophe there was usually an

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230
catastrophe there was usually an
 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.650
catastrophe there was usually an
investigation after the fact what went

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660
investigation after the fact what went
 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.530
investigation after the fact what went
wrong and that investigation almost

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:20.540
wrong and that investigation almost
 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.420
wrong and that investigation almost
always revealed that there was some

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430
always revealed that there was some
 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.470
always revealed that there was some
person before the disaster occurred who

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480
person before the disaster occurred who
 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.170
person before the disaster occurred who
said it was going to occur that person

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180
said it was going to occur that person
 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.350
said it was going to occur that person
was always an expert they always had

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360
was always an expert they always had
 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.389
was always an expert they always had
data that was telling them that there

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399
data that was telling them that there
 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.370
data that was telling them that there
was going to be something happening but

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380
was going to be something happening but
 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.160
was going to be something happening but
that person was an outlier they were an

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170
that person was an outlier they were an
 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.680
that person was an outlier they were an
expert but the other experts disagreed

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690
expert but the other experts disagreed
 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.190
expert but the other experts disagreed
and we wondered is this a phenomenon

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200
and we wondered is this a phenomenon
 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.830
and we wondered is this a phenomenon
that occurs with some regularity because

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840
that occurs with some regularity because
 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.500
that occurs with some regularity because
if there are people who can see

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510
if there are people who can see
 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.680
if there are people who can see
disasters coming before the rest of us

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690
disasters coming before the rest of us
 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.260
disasters coming before the rest of us
if we could find them before the

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270
if we could find them before the
 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.810
if we could find them before the
disaster that would be enormous ly

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820
disaster that would be enormous ly
 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.670
disaster that would be enormous ly
valuable if we could find them and

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680
valuable if we could find them and
 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.010
valuable if we could find them and
listen to them and pay attention if we

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020
listen to them and pay attention if we
 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.030
listen to them and pay attention if we
could tell the difference between

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040
could tell the difference between
 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.460
could tell the difference between
Chicken Little and the Cassandra

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470
Chicken Little and the Cassandra
 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.480
Chicken Little and the Cassandra
Cassandra

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490
Cassandra
 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.110
Cassandra
in Greek mythology was a woman cursed by

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:11.120
in Greek mythology was a woman cursed by
 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.380
in Greek mythology was a woman cursed by
the gods the curse was that she could

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390
the gods the curse was that she could
 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.649
the gods the curse was that she could
accurately see the future doesn't sound

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659
accurately see the future doesn't sound
 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.440
accurately see the future doesn't sound
so bad until you realize the second part

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450
so bad until you realize the second part
 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.590
so bad until you realize the second part
of the curse which was no one would ever

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600
of the curse which was no one would ever
 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.380
of the curse which was no one would ever
believe her and because she could see

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390
believe her and because she could see
 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.330
believe her and because she could see
the future and no one was paying

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340
the future and no one was paying
 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.640
the future and no one was paying
attention to her she went mad

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650
attention to her she went mad
 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.940
attention to her she went mad
so the Cassandra's that we looked for

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950
so the Cassandra's that we looked for
 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.120
so the Cassandra's that we looked for
were people who accurately predicted

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130
were people who accurately predicted
 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.210
were people who accurately predicted
some future disaster not people who woke

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220
some future disaster not people who woke
 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.380
some future disaster not people who woke
up in the middle of the night with the

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390
up in the middle of the night with the
 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.020
up in the middle of the night with the
premonition not people who predicted all

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030
premonition not people who predicted all
 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.590
premonition not people who predicted all
the time and once in a while get right

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600
the time and once in a while get right
 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.560
the time and once in a while get right
but people who saw a specific thing

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570
but people who saw a specific thing
 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.950
but people who saw a specific thing
coming people who had what we call

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960
coming people who had what we call
 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.380
coming people who had what we call
Sentinel intelligence the ability to see

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390
Sentinel intelligence the ability to see
 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.440
Sentinel intelligence the ability to see
something over the hill before other

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450
something over the hill before other
 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.440
something over the hill before other
people see it and we found that pattern

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450
people see it and we found that pattern
 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.020
people see it and we found that pattern
and in the first half of the book we go

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030
and in the first half of the book we go
 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.840
and in the first half of the book we go
through seven case studies of past

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850
through seven case studies of past
 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.379
through seven case studies of past
events where we found Cassandra's were

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:11.389
events where we found Cassandra's were
 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.170
events where we found Cassandra's were
right and we tried to learn something

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180
right and we tried to learn something
 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.059
right and we tried to learn something
about those seven Cassandra's from

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069
about those seven Cassandra's from
 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.819
about those seven Cassandra's from
passed in the second half of the book we

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829
passed in the second half of the book we
 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:21.940
passed in the second half of the book we
look at seven people today who might be

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950
look at seven people today who might be
 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.129
look at seven people today who might be
Cassandra's who are predicting things

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:24.139
Cassandra's who are predicting things
 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:27.250
Cassandra's who are predicting things
that might happen in the future so we

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260
that might happen in the future so we
 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.360
that might happen in the future so we
talk about a failed warning as a

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370
talk about a failed warning as a
 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.030
talk about a failed warning as a
Cassandra event and we tried to ask

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040
Cassandra event and we tried to ask
 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.429
Cassandra event and we tried to ask
ourselves in the book why did this

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439
ourselves in the book why did this
 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.160
ourselves in the book why did this
Cassandra event happen we find that

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170
Cassandra event happen we find that
 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.550
Cassandra event happen we find that
there are four overall factors there is

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560
there are four overall factors there is
 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.330
there are four overall factors there is
the quality of the Cassandra herself or

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340
the quality of the Cassandra herself or
 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.629
the quality of the Cassandra herself or
himself there were there are several

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:49.639
himself there were there are several
 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.209
himself there were there are several
things about that person that make them

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:52.219
things about that person that make them
 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:54.520
things about that person that make them
a Cassandra or not and then there's the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530
a Cassandra or not and then there's the
 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.770
a Cassandra or not and then there's the
audience a decision-maker

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780
audience a decision-maker
 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.390
audience a decision-maker
a king a president CEO there are

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400
a king a president CEO there are
 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.580
a king a president CEO there are
qualities about them that contribute to

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590
qualities about them that contribute to
 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.110
qualities about them that contribute to
an event becoming a Cassandra event then

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120
an event becoming a Cassandra event then
 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.780
an event becoming a Cassandra event then
there's the issue itself and the

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790
there's the issue itself and the
 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.259
there's the issue itself and the
qualities about the issue that make a

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269
qualities about the issue that make a
 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.839
qualities about the issue that make a
warning relevant to it hard for people

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849
warning relevant to it hard for people
 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.149
warning relevant to it hard for people
to accept and the last is the critics

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159
to accept and the last is the critics

the critics of the person giving the
 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.839
the critics of the person giving the
warning the critics of the Cassandra

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849
warning the critics of the Cassandra
 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.999
warning the critics of the Cassandra
what do they say and what do they not

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:28.009
what do they say and what do they not
 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:32.679
what do they say and what do they not
say and in those four column heading the

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:32.689
say and in those four column heading the
 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.319
say and in those four column heading the
Cassandra the decision-maker

Cassandra the decision-maker
 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.289
Cassandra the decision-maker
the issue itself and the critics under

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299
the issue itself and the critics under
 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.420
the issue itself and the critics under
each of them there are several different

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430
each of them there are several different
 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.849
each of them there are several different
criteria applying that template to a

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859
criteria applying that template to a
 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.619
criteria applying that template to a
potential Cassandra event we think we

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629
potential Cassandra event we think we
 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.059
potential Cassandra event we think we
can begin to tell who's right and who's

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069
can begin to tell who's right and who's
 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.330
can begin to tell who's right and who's

so in the book we look at a number of

so in the book we look at a number of
 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:56.819
so in the book we look at a number of
different fields we look at biology

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829
different fields we look at biology
