00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:02.080
problems because I think when I was
 

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.390
problems because I think when I was
watching it I was pointing it I was like

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:03.400
watching it I was pointing it I was like
 

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:05.880
watching it I was pointing it I was like
how can these computer programs miss

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:05.890
how can these computer programs miss
 

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:09.329
how can these computer programs miss
Neos yeah the cubical wall and I'm like

00:16:09.329 --> 00:16:09.339
Neos yeah the cubical wall and I'm like
 

00:16:09.339 --> 00:16:14.160
Neos yeah the cubical wall and I'm like
they're programs in this but how do you

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:14.170
they're programs in this but how do you
 

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:16.590
they're programs in this but how do you
do that like if your computer program

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:16.600
do that like if your computer program
 

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:18.360
do that like if your computer program
shouldn't you just have a system where

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:18.370
shouldn't you just have a system where
 

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:19.440
shouldn't you just have a system where
you're just like well they're plugged

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:19.450
you're just like well they're plugged
 

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.870
you're just like well they're plugged
into the matrix why do you even need to

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:21.880
into the matrix why do you even need to
 

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.820
into the matrix why do you even need to
physically find this guy if you can

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:23.830
physically find this guy if you can
 

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.740
physically find this guy if you can
rewrite the program because she says oh

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:25.750
rewrite the program because she says oh
 

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.480
rewrite the program because she says oh
you know when you see glitches and this

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:27.490
you know when you see glitches and this
 

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:29.190
you know when you see glitches and this
man you think it's a ghost that's really

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:29.200
man you think it's a ghost that's really
 

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.690
man you think it's a ghost that's really
the matrix rewriting itself in doing

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:30.700
the matrix rewriting itself in doing
 

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.730
the matrix rewriting itself in doing
that then why don't you just pull the

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:32.740
that then why don't you just pull the
 

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.430
that then why don't you just pull the
plug on neo rewrite the program so we

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440
plug on neo rewrite the program so we
 

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.320
plug on neo rewrite the program so we
never existed within the matrix and

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:37.330
never existed within the matrix and
 

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.300
never existed within the matrix and
everybody else goes on like not giving a

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:39.310
everybody else goes on like not giving a
 

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:40.829
everybody else goes on like not giving a
shit well and this is kind of a problem

00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:40.839
shit well and this is kind of a problem
 

00:16:40.839 --> 00:16:42.240
shit well and this is kind of a problem
with it - is that cuz a lot of people

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:42.250
with it - is that cuz a lot of people
 

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:43.980
with it - is that cuz a lot of people
say well your nitpick you read too much

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:43.990
say well your nitpick you read too much
 

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.990

how come you didn't question this in you

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.000
how come you didn't question this in you
 

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.340
how come you didn't question this in you
know stuff like this in the dark night

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:47.350
know stuff like this in the dark night
 

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:48.990
know stuff like this in the dark night
or something land which first of all I

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:49.000
or something land which first of all I
 

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.810

didn't ruin anything for me because the

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:53.800
didn't ruin anything for me because the
 

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.190
didn't ruin anything for me because the
emotional focus was always there and I

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:56.200
emotional focus was always there and I
 

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.050
emotional focus was always there and I
think even people that like the matrix

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:58.060
think even people that like the matrix
 

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.480
think even people that like the matrix
are like know emotionally there's

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:00.490
are like know emotionally there's
 

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:01.560
are like know emotionally there's
nothing there

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:01.570
nothing there
 

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:03.510
nothing there

this computer program from day one I
 

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.920
this computer program from day one I
always looked at it like this of course

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:38.930
always looked at it like this of course
 

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.960
always looked at it like this of course
they would talk like that of course they

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:40.970
they would talk like that of course they
 

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.910
they would talk like that of course they
would have no emotion they've all been

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.770
much in the matrix cuz I thought there
was more of a balance and this may just

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:25.780
was more of a balance and this may just
 

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.020
was more of a balance and this may just
be because the sequels just so over did

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:28.030
be because the sequels just so over did

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:38.230
matrix is both holds up a little better
 

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:41.490
matrix is both holds up a little better
but in my opinion a little worse because

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:41.500
but in my opinion a little worse because

computer like and then you have these
 

00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:43.230
computer like and then you have these
computer programs who want to somehow

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:43.240
computer programs who want to somehow
 

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.659

soullessness and they have personality
and I guess that's where I thought it

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:50.530
and I guess that's where I thought it
 

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:52.169
and I guess that's where I thought it
was fine in the first movie because you

00:23:52.169 --> 00:23:52.179
was fine in the first movie because you
 

00:23:52.179 --> 00:23:54.180
was fine in the first movie because you
could read into that but then in the

could read into that but then in the
sequels like they never played it up

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:55.900
sequels like they never played it up
 

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.020

you got throwing all these ideas and

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:07.270
you got throwing all these ideas and
 

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.480
you got throwing all these ideas and
such which I mean it's I think we both

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:09.490
such which I mean it's I think we both
 

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.340
such which I mean it's I think we both
agree the film the first film has a lot

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:11.350
agree the film the first film has a lot
 

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:12.150
agree the film the first film has a lot

the matrix was it was bringing up

the matrix was it was bringing up
questions but it was trying to answer

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:47.630
questions but it was trying to answer
 

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:50.050

trying to like it brings a question but
then it's like maybe it's in this

00:27:59.380 --> 00:27:59.390
then it's like maybe it's in this
 

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:00.850
then it's like maybe it's in this

here like really over here like really
over we're not saying the answer when I

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:04.520
over we're not saying the answer when I
 

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.160
over we're not saying the answer when I
show you the answer but if you maybe

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:06.170
show you the answer but if you maybe
 

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:09.460
show you the answer but if you maybe
over there you know it's like alleged as

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:09.470
over there you know it's like alleged as
 

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:11.680

00:41:30.559 --> 00:41:32.109
boring whenever they were outside the
matrix see me is that the one is

00:41:32.109 --> 00:41:32.119
matrix see me is that the one is
 

00:41:32.119 --> 00:41:33.010
matrix see me is that the one is
incredibly boring

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:33.020
incredibly boring
 

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.450
incredibly boring
yeah but whenever they were outside the

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:34.460
yeah but whenever they were outside the
 

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:36.190
yeah but whenever they were outside the
matrix I could have cared less whenever

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:36.200
matrix I could have cared less whenever
 

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.650
matrix I could have cared less whenever
they're in the matrix and that goes for

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:38.660
they're in the matrix and that goes for
 

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.120
they're in the matrix and that goes for
the first movie the best scenes in the

first movie are when they're in the
matrix so that's where all the fun is

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:43.700
matrix so that's where all the fun is
 

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:47.049
matrix so that's where all the fun is
yeah so yeah it's kind of our real
