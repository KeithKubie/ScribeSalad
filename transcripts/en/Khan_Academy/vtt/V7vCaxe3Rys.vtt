00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.320
We're on problem 91.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.590
By what percent did the median
household-- so median is

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.600
middle-- by what percent did the
median household income in

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.540
country Y decrease from
1970 to 1980?

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.790
So they want a percentage.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.350
All right.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.430
Statement number one tells us in
1970, the median household

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.270
income in country Y was 2/3
of the median household

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.190
income in country X.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.885
So let's write Y in 1970-- let's
just write '70, because

00:00:42.885 --> 00:00:44.950
the 19 is redundant.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.950
The median income in country Y
in 1970 is equal to 2/3 of the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.150
median income of country
X in 1970.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.250
That's what statement
one tells us.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.180
But one again, we know nothing
still about what happened in

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.310
1980 in country Y.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.390
So we still can't answer
the question.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.390
Statement number two.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:23.050
In 1980, the median household
income in country Y was 1/2

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.000
the median household income
in country X in 1980.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.930
Now, you might be tempted to
say, oh, two linear equations

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.650
and two unknowns, maybe I can
solve for it, et cetera.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.020
But no.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.640
There's actually two
linear equations in

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.800
four unknowns, right?

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.250
Y in 1970 is different
than Y in 1980.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.310
And X in 1970 is different
than X in 1980.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.910
So there's actually
four variables.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:48.840
But you say, oh no, no.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.860
But we don't need to figure out
all the variables, we just

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.160
need to figure out the
percent decline.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.400
Right?

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.300
They just say by what percent
did the median household

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.350
income in country Y decrease
from 1970 to 1980?

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:12.790
So essentially if we could
figure out this, Y80 over Y70,

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.830
we'll know what the percent
decline was.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:15.380
Right?

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.830
If this number is 0.8, then
it would be a 20% decline.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.950
If this number was 0.5, then
it would be a 50% decline.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.140
So whatever this number is,
that's essentially 1 minus

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.030
that is the percent decline.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.410
So maybe we just have
to figure out this.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.720
But look.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.790
I can prove to you
mathematically that we still

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.210
can't figure it out
without this.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:39.460
Because Y80 divided by Y70,
that's equal to 2/3X-- oh no,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.060
sorry, Y80.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:51.570
So Y80, that's 1/2X in 1980
divided by 2/3X in 1970.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.890
Right?

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:52.350
And then let's see.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.360
If we could take this 3/2
up, we get, let's

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.080
see-- divide by 1/3.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.870
3 becomes 3/2.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.250
So it becomes 3/4X80 over X70.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.290
They never told us what the
median household income in

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.560
country X was in any year.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.450
So we still can't solve
this problem.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.650
So there's not enough
information given.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.610
Next problem, 92.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.140
A certain group of car
dealerships agreed to donate x

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.810
dollars to a Red Cross chapter
for each car sold during a

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.970
30-day period.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.875
What was the total amount that
was expected to be donated?

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.880
So the total amount--
let's see.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.930
Donation is going to be equal
to x dollars times

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.500
the number of cars.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.720
And this is what we need
to figure out.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.640
We need to figure out what the
donations are equal to, or the

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.170
expected donations.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.810
It says a total of 500 cars
were expected to be sold.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.150
So it's essentially telling
us that C is equal to 500.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.090
We still can't figure out what D
is because we don't know how

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.330
many dollars are we getting
for each car.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.720
So that is not enough
information by itself.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.390
Statement two.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.470
60 more cars were sold
than expected.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.410
So the total amount actually
donated was $28,000.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.120
Interesting.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:29.260
So essentially it's saying that
C plus-- so if you had an

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.530
extra 60 cars than
expected, right?

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.440
500 were expected to be sold.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.120
Actually we could just say 500
were expected to be sold.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.245
60 more cars were sold
than expected.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.950
So this is the actual number
that were sold.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.620
And then that times the
amount donated per

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.380
car is equal to $28,000.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.760
Well, now we do have enough
information to figure out--

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.580
well, let's think about it.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.950
We have enough information
from this to

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.770
figure out x, right?

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.220
Well, we definitely have enough
information now to

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.510
figure out x if we use
statement number one.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.510
I just want to be careful to
make sure that we can't solve

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.250
this just with statement
number two.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:21.550
If I just said 560x is equal to
$28,000, then you get x is

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.850
equal to 28,000 over 560.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.720
So then the amount that was
expected to be donated would

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:36.650
be 28,000 over 560-- that's
what x is, whatever that

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.090
number is-- times the number
of cars that were

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.550
expected to be sold.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.380
Times 500.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.450
And actually, yeah, you have to
have statement one there,

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.910
because statement two-- 60
more cars were sold.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:50.880
Actually, let me think
about that.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.320
So both combined, when I use
both of the information, it

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.130
definitely works.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.780
So let me see if I can figure
it out just using

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.870
statement two alone.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.710
I don't think I can, but I have
a nagging feeling that

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.510
they may be giving more
information than I'm-- so let

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.900
me say that the cars
expected is C.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.940
So this is what statement two
actually is telling us.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.740
I assumed the 500, which
I shouldn't have done.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.480
So statement two is actually
telling, when I have 60 more

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.120
than the cars expected
to be sold

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.840
times x, I raised $28,000.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.230
Right.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.160
This alone is not-- you don't
know what x or C is.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.310
Because at the end of the
day you need to know

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.910
what x times C is.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.510
x times C is our goal.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:43.700
So if you distributed this out,
you get xC plus 60x is

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.890
equal to $28,000.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:53.270
And you get xC is equal
to 28,000 minus 60x.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.830
So this is as much information
as you can glean just from

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:56.800
statement number two.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.910
So that alone is not enough.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.750
If you could figure out what
x is, you're done.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.110
You actually don't need
to know the expected

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.100
number of cars sold.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.350
You would just know.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.800
Well actually, that's true
with statement one.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.220
So you need both of
these statements

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.230
to solve the problem.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.120
Anyway, as you can see,
I haven't done

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.970
these problems before.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.420
So sometimes I'm not sure.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.300
And sometimes I might
even get them wrong.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.100
Problem 93.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.660
While driving on the expressway,
did Robin ever

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.000
exceed the 55 mile an
hour speed limit?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.230
Well, who knows?

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.430
Statement one.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:36.190
Robin drove 100 miles.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.250
Well, that doesn't tell me
whether she ever went more

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.830
than-- I'm assuming
it's a she.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.960
I guess it's an androgynous
sounding name.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.800
That still doesn't tell
me whether she

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.640
went over 100 miles.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.700
Two.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.690
Robin drove for 2 hours
on the expressway.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.320
So time is equal to 2 hours.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.560
So each of these independently
give me no information about

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.690
how fast she went.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.790
But if I use both of
them, I can figure

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.480
out her average speed.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.990
I can say, well, she went
100 miles in 2 hours.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:11.690
Average speed is equal
to 50 miles per hour.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.940
Now, the question is,
did Robin ever

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.090
exceed the speed limit?

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:16.780
Well, I don't know.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.500
It's completely possible
that she just went up

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.590
to 50 miles an hour.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:25.120
Well, we don't know how fast
her car accelerates.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.250
She might just gone-- she
accelerated really fast, got

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.600
to 55, stayed there or went down
a little bit and ended up

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.570
averaging at 55.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:34.760
She's never exceeded it.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.650
But she could have easily gone
80 miles an hour at some

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.360
point, and then slowed
down and taken a

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.480
break, and had a picnic.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.500
We don't know.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.080
So this by itself is not enough
information to figure

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.360
out if she ever exceeded
the speed limit.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.680
If her average speed was 56
miles per hour, then we'd know

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.640
that she had to exceed
the speed limit.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:58.030
Because, well, we can assume
that at some some point she

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.845
was going at least 56
miles per hour.

00:08:59.845 --> 00:09:02.180
And especially if we can assume
that she started at a

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.250
standstill, because then you'd
have to go even faster than

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.850
the average to make up for the
time that you're going slower.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.370
But anyway, there's not enough
information here to figure it

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:14.760
out, just knowing that her
average speed was 50.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.010
Next problem.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.500
94.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.740
In Jefferson School, 300
students study French or

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:28.010
Spanish or both.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:28.250
OK.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:29.960
This sounds like
a Venn Diagram.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.800
French or Spanish or both.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.222
So this is French,
this is Spanish.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:43.490
And this right here is both,
in the intersection.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.080
If 100 of these students do not
study French-- OK, they

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.710
study French or Spanish
or both.

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.940
There's not an option
to do neither.

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.160
If 100 of these students do not
study French, how many of

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.950
these students study both
French and Spanish?

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.090
So when they tell us that 100 of
these students do not study

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:03.220
French, that tells us that this
area-- let me color it in

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:08.550
a suitably garish color.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.320
Oh, no.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.570
That's not what I want to do.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:19.220
That tells us that this area
right here is 100.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.160
So essentially, the people who
are studying Spanish but not

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.550
French is 100.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.050
Right?

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.030
And they're asking, how many of
these students study both

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:28.190
French and Spanish?

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.030
So they essentially want to
know the intersection of

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.150
French and Spanish.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.820
That purple area is what
the question asks.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.070
So let's explore
the statements.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:43.210
Statement number one tells us,
of the 300 students, 60 do not

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:44.070
study Spanish.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:48.350
60 no Spanish.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:52.750
So that's essentially telling
us this area.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.780
Not this, just this.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.620
So that tells us how many
study French only.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.250
That's 60.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.560
It still doesn't help us to
know the intersection.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:09.260
Statement number two says, a
total of 240 of the students

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.510
study Spanish.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.140
Well, I think this alone is
enough information, right?

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.720
Because they're telling us that
this purple area plus

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.690
this yellow area is
equal to 240.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:26.940
We want to figure out the
purple area, right?

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.490
So the total number of people
who study Spanish-- it's the

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.010
people who study French and
Spanish, which is this purple

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:36.520
area-- plus the people who only
study Spanish, which they

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.480
gave us in the problem
was 100.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.090
And then statement number
two says that

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:42.400
that is equal to 240.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.340
So the people who study French
and Spanish has to be the

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:48.830
purple area, which is 240
minus 100, which is 140.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:50.290
Which we don't have to figure
out the number, we just have

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:54.300
to know that two gives us enough
information, by itself,

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.740
to solve the problem.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:01.360
And we don't even need
statement number one.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.300
and I'm out of time.

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.000
See you in the next video.
