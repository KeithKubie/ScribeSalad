00:00:00.765 --> 00:00:01.830
Thanks for coming back.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.204
Now you might be
asking yourself,

00:00:03.204 --> 00:00:05.160
why are we talking
about security again?

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.870
I mean, we've already talked
about TLS and its use in HTTPS.

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:10.713
HTTPS as covers many
angles of attack

00:00:10.714 --> 00:00:12.630
for things like eavesdropping
on your traffic,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.130
or just impersonating the
web server as a whole.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.370
However, the most secure
front door in the world

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.019
will not be worth
anything if there's

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.789
a letter to the
first floor window.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.769
The letter being your web app.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.500
HTTP contains some very
subtle security risks.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.589
On top of that, the history
and backwards compatibility

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.960
of the HTTP protocol
carries a lot of baggage

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.689
from a time where security
wasn't as big of a topic

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:35.149
as it is now.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:36.689
In this lesson, we
are going to learn

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:39.064
how certain design choices
could have allowed an attacker

00:00:39.064 --> 00:00:41.460
to steal sensitive data, and
how you as a web developer

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.509
can protect you web app
against such attacks.
