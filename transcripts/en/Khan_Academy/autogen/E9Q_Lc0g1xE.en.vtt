00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.100
 In the last video we achieved a lot 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.760
 Understanding how vector functions work 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.340
 or the position of a vector function, which 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.460
 is in some sense a substitution of the traditional one 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.110
 parameterization when describing curves 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.050
 And what I want to do in this video is to give a little more 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.910
 a sense of what it takes to get a derivative of 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.730
 a vector function. 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.190
 In this case, this will be in relation to the parameter t 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.510
 So, let me draw a new coordinate system here. 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.580
 Let us say that we have the vector function r (t) 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.450
 and it is no different than the one I did in the previous video. 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.830
 r (t) = X (t) .i + Y (t) .j 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.460
 If we do this in 3 dimensions, then we will add z (t) .k 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.510
 but let us keep things relatively simple and let them 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.950
 let's say this describes the curve, and let's say the curve 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.630
 with which we work t is between a and b and this curve 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.870
 will look like something like that, let me do my best to draw 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.600
 curve. I will draw some approximate curve here, and so on 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.900
 let's say the curve looks like this. 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.890
 It is when t = a, and it starts to 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.750
 moves in that direction. 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.620
 This is when t = b - right here, it is t = a 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.790
 and right here will be x (a), and here is y (a) 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.730
 and analogously here above is x (b) and 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.240
 this is y (b) here. 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.240
 - 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.150
 In the previous video we see that the endpoints of these 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.720
 radius vectors are what describes the curve trays 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.400
 So, in the previous video we saw that r from a 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.300
 describes this point here 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.270
 I do not want to go back to that in detail 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.800
 I now want to think about what the difference is 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.930
 between 2 points? 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.410
 Let me take a random point here 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.760
 Somehow by accident 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.780
 Let's call this r of t 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.197
 In fact, I will take another point, 

00:02:08.197 --> 00:02:10.100
 because I want to be a little clearer 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.370
 I will change with another color - let's say this here 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.080
 is r at some point t 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.980
 t is here 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.410
 and this is r of t 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.050
 This will be a positive value to us 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.950
 Thus, this is our specific point t 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.080
 Now let's say we increase t 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.560
 with little 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.650
 with h 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.250
 Let's say r from t plus h ... well, if we look at it 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.430
 the parameter t as time, we moved forward in time 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.310
 and our little particle has moved 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.180
 a little 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.650
 And let's say we're here 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:52.530
 This here in yellow is r of t plus h 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.360
 Just a slightly higher value of h 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.040
 One question we can ask now is: how much 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.650
 is fast changing f in terms of t? 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.380
 First we have to say: what is it 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.550
 the difference between this is this? 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.010
 I want to imagine this 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.880
 If we take r, the radius vector we get 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.080
 by calculating the radius at t plus h; from this 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.590
 I will pull r from t 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.580
 - 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.690
 And what do we get? 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.730
 Here you can negotiate algebra with vectors, but 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.130
 we will get this vector 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.210
 Let me take a nice, bright color 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.820
 We will get this vector here 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.320
 We will get this vector here 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.010
 So, this purple vector here, let's draw it, 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.080
 is the vector r of t 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.120
 plus h minus r of t 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.110
 And this should be logical for you because when 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.050
 we collect vectors, heads go to tails 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:04.060
 The other option is to write this as r from t plus 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.490
 this here, plus r of t plus h minus r of t 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.630
 Here's what happens when we collect vectors, let's 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.180
 clarify, I add this vector 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.350
 to this vector here 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.260
 We put the tail of the second vector 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.450
 to the head of the first 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.850
 So, this is our first vector and I put the tail 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.000
 the second here. Now, the sum of these two vectors as well 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.470
 assumed, is equal to this vector 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.050
 It is equal to r of t plus h 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.000
 You will now see, in algebraic logic, 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.240
 that this is it will be canceled 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.080
 - 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.270
 I hope this comes as an explanation 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.510
 I want to be clear 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.450
 Suddenly, this is no longer a radius vector 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.560
 We do not say: let's put the tail of this vector 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.870
 at the beginning and use this vector to describe one 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.610
 This is now a kind of pure vector 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.700
 He simply describes the change between two 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.140
 other radius vectors 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.790
 - 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.930
 This vector literally describes the change 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.070
 But let us think what kind of algebraic kind this is 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.460
 if we extend it this way 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.740
 This will be equal to, what is r of t plus h? 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:20.520
 Let me write it here. This is the same 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:27.190
 such as x of t plus h on the single vector 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:35.040
 and plus y of t plus h on the single vector j, 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.570
 this part here, minus that part, 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.300
 minus ... I'll do this on the second line, 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.240
 I could do it here too, but it ends my place 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:52.650
 Minus x of t, r of t is just x of t in i, plus ... but here 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.700
 will divide the minus sign, so it is minus 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.690
 y from t j 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.660
 Actually, let me write it this way, 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.130
 this is a minus, plus that 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.200
 To see that this is the same here 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.950
 like this 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.200
 I just count for t 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.030
 So, we have x from t and t and then we can 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.970
 to distribute, right? 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.255
 If you assign this minus sign, we get minus x 

00:06:14.255 --> 00:06:15.920
 of t and min y from t 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.380
 Here we have vectors collection - maybe you need to 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.920
 negotiating this if you have not been to him for a long time 

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.990
 You know you can just collect the relevant components 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.450
 You can collect x-components and y-components 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.750
 - 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.790
 This will be equal to ... let me transcribe it here 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.810
 because I think I will need a place 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.510
 Let me transcribe it here 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:42.930
 So, I have r of t plus x minus r of t is equal ... and now 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.100
 I will simply group the x and y components - this is equal to 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.920
 x components collected together, but this is us 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.400
 negatively, then we'll get that out 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.100
 from this 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:07:02.400
 So, x from t plus h minus x from t, all this under 

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:09.840
 our single vector in x direction. And then we have plus y from t 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:16.900
 plus h minus y of t on a single vector in the j direction 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.490
 Here I just rearrange to find out what 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:25.870
 is the difference between every two r for a given 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:26.610
 change in distance 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.140
 And our change in the distance here is h between everyone 

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:31.000
 two radius vectors 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.500
 What I was about to show you 

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.100
 in this video is how to find change 

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.990
 and now we are working on the momentary change 

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.790
 with respect to t 

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.920
 I want to find out how much this has changed 

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.570
 for a period of h 

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:48.750
 Instead of h we could write the delta t 

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.010
 and that would not change anything 

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.570
 So I want to divide this into h 

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.410
 So I want to divide this into h 

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.200
 I mean, it's a h 

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.310
 - 

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.250
 This is the same as when dealing with the slope 

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:05.090
 We have a lift on the track, on the delta y, or 

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.290
 the change in y on the change in x 

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:09.160
 This is like the change in our change function in x 

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.960
 Let's divide everything. Maybe you should not 

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.470
 I say change in x, but change in t 

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:17.100
 Here, our change in t is h, huh? 

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:21.290
 The difference between t plus h and t will be just h 

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:25.650
 So we will divide everything into h 

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.750
 When we multiply a vector by scalar or divisible 

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.070
 scalar value, we just take each of the components 

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.140
 vector and multiply or divide the scalar value 

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.660
 And that's what we get 

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:39.540
 So, for the ending difference h, this 

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.300
 this shows us how much the vector for h is changing 

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.220
 But if we want to find the momentary change, 

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.230
 as we did when we first learned about 

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.520
 differential calculations, here's what we will do 

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.670
 This is analogous to bills of gradient 

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.520
 That would do us a good job if that one 

00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:02.220
 the trajectory was such 

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.920
 If it was a linear trajectory 

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.240
 and it looked like this 

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.800
 Then we could just make a plan and get it 

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.080
 the average change in radius vectors you can imagine - 

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.880
 two radius vectors and this is one of them 

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.050
 In fact, they were all parallel in this case 

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:24.470
 But it is not mandatory for the radius vectors to be parallel 

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.740
 They could look like this 

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.340
 And then, that would simply describe the change between 

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.940
 these two vectors for h or how quickly these radius vectors 

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.230
 are changing for the change in our parameter. No? 

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.530
 This is h or, if you prefer, delta t 

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:44.050
 Some people find h for easier, 

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:44.900
 others - delta t 

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:47.230
 Anyway, I'm interested in the momentary change 

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.140
 We have curves and we have high math 

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.870
 It would be good if we had only algebraic, 

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.670
 linear world 

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.850
 So what do we do? 

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:58.080
 So what do we do? 

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.760
 Let me move 

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.700
 Let's take that boundary. I want to take a nice color, 

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.910
 but my colors are over 

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:12.170
 The boundary when h is approaching 0 on both sides 

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:16.440
 Here, too, will take the boundary when h approaches 0 

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.520
 and here too will take the border when 

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.380
 h is approaching 0 

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.970
 Here I mean how much change we have 

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:27.866
 to change the parameter t, but also what it is 

00:10:27.866 --> 00:10:30.480
 the momentary change when the difference happens 

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.280
 becoming smaller and smaller? 

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.870
 That's what we learned when we were dealing with 

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.810
 momentary slope or instantaneous speed, or 

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.330
 slope of tangent line 

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.270
 That seems to me indefinite at the moment 

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:45.260
 For functions with vector values ​​we have no limits 

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.820
 and certain derivatives 

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.250
 But fortunately, all of us 

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:51.160
 looks familiar 

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:54.400
 This is in fact the definition of our derivative 

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.310
 If this is a scalar function 

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.340
 They are multiplied by vectors to get 

00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.880
 functions with vector values 

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.100
 But here, by definition, we are the derivative 

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.330
 This is x of t 

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:08.020
 Or, this is dx dt 

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.280
 This here is the primacy of t, or we can 

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.950
 to record it as dy dt 

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:17.520
 So, this is not really indefinite 

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.220
 My explanations are a bit cumbersome, but here 

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.590
 I just want to motivate your intuition 

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.890
 We can call this expression 

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:30.100
 the derivative of the vector function r 

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:35.440
 with regard to t, or we can call it dr dt 

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.170
 Note that I have left the signs for a vector 

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:44.470
 This is the derivative of t and, as such, 

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.700
 will be just equal to the derivative of x 

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.450
 x with respect to t, which is equal to 

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:54.230
 x the t of the single vector x, the horizontal 

00:11:54.230 --> 00:12:01.170
 single vector, plus y of t, by the single vector y, by 

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:04.240
 j, the single vector in the horizontal direction 

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.800
 This is a pretty good result 

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.340
 But perhaps the hard part is to imagine 

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.730
 visually what it means 

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.490
 Let me draw a great graphics for 

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:19.730
 for you can visualize this better 

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.310
 Let my curve be something like this 

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.700
 This is my curve 

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.860
 And let's say we're looking for the moment 

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.210
 change this point 

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:32.550
 So it's r of t 

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:35.520
 And then we take r from t plus h, we have already seen that 

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.740
 t plus h may be something like this 

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.090
 So this is r of t plus h 

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.290
 Now, the difference between the two ... 

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.250
 this is the numerator when we take the difference 

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:55.170
 How fast is the change from this vector to this vector 

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.140
 in terms of t? I know it's hard to visualize that 

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.960
 I will write a whole clip to pay more attention 

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.160
 I will write a whole clip to pay more attention 

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.200
 This may be a vector 

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.560
 So, the difference between these two things 

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.070
 this will be ours 

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.470
 But then, when we divide into h, it will get bigger 

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:10.840
 vector, yes - assuming h is a small number 

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.410
 Let's say h is less than 1 

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.410
 We will get a larger vector, right? 

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.100
 But this is kind of the average change for that time 

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:22.910
 But when h gets less and less, that 

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:26.100
 The r of t will take a tangent direction 

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.090
 this curve 

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:29.900
 You can imagine that, do not you? 

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.320
 These two vectors are getting closer together 

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.790
 dr decreases or the difference between these 

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:41.220
 two delta r gets smaller 

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.790
 You can imagine if h was even less if he was here 

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.510
 Suddenly, the difference between these two vectors 

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.795
 is becoming smaller 

00:13:47.795 --> 00:13:50.500
 And more and more tangential to this curve 

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.770
 - 

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.800
 But we also divide into less h, meaning the derivative, 

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.670
 the boundary when h approaches 0 can 

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:02.120
 even if it is a bigger number 

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.420
 In fact, it's a little difficult to imagine 

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:05.720
 the size of this vector 

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.510
 It will depend on the parameterization of the curve 

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.990
 It does not depend on the shape of the curve 

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:15.170
 The direction of this vector depends on the shape of this vector 

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.860
 curve and that direction will be 

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.460
 tangent to the curve 

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:26.830
 You can also imagine this vector 

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.220
 is on the tangent line of this curve 

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.960
 The magnitude of the vector is more difficult to understand 

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.050
 The next video will try to 

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:35.060
 I give you some intuition about her 

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.380
 But that's what I want you to understand now, 

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:40.990
 because we will be able to use it in the future when 

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:44.400
 we deal with linear vector vector integration 

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:44.666
