00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From the Library
of Congress, in Washington D.C.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Norse law has remained
unchanged for 10,000 years and

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.840
yet you seek to change it today.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.710
Over my dead body [growling]!

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Norse law states

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.190
that every Viking must
eat the food of the gods.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Falafel
is no food of the gods.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.410
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's
pronounced falafel.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.410
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Falafel
is not even meat.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Have
you ever tried one?

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.270
It's delicious!

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: And the tahini sauce,
it literally melts in your mouth.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I only
trust what I can kill.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.030
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: You don't
need to kill the falafel.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.050
It's vegan.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What did you call me?

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.040
[ Arguing ]

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Magnus Chase, son
of Frey eats falafel every day

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:18.070
and we know this because we
are told in this shiny book.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Shiny book.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:32.490
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Now who here dares
defy the words of Magnus Chase?

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Falafel is cool.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker: 7: I ate
some last night.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Magnus Chase and
the Gods of Asgard, book three,

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.860
The Ship of the Dead,
from Rick Riordan.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.860 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Now this is delicious.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: And it's gluten free!

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What did you call me?

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.570
[ Arguing ]

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Mr. Rick Riordan!

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.050
[ Cheers ]

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.920
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Hew everybody!

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.310
Wow, well that was something.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.110
I don't know about you guys, I'm
hungry for falafel now [laughter].

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.450
Anybody else?

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.480
Well it's fantastic to be here.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.510
Do we have a clicker up here
for the little thingy bobber?

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.780
Yeah. Oh, thank you.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.060
What happened to your hair?

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.150
Well, it's great to be
back, it's wonderful.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.500
Thanks to everybody for coming out.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.350 position:56%
Are you guys missing class for this?

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.650
&gt;&gt; [crowd response] Yes!

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.430
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Ah, I'm so sorry.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.390
What a terrible thing.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.880
So I should try to talk really,

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.370
really fast to get you guys
back as soon as possible?

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.890
No?

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.190
&gt;&gt; [crowd response] No!

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.590
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Okay, whatever.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.460
Well, it's great to be
here and as you heard

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.230
in the introduction I was
a teacher for many years

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.840
so I always liked field trips

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.080
and I'm glad you guys
could join me today.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.920
I was thinking backstage,

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.710
it has been 40 years
since I started writing.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.030
Can you believe that?

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.720 position:56%
I am 53 now, which I can't believe,
but I started writing when I was 13.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.940
I was in eighth grade and I wrote
this story for my English teacher

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.630
about this guy who dies and
he goes into the afterlife.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.720
It was like a fantasy story.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.910
My teacher read it and she said,
"Rick, this is really good.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.880
Why don't we see if we
can get it published?"

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.790
And I was like, "You can do that?"

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.600
I didn't know how you
got things published.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.410
This was before the Internet;
we didn't have fan fiction,

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.830
we didn't have What Pad, we
didn't have social media.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.790
If you wanted to get something
published you just kind of had

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.090
to send it to a magazine
or a publisher

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.370
in New York and hope they liked it.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.010
So we sent off this story.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.920
I was so excited and finally,
after about six weeks,

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.500
I got back a rejection and that
was only the first rejection.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.550
I kept writing, I kept writing

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.870
and I got rejected for
everything I put in.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.110
It wasn't until I was 30 years
old that I finally got published.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.950
I wrote a novel for adults
called Big Red Tequila.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.140
It was a murder mystery.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.120
I was teaching middle
school at the time;

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.260
I don't think that's why
I was contemplating murder

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.560
but I'm not sure [laughter].

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.330
But I sent it off and
it got published.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.820
But even after that, I was still
teaching for another ten years,

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.910
and I loved teaching, I didn't
mind that, but I was writing books

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.490
and teaching at the same time.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.910
It wasn't until my son was in the
second grade and having trouble

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.090
in school and I started telling him
Greek myths for bedtime stories,

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.370
that I started thinking hey,
you know what, I teach kids,

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.580
I write books, why don't I
put the two things together?

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.820
And it finally made sense to me.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.750
And out of those stories about
Greek mythology came the story

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.670
of Percy Jackson.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.230
My very first book, The
Lightning Thief, which I hear some

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.190
of you guys have read, and the
question was pretty simple.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.390
What would you do if you
found out that your real mom

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.870
or your real dad was a Greek god?

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.020
Yeah, I see the wheels
spinning, right?

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.320
You're thinking about it.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.870
Uh huh. That'd be pretty cool?

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.270
Yeah. Would anybody have
a favorite Greek god?

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.810
Who would you like
as your mom or dad?

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.110
Let me see some hands.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.980
Who would you choose?

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.170
Aphrodite, the goddess of love;
Aphrodite had a magical belt

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.510
and she could make any guy fall
in love with her like that.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.810
That'd be cool.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.110
I'm sure that's not why
you would want [inaudible]

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.670
but that's a pretty cool power.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.870
Yeah, who would you
like as a mom or a dad?

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Zeus.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.470
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Zeus!

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.770
The god of the sky.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.080
If anybody bothered you
you could be like, hey dad,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.200
this guy right here, boom!

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.010
Lightening, not bad.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.380
Over here, yes?

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.500
Artemis, ah, the huntress.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.800
She would be really cool.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.670
You'd be great at bows and arrows

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:59.680
and you could live
outside all the time.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.540
Of course, Artemis said she would
never have kids but, you know.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.060
Maybe you could be
adopted or something.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.360
That'd be cool.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.660
That'd be cool.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.450
My favorite answer, I was at a
school one time and I said, okay,

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.820
who would you like as a god if
you had a mom or a dad as a god.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.920
A kid raised his hand
and said, "Batman!"

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.980
I was like yes, excellent answer.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.280
All right, well anyway.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.580
Hands down.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.840
That was Percy Jackson.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.900
I wrote five books about
Percy and I loved it

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.860 position:56%
and I thought I was pretty much done
with Greek mythology but the thing

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.690
about myths and stories is the
more you read is the more you find.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.270
So I kept finding more
stories and so I, yes,

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.800
you've got the first
book right there.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.760
I started the Heroes
of Olympus series

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.310
and the first book
was the Lost Hero.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:48.100
Five more of those and now
I've written, like, yeah,

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.830
it's about 20 books for kids.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.260
That's crazy!

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.250
And today, the weird thing
is, after all of these years

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.200
from the time I was 13 and I wrote
that story about a guy who dies

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.540
and goes into the afterlife, I'm
here with you today to tell you

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.160
about the newest book, which is
about a guy who dies and goes

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.820
into the afterlife
[laughter], Magnus Chase.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.000
The Vikings believed that if
you died a hero with a sword

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.450
or some other weapon in your
hand, doing what was right

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.430
and defending your friends and
being courageous, being a hero,

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.770
if you died like that
you would go to Valhalla,

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.780
which was like paradise
for warriors.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.500
You would be one of Odon's chosen,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.330
the [foreign language
spoken], the loan warriors.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.650
And you would be indestructible
almost.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:39.090
You would fight with Odon on
[inaudible], the day of doom.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:44.070
Well Magnus Chase is a kid
living on the streets of Boston.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.990
One day he finds this magical
sword, defends a bunch of people

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.610
from this monster and in the
very first chapter Magnus dies.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.570
And he wakes up and
he's in Valhalla.

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.620
He's a modern [foreign language
spoken], one of Odon's warriors.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.840
Which is pretty cool except if
he ever goes outside of Valhalla

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.760
and goes on, like, adventures
he can die out there but if he's

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.480
in Valhalla he can't die.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.500
They can go around
Valhalla, they have swords,

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.800
they're cutting each
other's heads off

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.310
and they just get right
back up again.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.950
They have a big battle every day.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.410
Everybody goes out and it's like
a game of freeze tag or it's

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:23.820
like a game of dodge ball
except with swords [laughter].

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.100
And it doesn't matter
how many times you die,

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.990 position:56%
the next morning you'll just wake up
in your bed and you're totally fine.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.940
Do not try this at home, okay,
this is only in Valhalla.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:40.050
Anyway, Magnus Chase, what can I
tell you about the newest book?

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:43.600
Well, since there are nine wolds
in Norse mythology we are going

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.910
on nine different adventures.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.840
You guys are the very first ones.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.380
We're starting with you in
D.C, and then we're going all

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.480
across the company
to different places,

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.470
eight cities in eight
days from here.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.220
It's going to be a lot of fun.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.910
In the newest book, The Ship of the
Dead, Magnus has a little problem.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:02.790
Are you familiar with loki?

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.090
&gt;&gt; [crowd response] Yes.

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.400
&gt;&gt; You've seen the Thor movies?

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:06.700
&gt;&gt; [crowd response] Yes.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's not exactly how he
is in mythology but he is a pretty,

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.800
pretty clever, tricky villain.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.680
Well, Loki was punished
in Norse mythology.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:19.310
When the gods got mad at him
because he killed this other god

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.210 position:56%
and gods can die in Norse mythology.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:27.210
They took Loki and they tied him
down in a cave, like spread eagle,

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.370
like this on the floor
for all eternity.

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.630
But that wasn't gross enough.

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.960
They didn't just tie
him down with chains,

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:39.210
the gods turned Loki's two
favorite sons into wolves

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.100
and made them fight
each other to the death

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:46.320
and then they took the entrails,
the intestines, I'm sorry,

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.030
did you guys eat before you came?

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:52.690
They took the intestines of Loki's
sons and made magical chains

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.660
and chained him down with those
but even that wasn't gross enough.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:59.310
They took a big stone pillar
and put it by his head

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:04.270
and they took a giant serpent
and wound it around the pillar

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.510
and the serpent, all day
long for all eternity,

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:11.270
would drip poison into Loki's eyes.

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:14.390
Can you imagine what
that would feel like?

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:15.690
&gt;&gt; [crowd response] No.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:20.810
&gt;&gt; The only help he had, his wife,
the goddess Sigyn, she had a bowl

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:25.620
and she would kneel at Loki's
side and collect the acid in a cup

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.470
but every once in awhile she
would have to empty the cup.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:34.280 position:56%
So she would turn and empty it and
during that time the acid would fall

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.570
in Loki's eyes and Loki
would writhe and scream.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:42.510
Aaahh! And that's why the Vikings
thought earthquakes happened.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:47.130
It was Loki in his chains
under the mountain doing that.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:51.810
Well, in this book, The Ship
of the Dead, Loki has escaped.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:57.210
He is finally out and you can
imagine he's not real happy.

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:02.120
He has gone to find the ship
of the dead, which is the boat

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.940
that he will take to sail to
doomsday, the final battle,

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:11.360
when all nine worlds burn
and the gods will die.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.200 position:56%
It's a really happy time [laughter].

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:19.220
This ship of the dead is made,
it's called the ship of nails

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:22.390
and that's not because it has a
bunch of nails hammered in it,

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:26.720
we're talking toenails
and fingernails [moans].

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.830
The entire ship, big enough
for a million warriors,

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:36.260
is cobbled together from
the toenails and fingernails

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:40.350
of all the dead warriors
from all time.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.280
How gross is that?

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:50.620
And that's why the Vikings
believed that when you died,

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:55.380
you better get somebody to trim
your nails because if you died

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.790
with long nails you
were contributing

00:11:57.790 --> 00:12:00.230
to the ship of the dead.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.960
So that's what Magnus
has in store for him,

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.960
a whole bunch of toenails
and a really angry god.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.230
He's got to go on this big journey
to try to find out where Loki is

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.160
to stop him before he
can start doomsday.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.100
Some of the characters
that you will learn more

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.450
about if you have read
the series already,

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.690
you may remember Hearthstone
the elf,

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:24.210
he is the MVE, most valuable elf.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.430
He is from [inaudible],
the world of the elves,

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.410
and a few things are really cool
about Hearthstone, he's deaf;

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:35.580
he uses sign language but he also
is an amazing roon stone magician.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:40.180
He can take these roon stones and
make different things happen simply

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:44.930
by throwing them into the air like
one roon stone will create a horse

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:48.020
that has eight legs and
can ride through the air.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:52.340
Another roon stone will create a
barrier of ice that no one can get

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.960
through and he's got 27 different
roon stones so he's got a lot

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.360
of things, literally, in his bed.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.310
Thomas Jefferson Junior,
he lives in Valhalla.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:08.690
HE died a hero but he died in 1863.

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.820
He was a member of the
54th Massachusetts regimen,

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:14.540
one of the first African-American
units to fight for the union,

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.730
and he died in battle and
he is now there in Valhalla,

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:20.680
one of Magnus's best friends.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.950
And he is a great fighter,
he will go on the adventure.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.050
You'll find out a little
bit more about him.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.160
Thomas Jefferson Junior
is a great guy,

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.350
he's a great warrior,
he's very strong.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:32.900
He does have this strange thing
about wanting to charge up hills.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.660
I'm not sure what that's about;
it's a Civil War thing I guess.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:40.200
You'll also find out about Mallory
Keen, who's a great fighter.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:47.100
She died a hero in the 1970s in
Ireland trying to disarm a car bomb

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.970
and you'll hear how that
happened in the book.

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:52.340
Halfborn Gunderson,
another one of our friends.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:53.640
He's a berserker.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.960
Have you ever heard of berserkers?

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.260
&gt;&gt; [crowd response] Yes.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.470
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: They are
warriors from the Viking days

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.360
that they would go into
this sort of trance

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.240
and usually they didn't
wear armor, they just had,

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.960
like, an ax and that's it.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.360
Sometimes they didn't wear
anything but just like underpants.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.660
That was it.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.250
And they would paint themselves
different colors and they would go

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:15.250
into this massively
weird, frenzied state.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.070
You couldn't even talk to
them when they were like that.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.760
You just sort of point them
at the enemy and say go.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.160
And they would charge into battle

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.580
and while they were
berserking they felt no pain.

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.140
They would just charge into
battle and kill anybody they say.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:30.110
[Screams] like that.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:33.860
So, if you ever hear the term
you're going berserk that's

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.160
where it comes from.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.040
You're like a bersekrer,
you're charging into battle.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.850
And so you'll find out a
little bit more about him.

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:43.390
And one of my favorite
characters, Alex Fierro.

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.700
Alex was introduced
in the last book.

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.250
Alex is a great character.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:52.090
Alex is the child of Loki,
the evil trickster god

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:54.750
but that doesn't necessarily
mean Alex is evil.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.770
Alex has an interesting past.

00:14:56.770 --> 00:15:01.020
Alex is gender fluid, which means
that on some days Alex identifies

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.060
as male, on some days
Alex identifies as female

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.920
and if you get it wrong
on one day or the other,

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.230
Alex will let you know about it.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.060
And you're just supposed to, you
know, kind of go with it and sort

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:16.180
of know whether it's sort of a
female or a male day for Alex.

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:22.170
Anyway, Alex has this ceramics
tool and it's just like a wire

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:26.090
and not only can she cut ceramics
with it but she can also sort

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.870
of fling it and cut the
heads off of dragons,

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:33.110
you know, her friends, whatever.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:36.310
The thing about Alex that was kind
of cool was recently, in fact,

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.960
that book where she was
introduced, I'm going to say she

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.080
because normally Alex introduces

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.150
as female [applause] won
the Stonewall Book Award,

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:46.450
which is really cool.

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:52.350 position:56%
If you don't know what that is, it's
a book for, it's an award for book

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:56.400 position:56%
that have characters that are
lesbian, bisexual, gay, transgender,

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.440
that are in the LGBT spectrum.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:59.930
And you don't see a
lot of characters

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:01.330
like that in children's books.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:06.290
Alex is and so I was really honored
that because of Alex's presence

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:08.100
in the book it got
the Stonewall Award.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.320
And, of course, you'll
see Alex again.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.330
So, that's enough about Magnus.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:14.690
What else is going on with me?

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:18.950
Well, as you heard earlier,
I get a lot of questions

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.560
from people saying
are you ever going

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.450
to write about Aztec mythology?

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.270
What about Chinese mythology?

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.440
What about Nigerian mythology?

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.510
What about Native American
mythology?

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.450
And there are so many
amazing mythologies out there

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:38.400
but the thing is, a lot of those I
didn't grow up with the way I grew

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.360
up with Egyptian and
Norse, and Greek and Roman.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.660
I know those pretty well.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.950
I taught them, I grew up with them.

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:48.460
But Brazilian mythology, I
mean I'm sure it's amazing

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.020
but I don't know anything about it.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:52.880
So I started thinking, instead
of me writing all these books,

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.650
wouldn't it be better to find an
author who is from that background,

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:01.830 position:56%
who knows those myths, and who is an
expert in the way that I can't be.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:05.620
And instead of me writing the book,
finding somebody who wants to write

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:09.120
that book, who is from that
background, and promote them.

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.420
And so that's what
we're going to do.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.220
We have an imprint, which
is like just a subsection

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:16.100
of Disney Publishing,
called Rick Riordan Presents

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.820
and the first book is going
to come out very soon.

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.300
It's coming out in March.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:25.240
It's called Aru Shah and the End
of Time and it's by Roshani Chokshi

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.310
and that's here, that's the cover.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:31.780
I have to say, I love
Hindu mythology.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.360
I don't know if you know
anything about Hindu mythology.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.770
They have hundreds of gods.

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:40.560
You think Greek mythology
is complicated, whoa.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.860
Hindu mythology is amazing
and she does a great job,

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:48.480
all these different magic spells
and different gods and adventures

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.230
and it's a pretty incredible book.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:54.110
It's coming out in March
and then, in the fall,

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:57.190
we're going to do a book called The
Storm Runner by Jennifer Cervantes,

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.970
which is based on Mayan mythology.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:02.480
And, again, if you don't know
anything about Mayan mythology,

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.970
neither did I but after reading
this book it's pretty amazing.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.270
I'm glad I wasn't a Mayan
because there's some bloody,

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.480
bloody stuff that happens.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.250
And also, a book on Korean
mythology called The Dragon Pearl

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.870
by an author named Yoon
Ha Lee that's going

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:17.170
to be coming out in the fall.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:18.740
And we're going to try
to do four books a year.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.790
So if you're interested
in other mythologies,

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:23.950
hopefully this will give
you a look at those.

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:25.490
Also, I'm doing another series.

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.430
Has anybody read The
Trials of Apollo?

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:30.390
Yeah, good, I'm glad.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:35.010
This is about Apollo, the god, and
he gets punished by his dad, Zeus,

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.170
and if you're punished I don't'
know what your parents do

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:41.270
if they make you stay in your room
or they take away TV or whatever,

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:45.580
with Apollo he's punished by being
turned into a human [laughter].

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.910
I didn't know Zeus could do that

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:52.850
but he strips away Apollo's magic
powers, dumps him down into Earth

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:55.690
and he lands in a dumpster
in Manhattan.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:59.110
He's a regular 16-year-old
kid with no powers

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:04.290
and his name is Lester
Pappadapolous [laughter] and he has

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:07.690
to find his way back
to Mount Olympus

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.670
by doing all these
different adventures.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:12.550
So anyway, the third book in
that series I'm working on now,

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:16.750
it'll be called The Burning
Maze and that comes out May 1st.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:19.170
So stay tuned for that one.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.880
The Kane Chronicles,
my Egyptian series.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.390
We're putting out a new book

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:28.520
about the Kanes called The
Brooklyn House Magician's Guide.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.240
So if you're interested in
finding out how magicians do magic,

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.840
how they cast spells and
charms and curses and all that

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.980
and all the different Egyptian
gods, this will be here for you.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:41.340
And if you haven't read The Kane
Chronicles this is a good time

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.780
to pick them up because
they're getting a new look.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.360
There's a sneak peek at the
new jackets that they'll have

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.040
that are coming out in April.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.550
So check those out
if you like Egypt.

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.350
There's also a Magnus
Chase coloring book.

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.010
I know, right?

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.420
I, you know, I didn't
even think I would like,

00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.780
they said they want
to do a coloring book.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.530
Disney told me this, I'm
like, a coloring book?

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.180
And then I saw the pictures
and they're amazing.

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.480
I really like them.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.980
The Lightning Thief coloring
book just came out last month

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.670
and it's been a lot of fun.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:14.170
And this one's coming
out next year in August.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.600
And, if you want to know more,

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:21.460
we're just launching a
website called readriordan.com.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:25.520
The site has been around but it's
getting a major, major revamp.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.710
Some of the stuff is already
up, some of it is coming soon,

00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:31.020
but it will be the
official home for demigods.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:35.680
For instance, you can find out
more about all the characters.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.990
There will be quizzes online.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:38.740
I know a lot of you
have asked about this.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.800
How do I find out who
my godly parent is?

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:46.150
There's a quiz for that so you can
get on readriordan.com and find

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:51.010
out what's your magic weapon, who's
your godly parent and all of that.

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:54.220
You can decide what sort of
demigod you're going to be.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.660 position:56%
And a bunch of stuff about
locations that happened in the books

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.030
and social media, social art.

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:03.320
Anything you want to share,
Instagram stuff, Twitter stuff,

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.800
all of that will be there.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.460
And let's not forget, the boy who
started it all, Percy Jackson.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.940
What's going on in his world?

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.600
Some cool stuff has
happened recently.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.420
In the summer it was turned
into a Broadway musical.

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.170
Off-Broadway Lightning Thief,

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:22.070
can you imagine Percy
dancing and singing?

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:23.370
[singing] Oh, I kill Minotaurs.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:24.670
I don't know.

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.880
I have to admit, I haven't actually
seen the play and that's not

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.260
because it's not good;
it's supposed to be really,

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.480
really funny and really,
really good.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:36.280
It's just, I have trouble
seeing adaptations;

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.490
it just kind of freaks me out a
little bit to see my characters

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:42.740
like that but they did a
great job and if you want

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.040
to hear Percy sing the soundtrack
is on iTunes, you can check it out.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.830
And they're talking about doing
a touring version so, who knows,

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:55.880
fingers crossed, it'll come
to D.C. one of these days.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.770
And, next year, there's
going to be a special edition

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:03.730
of The Lightning Thief coming out
fully illustrated by John Rocco,

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:08.200
who did the covers, every
single page color illustrations,

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:13.580
the whole book, all the way
through, this thing is beautiful.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:14.880
And there's the cover.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.460
It's just announced yesterday and
here's a little sneak peek inside.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:24.560
I told you not to park there, rrrr!

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:31.970
A look at the cabins
of Camp Half Blood.

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:37.390 position:56%
And [inaudible], the ferry man,
taking people across the underworld.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:41.600
Nice. So you can look
forward to that in August.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.190
So that's just a little
look at what's going on.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:46.510
Now it's time to get
to my favorite part,

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:49.540
we're going to see what you guys
are interested in hearing about

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:52.610
and do a little Q and A. We're
going to get some from our audience

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.270
and we have our wonderful
helpers here who are going

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.160
to come out with microphones.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.010
So if you have a question
you can raise your hand,

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:00.680
we'll get to as many as we can.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.240
And we'll get some from
our online viewers as well.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 11: Who would you
want your godly parent to be?

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:09.230
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Ah, who would
I want my godly parent to be?

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:13.570
I would hope for Athena but as
I was telling somebody earlier,

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.290
with my luck I'd probably
get someone

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:17.560
like Dionysis [phonetic], you know.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.630
My power is I can summon
Diet Coke, hurray [laughter].

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.870
All right, a question
over on this side.

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:35.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 12: Hold on one second.

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:36.850
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Hold on.

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:38.150
Let's get you a microphone there.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:39.450
There you go sweetheart.

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:41.070
&gt;&gt; Speaker 13: Here we go.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:43.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 14: Who is in this book?

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.140
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: The one
that I'm talking about today?

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 14: Yes, the new book.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:48.670
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: The new
book, The Ship of the Dead,

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:52.030
well it is Magnus Chase and
some of the other characters

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:55.490
that I showed you on the
screen like Alex and Mallory

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.260
and T.J. You'll also,
however, get a little look

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.870
at Percy Jackson and Anabeth Chase.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:04.270
They make an appearance
in the book too.

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:06.930
So if you're wondering
what Percy is up to,

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:08.790
you can check that out in here too.

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:10.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: Awesome.

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:11.390
Okay, right over here.

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:16.590
Tell us your name.

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:17.890
&gt;&gt; Speaker 16: I'm Lillian.

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:20.640
What's your favorite
kind of mythology?

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.940 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Ah, thanks Lillian.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.240
My favorite kind of mythology.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.910
It's so hard to say,
I love them all.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:29.140
I always keep coming back
to the Greek myths simply

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.240
because there are so many of them.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.740
There's so much that
you can write about.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.440
The other myths are
great but we don't have

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.550
as many myths written down.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:43.700
I wish we did but we've lost a lot
of stories that were never written

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.780
down so I think the Greek just
because we know the most about it.

00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.900
Yeah and back over here.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.490
&gt;&gt; Speaker 16: When did your first
Lightning Thief book come out?

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: When did the first
Lightning Thief book came out, 2005,

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:04.230
2006-ish; 2006, my official
researcher down here told me, yeah.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:06.560
So it's been just over 10 years.

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 13: Say your name.

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:11.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: Let's go back to the
back over here, Rick, to the left.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:12.730
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Oh, okay.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.030
We'll get right to you.

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 17: Are you
going to write a book

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.180
about what happened to Leo?

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:18.700
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: What
happened to Leo.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:23.270
Actually, Leo is a character
in the Heroes of Olympus series

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:28.000
and in the trials of Apollo, you're
going to see all of the characters

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.900
from Percy Jackson and
Heroes of Olympus again

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:35.090
and in the second Trials of
Apollo series you will spend a lot

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:37.520
of time with Leo and Calypso.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.860
So yeah, you'll find out there
what's going on with both of them.

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.160
Yeah.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 13: Okay, ready?

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.760
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Okay,
yeah, go ahead.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.060
Thanks for waiting.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 13: Say your name.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:53.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Speaker 18: Why isn't, well, you
know Loki's son is in your new book.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:54.840
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Right.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 18: Alex.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.640 position:56%
I thought he was going to be killed.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.480
Like, why is, I thought
Loki's two sons were killed

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.780
and turned into wolves.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.080
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Ah, yes.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.380
You're very observant.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.680
That's right.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.030
These are, you're just
talking about different sons.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:15.210
Loki had a lot of children and some
of them were pretty interesting.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:19.230
One of his kids was Fenris
Wolf, this giant wolf.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:22.130
How does a god and a giant
have a kid who is a wolf?

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:23.700
I have no idea.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.390
One of their other children was
[inaudible], the world serpent,

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:30.330
this huge snake that is so
big it wraps all the way

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:31.870
around the bottom of the ocean.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:34.340
Again, how do you have
a kid who's a snake?

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.640
I don't know.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.860
But these are just two other
kids we were talking about.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.160
Great question!

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: Awesome.

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.760 position:56%
Okay, right here, tell us your name.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:43.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 19: Angelique.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:48.210
Which mythology do
you know most about?

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.360
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Hmm, I think
probably either Norse or Greek.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:56.080
I grew up with both of those and
Egyptian so I think I know them

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.620
but I think I've known the Norse
mythology the longest because I was

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:03.010
into that when I was like in 7th
grade and, like I was talking

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:05.420
about earlier, we just have
more of the Greek myths

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.720 position:56%
so I know a lot about those as well.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.020
Yeah.

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: Okay,
let's go right down here.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.620
All right.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:14.600
Tell us your name.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 20: Marcus.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.200
Is this you [laughter]?

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.070
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: Is that me?

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:24.200
That's Magnus.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.630
This is me without the Magnus hair.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.850
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Marcus's question
was is the guy of the cover

00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:33.280 position:56%
of the Ship of the Dead actually
Seal, who is my publicist at Disney,

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.300
Seal is just being a good
sport and he's dressing

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.540
up as Magnus for the day, so.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:41.660
We wouldn't want him to go off and
fight Fenriss Wolfe or anything.

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:46.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Speaker 21: My name is Mary Ann
and which book is your favorite book

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.900
of all the books that
you've written?

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.200
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Oh Mary Ann,

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.380
a great question and
so hard to answer.

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.220
I've got so many books.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.990
I mean, obviously, the Lightning
Thief is really special to me

00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:59.390
because it was my first children's
book and it's what started it all.

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:01.540
I think my favorite
Percy Jackson book

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:05.480 position:56%
in the series is actually the Battle
of the Labyrinth, the fourth one.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.340
I really like the battle
scene in that.

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.930
Favorite one of all time?

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:11.230
I don't know.

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:14.150
I really like the Magnus
Chase books, the Viking books.

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:17.910
Those gods and heroes and
monsters are just so weird.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:19.210
I really like them.

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:21.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: Okay, we're going
to the top up there to the right.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.810
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: All right.

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:24.750
&gt;&gt; Speaker 22: We actually
have a question from one

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:27.540
of the schools that's tuning
in live on Youtube right now.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.840
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Fantastic.

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 22: This is
Northwest Rankin Middle School

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.770
in Flowood, Mississippi.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:34.350
So Jacy Errington, who
is in seventh grade,

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:37.720
wants to know did you every write
a book that made you almost want

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:41.700
to quit and, if so, what
was it and why [laughter]?

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:45.810
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Yes, Jacy, that's
called every book [laughter].

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:49.670
No, just because, not really but,
I mean, writing books is hard.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:54.510
Writing books is a lot of work and
I have, like I said, written what?

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:58.250
Like 20 books for kids or
something like that and 30 overall.

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:00.850
And I keep thinking it's
going to get easier.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:02.150
It doesn't.

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:03.450
It doesn't.

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:04.750
Every book is hard.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.050
A lot of it is revising.

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:07.690
Do you guys have to
revise in school?

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:08.990
&gt;&gt; [crowd response] Yes.

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:10.290
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Yeah, I know.

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:11.590
Do you hate that?

00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:12.890
&gt;&gt; [crowd response] Yes.

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:14.190
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Yeah, me too!

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:17.100 position:56%
Me too. But here's the thing I found
out, it's just part of the deal.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:21.320
No one can write a perfect
first draft with no mistakes.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.940
It cannot be done.

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.200
I've written 30 books,
I still can't do it.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.390
I have to revise every single
book three, four, five,

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:31.590
six times before I
get everything right.

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:35.020
So if you're going to write, it's
a great thing to do but you have

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.610
to be ready, you've to revise.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:38.170
Part of the process.

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: Okay, we're going to
go to Steph over here on the right.

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:43.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 13: Okay, say your name.

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:44.410
&gt;&gt; Speaker 23: My name is Sasha

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:52.330
and my question is what was
the hardest series to make?

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:54.070
Like, how long did it take-

00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:56.390
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Yeah, sure.

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:58.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 23: to make
the Magnus Chase?

00:29:58.610 --> 00:30:00.790
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Yeah,
yeah, I think, um,

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:05.370 position:56%
probably the hardest one was the
Egyptian series, The Kane Chronicles

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:10.840
because we don't know a whole
lot about, well we know some

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:15.270
but there's still a lot about the
Egyptian gods that we don't know

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.420
and we have to sort of guess.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:18.950
I found out that a lot of stuff

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:22.370
about how Egyptians
thought magic worked though.

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:25.680
We have a lot of Egyptian
spells that have come

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.380 position:56%
down over the thousands of years and
that's kind of interesting so I went

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.020
to a lot of museums, I read a lot,

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.220
and I tried to recreate
how a magician

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:38.020
from Egypt would have
done their magic.

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:41.860 position:56%
It's really pretty fascinating stuff
but it was very hard to research.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.160
Thank you.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.460
Good question.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: Okay, back
over here to the left, Rick.

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.060
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Yeah.

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Speaker 24: My name is Tallulah
and what is your favorite Greek god?

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Favorite Greek god.

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:54.250
Would I surprise you if I
said Poseidon [laughter]?

00:30:54.250 --> 00:31:00.110 position:56%
I think that's why I made him
Percy's dad because I like the ocean

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:03.800
and I didn't want Percy's dad to
be Zeus, the most powerful god

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.320
because I just thought
that would be too obvious.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.470
You know, everyone
wants to be Zeus's kid.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:11.960
It's more interesting if he's
the second most powerful god,

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.750
gives him a little
bit more to work for.

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:15.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: Tell us your name.

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:16.350
&gt;&gt; Speaker 25: My name is Madison.

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:20.470
My question is what's your
motivation for your books?

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:22.370
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: What's
my motivation for books?

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:27.630
Madison, I think probably my
motivation is deadlines [laughter].

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:30.200
I'm kidding but it's really
good to have a deadline.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.500
I was talking about that with some

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.920
of the interviewers
before I came out.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.460
Do you ever, are you like me
where you don't really start

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.590
to do the work until
you know it's due?

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:40.890
&gt;&gt; Speaker 25: Yeah.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:43.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: I do that a lot and
so having a deadline is really good

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:45.890
for me, it keeps me motivated.

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:49.380
But, seriously, the big
motivation is you guys.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.350
If I know that you're looking or
books to read and you're excited

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:55.900
and you want to read the next
adventure, that's huge motivation

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.520
for me because I want
to make you guys happy,

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.570
I want to give you guys
a book you want to read.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:02.040
So that's great motivation.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: All right, we're
going to back to Sasha up here

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:05.630
in the upper right hand corner.

00:32:05.630 --> 00:32:08.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 26: My name is
Lena and my question is

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:15.750
that who is your favorite character
in the second book of Magnus Chase?

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:18.040
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: In the
Magnus Chase series?

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.760
Well, Magnus, of course,
he's the main character.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.280
He's the most like me.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.070
He has my sense of humor.

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:27.160
We're both kind of cynical,
both kind of sarcastic.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.720
But I do, I do like Alex Fierro.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.130
Alex is a really interesting
character.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:37.280
I've never written anybody
quite like Alex before

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:41.560
and it was both a challenge and
a treat and she's really fun.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:42.860
I like her.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:45.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: Okay, Stephanie
over here on the right.

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:47.750
&gt;&gt; Speaker 27: My name
is Zuri and I just wanted

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:50.840
to know what's your
all-around favorite god?

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:54.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: All around
favorite god, among the mythologies?

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.500
I don't know, I always liked Thor.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:57.880
Thor is pretty cool.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.790
You wouldn't know it by
the way I write about him.

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:02.950
I make him like this big sort
of Oaf who just kind of eats

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:07.060
and farts a lot but I really do
think he's a pretty cool guy.

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.560
So he's, I'd love to
have his hammer too.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.860
That would be a great weapon.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.380
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: Okay,
back up here to the left.

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:16.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 28: Who's your favorite
character you've ever written?

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:18.090
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Favorite
character I've every written.

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:21.360
I mean, I'm going to have
to say Percy Jackson.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.870
Every time I write about
him it's like going back

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:26.420
and seeing an old friend
all over again.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:29.390
I love his voice and I
love his sense of humor.

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:30.690
He's a lot of fun.

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:32.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: Okay,
tell us your name.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 29: My name is Jack

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:37.590
and my question is what's
the website for the quiz?

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:38.890
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Yeah.

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:40.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 29: What's
the website though?

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:41.490
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Absolutely.

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:43.660
The website, and I don't think the
quiz is up yet but if you go there

00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:46.030
and you bookmark it,
it'll be there soon.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.930
The website is readriordan.com.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:53.940
Read, r-e-a-d, my last
name, r-i-o-r-d-a-n.com

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.570
and there's already a bunch of
cool stuff but there's more coming.

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:59.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 13: It's going
to go live October 17th.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.420
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: October 17th.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:03.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: Yeah, so it's a soft
launch up now but then a hard launch

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:08.440
with the full gamut of what the
website offers October 17th.

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:09.740
Okay?

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.040
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Cool.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.340
All right.

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:13.640
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: All right, Sasha, do
we have one more school question?

00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:14.940
&gt;&gt; Sasha: Absolutely.

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:16.710
So one of our friends who is tuning
in from Brush, Colorado wants

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:18.920
to know, this is from
Hunter, age 10.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.220
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Okay.

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:22.670
&gt;&gt; Sasha: What do you think the
name of your next book will be?

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:25.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Well I know the
one that's coming out in the spring,

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:28.140
that will be The Burning Maze.

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:32.100
That is the third book
about the trials of Apollo.

00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:35.080
Past that I don't know.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.280
What's coming up next for me,
the Apollo series is going

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:42.430
to be five books so I've
got book four and book five

00:34:42.430 --> 00:34:44.420
and I don't know what
they're called yet.

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:47.520
Usually the title comes
to me right about the end

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.470
of the book I'm writing right now.

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:50.880
So stay tuned.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.750
And after that I don't
know, I don't know.

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:57.250
Do you guys have a sense of
what you would like to see?

00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:00.990
Like more Greek stuff or would you
like some different mythology or,

00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:03.640
I don't know, maybe you
can tell me what you'd

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:04.940
like to see written about.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: Shout it out.

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:09.100
Anybody got any good ideas
for another book for rick?

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:10.400
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Chinese.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: How about
over here, what did you say?

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:16.770
Okay. We're going to go one more,

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:18.480
we have time for one
more question right here.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 13: What's your name.

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:21.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 30: Zoey.

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:23.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: Zoey,
what's your question.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.520
Shhh, hey guys, hang on, hang on.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:29.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 30: Why did you
want to become an author?

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:31.740
&gt;&gt; Rick Riordan: Why did I
want to become an author?

00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:35.030
I really like telling stories

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:38.140
and when I was a teacher
that's what I did.

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:42.170
Most of the time I would tell
stories in the classroom and so

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:44.380
when I started writing books

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:47.240
for kids it really wasn't
that much of a change.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.380
I already liked doing that.

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:52.340
And I have the best job in the
world, I get to tell stories

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:54.550
and then come out and talk
to you guys about them.

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:55.850
So it's pretty cool.

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:57.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 15: All right guys.

00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:59.890
So let's give it up one more time
for your favorite author everybody!

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:01.190
Rick Riordan!

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:02.490
Wooh [cheers and applause]!

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:09.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: This has
been a presentation

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.940
