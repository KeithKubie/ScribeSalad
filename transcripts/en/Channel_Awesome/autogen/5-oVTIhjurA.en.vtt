00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:39.230 align:start position:0%
fire itself is the actual hands and I
 

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.050 align:start position:0%
fire itself is the actual hands and I

like that it's the actual heat radiating
 

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.420 align:start position:0%

from the fire that's the actual hand oh
that<00:13:43.580><c> was</c><00:13:43.820><c> really</c><00:13:43.970><c> cool</c><00:13:44.260><c> I</c><00:13:45.260><c> liked</c><00:13:46.100><c> and</c>

that was really cool I liked and
 

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.460 align:start position:0%
that was really cool I liked and
guessing<00:13:46.970><c> it's</c><00:13:47.540><c> a</c><00:13:47.690><c> little</c><00:13:47.960><c> nod</c><00:13:48.110><c> to</c><00:13:48.140><c> Ray</c>

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:48.470 align:start position:0%
guessing it's a little nod to Ray
 

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:53.290 align:start position:0%

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:21.230 align:start position:0%
like the the time it takes and sort of

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:30.020 align:start position:0%

seems to move in a slower pace and they
 

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
seems to move in a slower pace and they
