00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:13.050
Poe 
met his bride-to-be, Virginia Clemm, when

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.620
she was 7 years old, and he was 20, shortly
after his mother’s death in 1829.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.970
Their parents, his natural father (David Poe)
and her mother (Maria Clemm), were siblings,

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.800
and Poe had moved into the Clemm home briefly
before his time at West Point was to begin.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.790
Being so close in time to the death of his
mother, some authors have opined that he transferred

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.000
his feelings for his mother to his Aunt Maria,
and later to his cousin.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.190
Regardless, it appears that Poe and Virginia
quickly became friends, and she even helped

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.230
him woo one of her neighbors, Mary Devereaux.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.620
It is reported that at one point, Virginia
obtained “a lock of Devereaux’s hair to

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.620
give to Poe.”

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.500
That fell through and at some point, Poe’s
amorous eye turned to Virginia.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.610
By 1835, people had noticed his interest in
the young girl.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.600
In fact, Virginia’s half-sister’s husband,
Neilson Poe, had even offered to “take her

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.140
in and have her educated in an attempt to
prevent the girl’s marriage at such a young

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.140
age.”

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.360
Outraged and fearing he would lose the pubescent
love of his life, in August 1835, Poe offered

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.909
to take in and provide for Virginia’s mother
and the remainder of the family, in exchange

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.200
for the marriage.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.939
His arguments and ardor must have prevailed
because: “Poe secretly married Virginia

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:20.170
. . . on September 22, 1835.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.600
He was 26 and she was 13, though she is listed
on the marriage certificate as being 21.”

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.570
There is some dispute as to whether or not
this secret ceremony ever occurred.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.729
Regardless, the two were married in public
on May 16, 1836.

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:30.729
Marital Bliss

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:31.729
Many Poe apologists have claimed that the
marriage between Virginia and Poe: “May

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.040
have been celibate, with the two living together
more as brother and sister, in any case there

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.040
is no evidence that she ever became pregnant.”

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.560
In support of this theory, some point to the
title character in Annabel Lee, a “maiden,”

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.560
whom many say was reflective of Virginia.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.560
This seems unlikely, however, for several
reasons, including her rare beauty: “She

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.560
had large black eyes, and a pearly whiteness
of complexion, which was a perfect pallor.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.560
Her pale face, her brilliant eyes, and her
raven hair gave her an unearthly look.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.560
One felt that she was almost a disrobed spirit…”

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.560
In addition, Virginia was devoted to Poe.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.560
She kept a picture of him under her pillow,
and even wrote this acrostic poem for him

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.560
as a Valentine’s Day gift in 1846:

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.579
Ever with thee I wish to roam –

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.200
Dearest my life is thine.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.780
Give me a cottage for my home

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.780
And a rich old cypress vine,

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.780
Removed from the world with its sin and care

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.060
And the tattling of many tongues.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.530
Love alone shall guide us when we are there
–

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.740
Love shall heal my weakened lungs;

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.040
And Oh; the tranquil hours we’ll spend,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.940
Never wishing that others may see!

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.660
Perfect ease we’ll enjoy, without thinking
to lend

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.009
Ourselves to the world and its glee –

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.310
Ever peaceful and blissful we’ll be.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.980
Despite Virginia’s adoration, Poe apparently
had a wandering eye, and at one point it landed

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.940
on Frances Sargent Osgood.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.470
The two exchanged letters that, at the very
least, expressed an interest.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.030
This was poorly received by a third lady,
Elizabeth F. Ellet, who seemingly also had

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.951
a crush on Poe (who wouldn’t?) and made
a fuss.

00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:33.260
A scandal ensued that involved allegations
of indiscretions and ultimately to rumors

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.480
that Poe was “subject to acts of lunacy.”

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.480
Although Virginia was aware of, and unconcerned
with, Poe’s flirtations, the nasty scandal

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.480
affected her deeply.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.480
Virginia’s Death

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.569
Beginning in January 1842, Virginia had developed
tuberculosis, then known as consumption.

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.620
Her health progressively worsened, and by
early in 1846, she had told a friend: “I

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.020
know I shall die soon; I know I can’t get
well; but I want to be as happy as possible,

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.300
and make Edgar happy.”

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.300
On her deathbed, some claim Virginia blamed
her demise on the jealous Mrs. Ellet, stating,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.300
“Mrs. E. had been her murderer.”

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.300
Virginia died on January 30, 1847.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.300
Immortal Virginia

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.940
Whatever else you can say about Poe, he apparently
loved Virginia deeply.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.050
According to one observer: “He used to cry
over her grave every day and kept it green

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.050
with flowers.”

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.190
It appears that he channeled his love for
Virginia into his work.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.090
In addition to the dead maiden in Annabel
Lee, she is also believed to be the subject

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.769
of the poem, Ulalume, as well as the “rare
and radiant maiden . . . Lenore” of The

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:16.769
Raven.

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.239
Virginia may also have been the inspiration
for Eleonara, The Oblong Box and Ligeia:

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.769
I saw that she must die . . . There had been
much in her stern nature to impress me with

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.290
the belief that, to her, death would have
come without its terrors; –but not so.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.870
Words are impotent to convey any just idea
of the fierceness of resistance with which

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.370
she wrestled with the Shadow.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.030
I groaned in anguish at the pitiable spectacle
. . . of her wild desire for life…

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.870
Although many people believe that girls as
young as 13 commonly married in the 18th and

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.910
19th centuries, this is not the case.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.180
According to census microdata crunched by
the University of Minnesota’s IPUMS, the

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.599
mean age for marriage for women born between
1821 and 1830 (Virginia was born in 1822)

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:02.849
was 22.6 years, and among those who ever got
married (which was over 90% of the female

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:45.500
population in those days), only 12.6% were
married by the time they were 19.
