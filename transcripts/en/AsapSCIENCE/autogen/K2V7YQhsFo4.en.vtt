 This episode is supported by (Himes) 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:08.220
 With more than three million Americans using steroid, the desire to amplify the muscles is high 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.420
 But what happens to your body when taking steroids? Are there significant risks to performance improvement real estate? 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.560
 Every time you lift weights in the club, your muscles are torn 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.060
 But the body heals by forming new protein filaments to repair muscle fibers. 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.820
 Over time, the number and density of these threads increases 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.180
 In the end, if the protein synthesis rate is higher than the fraction, your muscles will grow 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.960
 The hormone testosterone regulates the degree of growth, by increasing protein synthesis 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.740
 Which is behind the increase of muscle in men for women, because of higher levels of testosterone 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.340
 Steroid is any compound of four specific rings of carbon 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.980
 Steroid actually contains some chemical compounds that can be used to treat heat and headaches 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.820
 And even sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.400
 But the type of steroids that we will focus on is the one that mimics natural testosterone to improve performance 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.660
 Which is used by more than 15% of athletes. 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.200
 Within the first day of steroid use, your gene expression will begin to change. 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.900
 Steroid enters cells easily and binds to the androgen receptor 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.540
 At this stage it can move to the nucleus and adhere to the DNA 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.000
 Which will do hundreds of genes that increase protein synthesis and reduce its fracture. 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.360
 Steroid users can have three to five times the nuclei in some muscle cells. 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.420
 Steroid can also stop the differentiation of fatty stem cells 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.620
 And reduce the proportion of fat in the body. 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.080
 Within days, the volume and strength of your muscles will increase rapidly 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.620
 While keeping your muscle fibers from rupturing, which makes steroids ideal for exercise and recovery 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.080
 But if you continue to use it, your behavior will begin to change 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.400
 And the presence of steroid receptors in parts of the central nervous system 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.900
 Such as the anterior brain, pituitary gland and hypothalamus, steroid can lead to a rage revolution 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.620
 A study of athletes taking steroids showed that 20 percent had higher levels of mania and depression than non-users 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.820
 The mice that were given steroids over 10 weeks became more aggressive against other mice in the same cage 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.740
 Male rats have also become more controlled and willing to compete for sex with female rats 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.240
 But this desire for sex may not mean better sexual performance. 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.100
 For female users 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.940
 Steroids can interfere with the cycle of ejaculation and reduce libido. 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.080
 A male condition may also occur in women by gaining male voice and increasing the growth of facial and body hair. 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.040
 Male users may experience abnormalities in the sperm cells and lack of sperm count. 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.760
 Steroids also reduce the normal production of hormones necessary to maintain testicular size 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.100
 Which means the contraction of the testicles. 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.580
 As most steroids use periods of use and stop doses 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.480
 The normal levels of testosterone may be low at times 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.120
 Causing erectile dysfunction and reducing libido in males. 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.700
 It also increases the thoracic tissue to 40% of male users while breaking up steroids into estradiol 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.380
 Which stimulates the growth of breast tissue. 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.560
 Finally, steroid can cause high levels of acne among half the users 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.540
 And increases the risk of heart disease and stroke 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.360
 Yes, steroid will make you swell quickly and improve your athletic performance 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.680
 But like most things, it brings with it many risks and side effects that can happen to you. 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.760
