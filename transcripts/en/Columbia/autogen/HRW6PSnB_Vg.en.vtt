01:19:44.669 --> 01:19:46.399
riffing on Locke's definition of
identity in terms of infinity which is

01:19:46.399 --> 01:19:46.409
identity in terms of infinity which is
 

01:19:46.409 --> 01:19:49.219
identity in terms of infinity which is
very influential in the Romantic period

01:19:49.219 --> 01:19:49.229
very influential in the Romantic period
 

01:19:49.229 --> 01:19:52.040
very influential in the Romantic period
and basically Locke just says right we

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:52.050
and basically Locke just says right we
 

01:19:52.050 --> 01:19:53.989
and basically Locke just says right we
count we realize we could always add one

01:19:53.989 --> 01:19:53.999
count we realize we could always add one
 

01:19:53.999 --> 01:19:56.290
count we realize we could always add one
so we kind of believe in infinity

01:19:56.290 --> 01:19:56.300
so we kind of believe in infinity
 

01:19:56.300 --> 01:19:59.689
so we kind of believe in infinity
positive idea of it and then by that

01:19:59.689 --> 01:19:59.699
positive idea of it and then by that
 

01:19:59.699 --> 01:20:01.580
positive idea of it and then by that
logic we count the moments that we are

01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:01.590
logic we count the moments that we are
 

01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:03.649
logic we count the moments that we are
ourselves and we could always be

01:20:03.649 --> 01:20:03.659
ourselves and we could always be
 

01:20:03.659 --> 01:20:04.969
ourselves and we could always be
ourselves for one more moment so we

01:20:04.969 --> 01:20:04.979
ourselves for one more moment so we
 

01:20:04.979 --> 01:20:07.549
ourselves for one more moment so we
could always be ourselves forever so

01:20:07.549 --> 01:20:07.559
could always be ourselves forever so
 

01:20:07.559 --> 01:20:09.229
could always be ourselves forever so
that's how we have a cohesive idea of

01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239
that's how we have a cohesive idea of
 

01:20:09.239 --> 01:20:10.250
that's how we have a cohesive idea of
identity

01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:10.260
identity
 

01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:12.290
identity
and in William Wordsworth sort of

01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:12.300
and in William Wordsworth sort of
 

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:16.160
and in William Wordsworth sort of
romantic interpretation of that is to

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:16.170
romantic interpretation of that is to
 

01:20:16.170 --> 01:20:17.779
romantic interpretation of that is to
say and that's how we believe in sort of

01:20:17.779 --> 01:20:17.789
say and that's how we believe in sort of
 

01:20:17.789 --> 01:20:20.390
say and that's how we believe in sort of
the Eternity of our identity right so

01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400
the Eternity of our identity right so
 

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:22.669
the Eternity of our identity right so

scrapbooks and I was looking for
 

01:24:54.579 --> 01:24:57.029
scrapbooks and I was looking for
particular kinds at that point at

particular kinds at that point at
 

01:24:57.039 --> 01:25:00.390
particular kinds at that point at
various points and so the fact is that

01:25:00.390 --> 01:25:00.400
various points and so the fact is that
 

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.339

of cataloging that indicate you know it
 

01:25:26.050 --> 01:25:27.719
of cataloging that indicate you know it
allows you to do a forms on research

01:25:27.719 --> 01:25:27.729
allows you to do a forms on research
 

01:25:27.729 --> 01:25:30.839
allows you to do a forms on research
online might miss quite a few but

01:25:30.839 --> 01:25:30.849
online might miss quite a few but
 

01:25:30.849 --> 01:25:32.430
online might miss quite a few but
there's some very smart librarian

01:25:32.430 --> 01:25:32.440

maybe other just want to comment on that
 

01:25:41.690 --> 01:25:43.030
maybe other just want to comment on that
before we return to the question of

01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040
before we return to the question of
 

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:46.270
before we return to the question of
audience yeah I mean I would say my

01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:46.280
audience yeah I mean I would say my
 

01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:48.820
audience yeah I mean I would say my
manuscript book project has very

01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:48.830
manuscript book project has very
 

01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:51.520

similarly with like Ellen everywhere I
 

01:25:51.530 --> 01:25:58.990
similarly with like Ellen everywhere I
am I did just go in and say oh and they

01:25:58.990 --> 01:25:59.000
am I did just go in and say oh and they
 

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:04.120
am I did just go in and say oh and they
even have less of a genre than

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:04.130
even have less of a genre than
 

01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:14.470
even have less of a genre than
specialists and kind of unsearchable in

01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480
specialists and kind of unsearchable in
 

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:16.450
specialists and kind of unsearchable in
that way there's not really I have not

01:26:16.450 --> 01:26:16.460
that way there's not really I have not
 

01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:18.070
that way there's not really I have not
found any good terms

01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.080
found any good terms
 

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:22.300
found any good terms
hmm to put into search engines that will

01:26:22.300 --> 01:26:22.310
hmm to put into search engines that will
 

01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:23.920
hmm to put into search engines that will
then show me what's there so it really

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:23.930
then show me what's there so it really
 

01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:26.440
then show me what's there so it really
is a question of sort of looking at

01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:26.450
is a question of sort of looking at
 

01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:29.950
is a question of sort of looking at
finding aids for family papers and

01:26:29.950 --> 01:26:29.960
finding aids for family papers and
 

01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:33.160
finding aids for family papers and
institutional papers and talking to

01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:33.170
institutional papers and talking to
 

01:26:33.170 --> 01:26:37.600
institutional papers and talking to
librarians who generally do know I've

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:37.610
librarians who generally do know I've
 

01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:39.520
librarians who generally do know I've
been not working with Diaries which are

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:39.530
been not working with Diaries which are
 

01:26:39.530 --> 01:26:44.400
been not working with Diaries which are
the most normal form of that so I just

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:44.410
the most normal form of that so I just
 

01:26:44.410 --> 01:26:47.950
the most normal form of that so I just
there's just much more study of Diaries

01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:47.960
there's just much more study of Diaries
 

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:49.930
there's just much more study of Diaries
as a form people have tried to think

01:26:49.930 --> 01:26:49.940
as a form people have tried to think
 

01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:51.340
as a form people have tried to think
about those days my history books I'm

01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:51.350
about those days my history books I'm
 

01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:52.870
about those days my history books I'm
trying to think about the ones that are

01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880
trying to think about the ones that are
 

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:58.090
trying to think about the ones that are
that and they take very different forms

01:26:58.090 --> 01:26:58.100
that and they take very different forms
 

01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:01.780
that and they take very different forms
from each other and really I think it's

01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:01.790
from each other and really I think it's
 

01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:06.580
from each other and really I think it's
meant for me that I'm not I'm not trying

01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:06.590
meant for me that I'm not I'm not trying
 

01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:08.260
meant for me that I'm not I'm not trying
to be comprehensive I don't think I have

01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:08.270
to be comprehensive I don't think I have
 

01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:12.400
to be comprehensive I don't think I have
anywhere near any kind of I'm just

01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:12.410
anywhere near any kind of I'm just
 

01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:14.230
anywhere near any kind of I'm just
trying to find ones that I find

01:27:14.230 --> 01:27:14.240
trying to find ones that I find
 

01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:16.090
trying to find ones that I find
interesting and then try to understand

01:27:16.090 --> 01:27:16.100
interesting and then try to understand
 

01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:17.980
interesting and then try to understand
what's going on inside of them

01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:17.990
what's going on inside of them
 

01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:20.740
what's going on inside of them
and in different ways that that people

01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:20.750
and in different ways that that people
 

01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:25.630
and in different ways that that people
are using these empty books to tell

01:27:25.630 --> 01:27:25.640
are using these empty books to tell
 

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:28.740
are using these empty books to tell
stories that

01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:28.750
stories that
 

01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:31.980
stories that
they feel neat telling and that are not

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:31.990
they feel neat telling and that are not
 

01:27:31.990 --> 01:27:34.980
they feel neat telling and that are not
stories that are that generally get into

stories that are that generally get into
 

01:27:34.990 --> 01:27:36.990
stories that are that generally get into
print enough and I guess part of what I

01:27:36.990 --> 01:27:37.000
print enough and I guess part of what I
 

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.890
print enough and I guess part of what I
found really moving about the big in

01:27:40.890 --> 01:27:40.900
found really moving about the big in
 

01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:46.320
found really moving about the big in
book is that what became for me the most

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:46.330
book is that what became for me the most
 

01:27:46.330 --> 01:27:48.630
book is that what became for me the most
poignant story in it that is the story

01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:48.640
poignant story in it that is the story
 

01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:52.440

quite telling in it that there's no
 

01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:58.740
quite telling in it that there's no
place in the book it is and my daughter

place in the book it is and my daughter
 

01:27:58.750 --> 01:28:03.480
place in the book it is and my daughter
Alice right so there's sort of like a

01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:03.490
Alice right so there's sort of like a
 

01:28:03.490 --> 01:28:06.090
Alice right so there's sort of like a
hidden book inside the book that is it's

01:28:06.090 --> 01:28:06.100
hidden book inside the book that is it's
 

01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:08.490
hidden book inside the book that is it's
it's most powerful piece of plot I

01:28:08.490 --> 01:28:08.500
it's most powerful piece of plot I
 

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:11.340
it's most powerful piece of plot I

say oh yes I understand now that can I
just pick up on that that also speaks to

01:28:19.230 --> 01:28:19.240
just pick up on that that also speaks to
 

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:21.300
just pick up on that that also speaks to
the importance of actually say looking

01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:21.310
the importance of actually say looking
 

01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:25.620
the importance of actually say looking
to knock bookstores or ebay but to

01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:25.630
to knock bookstores or ebay but to
 

01:28:25.630 --> 01:28:26.850
to knock bookstores or ebay but to
library collections where you actually

01:28:26.850 --> 01:28:26.860
library collections where you actually
 

01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:28.590
library collections where you actually
have some information on the person who

01:28:28.590 --> 01:28:28.600
have some information on the person who
 

01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.470
have some information on the person who
made it so that you could then work out

01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:31.480
made it so that you could then work out
 

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:33.060
made it so that you could then work out
your the name of the person and then get

01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:33.070
your the name of the person and then get
 

01:28:33.070 --> 01:28:34.770
your the name of the person and then get
back over to the census records so I

01:28:34.770 --> 01:28:34.780
back over to the census records so I
 

01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:37.290
back over to the census records so I
mean otherwise if it's an anonymous work

01:28:37.290 --> 01:28:37.300
mean otherwise if it's an anonymous work
 

01:28:37.300 --> 01:28:41.190
