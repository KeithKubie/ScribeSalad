00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.240
The Christmas Card That Became A Christmas
Movie

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:19.940
It’s a Wonderful Life was based on a “Christmas
Card” short story by Philip Van Doren Stern,

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.590
which was originally sent out to around 200
of Stern’s friends and family in December

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.529
of 1943.

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.040
The short story was called The Greatest Gift
and was inspired by a dream Stern had one

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.600
night in the 1930s.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.079
Stern, already an accomplished author at this
point, albeit a historical author, then proceeded

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.309
to write the 4,000 word short story about
a man named George who was going to commit

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.350
suicide by jumping off a bridge, but was stopped
when someone happened by and struck up a conversation

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.350
with him.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.149
The mysterious person eventually learns that
George wishes he’d never been born and grants

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:57.569
George his wish.

00:00:57.569 --> 00:01:02.030
George soon discovers that no one he knows
recognizes him and that many of the people

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.860
he’d known were worse off in their lives
because he had never existed.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.800
Most prominent among these was his little
brother who had drowned because he had not

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.970
been there to save him.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.080
George eventually gets the stranger to change
everything back to the way it was and is now

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.430
glad to be alive.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.150
Stern initially sought to find a publisher
for his short, 21 page story, but failed in

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.080
this endeavor, so decided to make a “Christmas
Card” style gift out of it and printed 200

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.380
copies which he sent out to friends and family
in December of 1943.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.770
This ended up being a gift that gave back,
as the work eventually found its way into

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.730
the hands of producer David Hempstead who
worked for RKO Pictures.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:46.500
RKO pictures then paid Stern $10,000 (around
$124,000 today) for the motion picture rights

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.800
to the story, just four months after Stern
had sent it out.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.110
Various adaptations were then written before
the screenplay version of the story was sold

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.140
to Frank Capra’s production company in 1945,
also for $10,000.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.170
Capra’s company subsequently adapted the
story further and ultimately made it into

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.140
It’s a Wonderful Life, which debuted in
1946.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.480
Interestingly while the story was based on
The Greatest Gift, the character of George

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.700
Bailey was actually based partly on the founder
of Bank of America, A.P. Giannini.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.670
Giannini was also the inspiration for a similar
character in Capra’s American Madness.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.040
At the age of 14, Giannini left school and
began working with his step father, Lorenzo

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.770
Scatena, in the produce industry as a produce
broker.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.980
By the time he was 31, he was able to sell
much of his interest in this company to his

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.549
employees and had planned to retire.

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.739
However, one year later, he was asked to join
the Columbus Savings &amp; Loan Society, which

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.680
was a small bank in North Beach, California.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.609
Once he joined up, he found that almost nobody
at the Savings &amp; Loan, nor other banks, were

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.840
willing to give loans to anyone but the rich
or those owning businesses.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.540
At first, Giannini attempted to convince the
other directors at the Savings &amp; Loan to start

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.640
lending to working class citizens, to give
them home and auto loans, among other things.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.519
He felt that working class citizens, though
lacking in assets to guarantee the loan against,

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.889
were generally honest and would pay back their
loans when they could.

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:22.260
Further, by loaning them money, it would allow
working class citizens to better themselves

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.370
in ways they would not have been able to do
without the money lent to them, such as being

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.920
able to buy a home or to start a new business.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.250
He was never able to convince the other directors
to begin lending to the working class.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.200
So he raised funds to start his own bank,
the Bank of Italy, which later became the

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.379
Bank of America.

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.680
He then made a practice of not offering loans
based on how much money or equity a person

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.150
had, but based primarily on how he judged
their character.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.030
Within a year, Bank of Italy had over $700,000
in deposits from these working class individuals,

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.620
which is somewhere around $15-$20 million
today.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.959
By the middle of the 1920s, it had become
the third largest bank in the United States.

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.950
Much like the fictitious George Bailey, Giannini
kept little for himself through all this.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.370
Despite that fact that the bank he started
was worth billions at the time of his death,

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.200
Giannini’s entire estate was valued at only
$500,000 when he died at the age of 79 in

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200
1949.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.879
He avoided acquiring great wealth as he felt
it would cause him to lose touch with the

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:22.950
working class.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.160
For much of his career, he refused pay for
his work and when the board attempted to give

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.360
him $1.5 million as a bonus one year, he gave
it all away to the University of California

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.919
stating “Money itch is a bad thing.

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:59.310
I never had that trouble.”
