00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:02.827
x = 4.

00:00:02.827 --> 00:00:08.930
This equation takes more steps to solve
for x, but our goal is still the same.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.017
We still want the variable on one side
of the equation with a coefficient of 1.

00:00:14.017 --> 00:00:16.855
The steps to solve for
x are first, add or

00:00:16.855 --> 00:00:19.788
subtract to get the variable term alone.

00:00:19.788 --> 00:00:26.029
So that means subtracting
1 from both sides,

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.789
which leaves us with 4x + 0 = 17- 1,

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.522
or just 4x = 16.

00:00:34.522 --> 00:00:37.492
The next step is to multiply or
divide so

00:00:37.492 --> 00:00:40.850
that the coefficient
on the variable is 1.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.071
So that means we'd need to divide both
sides by something to get x alone.

00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:47.257
And so we should divide by 4.

00:00:47.257 --> 00:00:50.940
We can cross out the 4s and

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.140
we're left with x = 16/4 = 4.
