00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.240
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Harbster:
Good morning, afternoon,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.100
11:30 is always afternoon, morning.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.050
My name is Jennifer Harbster.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.200
I am a Research and Reference
Specialist here at the Library

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.570
of Congress for the Science,
Technology and Business Division.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.360
And I'd like to welcome
you to today's program,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.770
Icy Volcanism in the
Outer Solar System.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.330
This program is part of a 2015
series of lectures that's presented

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.780
through a partnership
between our division

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.530
and NASA's Goddard
Space Flight Center.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.080
And I am very happy to report
that this is the 9th year

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.210
that the library has been
partnering with Goddard.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.220
It is my pleasure to introduce
today's speaker, Dr. Lynnae Quick,

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.750
who is a Research Scientist

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.160
at Goddard's Planetary
Geodynamics Laboratory.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.100
Dr. Quick received her
undergraduate degree in Physics

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.460
at North Carolina Agriculture
and Technical State University,

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.180
a Master's Degree in Physics at
Catholic University and a Masters

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.270 position:56%
and a Doctorate, way to go, in Earth

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.800
and Planetary Sciences
at Johns Hopkins.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.990
In addition to her work at
Goddard, Dr. Quick does outreach

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.870
to inspire girls into STEM careers.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.650
She has been featured on the
Women and Planetary Science Blog,

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.630 position:56%
which I have to plug for the library
because we are archiving the Women

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.980
in Planetary Science Blog
for our web archive project,

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.830
and she's also been involved

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.320
with the Carnegie Science Center
STEM Initiative called CanTEEN

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.580
Program that inspires
girls into Science careers.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.420
As you will discover, Dr.
Quick has a really exciting

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.420
and I think dreamy job
that includes volcanoes,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.450
icy moons in distant worlds.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.650 position:56%
She uses analytical methods to model
volcanic and cryovolcanic processes

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.690
on the terrestrial planets and the
moons of the outer solar system

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.040
with a particular emphasis
on Jupiter's moon, Europa.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.620
Her other research projects
focus on Venus volcanism,

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.260
stability of a subsurface ocean
on Triton and that's Triton,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.710
which is Neptune's moon, not
Titan which is Saturn's moon,

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.710
and the Europa imaging system.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.460
So let's get to learning about icy
volcanoes in the outer solar system

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.630
and join me in welcoming Dr. Lynnae
Quick to Library of Congress.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.930
[applause]

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.930
&gt;&gt; Lynnae Quick: Ok good morning.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.360
I'm very happy to be here.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.450
I'm used to walking
around a little bit

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.320
as I'm talking so please
bear with me.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.950
So this is, thank you so
much for the introduction,

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.670
and so this is work that I've done
in collaboration with Lori Glaze

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.370
at NASA Goddard, Steve Baloga at
Proxemy Research and Bruce Marsh

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.940
at Johns Hopkins University.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.730
And so you can see here,
to my right, your left,

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.700
so this is an artist
conception of an icy volcano

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.250
or of a cryovolcano
erupting on an icy moon.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.530
And then next to it we see a
picture of Jupiter's moon, Europa,

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.280
which I have to say is my favorite
moon in the outer solar systems

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.670
and we'll talk about this.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.680
Before we go there, these
pictures were floating

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.810
around Facebook actually last
week and I got very excited,

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.810
these are two images from the
Agricultural and Mechanical College

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.790
in Greensboro, North Carolina,
now North Carolina Agricultural

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.460
and Technical and State
University in 1899.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.210
And so this is the school where I
received my Bachelor's Degree from.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.460 position:56%
And then you see one image
students in a biological laboratory.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.440
And as our model, the model
of our school that goes

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.140
with our seal, is Minds and Hands.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.110
It's an agricultural
school so you know you have

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.740
to teach them something that has
to do with agriculture and farming.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.870
So there they are in their Sunday
best learning how to churn butter.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.450
And this young lady here looks
like she could not, you know,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.270
she looks like she could
not be any less happy

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.140
in her Sunday best learning
how to churn butter.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.700
When I was at A&amp;T we still
had biological laboratory.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.670
We have a farm, nice cows and
pigs and all of those things

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.710
but I can say I never took
a butter churning class.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.300
[laughter] So she's probably,

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.660
hopefully she's thinking
about planets.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.610
So again these images are ones
that you all have in the Library

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.120
of Congress and I'll
was glad to see them.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.940
I'm sure that they will
be glad that I'm here.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.550
So let's get into talking
about cryovolcanism.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.230
So here's an outline of my talk.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.030
You're going to see that there are
lots of nice pretty pictures here.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.980
This again is an artist
conception of a surface

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.670
of an icy body in the solar system.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.150
First I'm going to talk about
volcanism in our solar system,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.980
what are the different types.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.290
Give you an introduction
to cryovolcanism.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.590
What is it?

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.890
Where do we find it?

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.070
Then we'll talk about Europa's
physical properties and evidence

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.000
for cryovolcanism there
or icy volcanism.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.010
We'll talk about the
composition of these lavas.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.730
I'll talk briefly about a
model that I've developed

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.210
with some of my colleagues.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.260
We'll talk about the
implications of that model.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.490
Then we'll touch on
NASA's Europa mission.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.320
That's very exciting.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.690
And then just leave you
with a few lasting words

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.100
on the importance of icy moons.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.600
So there's the outline.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.460
So let's talk about the types of
volcanism in our solar system.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.450
What you all are used to, what we
see on earth is Silicic Volcanism

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:39.200
and again that's volcanism
that we see on the earth.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.130
It's happened on earth's moon,
on planet Mars, the planet Venus,

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.520
also on Jupiter's moon, Io,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.990
there's lots of silicic
volcanism happening even now.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.490
And so this is where the lava
or the magma is molten rock.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.730
And so I'm going to use lava and
magma interchangeably so both

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.130
of them are the same material.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.680
It's just magma is this molten
rock when it's in the subsurface.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.250
After it erupts onto the surface
that's lava, same material.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.860
And so then we have silicic
volcanism, which is what we're used

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.500
to on earth and other terrestrial
bodies, and cryovolcanism

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.730
which is what I'm going to talk
about today and this occurs

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.890
on the icy moons of
Saturn and Jupiter.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.470
It may occur on some of the Kuiper
belt objects like Pluto and Charon

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.860
and possibly on hydrous asteroids
like the asteroids ceres and again,

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.450
cryolava, or cryomagma, I'll
be using that interchangeably.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.590
And so usually these are just
fluids that are aqueous solutions.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.900
Can be pure water.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.980
Can have water mixed with salts,
mineral acids, ice crystals,

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.100
gas bubbles, water vapors,
carbon dioxide, things like that

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.670
so we'll talk about that.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.380
So let's back up a
little bit and talk

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.720
about silicic volcanism
just for one more slide.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.800
There are two types of lava that
we're familiar with on earth.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.840
There's the mafic lava which
is rich in iron and magnesium.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.920
It has an eruption temperature
greater than 900 degrees Celsius.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.820
And this type of lava,
the salt is mafic lava

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.330
and if you've ever seen any
eruptions in Hawaii or pictures

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.910
of eruptions in Hawaii, you know

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.570
that this type of lava
is very quiet.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.870
It's very effusive.

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.610
It likes to erupt and just
quietly flow along the ground.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.160
There's no explosive eruption.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.850
There's not much gas or much
volatiles in these eruptions.

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.180
And then we have felsic lavas.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.500
And these lavas, such
as rhyolite and dacite,

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.720
they're rich in aluminum,
potassium and other elements.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.800
They have slightly smaller eruption
temperature than mafic lava.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.600
And they're full of
gases and volatiles.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.620
And these are very high
viscosity explosive eruptions.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:43.960
We see here on this slide, Krakatoa
in Indonesia which is erupting.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.510
There's a lot of felsic lava here.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.950
If you think about Mt. St. Helens,
that's a lot of felsic lava.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.700 position:56%
So mafic lava, quiet, effusive,
flowing, gentle, everything is fine.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.680
Felsic lava you want to run.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.980
It's explosive.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.280
It's very violent.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:04.630 position:56%
And so when we think about
cryovolcanism we also have this kind

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.120
of effusive aqueous lava
that just flows nicely

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.270
and we also have explosive
cryovolcanism that occurs.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.470
And so explosive cryovolcanism
is kind of what you see

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:14.770
on this artist conception.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.680
It's geyser like eruptions
where you have ice particles,

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.730
water vaper, maybe carbon dioxide.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.180
And again when I say ice particles
a lot of times it's water ice.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.850
And as you move out further
and further and further

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:29.920
into the outer solar system you
might have nitrogen ice just

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.220
erupting very violently.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:34.350
Think about old faithful,
old faithful in Yellow Stone,

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.420
but very big and very cold.

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.650
And so you also have
effusive eruptions

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:42.630
which again are just these fluids.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.170
You may have ammonia as
a liquid once you get

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:46.910
out to the outer solar
system because it's so cold

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.430
when it's flowing onto to the
surface very acquiescently.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:53.020
And so one thing to keep in mind is
that these eruptions are occurring

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.310 position:56%
on bodies that are extremely frigid.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:59.770
So their surface temperatures
are between negative 233

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.500
and negative 173 degrees Celsius.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.470
So these are cold moons
and cold objects.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:10.120
And if you think about, at that
temperature, ice is so cold

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.870
that it behaves the way
bedrock behaves on earth.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.670
So there're really some interesting
stuff that happens there.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.960
And so you can see that the maximum
eruption temperature of a cryolava,

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.610
you see here, is 0 degrees Celsius.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.920
Here that's pretty cold, water
is, you know, it's freezing.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.340
Out there that's hot.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.330
It's very, very hot.

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:31.410
And so we've already talked about
where it occurs and I'll talk

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:33.330
about some of these bodies.

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.720
And one thing to think
about when we're talking

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.590
about cryovolcanism is you
can't always compare apples

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.770
to apples with volcanism on earth.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.170
Cryovolcanism in some
sense is a misnomer.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:48.480
Now I'll tell you why, so
we see all these images.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.860
I don't know can you
all see the little arrow

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.570
from my cursor, yes or no?

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.240
It doesn't look like people can.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:02.040
Ok, alright, so we have on the top
left we have an infusive eruption.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.380
This is the quiet eruption.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.110
The basaltic lava erupting
from Mauna Loa in Hawaii.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:11.310
Then beside that we have Mt. St.
Helens, an explosive eruption.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.250
Then on the bottom,
the very first picture

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:19.110
to your left is a fissure eruption
and this is also in Hawaii.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:22.030
And so these first three images
that I've pointed you to,

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.840
nobody would say these are
not volcanic processes.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.370
You have volcanism going on.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:28.730
It's clear these are
volcanic processes.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:32.360 position:56%
But if you look at the kind of
yellow, tannish figure on the bottom

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.770
in the center this is a fumarole
where we have just steam coming

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:38.730
up from earth's surface and
then here's Old Faithful Geyser.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:41.170
So nobody on earth would
say that this fumarole

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:44.450
and this geyser is
a volcano erupting.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.750
But because of these, when we get
out into the outer solar system,

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.770 position:56%
all of these processes on this slide
would be considered cryovolcanism

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.230
simply because of the
materials that these moons

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:55.550
or these bayous are made of.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.060
Again, they're made of ice.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:58.360
They're made of water.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.660
They're made of carbon dioxide.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.720
So any venting that you see form
the surface, whether it looks

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.020
like a geyser, whether it looks
like something that's erupting

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.110
from an icy volcano, we
call that cryovolcanism.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.530
So we've talked about
cryovolcanism, the differences

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.760
between cryovolcanism and
just the silicic volcanism

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.060
that we see on earth.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.160
So what was our first,
first look at cryovolcanism

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.200
in the outer solar system?

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.270 position:56%
Well our first look was when Voyager
2 flew by Neptune's moon, Triton,

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.960
this is the largest moon of Neptune
and you see Triton at the top here.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.560
I will say Triton is a sphere.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.810
The reason that it looks like
this is because the camera,

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:36.320
when it took a picture
on the spacecraft,

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.820
was not able to get a lot
of the moon hemisphere

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.730
but I promise you it's
not cut off like that.

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:46.720
[laughter] I have to say that
I don't want anybody to think,

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.180
you know, it's funky looking
but it's actually a sphere.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.590
And I like Triton.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.900
I have to say when I was
much younger it was one

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.550
of my favorite moons because
it's actually tinted pink

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:56.850
and I love pink.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:02.480 position:56%
So we see that we have these, if you
look at the bottom going from left

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:08.020
to right, we see these wall
planes units in the first image

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:12.140
on your left and the
image in the middle.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:15.080
This is the exact same surface
just from two different viewpoints.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.950 position:56%
And what it looks like, these
depressions are about 200 kilometers

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:22.630
across and they're
depressions and we believe

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:28.020
that ammonia lava's flowed into
these depressions and filled these

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.610
up and kind of made
a smooth surface.

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:34.850
The surface of Triton is
negative 200 degrees Celsius

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:38.600
so having liquid ammonia
there to flow can happen.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.880
And if you look at the bottom,
the south pole of Triton here,

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.380
and then you look at the
image right below that,

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.390
you can see these dark streaks.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.390 position:56%
These are actually nitrogen geysers.

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.410
And the Voyager team was so
excited when they first saw these

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:57.210
so they're similar to Old
Faithful but erupting again cold.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.570
They're 8 kilometers
above the surface.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.020
And so it's pretty cool.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.000
That was our first
look at cryovolcanism

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.420 position:56%
and so everybody was really excited.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.880
After these images were taken
people started looking at images

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.160
from other moons that the
Voyager spacecraft had looked at.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.980
If you remember Voyager 1 and
Voyager 2 did kind of a grand tour

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.840
of the outer solar system
and took these images

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.500
of several different moons.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.600
And so anywhere that there
was a smooth surface,

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.050
people thought oh my gosh, here's
an icy moon, don't see craters.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.350
There's a smooth surface.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:25.650
We don't see many depressions.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:28.160
There has to be cryovolcanism
everywhere.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.180
And so people were excited.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.130
People looked more at those images.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.400
The Galileo Spacecraft
went to the Jupiter system.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.700
It was great.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.060
And we found out after a couple of
years that cryovolcanism was not

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:42.340 position:56%
as widespread as people had assumed
and that was because we were looking

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.460
at low resolution images
at the time.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.760
And so as technology got better

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.760
and we had more missions then we
sent Cassini to the Saturn system

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.470
to look at Enceladus and
this is Enceladus here.

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.260
Enceladus is a cute little moon
and again the image is cut off,

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:02.520 position:56%
one side of it is in the shadow, but
I promise you it is also a sphere.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.860
And so it's a moon of Saturn.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.400
It's a little warmer than Triton,

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.450
maybe 198 degrees Celsius
on the surface.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:14.040
And we saw these spectacular
things when we looked at it.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.340
We saw these geysers
erupting from the South Pole.

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.720
And these geysers are
mostly water ice.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.630
There's some ammonia in there.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.100
There's evidence for
rocky particles and salts.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.320
And these geysers are, they
extend way out into space

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.980
to 500 kilometers off the
surface of tiny Enceladus.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.290
And this is really crazy
because Enceladus is a moon

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:38.670
that has a radius of 252 kilometers
which means it's about the size,

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:42.100
it has a radius about
the size of Great Britain

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.080
so it's very, very small.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.350
But you have all of this going on.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:48.930
And if you look at the
bottom of this image

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.910
of Enceladus you should
see these kind of bluish,

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.140
in the South Pole you see
kind of these bluish lines.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.670
We call those the tiger
stripes and that's

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.620 position:56%
where these geysers are coming from.

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.190
And so it's really exciting.

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:03.630
We've also learned that these
geysers actually feed ice

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:06.850
to Saturn's E ring, to
one of Saturn's rings

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:09.400
so these particles
are really moving.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.700
So that's great.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.400
We've seen Triton.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.050
We've seen Enceladus.

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:15.350
What else?

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:21.060
Well then there's Titan and Titan
is not to be confused with Triton.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.360
[laughter] Of course.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.810
And so Titan is Saturn's
largest moon.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:26.780
It's the only moon
in our solar system

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.380
with an appreciable atmosphere.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.680
It's very dynamic.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.110
There's lots of cool
things going on there.

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:34.030
And so there's been kind
of speculative evidence

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.830
for cryovolcanism on Titan.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:40.080
If we look at the first image
at the bottom to your left,

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:45.520
Ganesa Macula is the, there
are three images, well,

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:49.550
yeah three images so the first one
to your left you see Ganesa Macula.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.370
And people got real excited when
we first took these radar images

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:56.930
and people thought, oh my gosh,
here is an icy volcanic dome

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.740
or cryovolcanic dome on
the surface of Titan.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.440
And the reason being is because if
you look to the image of the right

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.880
of that, the image to the right
of that is the Rusalka dome

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.620
and that is a volcanic dome
made by very viscus lavas

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.450
on the surface of the planet Venus.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:13.940
And people thought oh my
gosh, they look just alike

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.780
and they're even arrows
here on Ganesa Macula

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:21.780
on Titan showing what we thought
were cryolava flows erupting

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:26.370 position:56%
from the top of that circular
feature which we thought was a vent.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:29.360
And so people were very
excited about that.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.320
Then Cassini took more
images and we found

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.010
out the Ganesa Macula is
not a cryovolcanic dome.

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:38.310
It's actually a feature
that's caused by tectonics.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:42.060
It looks like this because
we have different movements

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.520 position:56%
in the crust and in the lithosphere.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.870
When you take images from different
angles you're actually able to see

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:48.990
that this is not cryovolcanic
feature at all.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:50.710 position:56%
So we thought oh, that's really sad.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.800
No cryovolcanism on Titan.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:59.930
And so then in 2010 and 2013 we
took some images of this region

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.340
on the surface Sotra Facula.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:06.060
And you know it appears
bright in radar images.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:10.260
It has irregular terrain,
which we now believe

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.400
that Sotra Facula is a cryovolcano.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.640
And some of these white
features that you see,

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.140
this is to your far
right, are cryolava flows.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.610
So that's great.

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:24.300
We think there's cryovolcanism
on Titan.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.100
We think Sotra Facula is it.

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.640
People are still studying that.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:30.040
One thing that I will
say is Titan has a very,

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.480
since it has such a thick, dense
atmosphere we wouldn't expect

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.540
to see anything explosive.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.840
No geysers.

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.290
We would expect to see just
these thick viscus lava's

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.360
that meander across the surface.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.660
So that's great.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.290
We've talked about
Triton, Enceladus, Titan.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.770
What about Kuiper Belt Objects?

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:52.170 position:56%
And Pluto, poor little demoted
Pluto, which was a planet when I was

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:56.700
in elementary school, but
it's, you know, new horizons.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.640
I don't know if you all heard about
the new horizons mission that's run

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.180
out of Johns Hopkins Applied
Physics laboratory in NASA.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:09.180
And so we're getting back images
from new horizons as we speak

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:10.790
and they're still downloading data.

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:12.090
They're still analyzing it.

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:15.200
And so this is a true
color image of Pluto now.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.130 position:56%
That heart shaped region is Tombaugh
Regio named after Clyde Tombaugh

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:20.740
who first discovered Pluto.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.710
And something that's
really, really interesting,

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.660 position:56%
if we look at the picture, start
looking at the picture to the right,

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.550
if we zoom in on Tombaugh
Regio we see that there's a lot

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.760
of smooth surfaces and
we did not expect that.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:36.480
We expected there to be a lot
of impact craters and lots

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.090
of depressions so we didn't
expect that smooth surface.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.180
And it's been theorized that the
smooth surface may either be ice,

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.950
just ice flowing across the
surface just meandering.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.560
Or the project Scientist

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.690
for new horizons during the
press conference said something

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:50.020
that made me very happy.

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.970
He said cryovolcanism,
maybe geysers.

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:54.270
We're still getting in data.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:55.570
And so if we look at this picture

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:59.580
to the bottom left you see these
mountains, these little mountains

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.850
and wrinkles and bumps
and uplifts and in

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.830
between them the surface
is very smooth.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.800
So that could be cryolava flows.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:12.490 position:56%
And I will say that before new
horizons reached Pluto we did have a

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.990
workshop where we talked about what
we thought we might see on Pluto.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:19.010
And Pluto, it was thought,
to be very similar

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:22.010
to Neptune's moon Triton where
we first saw cryovolcanism.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.220
So a lot of the theories said there
would be cryovolcanism on Pluto

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.670
so we see some surfaces that
makes us happy but we're going

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:30.240
to have to wait a little bit.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.290 position:56%
So then there's Pluto's moon Charon.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:37.540 position:56%
And Charon is much more geologically
complex than we thought it would be.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.030
And this again is a new
image from New Horizons.

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:44.530
And one interesting thing about
Pluto is, I'm sorry, about Charon,

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.610
at other Kuiper Belt
items such as Quaoar,

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.940
I don't know if you
all have heard of that,

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:53.570 position:56%
is that telescopic observations from
earth reveal there's crystalline ice

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:55.810
on the surfaces of these bodies.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:57.830
Why do we care that
there's crystalline ice?

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.120
Well these bodies don't have
appreciable atmospheres.

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.110 position:56%
And so any ice that's on the surface

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:05.550
of these bodies we would
think it would be amorphous

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.220
and by crystalline amorphous,
crystalline is just you have ice

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.640
and all the molecules and atoms
are in this nice ordered structure,

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.710
amorphous ice is when
it becomes disordered.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.680
So we expect to see disordered
amorphous ice on the surface

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.420
of these moons, I'm sorry, on
the surface of these bodies.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.660
And so telescopic observation shows

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.010
that there's been crystalline
ice on these bodies.

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:29.250 position:56%
Crystalline ice can't stay on these
bodies for very long periods of time

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:32.720
because they have no atmosphere,
they're hit with different,

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:37.150 position:56%
you know, different objects, comets,
asteroids, even some of, you know,

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:39.650
some particles from the
sun streaming way out.

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:42.410
So any time you have crystalline
ice on the surface of a body

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:46.150
with no atmosphere that's
this far out, that is a sign

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:48.630
that something has replenished
the ice on the surface

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.880
and brought something
new from the subsurface.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.930
So that was taken to be a sign of
possible cryovolcanism on Charon

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:56.230
and other Quaoar objects.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:59.480
Again, this third bullet point
says New Horizon's data is still

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.230
coming in.

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:05.090
And so we'll, hopefully
they'll find something.

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:06.840
That will make me very happy.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.510
And then now we're looking
at water-rich asteroids

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:13.560
so this is the asteroid,
Ceres is the largest asteroid

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.860
in our asteroid belt.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:19.110 position:56%
It's a lot warmer than the other
bodies that I've been talking about.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:20.940
It's a lot closer in.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.080
So it's a water rich asteroid.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.940
It's the largest asteroid
in the asteroid belt.

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.910
And like I was saying it's a
little bit further in then some

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:30.210
of the bodies we've
been talking about.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:32.440
You can tell because it has a
pretty warm surface temperature

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:35.310
of negative 105 degrees
Celsius whereas Triton we start

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:37.180
out at negative 230.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.970
And so it's closer in, if
we think about the order

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.490 position:56%
of the planets from the sun outward.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:46.800
We have Mercury, Venus,
Earth, then we have Mars,

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.100
then we have the asteroid belt.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.560
That's where we find Ceres and
everything else is farther out.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.990
So Ceres is pretty cool.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:56.650
It has this interesting, if you
look at this picture on the bottom,

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:59.570
it has this interesting
internal structure.

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:03.340
It has a rocky core from
inside out, a rocky core.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.990
Then there's a water ice layer.

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:09.330
And then there's this
thin dusty crust.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:12.220 position:56%
And there's lots of clays and things

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.840
like brucite on the
surface of Ceres.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.630
And brucite is a mineral
that has the formula MG0H2

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.240
and that's basically Maalox.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.930
That's basically Milk of Magnesia.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:31.280
[laughter] So you have this nice
dusty Milk of Magnesia crust

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.580 position:56%
on Ceres so it's pretty interesting.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.680
And you notice that
there's a water ice layer.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.600 position:56%
And when we say that things in the
solar system have a water ice layer,

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:44.360 position:56%
that's always kind of tricky because
that means that there's a chance

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.430
for there to be water and
ice but we're not sure

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:51.070
within that layer how much of it
is water and how much of it is ice.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.550
So the thinking is that Ceres
may have a subsurface ocean,

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.070 position:56%
which would be very cool if it does.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:00.110
Dawn just reached Ceres
a couple of months ago.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:02.440
I think right before New
Horizons reached Pluto.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.160
So we're still learning more.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.310 position:56%
This is a new image up top of Ceres.

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.980
And something that's
interesting is that ESA,

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.430
which is the European Space Agency,

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:16.190
their Herschel Space Observatory
actually observed water vapor being

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:18.450
spewed out into space
from two spots on Ceres.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:19.860
And this is just an
artist's conception.

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:21.460
This is not what they saw.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.140
No one actually saw this.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:27.550
And so they now believe that that
water vapor could have been due

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:31.480
to cryovolcanoes or geysers
just pumping water vapor out.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.630
And so that's an exciting place.

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:36.490
We also see if we look
at the picture of Ceres,

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:40.280
this is a real picture of Ceres
up at the top to your left,

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.430 position:56%
there are two bright spots, and I
don't know if everyone can see those

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:48.540
but those bright spots are either
thought to be salts or ices,

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:52.940
either way, two of the theories are
that they were brought up either

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.120
by actually icy volcanoes
or icy geysers.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.440
So either way Ceres
is very interesting.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:04.050
So we have, we talked about
this, and is it almost 12:00?

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:08.510
Ok so we talked about this
and so now let's get to Europa

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:10.700
which is the moon that I
did my dissertation on.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.310
My favorite moon in
the outer solar system.

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:16.910
And you can see that Europa
has this opaque white surface

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:18.530
and that's the ice.

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:22.500
And then you have these
reddish brown regions

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.220
which we believe are salts.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.440
You have lots of these
lines across the surface.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:32.420
And those lines, singular
for those lines is linear,

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.530
plural for those lines is linea.

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:37.000
So there's a certain conference
that I go to and whenever I talk

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.670
about Europa someone always
tweets her name is Lynnae

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:41.060
and she's talking about Europa.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.460
There are lots of linea.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:43.760
[laughter] What a fitting name.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:50.080
So it's just, maybe I was born
to study Europa, who knows?

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.760
So let's talk about
Europa from the inside out.

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.380
You have a small iron core.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.960
You have a rocky layer
or a rocky mantle.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.910
And then you have a water ice
shell but remember what I told you

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:06.700
about water ice shells, some
part is ice, some part is water.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:10.180
We're never 100 percent
sure which part is which.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.100
We can tell by looking at
pictures of Europa that the outside

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.500
of it is ice, that makes
sense, the crust is ice

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.390
because ice is less
dense than water.

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:18.800
We know that ice cubes
float in water

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.810
so that makes sense the
ice would be at the top.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:24.100
Below it we believe
that from measurements

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.620
by the Galileo Spacecraft
that there are,

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.170
there's an extensive
ocean beneath it.

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:32.840
And so this water ice
layer is between 100

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.930
and 150 kilometers thick.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:39.580
And so we think that the ice
layer at most is maybe, you know,

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.630
somewhere between 20
to 40 kilometers thick

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:43.110
so that's a lot of water.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:46.520
Europa actually has twice the
amount of water that the earth has.

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:50.750
And if you look at this image
of at the bottom of earth

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:54.280
and then our moon and Europa, you
see how much smaller Europa is

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:58.310
than earth so to have that
much water is just astounding.

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:01.530
And so one thing that's
interesting about Europa is it's

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:04.480
about 90 percent ice
and 10 percent rock.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:09.150
We call it icy satellite but really
it's mostly rocky and that's part

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.860
of the reason it has some
of these dynamic processes

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.160
that are so interesting.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.460
One of my Professors at
Johns Hopkins used to joke

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.740
that Europa was really,
and 90 percent rock,

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.660
was really a rocky body just
masquerading as an icy body.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:22.020
But why do we call it an icy body?

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.960
Because all the geophysical
processes and geological processes

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.140
that we can see actually
occur in ice.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.030
And so it's a little bit
smaller than our moon.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:32.290
See the radius is about
50 to 60 kilometers.

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:36.310
Our own moon the radius
is about 1,738 kilometers.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:41.310
And the surface is a chilly
negative 173 degrees Celsius.

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:43.820
You've seen these reddish
brown marks on the surface.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.650
A lot of that comes from some
of these surface species.

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:51.220
We see Carbon Dioxide, Carbon
Monoxide on the surface.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:56.870
We see Sodium Chloride, which
that's regular old table salt,

00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:59.520
magnesium sulfate,
just a sulfate salt.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.810
And also sulfuric acid hydrates.

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:05.530
One thing that's really
interesting about Europa is

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:08.090
that it may be the only other
body in the solar system,

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:10.970
in addition to earth,
to have plate tectonics.

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:14.640
So these other solar system bodies
I've been showing you, they have,

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.040
you know, they have tectonics.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.870
You have the crust moving.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:21.920
But when it moves everything
just, it moves as one continuous,

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:23.900
you know, one continuous crust.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.200
Everything linked together.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.750 position:56%
Europa may be broken up into plates.

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:31.510 position:56%
And so it's a really exciting place.

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:35.500
So let's talk about its
place in the Jupiter system.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:39.260
And we have Europa here,
you can see the second moon

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:44.850
with its sister satellites
Io, Ganymede and Callisto.

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:49.520 position:56%
Io, these are the four Galilean
satellites so named because Galileo,

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.540
Galileo discovered them when
he trained his telescope

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.050
on them such a long time ago.

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:59.860
And so Io is the most volcanically
active body in the solar system.

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.880
There are volcanoes
going off everywhere.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:06.030
Ganymede is the largest moon in the
solar system and it's the only moon

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.420
in the solar system to
have its own magnetic field

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.270
like earth has its
own magnetic field.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:12.980
And then Callisto is a little
bit smaller than Ganymede.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.500
It has a pot marked surface.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.660
Those are caused by
impacts by asteroids

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.830
and comets and things like that.

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:25.450
And so we have on the bottom this
title energy and we see that it's,

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.730
title energy, you have quite a
lot of it when you're near Io.

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:31.300
As you go out to Callisto
it pretty much diminishes.

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:33.990
So what is tidal energy
or what is tidal heating?

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:38.090
So tidal energy, or tidal
heating as I like to call it,

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:41.390
is just what happens to these
moons as they're orbiting Jupiter.

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:43.990
They're much smaller than
Jupiter, much, much smaller.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:47.660
Jupiter is huge compared to
earth so it's much, much,

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.920
it's gargantuan compared
to these moons.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.230
And so as these moons are moving
in their orbits around Jupiter,

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:56.650
different parts of them are
pushed and pulled and tugged

00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:59.680
at different times and
that creates friction.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.860
That friction that's caused
by that pushing and pulling,

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:06.540
it's just like if you rubbed
your hands past each other,

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.370
you start doing that and you keep
doing it, your hands get warm.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:12.280
So that friction causes,
that friction from Jupiter,

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:16.820
causes the innards of these
bodies to be heated quite a bit.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.660
Io gets the most heat because
it's closest to Jupiter.

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:24.800
Because it gets the most heat,
volcanism is the geological process

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.420
that dominates that surface.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.990
Skip over Europa but as we
get to Ganymede you have,

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:33.400
you still have title energy,
not nearly as much as at Io

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:37.150
but you still have some and so
tectonics, movements in the crust

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:41.850
in the lithosphere are what really
affect the surface of Ganymede.

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:43.920
By the time you get to
Callisto, poor Callisto,

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.050
there's really no tidal
energy for Callisto.

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:50.130
And so we don't expect
Callisto to be dynamic world.

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:52.280
We're looking at it, it has
all these impact craters.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.430
If there were things
upwelling from the subsurface

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:56.760
such as cryolavas it
would kind of smooth

00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:00.040
out that surface and
we don't see that.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.810
And so Europa's in an interesting
place if we look at Europa.

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:08.040
So Europa gets not as much tidal
energy as Io but more than Ganymede

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:11.390
and so it's in a regime where
not only can you have tectonics

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:15.100
but you can have volcanism
so this is an exciting thing.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.680
And if we talk about Europa's
place in the Jupiter system, again,

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:23.690
I have just two movies,
if they will work.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:25.160
They worked before.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:31.710
Let's try to get out
of this and see.

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:38.760
Ok so this first movie just shows
Europa orbiting along with Ganymede

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:42.300
and Callisto, I'm sorry Europa
orbiting with Ganymede and Io.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:45.010
And Europa, Ganymede and
Io are in a residence.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:46.770
And just in simple terms that means

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:49.860
that for every four
times Io orbits Jupiter,

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.840
Europa orbits twice,
Ganymede orbits once.

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:57.040
And it's kind of difficult to see
here but this is what this image,

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.230
this animation, is
supposed to be showing.

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:04.320
And so because Europa is in this
kind of residence with Ganymede

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:08.570
and with Io, it's also pushed and
pulled and tugged in its orbit

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:12.630
with Ganymede and Io and that adds
additional heat to its interior.

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:15.220
And this second movie just
shows what I'm talking

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.340
about when I say it's pushed
and pulled and different parts

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:20.880
of it are elongated and shortened
in its orbit around Jupiter.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.100
So that's great.

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:34.450
So we talked about, give me
one second here, ok, so great.

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:39.400
And it put me back at
the beginning of my talk.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.590
How great is that?

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:43.890
We'll get there.

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:45.190
Ok and this is right
where I need to be.

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:49.860 position:56%
So we've talked about the difference
between volcanism and cryovolcanism.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.030
We talked about where
we see cryovolcanism.

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:53.330
We talked about Europa.

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:56.090
Is there evidence for
cryovolcanism on Europa?

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.450
And the answer is yes there is.

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:02.420
The Galileo Spacecraft sent
us back lots of nice images.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:08.700 position:56%
We got a lot of these images back in
the late 90's, you know, into 2000.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:13.200
And we see at the top left
you see a pond like feature.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.480
It does not look like the
surrounding planes in the back.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:20.780
And so it looks like a pond
therefore Planetary Scientists,

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.680
we call that the pond.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.550
And it is a smooth feature and it
looks like you've had some sort

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:29.550
of runny fluid that's just
come up and erupted and flowed

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:32.220
onto the service just
in that circular area.

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:37.960
And then to the right of that
this mitten shaped feature.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.450
Guess what we call that?

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:42.100
The mitten.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.700
[laughter] And so the
correct name is Murias Chaos

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.640
but most people call it the mitten.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:51.920
And so the mitten basically just
looks like you've had this kind

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.170
of viscus sticky lava that
kind of erupted and came

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:57.520
out onto the surface and
kind of spread and kind

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.380
of up domed at the edges.

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.230
And we think that's
what happened there.

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:05.340
At the bottom you have
this darker spot on Europa,

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:08.060
Thrace Macula, to the bottom left.

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.540
And that's pretty cool.

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:11.400
It's much darker than
the surrounding terrain.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.400
And then beside it
to the right of that

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.520
on the bottom we have
a close up of Thrace.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:19.160 position:56%
And you can see that although it
looks like the center has been baked

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.110
in place, if you look
at the edges there looks

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:25.770
like there's been some sort of
fluid that's just been moving

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:27.070
across the surface.

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:28.370
And so these were taking
with the evidence

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:31.760
of cryovolcanic flows
of lava flows here.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.490
And so what about, so
these are the nice, quiet,

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:37.820
quiescent eruptions,
don't cause any trouble.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:40.380
What about the explosive
cryovolcanism?

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:45.030
Yes, there is actually,
we have evidence for that.

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:48.470
So we have, this is a
double rich ridge here

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:52.400
and you see this arrow pointing
to these darker, this white arrow

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.310
at the top pointing
to these dark features

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:56.370
and here's a close up
of that to the right.

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:59.370
And it's believed that what
happened was there was an explosive

00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:05.300
cryovolcanic eruption or
several along this double ridge.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:09.550
And it threw up particles and
water vapor and they came back

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:12.600
to the ground and kind of lined
the surface along these ridges.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.850
And then at the bottom you see a
picture where, at the bottom left

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:18.650
where you see these reddish
brown features, those are thought

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:23.610
to be salts that came up, could
have come up during an eruption

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:25.140
and this colored the surface.

00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:26.920
Salts and CO2 and other
things like that.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.960
And we see them surrounding
these freckles.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.960
And you have the same thing
on the bottom right image.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:35.490
And so, let's see if I can go
through this a little bit quicker.

00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:38.010
So the interesting thing
with terrestrial volcanism

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:41.410
versus cryovolcanism is that
when we think of lavas moving

00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:44.990
through earth's surface or up
through the surface of Venus

00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:50.240
or what used to occur on the moon
millions and billions of years ago,

00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:53.860
that these lavas as they
move up towards the surface,

00:34:53.860 --> 00:35:00.630
this is a fresher diagram so going
to, pointing down to the interior

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:03.700
of the planet, pointing up is
to the surface, as these lavas

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.000
or these magmas, excuse me,

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.370
as they are in the subsurface,
move up to the surface.

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:09.100
They tend to want to superheat.

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:10.640
So they stay in very warm.

00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.350
They erupt.

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:16.770
And the issue with cryolavas
is if you have a watery fluid

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:19.470
or even a watery fluid that
may not even be pure water

00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:21.210
but just has a little
bit of salt in it,

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:22.930
as it moves to the
surface it's going to want

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:25.120
to freeze and that's an issue.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:28.340
So how do you solve that issue?

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:32.290
Well you can actually solve
that issue by adding salt.

00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:37.730
Adding salt to some of these fluids
will help them want to super heat

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:39.990
and remain warm as they
get to the surface.

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:43.180
And that's really good for the case
of Europa because we see evidence

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:46.830
of salts on the surface
in areas where we believe

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:48.880
that the surface has been
in contact with some sort

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:53.750
of subsurface fluid reservoir.

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:58.560
And so I will, this is just a table
showing plausible compositions

00:35:58.560 --> 00:35:59.860
of icy lavas.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.980 position:56%
You can see that a lot of these,
these are just sodium sulfate salts.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:07.780
If you look at hydrohalite which
is down kind of in the middle,

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:12.540
that's sodium chloride, that 2H2O,
that's just hydrated table salt

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:15.620
that could be erupting
onto the surface of Europa.

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.260
And we will skip that one.

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.730
And so this has been pretty great.

00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:24.030
So we talked about cryovolcanism,
what can we model on Europa?

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:27.700
So we believe that there's
cryovolcanism on Europa.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.520
We have imagery that
suggests that that is true.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:34.110
And so if that is the case,
remember I talked to you

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:37.690
about what we thought was an
icy volcanic dome on the surface

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:40.970 position:56%
of Titan, it ended up not being one.

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:44.020
We also see things that look like
icy volcanic domes on the surface

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:48.630
of Europa and the question is
what would be the necessary lava

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:51.410
viscosity and composition
to form these domes?

00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:55.040
And you can see at the top here
we have two domes we believe are

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.800
cryovolcanic in origin, again
from cryolavas coming out,

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:03.520
erupting onto the surface and
then kind of, they're very viscus

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:07.660
so they're spreading kind
of like a dome shape.

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:10.800
And so we've looked
at, what I've done

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.580
with my colleagues is applied
some analytical models to see

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:17.720
if we can kind of model the
formation of these domes.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:21.280
And so here in this next image
you just see several more domes

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.520
that could, we believe,
have been formed as a result

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:26.930
of viscus cryolavas
coming onto the surface.

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:30.220
And so these domes have heights
between 40 and 100 meters.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:33.600
They're 3 - 10 kilometers
in diameter.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.890
The size of these domes they're
intermediate size between domes

00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:40.470
on earth and in Venus but they are
thought to have formed the same way

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:43.340
through just having
very sticky viscus lava.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.450
And their formation
was modeled actually

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:51.920
in 2003 initially using models that
had been applied to domes on earth

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:55.270
and Venus by Sarah Fagents
at the University of Hawaii.

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:58.230
We got Sarah on our team and said
can we make these models a little

00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:59.530
bit more accurate?

00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:02.270
So I'm about to show you a
slide that's a little scary

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:05.270
because there are two
equations and a lot of words.

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:07.940
And I won't go through these
equations just to say that the one

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.770
at the top is a differential
equation

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:14.090
that describes the process
that we're looking at.

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:15.660
H is going to be the
height of the dome.

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.240
You see that at the
top of the numerator.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.200
If any of you are students
of physics,

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.500
math or engineering you're used

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.110
to seeing differential
equations so that's wonderful.

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:24.840
We have a nice differential
equation.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.630
The equation right below
that is the solution

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.870
to this differential equation and
using this equation and putting

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:34.970
in certain parameters for
viscosity of a cryolava,

00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:38.250
if we put in parameters for
viscosity of a cryolava,

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.260
that tells us something
about the composition

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:42.640
or we can infer something
about the composition.

00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:47.480
So this equation gives us height
of the dome after it's erupted

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:51.680
onto the surface, height of the
dome as a function of its distance

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.970
from the central vent where it
initially erupted from and time.

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:57.360
And what can we do?

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.740
Can we get profiles?

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.050
We absolutely can from
this equation.

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:05.030
And these profiles are
symmetric so if we had,

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:08.030
if we extended this graph we'd
see the exact same four profiles,

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:12.950 position:56%
exact same heights in places, on the
left side as we see on the right.

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:14.960
So basically these
are four profiles.

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:18.120
We've looked at these domes and
looked at a certain viscosity.

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.840
And this shows, in the red,

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.930
that after three years this final
profile, basically we tracked

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:26.900
after this cryolava has
erupted, how it moves and spreads

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:29.260
across the surface and
what the final profile is.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:34.120
We see the final profile after
three years is pretty similar

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:39.520
to the profiles of these domes
that I showed you on this image.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:42.920
So the final profile is
about 80 meters high,

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.680
about 2 1/2 kilometers in radius.

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:46.980
That's great.

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.280
We love math.

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.580
We can do math, that's great.

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.850
But what does that say
about planetary science?

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:55.380
How does this final profile in
the red after three years stack

00:39:55.380 --> 00:40:00.830
up against topography that we
got from the Galileo mission?

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:05.100
Well it's consistent with the
topography but not a perfect match

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:07.640
and that's why we call it science.

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.080
And so if you look at this
red box here we've taken,

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:15.310
I've taken that red box
and kind of these kind

00:40:15.310 --> 00:40:20.540
of turquoise diamonds are the
topography from this dome.

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:24.390
And so the models are consistent
with topography from Europa

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:26.060
that we know from the
Galileo Spacecraft

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.230 position:56%
but we could always do a lot better.

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:30.010
And so that's great.

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:31.440
We're going to keep doing that.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.270
I just received funding to
keep modeling these domes

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:36.090
and see what their
compositions might be,

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:39.810
what their viscosity's might
be, that could tell us a lot

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:46.520
about the subsurface structure
of Europa, about cryomagma bodies

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.390
in the subsurface and how
they move to the surface.

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:49.840
That's very exciting.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:54.020
And so there are a lot of words
on this slide but I will skip

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:58.140
to the final bullet and say
that when you do theory,

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:01.190
which is using math to figure
out things in planetary science,

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:05.280
you always want to be able to match
that to actually observed data.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.520
The model is no good if
you look at something

00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:10.130
on Europa and the two don't match.

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:12.280
You could be making up
anything and nobody is going

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.850 position:56%
to trust it as well, they shouldn't.

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:17.380
And so we need better
imagery of Europa.

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:20.530
Higher spatial resolutions images
so higher resolution images

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:23.360
so that we can get
better model constraints.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:26.150
And the bad news is
I will not get that,

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:30.110
that will not happen any time soon
but the good news is it will happen

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:34.550
in 10 to 15 years so NASA
has a mission to Europa

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:37.540
that I'm very excited about.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:41.390
And there is, I'm actually
on the Science team.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:42.760
I'm on the camera team.

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.530
We'll make this nice camera.

00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:47.860 position:56%
We'll be able to see domes and other
images on Europa in this camera.

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.120
The principle investigator is
Dr. Elizabeth Turla [phonetic]

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.890
at the Johns Hopkins University
Applied Physics Laboratory

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:54.660
and so I'm very excited about that.

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:57.040
It's very nice how many people
will get to do their thesis

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:59.250
on the moon they love and
then turn around and get to be

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.380
on a space flight mission.

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.760
So it's wonderful.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:09.490 position:56%
So if we can get this next video to
play, I may have to get out of this.

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:11.850
And they are going
to talk about Europa.

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:14.330
Here's just a very short
video and you're going

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:17.690
to see Dr. Bob Pappalardo from
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory's,

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:19.920
the project scientists
on the mission.

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.270
You'll see Dr. Claudia
Alexander who did a lot

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:23.570
of work on the Galileo Mission.

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:26.960
Unfortunately we lost her
just a couple of months ago

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:32.510
but they're going to talk
about why Europa is exciting.

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:34.620
&gt;&gt; Europa is the most likely.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:35.920
&gt;&gt; Lynnae Quick: Uh
oh [Background Music]

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:40.190
&gt;&gt; Europa is the most
likely place to find life

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:44.860 position:56%
in our solar system today because we
think there's a liquid water ocean

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.160
beneath its surface.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:51.570 position:56%
Now we know that on earth everywhere
that there's water, we find life.

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:56.050
So could Europa have the
ingredients to support life?

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:59.950
&gt;&gt; We might be actually looking
at a body that is presently alive,

00:42:59.950 --> 00:43:03.830
presently active and presently
undergoing its geology.

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:07.410
There is too much evidence right
now lying around on the surface,

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:10.850
the red stuff, that suggests
that something is going on there.

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:15.750 position:56%
Is that an environment that is
habitable for any sort of life form?

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:19.510
By golly we really have got to
go back and figure that out.

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:25.110
[ Music ]

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:30.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; We have designed a Europa mission
to take a spacecraft and a set

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:34.110
of instruments all the way
from planet earth to Jupiter.

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:36.000
&gt;&gt; Previous mission concepts were

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.720
for spacecraft that
would orbit Europa.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:42.250
But Europa is bathed in
radiation from Jupiter.

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:44.360
Any mission that goes
in the vicinity

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.910
of Europa is cooked pretty quickly.

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:49.530
Instead we are looking at a
mission that will orbit Jupiter,

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:53.030
make close fly byes
of Europa and then zip

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:54.980
out of the high radiation region.

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:57.570
&gt;&gt; Kind of like when I was
a kid we had the sprinklers

00:43:57.570 --> 00:44:00.190
and we didn't want to be too
close to the sprinkler head

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:04.150
so we would run in and get a little
water and then run back out again.

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:07.230
&gt;&gt; This allows us to have a
mission that's many years long

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:11.350
and to collect and transmit
lots and lots of data.

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:13.740
As Europa orbits Jupiter it flexes

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:18.040
and we could measure the
gravitational change of Europa

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:21.780
by encountering Europa at
different points in its orbit.

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:26.060
On a typical fly bye we would turn
on our remote sensing instruments,

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:28.910
we would image the surface, we
would interrogate the surface

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:31.940
with spectroscopy and we would
do the same thing on the way out

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:34.960
and we would essentially rinse
and repeat and do this many,

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:39.270
many times until we
understand Europa globally.

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:43.680
Images from the Hubble
Space Telescope tells us

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:49.090
that Europa might be erupting
plumes of water, high into space.

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:52.480
If that's true then we could
fly through those plumes

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.200
with a spacecraft and
literally taste it

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.970
to understand the composition
of Europa's interior.

00:44:57.970 --> 00:45:00.230
&gt;&gt; If it does have the
ability to harbor life,

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:02.050
how does that work exactly?

00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:03.690
We'll have enough instrumentation

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:07.860
to really pinpoint exactly
how the mechanisms would work

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:11.760
for replenishing the nutrients
into a subsurface ocean.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.500
&gt;&gt; Europa is so important
because we want to understand,

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.050
are we alone in the cosmos?

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:24.150 position:56%
If there is life in Europa it almost
certainly was completely independent

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:26.630
from the origin of life on earth.

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:28.480
That would mean the origin

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:35.510
of life must be pretty easy
throughout the galaxy and beyond.

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:44.420
[ Music ]

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:47.060
&gt;&gt; Lynnae Quick: And so sorry
that sound was not very good

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.070
on that but it's very exciting.

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:51.750
They showed these images of
plumes that it would be great

00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:53.240
if a spacecraft could fly through.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:57.080
Plume is just another way of
saying cryovolcanic geysers.

00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.970
So it's very exciting.

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:00.850
And then Dr. Pappalardo mentioned

00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:06.660 position:56%
that the Hubble Space Telescope
believes that it saw plumes erupting

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:11.690
from Europa about, I believe maybe
it was last year a paper came

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:13.570
out and we were so excited.

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:18.800
And so the one thing that, if
I could just the last slide,

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.520
the one thing that I was hoping
that you all would take away

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:24.610
and did it take me
back to the beginning?

00:46:24.610 --> 00:46:27.060
It does. How wonderful.

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.950
And then will not let me scroll.

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:36.700
Ok so before we, so the one thing
that I want you to take away is

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.420
that icy moons are important.

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:41.640
Icy bodies are important.

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:45.930
You have lots of water
on these icy bodies.

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:48.450
As they orbit, their planets,

00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:50.850
like you have Jupiter
imparting lots of heat.

00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:53.470
The interesting thing
about a moon like Europa is

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:57.890
that you have an ocean that's
up against the rocky mantel

00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:59.190
or up against the rocky layer.

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:02.000
That's exactly what we have on
earth when we have the sea floor.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.010
At our sea floor we
have hydrothermal vents,

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:08.610
we have different habitats for
life, lots of interesting things.

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:10.010
So when we think about these moons,

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:14.730
these moons are really what we
call astrobiologically important.

00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:16.030
They have water.

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:17.330
They have heat.

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:20.000
There are nutrients that are needed
for life that could be cycled.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.990
Anytime you have those three
things that's always exciting

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:27.000
and that's one of the reasons for
the Europa mission so I thank you

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.690
so much for bearing with me.

00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:32.860
I will take questions if anyone has
them or comments whether they have

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:37.100
to do with science or me being a
scientist or I saw your hand first.

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:41.920
No, there is no possibility
of the moon collapsing.

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:46.030
That stuff that's going out
into space is coming from areas

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:48.640
on the south pole of Enceladus.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:54.710 position:56%
Enceladus is a round body because
we have something called hydrostatic

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:56.030
pressure that works with gravity

00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:59.220
to keep everything clumped
together and strong.

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:03.320
When something is circularized
it probably will not collapse.

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:06.330
So if you were to think about
an asteroid that was maybe

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:08.900
like a rubble pile
where everything wasn't,

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.400
you know, it wouldn't be circular.

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.700
It wouldn't be spherical.

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.000
It would be some strange shape.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.260
Then you may have to worry
about losing too much to space

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.680
but that's not going to
happen with Enceladus.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:24.780
Just next, right and
so the question was

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:30.520
in my opinion what would be a
good place to prospect elements

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.510
and nutrients, is that
what you were saying?

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:36.430
&gt;&gt; Mining would be economically
important to the earth.

00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:38.020
&gt;&gt; Lynnae Quick: Economically
important to the earth.

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:42.960
Well I will say with a
caveat that I love Europa

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.490
but the ice shell is
30 kilometers thick.

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:48.810
So there would be lots of good
nutrients there and lots of things

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:51.090
that you could learn and
you always have students

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:53.750
in astrobiology courses that
want to do a term project

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:55.980
and see what it would take
to drill through the ice.

00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:57.410
That's 30 kilometers worth of ice.

00:48:57.410 --> 00:49:00.230
That's not going to happen.

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:05.780 position:56%
I believe that if we look at earth's
own moon though there are lots

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:10.180
of resources that could be
mined and could be drilled.

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:13.350
We think there could be a
water cycle on the moon,

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:16.600
which we did not know
before, on earth's moon.

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:21.940 position:56%
And a lunar reconnaissance
orbiter, LRO, is looking at the moon

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:26.150
and orbiting it and taking
pictures and taking data.

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:29.470
And you always, at these LRO
meetings you have several people

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:32.950
who actually talk about mining
our own moon for resources.

00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:34.720
So that would be great.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:38.910
That is someplace that's
near to us and someplace

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:43.270
that we could easily
place people again.

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:47.810
And as generations go and we
get further into technology

00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:50.130
and time passes, then
maybe we could have a drill

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:52.470
that was big enough
to get to Europa.

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:54.960
I think the first part for Europa
though was actually sending a

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.260
spacecraft there.

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:57.560
That's the first step.

00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:00.040
The first thing we want to do.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.670
And, yes, that's a
very good question.

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:04.420
So the question was
how do atmospheres

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:06.400
and planets affect the expression

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:09.630
of cryovolcanism on
some of these moons?

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:12.860
And so it affect it quite a lot.

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:17.430
So the smaller the body is,
the smaller the gravity is.

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:19.530
And when you have these
geyser like eruptions,

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:22.220
the farther the particles
can go up into space,

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:27.140
which is why Enceladus actually
feeds one of Saturn's rings water

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:31.660
because it's so small and easy
for those particles to escape.

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:34.340
For Europa, Europa is much
bigger than Enceladus.

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:37.370
Europa is a little bit
smaller than our own moon.

00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:40.910
So you probably would not
have geysers that are able

00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:42.850
to erupt particles as high

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:45.770
because gravity is just
going to pull it back down.

00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:48.310
For the question about atmospheres,

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:51.920
remember I mentioned Neptune's
moon Triton which is the only moon

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.030
in our solar system with
an appreciable atmosphere.

00:50:54.030 --> 00:50:56.480
And it's a thick atmosphere.

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.940
It's thick and cold and
it's almost as thick as,

00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:00.840
if anyone knows anything
about Venus,

00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:03.770
Venus has an atmosphere that's
comparable except for Venus is

00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:05.360
so hot and it's in the
inner solar system.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.820 position:56%
So the atmospheric pressure is so
high but you're not really going to,

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:12.760
you don't think you're going to
see geysers on a moon like that.

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:16.780
You are going to see just lavas
that are flowing out quietly

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:19.880 position:56%
and quiescently and they're probably
going to be very, very viscus

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:25.250
but that's a good question,
very good question.

00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:32.090
Yes, right, ok, so the question
is do I know how deep the ocean is

00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:33.650
on Europa, is that
what you're asking?

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:36.950
So we know that the water
and ice layer together is

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:39.120
between 100 and 150 kilometers.

00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:42.050
We think the ice is about
30 kilometers thick.

00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:48.100
So that leaves anywhere
between 70 to 120 kilometers

00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:49.470
so that's a lot of water.

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:52.400
&gt;&gt; Any theory on how that
could have developed,

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:55.460
how you get a ball of water?

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:58.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lynnae Quick: Well initially, if
I give the theory we'll have to talk

00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:00.630 position:56%
about planet formation a little bit.

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:06.290
So I will say that initially
what we believe happened is

00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:12.880
that you have this body and it was
probably maybe a little bit warmer

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:16.660
and at some point as time
passes it lost more heat

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:20.150
because these bodies
start out a little warm.

00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:24.710
You had it begin to
freeze from the top down.

00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:27.420
And so that's what
creates the ice crust.

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:33.430
We think like earth, when we think
about why we have water on earth,

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:36.050
we believe that we had a
lot of volatile and water

00:52:36.050 --> 00:52:38.460
and light species delivery
from comets.

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:41.030
So initially how it
probably got there was

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:44.160
that you had very hydrous
water rich bodies that kind

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.660
of clumped together to make Europa.

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:48.420
Did that answer your question?

00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:53.150
[inaudible audience question] Our
ocean is just a sliver, right.

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:58.250
Because Europa is in
a, as you move out,

00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:01.890
further out into the solar
system it's easier for there

00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:08.460
to be light molecules like water
and volatiles and things like that.

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:11.340
As you move in closer
to the sun it's hotter.

00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:14.610
And so it's really nice
that we have water.

00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:19.280
You look at poor Mercury and Venice
and I mean they're really steamy.

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:20.910
So we're kind of right
in the right place,

00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:24.830
what we call the Goldilocks
zone, not too hot, not too cold.

00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:29.160
But as you move further
out for different reasons,

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:33.080
we can talk about a
little bit more offline,

00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:36.410
you are able to have more water as
you move farther and farther away

00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:37.810
from the sun and it's able

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:40.620
to you know just stay there
and not evaporate away.

00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:43.540
So there was a question
here and then one over here.

00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:48.570
Yes sir? Ok so the question was
would cryovolcanism exhibit any

00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:53.320
phreatic eruptions or marked
craters and would it be different?

00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:58.300 position:56%
So the phreatic eruptions, those are
the more violent eruptions, correct.

00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:06.620
&gt;&gt; Well basically not about earth
but just underneath the surface

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:09.350
that causes basically a crater.

00:54:09.350 --> 00:54:16.810
Like you've seen craters in
Death Valley have no life.

00:54:16.810 --> 00:54:22.020
&gt;&gt; Lynnae Quick: My
feeling is that it could.

00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:23.490
If we're talking about craters

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:26.580
that are just beneath the surface
you would need very high resolution

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:28.570
images to see that.

00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:31.990
And I will say too
that we're talking

00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:35.320
about cryovolcanism although
I'm very, very excited about it,

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:37.400
keep in mind that our first look

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:42.250
at cryovolcanism was
in 1989 with Voyager 2.

00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:44.270
And if we want to put that
into perspective that was

00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:46.210
when I was five years old.

00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:52.400
And for science that is
yesterday, that's just yesterday.

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.670
So it's an emerging field.

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:57.050
And I would say that
that is possible.

00:54:57.050 --> 00:55:00.100
I would have to think about
the physical processes

00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:03.600
and what would be needed as far
as composition and maybe thickness

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.690
of a, regional thickness
or thinness of a crust

00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:08.150
that would allow that to happen.

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:10.720
Of course, ok, yes?

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:12.020
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Harbster:
Probably one more.

00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:13.320
&gt;&gt; Lynnae Quick: Ok yes sir?

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:16.520
Ok so the question was when
we think about volcanoes

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.200
on earth they're a
little bit more circular

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.420
and I showed an image
earlier where I said

00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:24.630 position:56%
that you probably had
cryovolcanism along a linear feature

00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:26.660
and what's the deal with that?

00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:31.250
And so keep in mind when we
think about volcanoes on earth

00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:33.720
and volcanism there
are different types.

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:37.370
So we see these nice cinder
cones but we also see,

00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:45.560
if you remember from, let's see,
one of the first slides, exactly,

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:52.320
the fissure eruption which is
to your left, the bottom left,

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:58.290
where you have lava erupting from
what looks like a line source.

00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:04.760
So we believe that we definitely
see the same things on earth

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:07.710
that we're saying could
be happening on Europa.

00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:12.630
So it's still a volcanic eruption
when you see a fissure eruption.

00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:15.110
It's not as crazy out
there as it seems.

00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:17.300
Now in finding that picture I
may have forgotten a little bit

00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:20.530
of your question and gotten
off but did I answer that?

00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:22.870
Ok, alright, that's it.

00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:24.400
Thank you so much.

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.630
[applause]

00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:30.330
