00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.497
What is the shape of a molecule?

00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:12.167
Well, a molecule is mostly empty space.

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:14.001
Almost all of its mass is concentrated

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:17.368
in the extremely dense nuclei of its atoms.

00:00:17.368 --> 00:00:18.307
And its electrons,

00:00:18.307 --> 00:00:19.790
which determine how the atoms

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.784
are bonded to each other,

00:00:20.784 --> 00:00:23.307
are more like clouds of negative charge

00:00:23.307 --> 00:00:25.584
than individual, discrete particles.

00:00:25.584 --> 00:00:27.394
So, a molecule doesn't have a shape

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:29.139
in the same way that, for example,

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:31.006
a statue has a shape.

00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:32.081
But for every molecule,

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:33.456
there's at least one way

00:00:33.456 --> 00:00:35.511
to arrange the nuclei and electrons

00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:37.712
so as to maximize the attraction

00:00:37.712 --> 00:00:38.850
of opposite charges

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.386
and minimize the repulsion

00:00:40.386 --> 00:00:42.599
of like charges.

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:44.347
Now, let's assume that the only electrons

00:00:44.347 --> 00:00:45.891
that matter to a molecule's shape

00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:48.808
are the outermost ones from each participating atom.

00:00:49.454 --> 00:00:50.504
And let's also assume

00:00:50.504 --> 00:00:52.893
that the electron clouds in between atoms,

00:00:52.893 --> 00:00:54.561
in other words, a molecule's bonds,

00:00:54.561 --> 00:00:57.469
are shaped kind of like sausages.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.289
Remember that nuclei are positively charged

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.245
and electrons are negatively charged,

00:01:02.245 --> 00:01:03.731
and if all of a molecule's nuclei

00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:04.821
were bunched up together

00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:06.989
or all of its electrons were bunched up together,

00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:09.233
they would just repel each other and fly apart,

00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:11.005
and that doesn't help anyone.

00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:14.103
In 1776, Alessandro Volta,

00:01:14.103 --> 00:01:16.599
decades before he would eventually invent batteries,

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:18.263
discovered methane.

00:01:18.263 --> 00:01:22.133
Now, the chemical formula of methane is CH4.

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.126
And this formula tells us

00:01:23.126 --> 00:01:24.800
that every molecule of methane

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.442
is made up of one carbon and four hydrogen atoms,

00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:31.139
but it doesn't tell us what's bonded to what

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:34.532
or how they atoms are arranged in 3D space.

00:01:34.532 --> 00:01:36.212
From their electron configurations,

00:01:36.212 --> 00:01:37.706
we know that carbon can bond

00:01:37.706 --> 00:01:39.531
with up to four other atoms

00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:41.576
and that each hydrogen can only bond

00:01:41.576 --> 00:01:43.034
with one other atom.

00:01:43.034 --> 00:01:44.402
So, we can guess

00:01:44.402 --> 00:01:46.288
that the carbon should be the central atom

00:01:46.288 --> 00:01:48.906
bonded to all the hydrogens.

00:01:48.906 --> 00:01:50.040
Now, each bond represents

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.658
the sharing of two electrons

00:01:51.658 --> 00:01:54.570
and we draw each shared pair of electrons as a line.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.801
So, now we have a flat representation

00:01:56.801 --> 00:01:58.264
of this molecule,

00:01:58.264 --> 00:02:00.826
but how would it look in three dimensions?

00:02:00.826 --> 00:02:01.807
We can reasonably say

00:02:01.807 --> 00:02:03.269
that because each of these bonds

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:05.595
is a region of negative electric charge

00:02:05.595 --> 00:02:07.403
and like charges repel each other,

00:02:07.403 --> 00:02:09.569
the most favorable configuration of atoms

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.330
would maximize the distance between bonds.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.743
And to get all the bonds

00:02:13.743 --> 00:02:16.071
as far away from each other as possible,

00:02:16.071 --> 00:02:18.512
the optimal shape is this.

00:02:18.512 --> 00:02:20.858
This is called a tetrahedron.

00:02:20.858 --> 00:02:22.901
Now, depending on the different atoms involved,

00:02:22.901 --> 00:02:25.323
you can actually get lots of different shapes.

00:02:25.323 --> 00:02:28.299
Ammonia, or NH3, is shaped like a pyramid.

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.122
Carbon dioxide, or CO2, is a straight line.

00:02:31.122 --> 00:02:34.548
Water, H2O, is bent like your elbow would be bent.

00:02:34.548 --> 00:02:37.129
And chlorine trifluoride, or ClF3,

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.215
is shaped like the letter T.

00:02:39.215 --> 00:02:40.909
Remember that what we've been doing here

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.561
is expanding on our model of atoms and electrons

00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:45.843
to build up to 3D shapes.

00:02:45.843 --> 00:02:46.937
We'd have to do experiments

00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:48.138
to figure out if these molecules

00:02:48.138 --> 00:02:50.489
actually do have the shapes we predict.

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.362
Spoiler alert:

00:02:51.362 --> 00:02:53.554
most of the do, but some of them don't.

00:02:53.554 --> 00:02:54.938
Now, shapes get more complicated

00:02:54.938 --> 00:02:56.937
as you increase the number of atoms.

00:02:56.937 --> 00:02:58.574
All the examples we just talked about

00:02:58.574 --> 00:03:01.071
had one obviously central atom,

00:03:01.071 --> 00:03:02.325
but most molecules,

00:03:02.325 --> 00:03:03.948
from relatively small pharmaceuticals

00:03:03.948 --> 00:03:05.374
all the way up to long polymers

00:03:05.374 --> 00:03:07.743
like DNA or proteins, don't.

00:03:07.743 --> 00:03:08.808
The key thing to remember

00:03:08.808 --> 00:03:10.879
is that bonded atoms will arrange themselves

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.612
to maximize the attraction between opposite charges

00:03:13.612 --> 00:03:16.717
and minimize the repulsion between like charges.

00:03:16.717 --> 00:03:18.969
Some molecules even have two or more

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:20.508
stable arrangements of atoms,

00:03:20.508 --> 00:03:22.470
and we can actually get really cool chemistry

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.190
from the switches between those configurations,

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.306
even when the composition of that molecule,

00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:29.894
that's to say the number and identity of its atoms,

00:03:29.894 --> 00:03:32.185
has not changed at all.
