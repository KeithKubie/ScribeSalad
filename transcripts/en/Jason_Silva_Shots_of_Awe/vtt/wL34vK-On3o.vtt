00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.440
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.065
This episode of "Shots of Awe"
is brought to you by Norton.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.525
So one of the next
big tech revolutions

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:26.450
that everybody is
talking about these days

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.890
is the notion of the
internet of things.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.290
See, now that we are
extending intelligent sensors

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.420
into the world of everyday
objects, all of a sudden,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.610
these objects are going
to be endowed with agency.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.870
They're going to be
endowed with the ability

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.700
to give us feedback.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.660
The world is going to become
intelligent and responsive

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.910
and going to
anticipate our needs.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.380
The world is going to feel like
an extension of our mindedness.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.250
"When everything becomes
linked with everything else,"

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.270
as Erik Davis used to say,
"matter becomes mind."

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.250
David Rose, in his new
book, "Enchanted Objects,"

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.260
essentially says that
we're moving back

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.610
into a world of animism, where
object's have actual agency.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.870
They actually have a kind of
consciousness and that things

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.360
almost are enchanted,
almost are alive.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.800
You walk into a
room, and the room

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.450
knows how you like the lighting.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.680
And the song that you love
starts automatically playing.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.760
And the curtains
automatically raise.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.370
And the computer offers
you your favorite snack.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.880
The full flourishing
of these technologies

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.610
promises to essentially
blur the distinction

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.850
between self and world.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.230
The entire world
will have mind in it.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.690
It's how the cognitive
philosophers David Chalmers

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.910
and Andy Clark used
to say, "we've always

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.190
been adept at dovetailing
our minds to work tools."

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.670
But when our tools
start talking back,

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.310
the loop will be finished.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.580
We will have fully spread our
minds out into our universe.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.730
This is the internet of things.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.560
This is why it's a
game changer, and this

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.320
is why it absolutely
rattles my imagination.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.320
So read up on it, right.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.900
It's coming.
