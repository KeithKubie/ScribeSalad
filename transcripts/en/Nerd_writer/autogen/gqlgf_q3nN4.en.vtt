00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.720
*clock ticking*

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.400
Who was the first person to ever have the idea of travelling through time?

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.380
If I had to guess, I'd say it was probably an early human tens of thousands of years ago

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.460
who stubbed his toe or tripped or lit his hair on fire, and in searing pain

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.700
had the thought: "I wish I would've not done that".

00:00:29.845 --> 00:00:32.775
In this really limited way, time travel as an idea is probably as

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:35.705
old as regret, which is to say, as

00:00:35.705 --> 00:00:38.645
old as humanity itself. Human beings have an

00:00:38.645 --> 00:00:41.545
instinctive sense for cause and effect and

00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:44.545
a particular skill for manipulating causes to get

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:47.585
the effects that they want. It makes sense that our

00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:50.485
wandering minds would look at the effects of what's already happened

00:00:50.485 --> 00:00:53.745
and wonder what things might look like if the

00:00:53.745 --> 00:00:56.795
causes had been different somehow. Which makes it kind of weird that

00:00:56.795 --> 00:00:59.795
time travel as a device to tell stories

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.780
is a relatively recent phenomenon.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.795
It might not seem that way, since travelling through time is such a staple of modern

00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:08.855
science fiction and really the modern imagination.

00:01:08.875 --> 00:01:11.715
We've been so saturated with time-travelling novels and

00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:14.135
TV shows and movies that the average person

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.720
pretty much understands all the basic concepts and paradoxes.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.715
But the time travel genre is only about a hundred

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.100
years old, and change, depending on where you mark the beginning.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.960
Many people see H.G. Wells' "The Time Machine" in 1895 as the start of the genre.

00:01:30.385 --> 00:01:33.125
Others look to Mark Twain's "A Connecticut Yankee in

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:35.700
King Arthur's Court", from a few years later.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.795
Some even cite Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol", with it's Ghosts

00:01:38.795 --> 00:01:41.765
of Christmas past and future, from 1843.

00:01:41.765 --> 00:01:44.545
The truth is, you can't really pinpoint a

00:01:44.545 --> 00:01:47.015
specific novel as the genesis of time-travel

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:49.975
fiction, because the genre doesn't pop into existence

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.440
out of nowhere like a cyborg from the future.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.440
It grew slowly from the ashes

00:01:55.445 --> 00:01:58.435
of a genre that no one really knows about any more.

00:01:58.935 --> 00:02:02.015
But to understand that, there is one specific book

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.400
you can mention.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.600
In more ways than one, Charles Darwin's "On the Origin of Species"

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.220
triggered a sea change in science and culture.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.280
After "Origin" was published in 1859, the idea of evolution,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.200
not necessarily the idea of natural selection, was adopted fast - really fast.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.035
Just a decade later, evolution was 'assumed' at several top

00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:27.035
universities, and it filtered down into the popular consciousness.

00:02:27.035 --> 00:02:29.755
It coloured the way people thought,

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.280
not just about biology, but about sociology too.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.260
If species were getting fitter and fitter,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.740
better and better, why not societies?

00:02:38.745 --> 00:02:41.960
It's in this period that a certain kind of novel

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.520
becomes really popular. It's called the "utopian romance"

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.380
and it culminates in Edward Bellamy's 1888 book "Looking Backward".

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.960
In Bellamy's book, the hero Julian West falls into a deep hypnotic sleep

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.300
and wakes up one hundred and thirteen (113) years later in the year 2000.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.820
The world is totally changed into a socialist utopia,

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.360
essentially, Bellamy's version of the perfect society,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.720
evolved out of the society of his own day.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.980
The book was a huge success. The second novel

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.200
in all of American literature to sell over a million copies.

00:03:15.205 --> 00:03:18.255
Like successful things do, it exploded the genre, resulting

00:03:18.255 --> 00:03:21.325
in dozens and dozens of utopian stories written along

00:03:21.325 --> 00:03:23.655
a very similar structure. And with evolution

00:03:23.655 --> 00:03:26.465
as the guiding principle, utopias were no longer

00:03:26.465 --> 00:03:29.155
on a lost island or a different world...

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.820
they were in the future.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.980
In his extraordinary book on time travel fiction,

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.615
David Wittenberg shows that, over time, utopian romance

00:03:39.615 --> 00:03:41.985
became really preoccupied with how

00:03:41.985 --> 00:03:44.715
its heroes got the the future. A lot of the time people

00:03:44.715 --> 00:03:47.895
fell asleep and woke up years later, other times peoples minds

00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:50.615
were sent forward and were able to come back.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.560
People traveled to the future in hot air balloons, by lightning storms,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.940
even once with the use of a special shampoo.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.035
In fact, when H.G. Wells solves the problem with the mechanical

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.920
"time machine", he's doing it for the same reason as everybody else:

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.115
to create a realistic frame for his own utopian story.

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:12.345
Or, in this case, his criticism and satire of that genre.

00:04:12.525 --> 00:04:15.365
Eventually, the utopian craze fell

00:04:15.365 --> 00:04:18.305
under the weight of its own propaganda, today

00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:21.445
barely anyone reads or writes that kind of fiction and

00:04:21.445 --> 00:04:24.605
nobody knows the name of the author or the book that sold

00:04:24.605 --> 00:04:27.075
a million copies a hundred years ago.

00:04:27.075 --> 00:04:29.995
But as Utopian Fiction collapsed, it left us with

00:04:29.995 --> 00:04:33.325
a framing device that grew into its own genre.

00:04:33.935 --> 00:04:36.845
That's where, or rather, when, time travel fiction

00:04:36.845 --> 00:04:39.475
as we know it, comes from.

00:04:39.475 --> 00:04:42.115
In the following decades, the genre would be transformed

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:45.035
by the discoveries of Einstein, it would

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:48.085
use a popular understanding of space time to probe the paradoxes

00:04:48.085 --> 00:04:51.085
of causality that we've all become so familiar with.

00:04:51.085 --> 00:04:54.125
But as Wittenberg notes, time travel fiction is essentially

00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:56.555
the child of narrative itself.

00:04:56.835 --> 00:04:58.905
Examining the nature of causality

00:04:58.905 --> 00:05:01.865
is the same thing as examining the nature of story because...

00:05:02.195 --> 00:05:05.295
that's what a story is: cause and effect.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.420
It's why time travel books and movies are obsessed with rules.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:11.300
They're like laboratories of storytelling.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.460
Just create a world, establish its rules, and ask...

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.940
[Gunshot and yell.]

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.440
"whats possible?"

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.920
*clock ticking*

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.200
Hey everybody, thank you so much for watching. This episode was

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.480
sponsored by the new Youtube Red original series "Lifeline".

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.880
It's the first, the very first, scifi narrative

00:05:34.885 --> 00:05:37.125
series that Red has produced, about a

00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:40.415
company called Lifeline sends its agents into the future

00:05:40.415 --> 00:05:43.565
to save clients that they know are going to die.

00:05:43.845 --> 00:05:46.765
It's a really great concept and, personally, I'm super excited

00:05:46.765 --> 00:05:50.115
that Red is actually green-lighting shows like this,

00:05:50.115 --> 00:05:52.705
I hope the future brings more by talented creators.

00:05:52.705 --> 00:05:55.445
In this case, Sam and Niko from Corridor Digital

00:05:55.445 --> 00:05:58.775
are directing the entire series and I've been a fan of theirs for a while.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:01.165
