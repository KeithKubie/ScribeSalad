00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.930
In this tutorial, we'll be
talking about how to run the

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.480
PHP samples for a
YouTube V3 API.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.900
For this to work, you'll need
a local installation

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.150
of Apache and PHP.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.330
I'm running this demo on OSX,
which ships with a version of

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.440
Apache with PHP.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.730
To enable PHP, I just
have to make a few

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.830
configuration changes.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.050
The first thing you want to
do is verify that our PHP

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.750
installation is working
correctly.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.070
You can skip this if you know
that it is working correctly.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.810
I'm going to go ahead and
create a new PHP file.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.060
I'm going to edit it.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.530
Now I'm going to go ahead and
browse to this PHP file.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.830
And I can see that
it's working.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.860
So let's go ahead and
download the API

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.840
client library for PHP.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.831
We can find this at
code.google.com/

00:01:11.831 --> 00:01:13.081
p/google-API-PHP-client.

00:01:19.096 --> 00:01:22.150
We'll click on Download
the Latest Release.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.440
While we're doing that, we
also want to download the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.440
YouTube API samples.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.430
We can find these at
code.google.com/

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.680
p/youtube-api-samples.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.560
Click on the download
link, and we'll

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.760
download the samples.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.880
Once these have downloaded,
we should unpack them.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.970
Let's now copy the files into
a directory that we'll be

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.590
running PHP files off of.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.045
We'll also want to copy
the PHP samples over.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.832
Now, let's give it the
proper permissions.

00:02:23.832 --> 00:02:26.350
I'm recursively giving
it 7, 5, 5.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.830
Now let's make the search
sample work.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.130
The first thing we'll need
to do is call set

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.910
include path on our code.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.470
We'll want to include the Google
API client library.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.860
We'll also need to set
the developer key.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.650
We can find this from the
Google API console,

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.310
code.google.com/APIs/console.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.490
If you browse there, and you
don't see this page, you'll

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.410
want to watch a video about how
to create and register a

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.100
YouTube API key.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.290
Scroll down to Simple
API Access.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.740
Let's copy the key.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.432
And let's paste it over
the place holder.

00:03:23.432 --> 00:03:26.980
Let's save the file and browse
through this search sample.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.430
We should see this page.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.065
And when we click Search, we'll
see the search results.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.390
The next sample we'll try to
get running will be the My

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.470
Upload sample.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.750
So let's go ahead and open that
up in our text editor.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.050
The sample demonstrates how to
use the three legged OAuth 2.0

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.340
flow to authorize your script
to run on behalf of user.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.600
We'll need to copy over
set include path.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.636
We'll also need to
set the client ID

00:04:09.636 --> 00:04:11.100
and the client secret.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.365
Again, we can find these in
the Google API console.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.400
Now let's go ahead
and run our code.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.800
Note that this first run
will not work yet.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.290
We'll be asked to authorize, and
we'll see an error page.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.860
It's because we need to
register this URI as a

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.630
redirect URI in the
API console.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.340
So let's go ahead and copy it,
go back to the API console,

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.720
click on Edit settings.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.690
We'll paste it into the
authorized redirect URI's box.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.430
Let's click update.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.600
Now let's click back and try
to run our sample again.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.850
And run the code again.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.110
You'll see that the code
is now requesting

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.940
that I allow access.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.190
I'll click Allow.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.000
The script is now running.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.560
So that's what you need to run
the sample codes for Search

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.810
and My Uploads in PHP.
