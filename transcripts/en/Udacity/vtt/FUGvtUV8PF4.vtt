00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.010
Pete, could you tell me a little bit
about Metrics and how you guys went

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.710
about measuring things in the early days
and what was important in measuring?

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.532
&gt;&gt; That's a really good question because
you're pretty resource-constrained

00:00:12.532 --> 00:00:15.880
early on and every moment you spend
implementing some fancy analytic

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.470
is one less moment you could be focusing
on your customers or your product.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.630
But when I look back,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.010
I think there were a few things that
we tracked that were really helpful.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.777
The first thing, and
they're not all numbers.

00:00:29.777 --> 00:00:33.704
The first was Dan, my co-founder, set up
an email that would email everyone in

00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:35.288
the company every single day and

00:00:35.288 --> 00:00:38.822
say here's the list of everybody that
signed up for our product today.

00:00:38.822 --> 00:00:43.140
And I remember being so excited when
I noticed somebody from Starbucks

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.100
had signed up or we noticed this
big company or this big company.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.160
That gave us a simple way
to jump on these moments.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.830
Email and say, hey what's going on?

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.450
Can we help you?

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.790
And I think, some of our longest
lasting customer relationships started

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.130
through that, so it was a really easy
way to plug in to what was actually

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.099
happening with our customers.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.400
The second one is,
it sounds a little funny actually.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.750
We made it impossible to fire
Optimizely without sending us an email.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.790
So we didn't built any way to
unsubscribe from our service.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.340
Instead we said, if you want to
unsubscribe, email Optimizely.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.760
And we were a little worried that people
would be really pissed off about this.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.130
And one or two were, but it also
gave us a really, really clear and

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.310
quick way to understand
where we were screwing up.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.200
I think where otherwise some of
these customers would have sort of

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.150
silently drifted off into the night.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.150
This gave us an avenue to
ask what was going wrong.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.700
What could we have done to have
kept you as a happy customer?

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.950
And we didn't earn them all back,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.720
we probably didn't earn
many of them back as first.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.450
But it was a pretty easy way to find
out where we were screwing up and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.020
so, I'd like to think that the most
important metrics early on

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.550
were the ones that help us stay in
tune to where we were pleasing and

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.780
where we were angering customers.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.400
&gt;&gt; So given where the company is
currently, what do you think is

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.440
important to measure in the next
couple months or years.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.117
&gt;&gt; Well, we're a lot bigger now,
we're hundreds of employees and

00:02:06.117 --> 00:02:07.492
we have thousands of customers.

00:02:07.492 --> 00:02:10.633
And we've gotten a lot more
sophisticated in how we

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:12.982
measure our financials as a company.

00:02:12.982 --> 00:02:17.428
So how we forecast gap revenue
analysis and all of that.

00:02:17.428 --> 00:02:19.950
And that's been very illuminating.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.270
It's great as a founder to be able to
have that view into your business.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.990
One of things that we're trying to
build out now, I mentioned this before,

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.340
is the ability to measure
customers in the same way.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.490
And to give everybody inside Optimizely
this same crystal clear view of how

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.610
our customers are doing, and how good
the experience we're giving them is.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.490
And the way we do that is with
the optimized lead promoter system.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.490
I mentioned this before.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.630
It's a variant of NPS
net promoter system.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.180
And we ask our customers
a simple question.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.470
And we ask them to explain,

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.730
how likely would they be to recommend
Optimizely to a friend or colleague.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.820
And based on that answer and
based on the reason for

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.240
their answer we get insights
into how well we're doing.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.880
It's pretty easy to
spot leading indicators

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.000
which we expect will later show
up in the revenue elsewhere.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.140
If we're giving our customers a bad
experience we'd expect to see that in

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.830
churn numbers.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.160
&gt;&gt; Hm.
&gt;&gt; But churn is a trailing indicator.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.760
We're doing our best now to
build leading indicators of

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.680
how well we're treating our customers,
and that's a big challenge for

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.860
us over the next few years.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it sounds like it.
