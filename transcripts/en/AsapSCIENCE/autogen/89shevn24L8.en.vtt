00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.230
 Whatever memories of a bad break or a traumatic event may be remembered 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.809
 Throughout our lives, but what if there was a way to forget all 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.730
 These events? Can science allow you to erase your bad memories? 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.199
 Memories are an incredibly complex process, and scientists believe it is like a fill 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.089
 Closet and updated memories are stored in different parts of the brain, but now 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:26.849
 This theory has proved to be untrue, in fact every memory is a broad process in the brain. If you've finished watching this section and do not remember it 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.939
 It is because the cells in your brain have been raised and separated to build 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.270
 New links will literally re-connect the circuits in your brain, and this change 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.070
 Is partially facilitated by the help of proteins found in the brain. 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.300
 So what happens if these proteins are not available? Simply, memories do not. 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.940
 Scientists have tried this by giving animals drugs that prevent these proteins from forming 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.170
 As a result, the animals were unable to remember what happened a short while later 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.580
 Give her medicines 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.760
 Based on this research, scientists have found a way to target long-term memories for deletion 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.920
 As you see every time you remember a certain memory, your brain is separated again 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.860
 And reconnect it. In fact every time you attach to the memory you literally and physically change 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.250
 This anniversary in your mind, every time this little anniversary changes, to reflect 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.620
 Your current thoughts, the process of remembering is a process of creation and imagination, which means that it is all 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.750
 Comment on your old memories all that became more accurate. 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.360
 Scientists have identified the reality of this change, after the events of September 11 a number of people 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.670
 They asked about their memories of that dreadful day, and after 37% of the details were 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.280
 Has changed, and by 2004 almost 50% of the details have changed or lost, because of that memories 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.540
 Reconstructed and reconstituted each time. If controlled by drug inhibitor protein during 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.420
 Reminds you of the memory, the anniversary will be completely deleted. 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.440
 To experiment with this, scientists took laboratory mice and played a sound for them, followed by a short period 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.950
 With an electric snap, after repeating this process several times the mice quickly learned that if they did 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.460
 They heard the sound shortly after it would be electrocuted, and as a result the mice would freeze 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.159
 Every time you hear the sound. Months later, mice will respond to sounds. whatever 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.630
 If scientists have controlled the drug first, the mice will forget the memory of the sound and simply 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.909
 It will go beyond that, because it will have lost the memory of the selected voice. And to make sure that the medicine 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:18.760
 Does not cause much damage to the brain, scientists have repeated these experiments many times in many ways 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.590
 Both sounds will warn of shock and both will certainly scare the mouse, but if scientists control 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.909
 With the medicine and only one of the two sounds, the mouse will forget this tone only, while 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.189
 He will remember his fear of the other 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.349
 Over time, scientists have discovered a specific drug targeting a specific protein in 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.079
 Different parts of the brain. So if you feel a terrible feeling in one of your memories, you're targeting 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:45.049
 A specific protein in the brain's brain area will help to eliminate this link alone 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.139
 Which can be an amazing tool, especially for patients with similar symptoms 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:53.329
 Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. But while these drugs are used in very advanced stages 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.239
 The question remains: If you are given a "medicine to forget" you will agree 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.549
 To take it? 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.480
