00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:17.480
 Hello Android Developer Program engine is not in favor today 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:20.720
 When designing a drowsy app, the most basic sk independent pixels 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:24.289
 We want to talk about dp. 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:29.179
 The first thing you should think about before designing an app 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:32.870
 There are a variety of opportunities in the world and the fact that there are Android devices in shape 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:37.160
 Also the pixel density of the vise may be different 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:42.140
 Inflorescence density is determined by the number of points in a 1-inch square 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:46.129
 In other words, it is expressed as a multiply-in value dpi, and generally this bpi value 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.570
 Indicate how clearly the image or text on the screen is rendered. 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.799
 It becomes an indicator 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.750
 One example is how the English dictation is based on different dpi values 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:58.070
 Let's look at the clutches. 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:03.290
 As you can see, if you have a higher pixel density value like 452 ti 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:05.420
 After the letter e is much higher than the other screen with lower dpi 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:09.590
 It is clean and accurate. 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.450
 The Android devices are here as well as various synthetic fibers like 165 234 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.560
 You can find something to bring 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.570
 If you're a developer, and you want to respond to all of these values, 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.829
 It can be troublesome. 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:25.969
 So do not come in to make your life more comfortable, 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:27.380
 We classify the 9-minute control devices into a virtual logical Mars 1 degree unit 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:30.439
 There is 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.579
 Some typical pixel density units used in Android include: 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.450
 The same 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.619
 For example, for a device with 165 dpi, 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.179
 Will be classified 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:44.990
 So you do not have to think about the number 165 anymore 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:48.979
 Actually, the 2 van 6 dpi is a special number. 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:53.539
 On Android, the baseline city area standard is called the " 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:56.270
 I explained that everything, including the dicer parser dip, 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:00.649
 It is based on the value of rice cake. 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:05.539
 At present, when Android 80 160 dpi and more than this type 1 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:06.920
 240 320 480 dpi All four Mars are also most widely priced 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.660
 Is being used 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:15.310
 In addition to this, you can use ldpi or 13 dpi values ​​with a 120 dpi value 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:18.560
 Although the tv dpi you have is expressed, it is rarely used 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.340
 You do not have to worry about your current 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:27.610
 Now that I've found out about Synthetic Text, I'm in the Android design. 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.610
 I will explain the core density density wave 3 and 4 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:34.209
 Density Diversity Pasteur Besti Independent pixels are generally shortened to dp or 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:38.650
 I'm talking about dip. 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:43.030
 It's a sort of virtual inflorescence. At 160 dpi, 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.870
 Actually, one pixel is exactly represented by one d pixel, and more 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:52.510
 For example, if the density is high, x hdpe 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.760
 , One pixel of the dete tp is enlarged by 2 times in the vertical direction, 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.780
 Can be represented as real pixels 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.290
 So why on Android do you use this dp design? 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:06.430
 The biggest reason is that the Android app's iRayas design and user 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:10.659
 When designing an interface, each a ui element has a different pixel density 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.549
 Make it physically similar on your device 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:16.900
 Because I wanted to 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:20.169
 Let's look at an example here: 200 across two different devices 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:24.400
 dp height is elongated purple squares 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:28.120
 I have an mdpi screen for a tablet device, and on this device 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:32.260
 The 200 pp value will be accurately represented as 200p cells 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.609
 Again, 1 dp is exactly one pixel at the reference density 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.109
 Is expressed 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:41.709
 On the other hand, the Lexus smartphone here has xhdpi power. 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.639
 200 dp height is represented by 400 pixels on the second foot 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.849
 Will 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:48.879
 Because this conversion is done automatically on Android platform cars 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:52.659
 Developers do not have to worry too much 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:56.680
 One interesting thing to note here is that using dp units 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:04:00.879
 Even though the screen density changes, the actual physical size remains similar 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.199
 You can also use this dp unit to indicate the size of the actual object 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:06.150
 There is 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:10.720
 For example, the size of a finger on a person can be expressed in roughly 50 tp 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:13.959
 When you design a button like this, you can see this value 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.319
 You can avoid mistakes such as designing buttons that are too small for hard work. 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.319
 There is 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:23.370
 Next you need to set the depth value so that you can freely 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:27.000
 Let's take a look at how to calculate 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.400
 You do not have to worry too much about the formula 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.120
 It's the only thing you need to know. 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.490
 As you can see, if you know the three values ​​that are not yet defined 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.660
 One other value is known 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.660
 Let's take a look at her. 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:47.290
 The definition of dp is as follows: 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:48.430
 2, 1 dp is exactly 1 pixel, and the cell is exactly 1 dp 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.630
 is 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:55.720
 Many screen densities are xhdpi, that is, 302 dpi is doubled 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:05:01.060
 When talked pa size becomes this pixel 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:05.200
 So let's use this news to solve a more real problem. 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:07.180
 The latest Lexus SEVEN device screens launched in 2013 in depth resolution units 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:12.190
 How much would it be expressed in terms of 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:15.610
 We know the following information: Screen size is 7 inches 9 screen 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:19.570
 The density is shown in xhdpi and 320 dpi. 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:23.470
 The screen resolution is 1920 x 1200 pixels 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:26.800
 Which of these heights would you use to calculate the dp resolution? 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.730
 In fact, the size of the actual physical screen is 7 inches. 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.240
 not 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.080
 You need to know the actual screen size of the device when you want to find independent pixel values. 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.970
 There is not 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:41.350
 As described in the first paragraph, xhdpi and the reference density of the original density 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:45.760
 mdpi The simple ratio is two days, and I recall the formula I saw earlier. 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:48.340
 In this case, to convert the pixel value to dp, simply use the pixel value 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:53.230
 Divide by 2 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:56.260
 So the correct answer is to divide 120 by 2, 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:59.139
 The 960 is the 600d P of the bar 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:03.880
 So what does this transformation already do? 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:06.729
 In general, the dp impression is smaller than the pixel resolution, 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:11.190
 I can see that it's better representation of size 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:15.310
 For example, a 1280 file with 800 pixels large mdpi tablet device 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.300
 1280 files 720 pixels wide Think xhdpi mobile phone 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.500
 There is 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:22.360
 The pixel resolution of two devices is almost similar, but the actual screen size is 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.770
 Will be much smaller if 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:31.479
 If you change the dp value to a decent value, 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.740
 720 dp impression, while mobile phone has 306 cdp 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:36.580
 You will have as expected 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:40.210
 This is almost twice the size of the actual device's physical screen size. 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:44.080
 You can think of it as a better reflector 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.919
 In terms of security, it is related to dp and also supports virtualization soda 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.220
 There is 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:52.990
 The scale is an Independent 3 or s game 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:57.039
 s &amp; p is the font size setting you need on your system, 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:07:02.669
 If the size is set to Medium, dp will match exactly 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:02.669
 Therefore, it is useful to use it when assigning it to the text of the app pair 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.659
 Finally, when you design your Android ui, 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:11.649
 I will. 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:15.729
 First, you should always use dp units when designing ui 

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:19.599
 If you use the dp value to represent the size or position of the ui element, 

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:21.189
 It will be much easier to create an app that works properly in House 

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:25.749
 Will 

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:29.199
 In order to express the second image clearly, 

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:32.349
 You must provide a different graphics 1 source 

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:36.909
 For example, here's a share icon, where Work 2 is defined as 32 dp 

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:43.230
 Therefore, in order to cope with each screen density without auto scaling, 

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:48.210
 You need to prepare png file in addition to 4 kinds of porridge. 

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:52.740
 Finally, to make it easier for you to use your x, 

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:57.000
 Please use sp unit when setting text size 

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:58.620
 It's really important to design an Android app so far. 

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.070
 Has been explained about 

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:04.170
 To design applications that work well on various screen sizes 

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:07.560
 There are a lot of people who are suffering. 

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:11.580
 Visit the Android developer site, especially the design for multi-screen page 

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.570
 Find a lot of useful information, including about the dp we discussed today. 

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:17.840
 can 

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:17.840
 Please take a look at it.
