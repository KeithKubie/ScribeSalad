00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.280
In this video, we're going
to talk about how

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.590
to visualize data.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.000
In particular, we're going to
use something called a stem

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.340
and leaf plot.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.520
And what's useful about this is
it essentially allows you

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.770
to show all of your data and
show a lot of detail about all

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.690
of the numbers in your data set,
while at the same time

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.010
having a good sense about how
those numbers in your set are

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.080
distributed.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.150
Right here, I have
a set of numbers.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.110
And when I just look at this,
it really doesn't make a lot

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.730
of sense to me.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.330
It's just a bunch of
numbers to me.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.230
I have no sense are more of
them closer to 20 or 30?

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.570
Are more of them closer to 80?

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.170
Is their median or their
mode 30 or 40 or 84?

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.640
I have no idea, just looking
at this list of numbers.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.030
But using a stem and leaf plot,
hopefully, some of this

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.210
will become a little
bit more apparent.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.270
And the idea here is to list the
most significant digit in

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.620
each of those numbers
in the stem.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.500
So when we talk about the most
significant digit, these

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.180
numbers right here,
they range-- let's

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.650
see, we have a 2 here.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.200
That looks like-- we have a 1.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.920
That looks like our
lowest number.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.490
And it goes all the
way up to 84.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.400
It has a bunch of numbers in
between in the teens, in the

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.970
twenties, in the thirties,
forties, fifties, sixties.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.400
so on and so forth.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.280
So it looks like the most
significant digit here is the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.720
tens digit.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.110
So let's write it right here.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.380
Let's write our tens digit.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.430
And the tens digit could be a
0, 1, 2, 3, 4-- let me write

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.950
this a little bit bigger.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:52.610
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or-- let
me scroll down a little

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.080
bit-- an 8.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.830
These digits will represent
our stem.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.520
So I'm going to draw this
little line around here.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.120
This is going to be a our
stem right there in the

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.090
stem and leaf plot.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.040
For a number like 1, the
tens digit is 0.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.890
You could imagine it as 01.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.540
For a number like 84, the tens
digit is obviously 8.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.140
So what I'm going to do is
rewrite all of these numbers

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.200
here using the stem
and leaf plot.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.890
And the technique here, and I'm
just going to show you by

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.320
example, let's go through
each of these numbers.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.290
Let's say I want to write 35.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.310
So 35-- let me cross it out.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.530
35, so it has a tens
digit of 3.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.490
I'll put a 5 right here.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.100
That tells me that 35 is
one of my numbers.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.960
Then I have 42.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.640
Cross it out, let me
know I used it.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.100
42, I'm writing the ones
digit as leaves.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.950
You're going to see what
I'm going to do.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:56.170
Let's see.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.880
38.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.080
Well, I have a 30.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.570
I'm going to write an 8 here.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.520
So I didn't have to
rewrite the 30.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.190
I'm just saying, look, I have
a 35 and I have a 38.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.270
I'm just writing the ones digits
within the three stem,

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.060
within the tens place, within
the thirties place, however

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.190
you want view it, the
thirties bucket.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.330
Then we have a 57.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.500
We have a 2, which you could
just view as 02.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.390
We have a 2.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:35.580
We have 24, 27, 36.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:43.680
We have a 35, a 38,
and a 36, 45, 60.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.460
I think you get the idea,
but just for the sake of

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.140
completion, let's finish
all of these.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:04:05.230
38, 40, another 40, a 44, a 1,
another 44, a 48-- there's a

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:16.240
lot of things in this forties
bucket-- 48, an 84, a 38, a

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:25.070
20, a 4-- put that right
there, 04-- a 2.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.370
It's getting a little
monotonous, but

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.390
let's just finish it.

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:36.760
48, another 48 right
there, a 58, a 3.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.535
Stick it up there.

00:04:37.535 --> 00:04:39.180
It's 03.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:57.140
Then we have a 20, a 6,
a 40, 22, 26, 17.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.775
That's our first number
in the teens bucket.

00:04:58.775 --> 00:05:14.590
An 18, a 40-- a lot of things in
the forties-- a 51, 62, 31,

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:37.750
27, 48, 35-- almost done--
27, 37, 58 and 21.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.100
And we have our 21.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.690
And just like that, it was a
little monotonous, but we

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.860
essentially just rewrote this
list of numbers down here.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.350
I have every number
represented.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.950
We haven't lost any
information here.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:51.700
I know every number.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.620
I could go start with this,
and I could tell you every

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.580
number that I had in my original
list. I have a 6, I

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.430
have a 27, I have a 38, a 35.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.510
So we haven't lost
any information.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.760
But what's neater about this
representation is when the

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.240
numbers are written this way, we
actually save ink, because

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.790
you don't have to rewrite
the 40 to 45.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.110
You just write the ones digit.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.490
But more importantly, we kind of
understand how the numbers

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.360
are distributed, that we have
a bunch of numbers in the

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.250
forties and thirties
and twenties.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.520
That's where most of
the numbers are.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.530
We have very few numbers
up in the eighties.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.090
We have no numbers
in the seventies.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.910
We have very few.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.730
We have a lot in the ones, but
still, most of them are

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.800
focused in this range
over here.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.780
So this is just one of many,
many, many ways to visualize

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.290
data that you will run into
in your mathematical or

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.270
statistical futures.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.980
But I just wanted to
expose you to this.
