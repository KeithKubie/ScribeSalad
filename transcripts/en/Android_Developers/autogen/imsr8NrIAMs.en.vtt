and then we created a talk that would

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:52.500
and then we created a talk that would
 

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.190
and then we created a talk that would
take two days to deliver so we're just

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200
take two days to deliver so we're just
 

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.600
take two days to deliver so we're just
going to assume that everybody knows how

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:56.610
going to assume that everybody knows how
 

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.100
going to assume that everybody knows how
animations work and we're just going to

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:58.110
animations work and we're just going to
 

00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.450
animations work and we're just going to
go on and talk about the recyclerview

00:10:59.450 --> 00:10:59.460
go on and talk about the recyclerview
 

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.900
go on and talk about the recyclerview
animations in particular so first of all

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:02.910
animations in particular so first of all
 

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:04.220
animations in particular so first of all
let's take a look at the different kinds

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:04.230
let's take a look at the different kinds
 

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.100
let's take a look at the different kinds
of things that can

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:05.110
of things that can
 

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.960
of things that can
happen in a recyclerview so here's a

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:06.970
happen in a recyclerview so here's a
 

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:08.790
happen in a recyclerview so here's a
really interesting recyclerview over

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800
really interesting recyclerview over
 

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.440
really interesting recyclerview over
there I want everybody to know that I

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:10.450
there I want everybody to know that I
 

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.850
there I want everybody to know that I
did this art myself okay so we have an

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:14.860
did this art myself okay so we have an
 

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.440
did this art myself okay so we have an
ADD operation so we're going to tap on

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:16.450
ADD operation so we're going to tap on
 

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.480
ADD operation so we're going to tap on
this or whatever we're going to add an

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:18.490
this or whatever we're going to add an
 

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:20.009
this or whatever we're going to add an
item in between the h and the i' and

00:11:20.009 --> 00:11:20.019
item in between the h and the i' and
 

00:11:20.019 --> 00:11:21.150
item in between the h and the i' and
we're going to create this other

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.160
we're going to create this other
 

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.530
we're going to create this other
representation where you see that p

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:22.540
representation where you see that p
 

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:24.389
representation where you see that p
element there the I and the J got

00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399
element there the I and the J got
 

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:26.160
element there the I and the J got
shifted down and the K is no longer in

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:26.170
shifted down and the K is no longer in
 

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.160
shifted down and the K is no longer in
the list we have a delete operation so

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:29.170
the list we have a delete operation so
 

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:30.810
the list we have a delete operation so
we're going to delete the H element

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:30.820
we're going to delete the H element
 

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.610
we're going to delete the H element
there and that's going to create this

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:32.620
there and that's going to create this
 

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.639
there and that's going to create this
other list okay H is gone I J and K got

00:11:35.639 --> 00:11:35.649
other list okay H is gone I J and K got
 

00:11:35.649 --> 00:11:37.319
other list okay H is gone I J and K got
shifted up and then we have this new LM

00:11:37.319 --> 00:11:37.329
shifted up and then we have this new LM
 

00:11:37.329 --> 00:11:39.660
shifted up and then we have this new LM
L down at the bottom or we may have a

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:39.670
L down at the bottom or we may have a
 

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.519
L down at the bottom or we may have a
change animation where we're going to

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:41.529
change animation where we're going to
 

00:11:41.529 --> 00:11:43.620
change animation where we're going to
change the content inside that J item

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:43.630
change the content inside that J item
 

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.690
change the content inside that J item
and it's going to become this other

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:45.700
and it's going to become this other
 

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.850
and it's going to become this other
content over there on the right so all

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:47.860
content over there on the right so all
 

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:49.860
content over there on the right so all
very good and also all very beautiful

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:49.870
very good and also all very beautiful
 

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.009
very good and also all very beautiful
right okay so let's talk about

00:11:53.009 --> 00:11:53.019
right okay so let's talk about
 

00:11:53.019 --> 00:11:54.750
right okay so let's talk about
animations in particular so those were

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:54.760
animations in particular so those were
 

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.310
animations in particular so those were
the different states like the before and

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.320
the different states like the before and
 

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.170
the different states like the before and
after but then how do you animate these

00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:58.180
after but then how do you animate these
 

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.300
after but then how do you animate these
things so in the add operation say well

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:00.310
things so in the add operation say well
 

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:01.680
things so in the add operation say well
we're going to add an item here how do

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:01.690
we're going to add an item here how do
 

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.569
we're going to add an item here how do
we actually transition to this new state

00:12:03.569 --> 00:12:03.579
we actually transition to this new state
 

00:12:03.579 --> 00:12:05.370
we actually transition to this new state
of the list what are the animations that

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:05.380
of the list what are the animations that
 

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.530
of the list what are the animations that
need to take place well clearly there's

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:07.540
need to take place well clearly there's
 

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.269
need to take place well clearly there's
a new item there so we have some sort of

00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279
a new item there so we have some sort of
 

00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:11.220
a new item there so we have some sort of
animation that's going to fade that in

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:11.230
animation that's going to fade that in
 

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.870
animation that's going to fade that in
or otherwise make it appear in the list

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880
or otherwise make it appear in the list
 

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.030
or otherwise make it appear in the list
and then we have I and J that's shifted

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040
and then we have I and J that's shifted
 

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.800
and then we have I and J that's shifted
so we could do maybe some simple

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:16.810
so we could do maybe some simple
 

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:18.210
so we could do maybe some simple
translation and move those things around

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:18.220
translation and move those things around
 

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.250
translation and move those things around
in the list and then we have the item K

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:20.260
in the list and then we have the item K
 

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.470
in the list and then we have the item K
that no longer exists so maybe we can do

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480
that no longer exists so maybe we can do
 

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.910
that no longer exists so maybe we can do
some sort of fade or disappearing

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:23.920
some sort of fade or disappearing
 

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.910
some sort of fade or disappearing
animation to make that go away over time

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:26.920
animation to make that go away over time
 

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.670
animation to make that go away over time
so for the remove operation similarly

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680
so for the remove operation similarly
 

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.009
so for the remove operation similarly
what animations do we run here well

00:12:32.009 --> 00:12:32.019
what animations do we run here well
 

00:12:32.019 --> 00:12:33.360
what animations do we run here well
first of all we're going to need to

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:33.370
first of all we're going to need to
 

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:34.889
first of all we're going to need to
remove that H element that went away

00:12:34.889 --> 00:12:34.899
remove that H element that went away
 

00:12:34.899 --> 00:12:36.449
remove that H element that went away
we're going to shift some things around

00:12:36.449 --> 00:12:36.459
we're going to shift some things around
 

00:12:36.459 --> 00:12:39.060
we're going to shift some things around
because they moved within the list in

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:39.070
because they moved within the list in
 

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.829
because they moved within the list in
the before in the after state and then

00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:40.839
the before in the after state and then
 

00:12:40.839 --> 00:12:42.780
the before in the after state and then
we have this new item there that's

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:42.790
we have this new item there that's
 

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.069
we have this new item there that's
potentially going to fade in or

00:12:44.069 --> 00:12:44.079
potentially going to fade in or
 

00:12:44.079 --> 00:12:46.170
potentially going to fade in or
otherwise transition to be in the list

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:46.180
otherwise transition to be in the list
 

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.670
otherwise transition to be in the list
there and then finally we have the

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680
there and then finally we have the
 

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.290
there and then finally we have the
change animation where we're going to

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:49.300
change animation where we're going to
 

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.660
change animation where we're going to
run some sort of animation to indicate

00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:51.670
run some sort of animation to indicate
 

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.310
run some sort of animation to indicate
that the contents of that item have

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:53.320
that the contents of that item have
 

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.569
that the contents of that item have
changed over time so it's important to

00:12:57.569 --> 00:12:57.579
changed over time so it's important to
 

00:12:57.579 --> 00:13:00.000
changed over time so it's important to
point out that a lot of the stuff just

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.010
point out that a lot of the stuff just
 

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.800
point out that a lot of the stuff just
comes baked into recyclerview an item

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:01.810
comes baked into recyclerview an item
 

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.449
comes baked into recyclerview an item
animator and the default layout managers

00:13:03.449 --> 00:13:03.459
animator and the default layout managers
 

00:13:03.459 --> 00:13:06.540
animator and the default layout managers
already and in fact even if you start to

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:06.550
already and in fact even if you start to
 

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.009
already and in fact even if you start to
customize there's still a lot that just

00:13:08.009 --> 00:13:08.019
customize there's still a lot that just
 

00:13:08.019 --> 00:13:10.740
customize there's still a lot that just
comes for free out of the box so if an

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:10.750
comes for free out of the box so if an
 

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.420
comes for free out of the box so if an
item gets removed we're automatically

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:12.430
item gets removed we're automatically
 

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:13.860
item gets removed we're automatically
going to fade it out if an item gets

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:13.870
going to fade it out if an item gets
 

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.480
going to fade it out if an item gets
added we're automatically going to fade

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:15.490
added we're automatically going to fade
 

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.250
added we're automatically going to fade
it in if it's moving around in the

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:17.260
it in if it's moving around in the
 

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.380
it in if it's moving around in the
before and after State

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:18.390
before and after State
 

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:19.790
before and after State
then we're going to translate and if

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800
then we're going to translate and if
 

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.380
then we're going to translate and if
it's changing we're going to crossfade

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:21.390
it's changing we're going to crossfade
 

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:22.700
it's changing we're going to crossfade
it right we're going to provide the two

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:22.710
it right we're going to provide the two
 

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.500
it right we're going to provide the two
different views that we then crossfade

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:24.510
different views that we then crossfade
 

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:26.720
different views that we then crossfade
between and then the question is can we

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:26.730
between and then the question is can we
 

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:28.430
between and then the question is can we
actually do better than that and it

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:28.440
actually do better than that and it
 

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.400
actually do better than that and it
turns out we can so first of all let's

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:31.410
turns out we can so first of all let's
 

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.620
turns out we can so first of all let's
take a look at what an actual list looks

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:33.630
take a look at what an actual list looks
 

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.450
take a look at what an actual list looks
like under the covers so that's what it

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:35.460
like under the covers so that's what it
 

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.280
like under the covers so that's what it
looks like on the screen to the user but

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:37.290
looks like on the screen to the user but
 

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.140
looks like on the screen to the user but
really that's a viewport into the

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:39.150
really that's a viewport into the
 

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.720
really that's a viewport into the
overall list of information that exists

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:41.730
overall list of information that exists
 

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:43.700
overall list of information that exists
on and off the screen right so you have

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:43.710
on and off the screen right so you have
 

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.260
on and off the screen right so you have
this virtual list there scrolling

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:45.270
this virtual list there scrolling
 

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:47.570
this virtual list there scrolling
through and you can see the items here

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:47.580
through and you can see the items here
 

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.160
through and you can see the items here
that are represented there actually

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:49.170
that are represented there actually
 

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:51.590
that are represented there actually
exist in some virtual state off screen

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600
exist in some virtual state off screen
 

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.360
exist in some virtual state off screen
so now let's take another look at how

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:53.370
so now let's take another look at how
 

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.700
so now let's take another look at how
these animations might work given the

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:55.710
these animations might work given the
 

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:56.900
these animations might work given the
information that we have about the

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:56.910
information that we have about the
 

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.060
information that we have about the
off-screen items there so here we said

00:13:59.060 --> 00:13:59.070
off-screen items there so here we said
 

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.160
off-screen items there so here we said
OK for an addition we're going to remove

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:01.170
OK for an addition we're going to remove
 

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:02.720
OK for an addition we're going to remove
that K element we're going to shift

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:02.730
that K element we're going to shift
 

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.520
that K element we're going to shift
stuff around and add it if it's in the

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:04.530
stuff around and add it if it's in the
 

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.800
stuff around and add it if it's in the
after state over there but in actual

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:06.810
after state over there but in actual
 

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:09.620
after state over there but in actual
fact in the virtual list that K didn't

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:09.630
fact in the virtual list that K didn't
 

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.440
fact in the virtual list that K didn't
go away it got shifted off the screen so

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:12.450
go away it got shifted off the screen so
 

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.480
go away it got shifted off the screen so
that animation a richer animation of

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:14.490
that animation a richer animation of
 

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.700
that animation a richer animation of
that K element is to simply shift it or

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:16.710
that K element is to simply shift it or
 

00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:18.560
that K element is to simply shift it or
move it off-screen to where it would be

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:18.570
move it off-screen to where it would be
 

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.810
move it off-screen to where it would be
if we could see whatever parts of the

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:20.820
if we could see whatever parts of the
 

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.210
if we could see whatever parts of the
list that are currently off screen item

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:23.220
list that are currently off screen item
 

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:23.990
list that are currently off screen item
removal

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000
removal
 

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
removal
similarly we said okay well we need to

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.010
similarly we said okay well we need to
 

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.350
similarly we said okay well we need to
fade this thing out and we're going to

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360
fade this thing out and we're going to
 

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.670
fade this thing out and we're going to
move some stuff over there and then this

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680
move some stuff over there and then this
 

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.770
move some stuff over there and then this
this el item is going to appear on the

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:30.780
this el item is going to appear on the
 

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.330
this el item is going to appear on the
screen because it came from somewhere

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:32.340
screen because it came from somewhere
 

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.880
screen because it came from somewhere
well we potentially know where it came

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:34.890
well we potentially know where it came
 

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.620
well we potentially know where it came
from right this is the virtual list

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:36.630
from right this is the virtual list
 

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.690
from right this is the virtual list
where that l didn't just magically

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:38.700
where that l didn't just magically
 

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.810
where that l didn't just magically
appear instead it shifted on-screen from

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:41.820
appear instead it shifted on-screen from
 

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.990
appear instead it shifted on-screen from
where it used to be in the virtual list

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000
where it used to be in the virtual list
 

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.630
where it used to be in the virtual list
and then changes so these are the

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:47.640
and then changes so these are the
 

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.220
and then changes so these are the
different these are the different kinds

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:49.230
different these are the different kinds
 

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.080
different these are the different kinds
of animations it's interesting to sort

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:51.090
of animations it's interesting to sort
 

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.220
of animations it's interesting to sort
of break it down and say what are all

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:52.230
of break it down and say what are all
 

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:53.930
of break it down and say what are all
the possible changes that can happen in

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:53.940
the possible changes that can happen in
 

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.270
the possible changes that can happen in
this list before and after and then how

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:56.280
this list before and after and then how
 

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.220
this list before and after and then how
do we animate all of them so persistence

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:58.230
do we animate all of them so persistence
 

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.620
do we animate all of them so persistence
is when items are there before and after

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:00.630
is when items are there before and after
 

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.360
is when items are there before and after
whether or not they move if they don't

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:02.370
whether or not they move if they don't
 

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:04.250
whether or not they move if they don't
move at all nothing to do if they move

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:04.260
move at all nothing to do if they move
 

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:05.630
move at all nothing to do if they move
around in the list then you need to move

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:05.640
around in the list then you need to move
 

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.240
around in the list then you need to move
them things get added to the list things

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:08.250
them things get added to the list things
 

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.710
them things get added to the list things
get removed from the list and things get

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720
get removed from the list and things get
 

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.690
get removed from the list and things get
changed but it gets interesting when you

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:11.700
changed but it gets interesting when you
 

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:12.800
changed but it gets interesting when you
talk about appearance and disappearance

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:12.810
talk about appearance and disappearance
 

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:15.350
talk about appearance and disappearance
because here these are the things where

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360
because here these are the things where
 

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.180
because here these are the things where
yeah it got added to the list but it

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:17.190
yeah it got added to the list but it
 

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:18.410
yeah it got added to the list but it
only got added to the list because it

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:18.420
only got added to the list because it
 

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.390
only got added to the list because it
moved on screen from where it actually

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:20.400
moved on screen from where it actually
 

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.090
moved on screen from where it actually
persisted before the layout change these

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:23.100
persisted before the layout change these
 

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.560
persisted before the layout change these
are the two types of animations that we

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:24.570
are the two types of animations that we
 

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.600
are the two types of animations that we
call predictive animations and there's

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:26.610
call predictive animations and there's
 

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:28.070
call predictive animations and there's
some parts of the API that around this

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:28.080
some parts of the API that around this
 

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.690
some parts of the API that around this
so if you see the word predictive this

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:29.700
so if you see the word predictive this
 

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.230
so if you see the word predictive this
is what it's about it's about telling

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:31.240
is what it's about it's about telling
 

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.570
is what it's about it's about telling
that's the information that we need to

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:33.580
that's the information that we need to
 

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.370
that's the information that we need to
know where things came from or where

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:35.380
know where things came from or where
 

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.110
know where things came from or where
they're going to when they appear

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120
they're going to when they appear
 

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.440
they're going to when they appear
disappear from the list so there are two

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:40.450
disappear from the list so there are two
 

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.540
disappear from the list so there are two
main things you want to think about when

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:42.550
main things you want to think about when
 

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.190
main things you want to think about when
you're trying to customize animations

00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:44.200
you're trying to customize animations
 

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.410
you're trying to customize animations
one is the layout manager the layout

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:46.420
one is the layout manager the layout
 

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.240
one is the layout manager the layout
manager is responsible for figuring out

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:48.250
manager is responsible for figuring out
 

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.160
manager is responsible for figuring out
where things go in the context of

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:50.170
where things go in the context of
 

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.290
where things go in the context of
animations it's not just where they are

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:52.300
animations it's not just where they are
 

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.480
animations it's not just where they are
but it's where they came from and where

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:54.490
but it's where they came from and where
 

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.010
but it's where they came from and where
they're going to be after the layout

00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:56.020
they're going to be after the layout
 

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.290
they're going to be after the layout
change and on the other side is the item

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:58.300
change and on the other side is the item
 

00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:59.519
change and on the other side is the item
animator and that's responsible for

00:15:59.519 --> 00:15:59.529
animator and that's responsible for
 

00:15:59.529 --> 00:16:01.889
animator and that's responsible for
actually running the animations so on

00:16:01.889 --> 00:16:01.899
actually running the animations so on
 

00:16:01.899 --> 00:16:03.720
actually running the animations so on
one side we have the layout manager that

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:03.730
one side we have the layout manager that
 

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.820
one side we have the layout manager that
figure out where things were and where

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:05.830
figure out where things were and where
 

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.940
figure out where things were and where
they're going to be and then it it

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:08.950
they're going to be and then it it
 

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:10.680
they're going to be and then it it
tabulates all that information hands it

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:10.690
tabulates all that information hands it
 

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:12.090
tabulates all that information hands it
over the item animator that then takes

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:12.100
over the item animator that then takes
 

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.010
over the item animator that then takes
that information says now how do we

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:14.020
that information says now how do we
 

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.720
that information says now how do we
animate these things and we have

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:15.730
animate these things and we have
 

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.400
animate these things and we have
built-in animations in the system but

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:17.410
built-in animations in the system but
 

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.550
built-in animations in the system but
then you can customize given that same

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560
then you can customize given that same
 

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.750
then you can customize given that same
information from the layout manager in

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:21.760
information from the layout manager in
 

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:24.060
information from the layout manager in
your own system so in the layout manager

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:24.070
your own system so in the layout manager
 

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.530
your own system so in the layout manager
side you have basically three options

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:25.540
side you have basically three options
 

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.660
side you have basically three options
option one is you can use a standard

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:27.670
option one is you can use a standard
 

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.329
option one is you can use a standard
layout manager we give you a few we've

00:16:30.329 --> 00:16:30.339
layout manager we give you a few we've
 

00:16:30.339 --> 00:16:31.980
layout manager we give you a few we've
got linear layout manager we've got grid

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:31.990
got linear layout manager we've got grid
 

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:33.630
got linear layout manager we've got grid
layout manager and staggered grid layout

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:33.640
layout manager and staggered grid layout
 

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.670
layout manager and staggered grid layout
manager and all of these come with the

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680
manager and all of these come with the
 

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.829
manager and all of these come with the
capabilities we're talking about now not

00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839
capabilities we're talking about now not
 

00:16:37.839 --> 00:16:39.810
capabilities we're talking about now not
just simple item animations but also

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:39.820
just simple item animations but also
 

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.880
just simple item animations but also
predictive item animations so if you run

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:41.890
predictive item animations so if you run
 

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:44.250
predictive item animations so if you run
we'll see a demo a little bit later but

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:44.260
we'll see a demo a little bit later but
 

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.040
we'll see a demo a little bit later but
it actually moves things off off-screen

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:47.050
it actually moves things off off-screen
 

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.530
it actually moves things off off-screen
smoothly or on-screen smoothly because

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:49.540
smoothly or on-screen smoothly because
 

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:51.120
smoothly or on-screen smoothly because
it can tell where these things are

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:51.130
it can tell where these things are
 

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.760
it can tell where these things are
coming from or going to option two is if

coming from or going to option two is if
 

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:55.350
coming from or going to option two is if
you want a custom layout manager that's

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360
you want a custom layout manager that's

want to structure your information on
 

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:00.150
want to structure your information on
the screen you're going to have a little

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160
the screen you're going to have a little
 

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:01.319
the screen you're going to have a little
bit of work to do if you want to go

00:17:01.319 --> 00:17:01.329
bit of work to do if you want to go
 

00:17:01.329 --> 00:17:02.970
bit of work to do if you want to go
beyond the basics but basic item

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:02.980
beyond the basics but basic item
 

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.069
beyond the basics but basic item
animation is handled for you we know how

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:05.079
animation is handled for you we know how
 

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:06.569
animation is handled for you we know how
to fade things in and out and to

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:06.579
to fade things in and out and to
 

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:08.549
to fade things in and out and to
crossfade them and to translate on the

crossfade them and to translate on the
 

00:17:08.559 --> 00:17:10.199
crossfade them and to translate on the
screen we can calculate all that stuff

screen we can calculate all that stuff
 

00:17:10.209 --> 00:17:12.240
screen we can calculate all that stuff
automatically but it's not predictive

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:12.250
automatically but it's not predictive
 

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:13.860
automatically but it's not predictive
because we don't know your layout

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:13.870
because we don't know your layout
 

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:15.809
because we don't know your layout
manager so we can't tell for your

00:17:15.809 --> 00:17:15.819

staggered grid stacks cue syncro you
 

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.020
staggered grid stacks cue syncro you
have on the screen where should that

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:22.030
have on the screen where should that
 

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.390
have on the screen where should that
item have been before we made it appear

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400
item have been before we made it appear
 

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.340
item have been before we made it appear
on the screen in your strange layout

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:26.350
on the screen in your strange layout
 

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:28.500
on the screen in your strange layout
manager we don't know so all we can do

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:28.510
manager we don't know so all we can do
 

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:31.080
manager we don't know so all we can do
is fade it in and then option three is

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:31.090
is fade it in and then option three is
 

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:32.730
is fade it in and then option three is
to go full-bore custom and say i've got

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:32.740
to go full-bore custom and say i've got
 

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.950
to go full-bore custom and say i've got
a custom layout manager and I want

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960
a custom layout manager and I want
 

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.870
a custom layout manager and I want
predictive animation so you're going to

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:36.880
predictive animation so you're going to
 

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.790
predictive animation so you're going to
need to enable those and then you're

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:38.800
need to enable those and then you're
 

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.380
need to enable those and then you're
going to need to tell us what we need to

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:40.390
going to need to tell us what we need to
 

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.390
going to need to tell us what we need to
know for the items that go away that

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:42.400
know for the items that go away that
 

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.250
know for the items that go away that
disappeared off the screen where would

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:44.260
disappeared off the screen where would
 

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.840
disappeared off the screen where would
they have gone if we could still see

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:45.850
they have gone if we could still see
 

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:48.210
they have gone if we could still see
them or if they appear on the screen

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:48.220
them or if they appear on the screen
 

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.150
them or if they appear on the screen
from off-screen where did they come from

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160
from off-screen where did they come from
 

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.280
from off-screen where did they come from
so let's take a look at some of this

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:53.290
so let's take a look at some of this
 

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:57.240
so let's take a look at some of this
information how do we get this so it's

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:57.250
information how do we get this so it's
 

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.850
information how do we get this so it's
the two sides it's it's the it's the pre

00:17:59.850 --> 00:17:59.860
the two sides it's it's the it's the pre
 

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.110
the two sides it's it's the it's the pre
layout where we're trying to figure out

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120
layout where we're trying to figure out
 

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.720
layout where we're trying to figure out
like where they were before they then

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:03.730
like where they were before they then
 

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.490
like where they were before they then
disappeared and the post layout like

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:05.500
disappeared and the post layout like
 

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.780
disappeared and the post layout like
well where did they go once they

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:06.790
well where did they go once they
 

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.390
well where did they go once they
disappeared from the list for everything

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:09.400
disappeared from the list for everything
 

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.980
disappeared from the list for everything
that's in that list virtual or non and

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:12.990
that's in that list virtual or non and
 

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.690
that's in that list virtual or non and
so an important element here is that

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:15.700
so an important element here is that
 

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.460
so an important element here is that
there's potentially two calls two on

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:17.470
there's potentially two calls two on
 

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:19.740
there's potentially two calls two on
layout children specifically if you opt

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:19.750
layout children specifically if you opt
 

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.110
layout children specifically if you opt
into predictive animations then you're

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:22.120
into predictive animations then you're
 

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.700
into predictive animations then you're
going to see two calls into your on

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:23.710
going to see two calls into your on
 

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.890
going to see two calls into your on
layout children method the first one is

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:25.900
layout children method the first one is
 

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.050
layout children method the first one is
going to be pre layout where we need to

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:28.060
going to be pre layout where we need to
 

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.670
going to be pre layout where we need to
know the information before the layout

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:29.680
know the information before the layout
 

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.830
know the information before the layout
change happens including for the items

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840
change happens including for the items
 

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.660
change happens including for the items
that are going to go away and then

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:33.670
that are going to go away and then
 

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:35.100
that are going to go away and then
there's the regular layout where we

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:35.110
there's the regular layout where we
 

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.260
there's the regular layout where we
figure out where everything is once

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:37.270
figure out where everything is once
 

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.740
figure out where everything is once
layout is actually already run all right

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:40.750
layout is actually already run all right
 

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.210
layout is actually already run all right
so let's take a look at a little bit of

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:42.220
so let's take a look at a little bit of
 

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:44.760
so let's take a look at a little bit of
code so we have support predictive item

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:44.770
code so we have support predictive item
 

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.140
code so we have support predictive item
animations this is what you need to

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:46.150
animations this is what you need to
 

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:48.180
animations this is what you need to
override and return true if you actually

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:48.190
override and return true if you actually
 

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:49.710
override and return true if you actually
want predictive animations then we're

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.720
want predictive animations then we're
 

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.780
want predictive animations then we're
going to call you twice for on layout

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:51.790
going to call you twice for on layout
 

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.720
going to call you twice for on layout
children and in on layout children this

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:54.730
children and in on layout children this
 

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:57.570
children and in on layout children this
code is taken mostly stolen mostly from

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:57.580
code is taken mostly stolen mostly from
 

00:18:57.580 --> 00:19:00.230
code is taken mostly stolen mostly from
linear layout manager which ki wrote

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240
linear layout manager which ki wrote
 

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.850
linear layout manager which ki wrote
which I would suggest you look at to

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:02.860
which I would suggest you look at to
 

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.410
which I would suggest you look at to
understand the basics of how this works

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:04.420
understand the basics of how this works
 

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.240
understand the basics of how this works
but at a very high level there's sort of

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:06.250
but at a very high level there's sort of
 

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.040
but at a very high level there's sort of
three important elements here one is

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:08.050
three important elements here one is
 

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:09.720
three important elements here one is
first you detach and scrap the view so

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:09.730
first you detach and scrap the view so
 

00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:11.640
first you detach and scrap the view so
you basically say okay take everything

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:11.650
you basically say okay take everything
 

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.710
you basically say okay take everything
off and then I'm going to tell you how

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:13.720
off and then I'm going to tell you how
 

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.110
off and then I'm going to tell you how
to repopulate it into the end of the

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:16.120
to repopulate it into the end of the
 

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.180
to repopulate it into the end of the
view and then we're going to go through

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:18.190
view and then we're going to go through
 

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:19.650
view and then we're going to go through
all the items that need to be in the

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:19.660
all the items that need to be in the
 

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.020
all the items that need to be in the
list and we're going to add them in and

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:22.030
list and we're going to add them in and
 

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.660
list and we're going to add them in and
then we're going to account for

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:23.670
then we're going to account for
 

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:27.750
then we're going to account for
information if it's if it's removed and

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760
information if it's if it's removed and
 

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.590
information if it's if it's removed and
we're going to adjust the layout

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:28.600
we're going to adjust the layout
 

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.840
we're going to adjust the layout
parameters appropriately and there's a

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:30.850
parameters appropriately and there's a
 

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:32.490
parameters appropriately and there's a
couple of important things to note here

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:32.500
couple of important things to note here
 

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.400
couple of important things to note here
is the item count accounts for not just

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:35.410
is the item count accounts for not just
 

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:37.200
is the item count accounts for not just
the real items that are in the list but

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:37.210
the real items that are in the list but
 

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:39.150
the real items that are in the list but
if you're being called on pre layout it

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:39.160
if you're being called on pre layout it
 

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.920
if you're being called on pre layout it
also accounts for the items that are in

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:40.930
also accounts for the items that are in
 

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:43.590
also accounts for the items that are in
the list pre prior to layout running

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600
the list pre prior to layout running
 

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.300
the list pre prior to layout running
right so we want to know where all of

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:45.310
right so we want to know where all of
 

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:47.820
right so we want to know where all of
the items were before a layout run

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:47.830
the items were before a layout run
 

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:49.410
the items were before a layout run
including those items that are going to

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:49.420
including those items that are going to
 

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.020
including those items that are going to
go away because of layout so you iterate

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:52.030
go away because of layout so you iterate
 

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:53.580
go away because of layout so you iterate
through those you put them in place you

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:53.590
through those you put them in place you
 

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:55.050
through those you put them in place you
add all the views to recyclerview and

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:55.060
add all the views to recyclerview and
 

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.890
add all the views to recyclerview and
then finally you do this step

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:56.900
then finally you do this step
 

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.120
then finally you do this step
and say well if I'm not running

00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:58.130
and say well if I'm not running
 

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.100
and say well if I'm not running
pre-layout then I also need to figure

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:00.110
pre-layout then I also need to figure
 

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:02.020
pre-layout then I also need to figure
out where the items are going to be in

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:02.030
out where the items are going to be in
 

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.690
out where the items are going to be in
the virtual recyclerview and the virtual

00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:04.700
the virtual recyclerview and the virtual
 

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.220
the virtual recyclerview and the virtual
list after layout runs

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:06.230
list after layout runs
 

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.049
list after layout runs
so once you've provided all that

00:20:08.049 --> 00:20:08.059
so once you've provided all that
 

00:20:08.059 --> 00:20:09.520
so once you've provided all that
information then recyclerview

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:09.530
information then recyclerview
 

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:12.910
information then recyclerview
has the information that it needs to

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:12.920
has the information that it needs to
 

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.620
has the information that it needs to
then provide it to the item animator to

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:14.630
then provide it to the item animator to
 

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.810
then provide it to the item animator to
run the animations so in item animator

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:16.820
run the animations so in item animator
 

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:22.900
run the animations so in item animator
let's have some gratuitous animations so

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:22.910
let's have some gratuitous animations so
 

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.360
let's have some gratuitous animations so
a couple item options with item animator

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:25.370
a couple item options with item animator
 

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.910
a couple item options with item animator
one is go ahead and use the default item

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:27.920
one is go ahead and use the default item
 

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.190
one is go ahead and use the default item
animator that's why we wrote it it does

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:30.200
animator that's why we wrote it it does
 

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.169
animator that's why we wrote it it does
a lot of the basics for you if you just

00:20:32.169 --> 00:20:32.179
a lot of the basics for you if you just
 

00:20:32.179 --> 00:20:35.110
a lot of the basics for you if you just
want simple animations recyclerview

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120
want simple animations recyclerview
 

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.120
want simple animations recyclerview
basically enables default item animator

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:37.130
basically enables default item animator
 

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.910
basically enables default item animator
by default that's why we called it that

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:39.920
by default that's why we called it that
 

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.430
by default that's why we called it that
this clever naming we believe a lot

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:42.440
this clever naming we believe a lot
 

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.880
this clever naming we believe a lot
about api's and the Android team then go

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:45.890
about api's and the Android team then go
 

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.950
about api's and the Android team then go
ahead and use it and you could at least

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:47.960
ahead and use it and you could at least
 

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.299
ahead and use it and you could at least
start from there and then start

00:20:49.299 --> 00:20:49.309
start from there and then start
 

00:20:49.309 --> 00:20:52.720
start from there and then start
customizing as you as you see fit for

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:52.730
customizing as you as you see fit for
 

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.900
customizing as you as you see fit for
some specialized animations so it does

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:55.910
some specialized animations so it does
 

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.030
some specialized animations so it does
fade out and translate and it fades in

00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:58.040
fade out and translate and it fades in
 

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.450
fade out and translate and it fades in
and it crossfades changes option two is

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:01.460
and it crossfades changes option two is
 

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.160
and it crossfades changes option two is
you can get a little more customized and

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:03.170
you can get a little more customized and
 

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:06.580
you can get a little more customized and
you can implement item animator directly

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:06.590
you can implement item animator directly
 

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:09.970
you can implement item animator directly
or implement simple item animator or you

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:09.980
or implement simple item animator or you
 

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.919
or implement simple item animator or you
can subclass so what we did in the demo

00:21:11.919 --> 00:21:11.929
can subclass so what we did in the demo
 

00:21:11.929 --> 00:21:14.080
can subclass so what we did in the demo
you're about to see is we subclass off

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:14.090
you're about to see is we subclass off
 

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:15.970
you're about to see is we subclass off
of default item animator and then just

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:15.980
of default item animator and then just
 

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.799
of default item animator and then just
overrode the specific capabilities that

00:21:17.799 --> 00:21:17.809
overrode the specific capabilities that
 

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:19.060
overrode the specific capabilities that
we wanted so there's a lot of things

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:19.070
we wanted so there's a lot of things
 

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.770
we wanted so there's a lot of things
that you can lean on there so that you

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:20.780
that you can lean on there so that you
 

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.169
that you can lean on there so that you
don't have to actually do everything so

00:21:23.169 --> 00:21:23.179
don't have to actually do everything so
 

00:21:23.179 --> 00:21:24.669
don't have to actually do everything so
there's an important step about

00:21:24.669 --> 00:21:24.679
there's an important step about
 

00:21:24.679 --> 00:21:26.049
there's an important step about
recording the pre and post layout

00:21:26.049 --> 00:21:26.059
recording the pre and post layout
 

00:21:26.059 --> 00:21:28.180
recording the pre and post layout
information chances are if you're doing

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:28.190
information chances are if you're doing
 

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:30.190
information chances are if you're doing
custom animations you may want more

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:30.200
custom animations you may want more
 

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.140
custom animations you may want more
information than the system records by

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:32.150
information than the system records by
 

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.150
information than the system records by
default by default that says what was

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:34.160
default by default that says what was
 

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.700
default by default that says what was
the view that was changing here and what

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:36.710
the view that was changing here and what
 

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:38.290
the view that was changing here and what
was the bout what were the bounds of

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:38.300
was the bout what were the bounds of
 

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.690
was the bout what were the bounds of
that view so then it knows basically how

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:40.700
that view so then it knows basically how
 

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.370
that view so then it knows basically how
big it was and where it came from before

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:42.380
big it was and where it came from before
 

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.770
big it was and where it came from before
and after and it can create some simple

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:44.780
and after and it can create some simple
 

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.870
and after and it can create some simple
animations based on that information but

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880
animations based on that information but
 

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.790
animations based on that information but
if you're animating custom content in

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:48.800
if you're animating custom content in
 

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.820
if you're animating custom content in
your view holder then maybe you want

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:51.830
your view holder then maybe you want
 

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.590
your view holder then maybe you want
more information recorded before and

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600
more information recorded before and
 

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.270
more information recorded before and
after it's worth pointing out that if

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280
after it's worth pointing out that if
 

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.590
after it's worth pointing out that if
anybody's taken a look at the

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:56.600
anybody's taken a look at the
 

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.419
anybody's taken a look at the
transitions or the activity transitions

00:21:58.419 --> 00:21:58.429
transitions or the activity transitions
 

00:21:58.429 --> 00:22:02.049
transitions or the activity transitions
api's this is very similar to that it's

00:22:02.049 --> 00:22:02.059
api's this is very similar to that it's
 

00:22:02.059 --> 00:22:04.060
api's this is very similar to that it's
the idea that I need to record a bunch

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:04.070
the idea that I need to record a bunch
 

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.980
the idea that I need to record a bunch
of information then layout is going to

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:05.990
of information then layout is going to
 

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:08.169
of information then layout is going to
run then I'm going to record information

00:22:08.169 --> 00:22:08.179
run then I'm going to record information
 

00:22:08.179 --> 00:22:09.340
run then I'm going to record information
for the same input

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:09.350
for the same input
 

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.080
for the same input
different views and then we're going to

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:11.090
different views and then we're going to
 

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:12.370
different views and then we're going to
compare them and run appropriate

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:12.380
compare them and run appropriate
 

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.500
compare them and run appropriate
animations so we record that stuff

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:14.510
animations so we record that stuff
 

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:16.240
animations so we record that stuff
before and after and then you're going

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:16.250
before and after and then you're going
 

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:17.760
before and after and then you're going
to override you're going to choose which

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:17.770
to override you're going to choose which
 

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:20.020
to override you're going to choose which
methods to override so you can animate

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:20.030
methods to override so you can animate
 

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:21.789
methods to override so you can animate
the appearance or disappearance for

00:22:21.789 --> 00:22:21.799
the appearance or disappearance for
 

00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:23.770
the appearance or disappearance for
things that are appearing or going away

00:22:23.770 --> 00:22:23.780
things that are appearing or going away
 

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.830
things that are appearing or going away
whether they're moving or not you're

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840
whether they're moving or not you're
 

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.180
whether they're moving or not you're
going to animate persistence which is

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:28.190
going to animate persistence which is
 

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:29.650
going to animate persistence which is
the things that don't move as well as

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:29.660
the things that don't move as well as
 

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.539
the things that don't move as well as
the things that move on the screen but

00:22:31.539 --> 00:22:31.549
the things that move on the screen but
 

00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:33.220
the things that move on the screen but
basically are their before and after

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:33.230
basically are their before and after
 

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:34.840
basically are their before and after
layout runs and then you're going to

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:34.850
layout runs and then you're going to
 

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:36.850
layout runs and then you're going to
animate change when the actual contents

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:36.860
animate change when the actual contents
 

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.520
animate change when the actual contents
in items change and all of these as I

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:39.530
in items change and all of these as I
 

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:40.890
in items change and all of these as I
said these have standards

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:40.900
said these have standards
 

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.789
said these have standards
implementations in default item animator

00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799
implementations in default item animator
 

00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:44.620
implementations in default item animator
but then you can choose to override and

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:44.630
but then you can choose to override and
 

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.350
but then you can choose to override and
do something custom if you want and then

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360
do something custom if you want and then
 

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:49.149
do something custom if you want and then
an important point is that when you're

00:22:49.149 --> 00:22:49.159
an important point is that when you're
 

00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:50.529
an important point is that when you're
done with your animation on any

00:22:50.529 --> 00:22:50.539
done with your animation on any
 

00:22:50.539 --> 00:22:52.539
done with your animation on any
particular view holder you have to call

00:22:52.539 --> 00:22:52.549
particular view holder you have to call
 

00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:54.520
particular view holder you have to call
dispatch animation finished there's a

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:54.530
dispatch animation finished there's a
 

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:55.990
dispatch animation finished there's a
little bit of state that's being tracked

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000
little bit of state that's being tracked
 

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.360
little bit of state that's being tracked
in some situations that we need to know

00:22:58.360 --> 00:22:58.370
in some situations that we need to know
 

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:01.299
in some situations that we need to know
when to get rid of so a good example you

00:23:01.299 --> 00:23:01.309
when to get rid of so a good example you
 

00:23:01.309 --> 00:23:04.029
when to get rid of so a good example you
alluded to this before is if you remove

00:23:04.029 --> 00:23:04.039
alluded to this before is if you remove
 

00:23:04.039 --> 00:23:05.529
alluded to this before is if you remove
a view and then we're going to animate

00:23:05.529 --> 00:23:05.539
a view and then we're going to animate
 

00:23:05.539 --> 00:23:07.149
a view and then we're going to animate
it we're going to fade that view out we

00:23:07.149 --> 00:23:07.159
it we're going to fade that view out we
 

00:23:07.159 --> 00:23:08.799
it we're going to fade that view out we
actually take that view when we add it

00:23:08.799 --> 00:23:08.809
actually take that view when we add it
 

00:23:08.809 --> 00:23:11.140
actually take that view when we add it
into the view group so that it can exist

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:11.150
into the view group so that it can exist
 

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:12.640
into the view group so that it can exist
so that we can actually fade it out

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:12.650
so that we can actually fade it out
 

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:14.049
so that we can actually fade it out
right you're removed it from the

00:23:14.049 --> 00:23:14.059
right you're removed it from the
 

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:16.149

and after and then we fade in a new item
at the bottom the delete operation is

00:26:28.719 --> 00:26:28.729
at the bottom the delete operation is
 

00:26:28.729 --> 00:26:31.060
at the bottom the delete operation is
very simpler simple we remove it from

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:31.070
very simpler simple we remove it from
 

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:33.730
very simpler simple we remove it from
the list that we had

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:33.740
the list that we had
 

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.370
the list that we had
the appropriate position there and then

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:36.380
the appropriate position there and then
 

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.200
the appropriate position there and then
we do a notify item removed it's

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:38.210
we do a notify item removed it's
 

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:41.410
we do a notify item removed it's
important to tell recyclerview the thing

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:41.420
important to tell recyclerview the thing
 

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:42.610
important to tell recyclerview the thing
that happened don't you say well

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:42.620
that happened don't you say well
 

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.890
that happened don't you say well
something changed the more information

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:44.900
something changed the more information
 

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.110
something changed the more information
you give us about the specific range the

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120
you give us about the specific range the
 

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:49.540
you give us about the specific range the
specific item the specific action the

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:49.550
specific item the specific action the
 

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:52.210
specific item the specific action the
better able we are going to be to

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:52.220
better able we are going to be to
 

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.470
better able we are going to be to
actually take advantage of that and give

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:53.480
actually take advantage of that and give
 

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.270
actually take advantage of that and give
you a richer experience if you just say

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:55.280
you a richer experience if you just say
 

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.890
you a richer experience if you just say
something changed and we don't have

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:56.900
something changed and we don't have
 

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.169
something changed and we don't have
stable IDs and can't determine what

00:26:59.169 --> 00:26:59.179
stable IDs and can't determine what
 

00:26:59.179 --> 00:27:00.760
stable IDs and can't determine what
those things are that changed you're

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:00.770
those things are that changed you're
 

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:01.840
those things are that changed you're
probably not going to get the rich

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:01.850
probably not going to get the rich
 

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.650
probably not going to get the rich
animations and interaction that you want

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:04.660
animations and interaction that you want
 

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:06.760
animations and interaction that you want
okay so let's take a look at add

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:06.770
okay so let's take a look at add
 

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:08.740
okay so let's take a look at add
animations once again we're going to

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:08.750
animations once again we're going to
 

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:09.880
animations once again we're going to
click an item there and then we're going

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:09.890
click an item there and then we're going
 

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:11.260
click an item there and then we're going
to add one into the middle of the list

00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:11.270
to add one into the middle of the list
 

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:13.150
to add one into the middle of the list
we're going to fade the thing out at the

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:13.160
we're going to fade the thing out at the
 

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.410
we're going to fade the thing out at the
bottom that's going away we're going to

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:14.420
bottom that's going away we're going to
 

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.790
bottom that's going away we're going to
shift some sting things on the screen

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:15.800
shift some sting things on the screen
 

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.440
shift some sting things on the screen
then we're going to fade in the new item

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:17.450
then we're going to fade in the new item
 

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:20.020
then we're going to fade in the new item
they're decent animations but I think we

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:20.030
they're decent animations but I think we
 

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:21.640
they're decent animations but I think we
can do better this is very similar to

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:21.650
can do better this is very similar to
 

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.430
can do better this is very similar to
the delete thing where instead of

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:24.440
the delete thing where instead of
 

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.169
the delete thing where instead of
calling notify delete we do a notify

00:27:26.169 --> 00:27:26.179
calling notify delete we do a notify
 

00:27:26.179 --> 00:27:28.510
calling notify delete we do a notify
item inserted after we've added the

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:28.520
item inserted after we've added the
 

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.630
item inserted after we've added the
color into the list all right so here

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:31.640
color into the list all right so here
 

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.650
color into the list all right so here
are the artifacts that I was talking

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:32.660
are the artifacts that I was talking
 

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:33.940
are the artifacts that I was talking
about so you can sort of see these

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:33.950
about so you can sort of see these
 

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:36.700
about so you can sort of see these
delete and add operations again and you

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:36.710
delete and add operations again and you
 

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:38.530
delete and add operations again and you
can see that instead of like this is

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:38.540
can see that instead of like this is
 

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.630
can see that instead of like this is
supposed to be a contiguous list right

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:40.640
supposed to be a contiguous list right
 

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.310
supposed to be a contiguous list right
you're basically breaking the user's

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320
you're basically breaking the user's
 

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.930
you're basically breaking the user's
mental model they think there's a list

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:43.940
mental model they think there's a list
 

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.000
mental model they think there's a list
but then why is this thing why is that

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:46.010
but then why is this thing why is that
 

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:47.799
but then why is this thing why is that
they're that weird janky thing at the

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:47.809
they're that weird janky thing at the
 

00:27:47.809 --> 00:27:49.540
they're that weird janky thing at the
bottom where things are fading in and

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:49.550
bottom where things are fading in and
 

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:50.980
bottom where things are fading in and
out now it doesn't look like a list it

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:50.990
out now it doesn't look like a list it
 

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:52.510
out now it doesn't look like a list it
just looks like a jumble of items there

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:52.520
just looks like a jumble of items there
 

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.280
just looks like a jumble of items there
right so that's the thing that we want

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:54.290
right so that's the thing that we want
 

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:55.799
right so that's the thing that we want
to get around with predictive animations

00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:55.809
to get around with predictive animations
 

00:27:55.809 --> 00:27:58.330
to get around with predictive animations
so if we take a look at predictive

00:27:58.330 --> 00:27:58.340
so if we take a look at predictive
 

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.520
so if we take a look at predictive
animations for the fade case you can see

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:00.530
animations for the fade case you can see
 

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:02.980
animations for the fade case you can see
that now when items go away they move

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:02.990
that now when items go away they move
 

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.260
that now when items go away they move
off the screen very logically into the

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:05.270
off the screen very logically into the
 

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:06.760
off the screen very logically into the
position that they're still occupying

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:06.770
position that they're still occupying
 

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:08.020
position that they're still occupying
within the virtual list

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:08.030
within the virtual list
 

00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:09.880
within the virtual list
same thing with delete when items come

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:09.890
same thing with delete when items come
 

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:12.250
same thing with delete when items come
in from off screen they're moving in in

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:12.260
in from off screen they're moving in in
 

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:14.320
in from off screen they're moving in in
a very predictable manner that matches

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:14.330
a very predictable manner that matches
 

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:16.060
a very predictable manner that matches
what the user thinks about this list

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:16.070
what the user thinks about this list
 

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:22.060
what the user thinks about this list
structure so some code to enable this

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:22.070
structure so some code to enable this
 

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.310
structure so some code to enable this
first of all here's my awesome linear

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320
first of all here's my awesome linear
 

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.049
first of all here's my awesome linear
layout manager custom class where it

00:28:26.049 --> 00:28:26.059
layout manager custom class where it
 

00:28:26.059 --> 00:28:27.760
layout manager custom class where it
basically just enables or disables

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:27.770
basically just enables or disables
 

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:29.590
basically just enables or disables
predictive animations just for the

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:29.600
predictive animations just for the
 

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.970
predictive animations just for the
purposes of running the show demo boosts

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:30.980
purposes of running the show demo boosts
 

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.460
purposes of running the show demo boosts
or suit yeah we're going to open source

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:33.470
or suit yeah we're going to open source
 

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:35.970
or suit yeah we're going to open source
just that one snippet of code

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:35.980
just that one snippet of code
 

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.889
just that one snippet of code
that's really the most interesting bit

00:28:37.889 --> 00:28:37.899
that's really the most interesting bit
 

00:28:37.899 --> 00:28:40.350
that's really the most interesting bit
in the entire demo we're looking into

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.360
in the entire demo we're looking into
 

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.759
in the entire demo we're looking into
open sourcing the rest of it but that's

00:28:41.759 --> 00:28:41.769
open sourcing the rest of it but that's
 

00:28:41.769 --> 00:28:42.810
open sourcing the rest of it but that's
the one that I really want to get out

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:42.820
the one that I really want to get out
 

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:45.240
the one that I really want to get out
there maybe we can write an article on

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:45.250
there maybe we can write an article on
 

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:47.399
there maybe we can write an article on
my blog about that medium.com will write

00:28:47.399 --> 00:28:47.409
my blog about that medium.com will write
 

00:28:47.409 --> 00:28:49.440
my blog about that medium.com will write
an article about that snippet check

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:49.450
an article about that snippet check
 

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:49.830
an article about that snippet check
there

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840
there
 

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:54.299
there
okay so default change animations you

00:28:54.299 --> 00:28:54.309
okay so default change animations you
 

00:28:54.309 --> 00:28:55.740
okay so default change animations you
can see as we click it you get a

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:55.750
can see as we click it you get a
 

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.210
can see as we click it you get a
crossfade right the we're doing a

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:57.220
crossfade right the we're doing a
 

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.529
crossfade right the we're doing a
crossfade of the background color as

00:28:58.529 --> 00:28:58.539
crossfade of the background color as
 

00:28:58.539 --> 00:29:00.180
crossfade of the background color as
well as the text everything all at the

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:00.190
well as the text everything all at the
 

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:01.860
well as the text everything all at the
same time basically we have the old view

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:01.870
same time basically we have the old view
 

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:03.930
same time basically we have the old view
we have the new view and we simply do an

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:03.940
we have the new view and we simply do an
 

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.330
we have the new view and we simply do an
alpha crossfade between them it's decent

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:06.340
alpha crossfade between them it's decent
 

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:07.799
alpha crossfade between them it's decent
but maybe we can make that a little more

00:29:07.799 --> 00:29:07.809
but maybe we can make that a little more
 

00:29:07.809 --> 00:29:10.289
but maybe we can make that a little more
interesting and that's with the standard

00:29:10.289 --> 00:29:10.299
interesting and that's with the standard
 

00:29:10.299 --> 00:29:13.649
interesting and that's with the standard
item default item animator so with a

00:29:13.649 --> 00:29:13.659
item default item animator so with a
 

00:29:13.659 --> 00:29:15.810
item default item animator so with a
custom item animator we've got a little

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:15.820
custom item animator we've got a little
 

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:18.120
custom item animator we've got a little
bit something more interesting going on

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:18.130
bit something more interesting going on
 

00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:20.129
bit something more interesting going on
so instead of cross fading between these

00:29:20.129 --> 00:29:20.139
so instead of cross fading between these
 

00:29:20.139 --> 00:29:22.080
so instead of cross fading between these
two views we're actually treating the

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:22.090
two views we're actually treating the
 

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:23.399
two views we're actually treating the
entire view hierarchy in there the

00:29:23.399 --> 00:29:23.409
entire view hierarchy in there the
 

00:29:23.409 --> 00:29:24.570
entire view hierarchy in there the
linear layout and the textview

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:24.580
linear layout and the textview
 

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:25.919
linear layout and the textview
separately and doing different things

00:29:25.919 --> 00:29:25.929
separately and doing different things
 

00:29:25.929 --> 00:29:26.519
separately and doing different things
with them

00:29:26.519 --> 00:29:26.529
with them
 

00:29:26.529 --> 00:29:28.320
with them
so the background color is fading to

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:28.330
so the background color is fading to
 

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:30.180
so the background color is fading to
black and then back up to the new color

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:30.190
black and then back up to the new color
 

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:32.639
black and then back up to the new color
and the text is rotating out of place

00:29:32.639 --> 00:29:32.649
and the text is rotating out of place
 

00:29:32.649 --> 00:29:34.470
and the text is rotating out of place
and then with the new value rotating

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480
and then with the new value rotating
 

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.919
and then with the new value rotating
into place so how do we do that first of

00:29:37.919 --> 00:29:37.929
into place so how do we do that first of
 

00:29:37.929 --> 00:29:39.690
into place so how do we do that first of
all we say that we can reuse the view

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:39.700
all we say that we can reuse the view
 

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.310
all we say that we can reuse the view
holder because I don't want to create a

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:41.320
holder because I don't want to create a
 

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.230
holder because I don't want to create a
new one I simply want to animate the

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:43.240
new one I simply want to animate the
 

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.639
new one I simply want to animate the
items that are in the existing view

00:29:44.639 --> 00:29:44.649
items that are in the existing view
 

00:29:44.649 --> 00:29:48.060
items that are in the existing view
holder that we already have and then we

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:48.070
holder that we already have and then we
 

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:50.450
holder that we already have and then we
we extend default item animator

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:50.460
we extend default item animator
 

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.470
we extend default item animator
specifically to customize the change

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480
specifically to customize the change
 

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:56.789
specifically to customize the change
animation so here we've got the get item

00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799
animation so here we've got the get item
 

00:29:56.799 --> 00:29:58.740
animation so here we've got the get item
holder info this is a data structure

00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:58.750
holder info this is a data structure
 

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:00.539
holder info this is a data structure
where we cache the information that

00:30:00.539 --> 00:30:00.549
where we cache the information that
 

00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:02.100
where we cache the information that
we're going to retain before and after

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:02.110
we're going to retain before and after
 

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:03.870
we're going to retain before and after
so that we know the values that we

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:03.880
so that we know the values that we
 

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.310
so that we know the values that we
actually need to animate before and

00:30:05.310 --> 00:30:05.320
actually need to animate before and
 

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.769
actually need to animate before and
after and then this is going to be

00:30:07.769 --> 00:30:07.779
after and then this is going to be
 

00:30:07.779 --> 00:30:10.110
after and then this is going to be
called by both the pre layout record

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:10.120
called by both the pre layout record
 

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.519
called by both the pre layout record
operation as well as the post layout

00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:11.529
operation as well as the post layout
 

00:30:11.529 --> 00:30:15.299
operation as well as the post layout
record so basically when you when you

00:30:15.299 --> 00:30:15.309
record so basically when you when you
 

00:30:15.309 --> 00:30:16.590
record so basically when you when you
customize this stuff we're going to call

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:16.600
customize this stuff we're going to call
 

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.539
customize this stuff we're going to call
your code and say okay record whatever

00:30:18.539 --> 00:30:18.549
your code and say okay record whatever
 

00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:21.060
your code and say okay record whatever
you want before and now layout is run

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:21.070
you want before and now layout is run
 

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.980
you want before and now layout is run
record whatever you want after and then

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:22.990
record whatever you want after and then
 

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:24.240
record whatever you want after and then
your animation calls are going to be

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:24.250
your animation calls are going to be
 

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.730
your animation calls are going to be
called with those data structures so

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:26.740
called with those data structures so
 

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:27.659
called with those data structures so
that you can then take that information

00:30:27.659 --> 00:30:27.669
that you can then take that information
 

00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:29.789
that you can then take that information
that you recorded earlier and do

00:30:29.789 --> 00:30:29.799
that you recorded earlier and do
 

00:30:29.799 --> 00:30:32.399
that you recorded earlier and do
something with it so here we override

00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:32.409
something with it so here we override
 

00:30:32.409 --> 00:30:34.470
something with it so here we override
the animate change method and you can

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480
the animate change method and you can
 

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.750
the animate change method and you can
see in the the method parameters we've

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:36.760
see in the the method parameters we've
 

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.120
see in the the method parameters we've
got the holder the old holder in the new

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:39.130
got the holder the old holder in the new
 

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:40.889
got the holder the old holder in the new
holder which in this case is actually

00:30:40.889 --> 00:30:40.899
holder which in this case is actually
 

00:30:40.899 --> 00:30:42.299
holder which in this case is actually
going to be the same view holder

00:30:42.299 --> 00:30:42.309
going to be the same view holder
 

00:30:42.309 --> 00:30:44.430
going to be the same view holder
information and we have the pre info in

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:44.440
information and we have the pre info in
 

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.080
information and we have the pre info in
the post info so that's the data

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:46.090
the post info so that's the data
 

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:47.490
the post info so that's the data
structures that we filled in ourselves

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:47.500
structures that we filled in ourselves
 

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:48.989
structures that we filled in ourselves
when we were called

00:30:48.989 --> 00:30:48.999
when we were called
 

00:30:48.999 --> 00:30:51.149
when we were called
for and after and then let's see how

00:30:51.149 --> 00:30:51.159
for and after and then let's see how
 

00:30:51.159 --> 00:30:52.979
for and after and then let's see how
this works so we create some animations

00:30:52.979 --> 00:30:52.989
this works so we create some animations
 

00:30:52.989 --> 00:30:54.959
this works so we create some animations
here we have one animation that does

00:30:54.959 --> 00:30:54.969
here we have one animation that does
 

00:30:54.969 --> 00:30:56.639
here we have one animation that does
have fade to black from the old color

00:30:56.639 --> 00:30:56.649
have fade to black from the old color
 

00:30:56.649 --> 00:30:58.979
have fade to black from the old color
and then fade from black into the new

00:30:58.979 --> 00:30:58.989
and then fade from black into the new
 

00:30:58.989 --> 00:31:00.809
and then fade from black into the new
color and we structure that inside an

00:31:00.809 --> 00:31:00.819
color and we structure that inside an
 

00:31:00.819 --> 00:31:03.059
color and we structure that inside an
animator set and sequence those to run

00:31:03.059 --> 00:31:03.069
animator set and sequence those to run
 

00:31:03.069 --> 00:31:05.099
animator set and sequence those to run
one after the other and then the text

00:31:05.099 --> 00:31:05.109
one after the other and then the text
 

00:31:05.109 --> 00:31:07.349
one after the other and then the text
rotation is on the textview itself so

00:31:07.349 --> 00:31:07.359
rotation is on the textview itself so
 

00:31:07.359 --> 00:31:08.969
rotation is on the textview itself so
we're going to do a rotation of zero to

00:31:08.969 --> 00:31:08.979
we're going to do a rotation of zero to
 

00:31:08.979 --> 00:31:10.579
we're going to do a rotation of zero to
90 to rotate it so that it's

00:31:10.579 --> 00:31:10.589
90 to rotate it so that it's
 

00:31:10.589 --> 00:31:13.769
90 to rotate it so that it's
perpendicular to the viewer and then we

00:31:13.769 --> 00:31:13.779
perpendicular to the viewer and then we
 

00:31:13.779 --> 00:31:15.359
perpendicular to the viewer and then we
swap the text out we'll see on the next

00:31:15.359 --> 00:31:15.369
swap the text out we'll see on the next
 

00:31:15.369 --> 00:31:17.969
swap the text out we'll see on the next
slide and then we animate the text back

00:31:17.969 --> 00:31:17.979
slide and then we animate the text back
 

00:31:17.979 --> 00:31:19.739
slide and then we animate the text back
into place with the new value of it and

00:31:19.739 --> 00:31:19.749
into place with the new value of it and
 

00:31:19.749 --> 00:31:21.809
into place with the new value of it and
again we run those sequentially animator

00:31:21.809 --> 00:31:21.819
again we run those sequentially animator
 

00:31:21.819 --> 00:31:24.619
again we run those sequentially animator
set run one run the other and we're done

00:31:24.619 --> 00:31:24.629
set run one run the other and we're done
 

00:31:24.629 --> 00:31:26.609
set run one run the other and we're done
I'm cutting out a little bit of code

00:31:26.609 --> 00:31:26.619
I'm cutting out a little bit of code
 

00:31:26.619 --> 00:31:27.989
I'm cutting out a little bit of code
there's some interpolators in there but

00:31:27.989 --> 00:31:27.999
there's some interpolators in there but
 

00:31:27.999 --> 00:31:29.549
there's some interpolators in there but
I just wanted to get the the high-level

00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:29.559
I just wanted to get the the high-level
 

00:31:29.559 --> 00:31:31.949
I just wanted to get the the high-level
view what's going on there and then we

00:31:31.949 --> 00:31:31.959
view what's going on there and then we
 

00:31:31.959 --> 00:31:34.379
view what's going on there and then we
add a listener on the animation so that

00:31:34.379 --> 00:31:34.389
add a listener on the animation so that
 

00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:36.299
add a listener on the animation so that
we swap the text appropriately so we're

00:31:36.299 --> 00:31:36.309
we swap the text appropriately so we're
 

00:31:36.309 --> 00:31:38.249
we swap the text appropriately so we're
going to use the old text so we've

00:31:38.249 --> 00:31:38.259
going to use the old text so we've
 

00:31:38.259 --> 00:31:40.499
going to use the old text so we've
already run layout right and our reused

00:31:40.499 --> 00:31:40.509
already run layout right and our reused
 

00:31:40.509 --> 00:31:42.959
already run layout right and our reused
view holder has the new text in it well

00:31:42.959 --> 00:31:42.969
view holder has the new text in it well
 

00:31:42.969 --> 00:31:44.189
view holder has the new text in it well
that's not going to make any sense if

00:31:44.189 --> 00:31:44.199
that's not going to make any sense if
 

00:31:44.199 --> 00:31:45.659
that's not going to make any sense if
we're trying to rotate the old text out

00:31:45.659 --> 00:31:45.669
we're trying to rotate the old text out
 

00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:47.369
we're trying to rotate the old text out
so when the animation starts we

00:31:47.369 --> 00:31:47.379
so when the animation starts we
 

00:31:47.379 --> 00:31:49.199
so when the animation starts we
substitute that with the old text and

00:31:49.199 --> 00:31:49.209
substitute that with the old text and
 

00:31:49.209 --> 00:31:51.359
substitute that with the old text and
then we run that half an animation to

00:31:51.359 --> 00:31:51.369
then we run that half an animation to
 

00:31:51.369 --> 00:31:53.699
then we run that half an animation to
rotate it out of view so the viewer

00:31:53.699 --> 00:31:53.709
rotate it out of view so the viewer
 

00:31:53.709 --> 00:31:55.769
rotate it out of view so the viewer
can't see it anymore then we swap in the

00:31:55.769 --> 00:31:55.779
can't see it anymore then we swap in the
 

00:31:55.779 --> 00:31:57.749
can't see it anymore then we swap in the
value of the new text and we rotate it

00:31:57.749 --> 00:31:57.759
value of the new text and we rotate it
 

00:31:57.759 --> 00:32:01.439
value of the new text and we rotate it
into place change animations and now we

00:32:01.439 --> 00:32:01.449
into place change animations and now we
 

00:32:01.449 --> 00:32:02.849
into place change animations and now we
put all the stuff together we create an

00:32:02.849 --> 00:32:02.859
put all the stuff together we create an
 

00:32:02.859 --> 00:32:05.189
put all the stuff together we create an
animator sets and we add them all

00:32:05.189 --> 00:32:05.199
animator sets and we add them all
 

00:32:05.199 --> 00:32:07.109
animator sets and we add them all
together and then most important we call

00:32:07.109 --> 00:32:07.119
together and then most important we call
 

00:32:07.119 --> 00:32:09.359
together and then most important we call
we call dispatch animation finished so

00:32:09.359 --> 00:32:09.369
we call dispatch animation finished so
 

00:32:09.369 --> 00:32:10.889
we call dispatch animation finished so
that the recycler view can get rid of

00:32:10.889 --> 00:32:10.899
that the recycler view can get rid of
 

00:32:10.899 --> 00:32:12.389
that the recycler view can get rid of
any state that it retained for these

00:32:12.389 --> 00:32:12.399
any state that it retained for these
 

00:32:12.399 --> 00:32:14.609
any state that it retained for these
things along the way and then we're off

00:32:14.609 --> 00:32:14.619
things along the way and then we're off
 

00:32:14.619 --> 00:32:16.919
things along the way and then we're off
and running okay so on the previous one

00:32:16.919 --> 00:32:16.929
and running okay so on the previous one
 

00:32:16.929 --> 00:32:19.139
and running okay so on the previous one
if you actually clicked on an item that

00:32:19.139 --> 00:32:19.149
if you actually clicked on an item that
 

00:32:19.149 --> 00:32:20.789
if you actually clicked on an item that
was animating you'd get some kind of

00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:20.799
was animating you'd get some kind of
 

00:32:20.799 --> 00:32:22.679
was animating you'd get some kind of
janky effects because you'd be in the

00:32:22.679 --> 00:32:22.689
janky effects because you'd be in the
 

00:32:22.689 --> 00:32:24.389
janky effects because you'd be in the
middle of an animation and then a new

00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399
middle of an animation and then a new
 

00:32:24.399 --> 00:32:26.549
middle of an animation and then a new
animation would start and they both be

00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559
animation would start and they both be
 

00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:28.679
animation would start and they both be
running at the same time or maybe you

00:32:28.679 --> 00:32:28.689
running at the same time or maybe you
 

00:32:28.689 --> 00:32:30.359
running at the same time or maybe you
could cancel one but you would get some

00:32:30.359 --> 00:32:30.369
could cancel one but you would get some
 

00:32:30.369 --> 00:32:33.059
could cancel one but you would get some
discontinuous behavior so what I really

00:32:33.059 --> 00:32:33.069
discontinuous behavior so what I really
 

00:32:33.069 --> 00:32:35.429
discontinuous behavior so what I really
wanted was if the user just continuously

00:32:35.429 --> 00:32:35.439
wanted was if the user just continuously
 

00:32:35.439 --> 00:32:37.799
wanted was if the user just continuously
clicks on these things you make that

00:32:37.799 --> 00:32:37.809
clicks on these things you make that
 

00:32:37.809 --> 00:32:39.869
clicks on these things you make that
transition to the new animation as

00:32:39.869 --> 00:32:39.879
transition to the new animation as
 

00:32:39.879 --> 00:32:41.579
transition to the new animation as
smooth as possible so you can see we're

00:32:41.579 --> 00:32:41.589
smooth as possible so you can see we're
 

00:32:41.589 --> 00:32:42.809
smooth as possible so you can see we're
doing that on the right there we're

00:32:42.809 --> 00:32:42.819
doing that on the right there we're
 

00:32:42.819 --> 00:32:43.979
doing that on the right there we're
clicking on this thing and it looks

00:32:43.979 --> 00:32:43.989
clicking on this thing and it looks
 

00:32:43.989 --> 00:32:46.349
clicking on this thing and it looks
mostly good if if they click during the

00:32:46.349 --> 00:32:46.359
mostly good if if they click during the
 

00:32:46.359 --> 00:32:47.819
mostly good if if they click during the
second half well there's I mean there's

00:32:47.819 --> 00:32:47.829
second half well there's I mean there's
 

00:32:47.829 --> 00:32:49.529
second half well there's I mean there's
a little too much information so we are

00:32:49.529 --> 00:32:49.539
a little too much information so we are
 

00:32:49.539 --> 00:32:51.329
a little too much information so we are
swapping the text along the way but

00:32:51.329 --> 00:32:51.339
swapping the text along the way but
 

00:32:51.339 --> 00:32:53.279
swapping the text along the way but
we're making the color transition as

00:32:53.279 --> 00:32:53.289
we're making the color transition as
 

00:32:53.289 --> 00:32:55.319
we're making the color transition as
smooth as possible so how do we do that

00:32:55.319 --> 00:32:55.329
smooth as possible so how do we do that
 

00:32:55.329 --> 00:32:57.539
smooth as possible so how do we do that
first of all we need to cache the

00:32:57.539 --> 00:32:57.549
first of all we need to cache the
 

00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:58.769
first of all we need to cache the
running animations we're going to need

00:32:58.769 --> 00:32:58.779
running animations we're going to need
 

00:32:58.779 --> 00:33:00.809
running animations we're going to need
to retain information about what's

00:33:00.809 --> 00:33:00.819
to retain information about what's
 

00:33:00.819 --> 00:33:01.730
to retain information about what's
actually running on

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:01.740
actually running on
 

00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:03.650
actually running on
each item so we can get that information

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:03.660
each item so we can get that information
 

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.419
each item so we can get that information
later so we're going to cast this in

00:33:05.419 --> 00:33:05.429
later so we're going to cast this in
 

00:33:05.429 --> 00:33:06.860
later so we're going to cast this in
this little data structure and then

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:06.870
this little data structure and then
 

00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:08.150
this little data structure and then
we're going to check it when we're told

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:08.160
we're going to check it when we're told
 

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.950
we're going to check it when we're told
to animate a change we're going to say

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960
to animate a change we're going to say
 

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.690
to animate a change we're going to say
well are there any animations currently

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:11.700
well are there any animations currently
 

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.790
well are there any animations currently
running on this thing if there are let's

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:13.800
running on this thing if there are let's
 

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.530
running on this thing if there are let's
record some information about that are

00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:15.540
record some information about that are
 

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.150
record some information about that are
we in the first half the animation or

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:17.160
we in the first half the animation or
 

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.010
we in the first half the animation or
the second half the animation and how

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:19.020
the second half the animation and how
 

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.669
the second half the animation and how
far are we in those animations and then

00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679
far are we in those animations and then
 

00:33:22.679 --> 00:33:25.910
far are we in those animations and then
we're going to seek the new animation so

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:25.920
we're going to seek the new animation so
 

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:26.840
we're going to seek the new animation so
we're going to take all that information

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:26.850
we're going to take all that information
 

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:28.940
we're going to take all that information
from what used to be running and then

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:28.950
from what used to be running and then
 

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:30.590
from what used to be running and then
seek in the new animations that we

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600
seek in the new animations that we
 

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.510
seek in the new animations that we
created from the previous code that we

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:32.520
created from the previous code that we
 

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.820
created from the previous code that we
saw before so that if you're halfway

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:34.830
saw before so that if you're halfway
 

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:36.980
saw before so that if you're halfway
through or quarter the way through that

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:36.990
through or quarter the way through that
 

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:38.660
through or quarter the way through that
first half an animation we're going to

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:38.670
first half an animation we're going to
 

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:40.100
first half an animation we're going to
seek a quarter of the way through the

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:40.110
seek a quarter of the way through the
 

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:41.960
seek a quarter of the way through the
new animation so it's going to start at

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:41.970
new animation so it's going to start at
 

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:43.640
new animation so it's going to start at
exactly the same place that the old one

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:43.650
exactly the same place that the old one
 

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:46.669
exactly the same place that the old one
left off and then we're going to cast

00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:46.679
left off and then we're going to cast
 

00:33:46.679 --> 00:33:47.900
left off and then we're going to cast
the new animators when we're done

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:47.910
the new animators when we're done
 

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:49.669
the new animators when we're done
because we need to provide that

00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679
because we need to provide that
 

00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:51.919
because we need to provide that
information for the next interruption

00:33:51.919 --> 00:33:51.929
information for the next interruption
 

00:33:51.929 --> 00:33:55.790
information for the next interruption
that occurs and that was it thanks yet

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:55.800
that occurs and that was it thanks yet
 

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:58.820
that occurs and that was it thanks yet
to us they were lovely meet I wish I saw

00:33:58.820 --> 00:33:58.830
to us they were lovely meet I wish I saw
 

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:01.730
to us they were lovely meet I wish I saw
them before I think that but that we

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:01.740
them before I think that but that we
 

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:05.840
them before I think that but that we
have okay so we wanted to touch base on

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:05.850
have okay so we wanted to touch base on
 

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:08.270
have okay so we wanted to touch base on
like some important things about

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280
like some important things about
 

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.099
like some important things about
recycling we that we think you should

00:34:10.099 --> 00:34:10.109
recycling we that we think you should
 

00:34:10.109 --> 00:34:14.750
recycling we that we think you should
know about so no update means no on mind

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760
know about so no update means no on mind
 

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.190
know about so no update means no on mind
this is one problem and people

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:16.200
this is one problem and people
 

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:19.190
this is one problem and people
transition from this view and commit the

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200
transition from this view and commit the
 

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.169
transition from this view and commit the
same expectations this psycho view is

00:34:21.169 --> 00:34:21.179
same expectations this psycho view is
 

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:23.960
same expectations this psycho view is
different so if you don't tell that an

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:23.970
different so if you don't tell that an
 

00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:26.270
different so if you don't tell that an
item has been updated we are not going

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280
item has been updated we are not going
 

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.790
item has been updated we are not going
to rebind it how the update and item use

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800
to rebind it how the update and item use
 

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.550
to rebind it how the update and item use
so for example if you say item move the

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:31.560
so for example if you say item move the
 

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.470
so for example if you say item move the
item only move like I have no idea you

00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480
item only move like I have no idea you
 

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.359
item only move like I have no idea you
are displaying a roll number there

00:34:35.359 --> 00:34:35.369
are displaying a roll number there
 

00:34:35.369 --> 00:34:38.300
are displaying a roll number there
because you didn't tell me item exchange

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:38.310
because you didn't tell me item exchange
 

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:40.639
because you didn't tell me item exchange
so we will just move it we are not going

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:40.649
so we will just move it we are not going
 

00:34:40.649 --> 00:34:42.859
so we will just move it we are not going
to tell to the adapter why do we do this

00:34:42.859 --> 00:34:42.869
to tell to the adapter why do we do this
 

00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:45.770
to tell to the adapter why do we do this
because not calling on mind means we are

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:45.780
because not calling on mind means we are
 

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.810
because not calling on mind means we are
not relating anything if we don't

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:47.820
not relating anything if we don't
 

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:50.480
not relating anything if we don't
invalidate anything Cash's are valid and

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:50.490
invalidate anything Cash's are valid and
 

00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:53.810
invalidate anything Cash's are valid and
kittens are happy it's important so

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:53.820
kittens are happy it's important so
 

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.510
kittens are happy it's important so
another another mistake I always see is

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:56.520
another another mistake I always see is
 

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.210
another another mistake I always see is
that making this you cannot make

00:34:59.210 --> 00:34:59.220
that making this you cannot make
 

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:02.060
that making this you cannot make
position final in own mind cause this is

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:02.070
position final in own mind cause this is
 

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:04.340
position final in own mind cause this is
this goes back to the same example in

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:04.350
this goes back to the same example in
 

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:06.650
this goes back to the same example in
the previous slide because just because

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:06.660
the previous slide because just because
 

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.540
the previous slide because just because
an item move doesn't mean we are going

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:08.550
an item move doesn't mean we are going
 

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:10.910
an item move doesn't mean we are going
to rebind it so if you use that position

00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920
to rebind it so if you use that position
 

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.310
to rebind it so if you use that position
in an example like this like in a click

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320
in an example like this like in a click
 

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.290
in an example like this like in a click
listener you are doing it wrong

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:15.300
listener you are doing it wrong
 

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:18.170
listener you are doing it wrong
so for we can easily crash this code by

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:18.180
so for we can easily crash this code by
 

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:19.760
so for we can easily crash this code by
something like this you bind it tight

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:19.770
something like this you bind it tight
 

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:22.370
something like this you bind it tight
and position five you move it then call

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:22.380
and position five you move it then call
 

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.380
and position five you move it then call
unclick now you remove the wrong item

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:24.390
unclick now you remove the wrong item
 

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:28.040
unclick now you remove the wrong item
from that up there so how do we solve

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:28.050
from that up there so how do we solve
 

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:33.110
from that up there so how do we solve
this oops let's all come here come here

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:33.120
this oops let's all come here come here
 

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.640
this oops let's all come here come here
come here

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:34.650
come here
 

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:38.630
come here
one more time okay yes this is how we

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640
one more time okay yes this is how we
 

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.970
one more time okay yes this is how we
solve it there's a gate adapter position

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:40.980
solve it there's a gate adapter position
 

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.740
solve it there's a gate adapter position
in the holder which will always give you

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:42.750
in the holder which will always give you
 

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:44.870
in the holder which will always give you
the up-to-date adapter position for a

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880
the up-to-date adapter position for a
 

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:48.560
the up-to-date adapter position for a
holder so if you cannot use that

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:48.570
holder so if you cannot use that
 

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:50.690
holder so if you cannot use that
position is better to create that click

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700
position is better to create that click
 

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:53.390
position is better to create that click
listener when you create a VM holder so

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:53.400
listener when you create a VM holder so
 

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.490
listener when you create a VM holder so
it's much better to use the crate view

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:55.500
it's much better to use the crate view
 

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.530
it's much better to use the crate view
holder to add your callback so that you

00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:57.540
holder to add your callback so that you
 

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.690
holder to add your callback so that you
don't keep creating any object every

00:35:59.690 --> 00:35:59.700
don't keep creating any object every
 

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.750
don't keep creating any object every
time the wave is rebounds and this know

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760
time the wave is rebounds and this know
 

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.490
time the wave is rebounds and this know
position check is also important because

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:04.500
position check is also important because
 

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:07.820
position check is also important because
in a case where an item is deleted but

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:07.830
in a case where an item is deleted but
 

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:10.010
in a case where an item is deleted but
uses quick enough to click on that item

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:10.020
uses quick enough to click on that item
 

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.320
uses quick enough to click on that item
before it is removed from the UI you may

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:12.330
before it is removed from the UI you may
 

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:14.270
before it is removed from the UI you may
you also receive the callback because

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280
you also receive the callback because
 

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.280
you also receive the callback because
the real view so you should always check

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:16.290
the real view so you should always check
 

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:21.200
the real view so you should always check
for no position another error about the

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:21.210
for no position another error about the
 

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:23.900
for no position another error about the
new API as we introduced is this item

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:23.910
new API as we introduced is this item
 

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:25.880
new API as we introduced is this item
payload so when you change an item you

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:25.890
payload so when you change an item you
 

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:29.750
payload so when you change an item you
could say white change for example I can

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:29.760
could say white change for example I can
 

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.760
could say white change for example I can
say this item this position change

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:31.770
say this item this position change
 

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:34.010
say this item this position change
because the like maybe you liked it or

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:34.020
because the like maybe you liked it or
 

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.100
because the like maybe you liked it or
your stop liking it the cool part about

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:37.110
your stop liking it the cool part about
 

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:38.780
your stop liking it the cool part about
this a pay is there's another on byte

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:38.790
this a pay is there's another on byte
 

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:41.000
this a pay is there's another on byte
method which receives a list of payloads

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:41.010
method which receives a list of payloads
 

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:44.120
method which receives a list of payloads
and such the payload is empty you just

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:44.130
and such the payload is empty you just
 

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:47.000
and such the payload is empty you just
run the regular on by but if the

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:47.010
run the regular on by but if the
 

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:49.790
run the regular on by but if the
payloads is not empty this means we are

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800
payloads is not empty this means we are
 

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.340
payloads is not empty this means we are
reusing the same beholder so you know

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:52.350
reusing the same beholder so you know
 

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:54.380
reusing the same beholder so you know
that that we older was representing the

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:54.390
that that we older was representing the
 

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:57.380
that that we older was representing the
same item before a change came for this

00:36:57.380 --> 00:36:57.390
same item before a change came for this
 

00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:00.470
same item before a change came for this
particular reason so the only thing so

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480
particular reason so the only thing so
 

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.150
particular reason so the only thing so
say it's the like update the only thing

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160
say it's the like update the only thing
 

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.820
say it's the like update the only thing
you have to do is change that button

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:04.830
you have to do is change that button
 

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:06.140
you have to do is change that button
because you know the rest of the view

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:06.150
because you know the rest of the view
 

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:08.570
because you know the rest of the view
older is valid and the same payload

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:08.580
older is valid and the same payload
 

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.730
older is valid and the same payload
deformations also pass to your item

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:10.740
deformations also pass to your item
 

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.490
deformations also pass to your item
animator where you can use to decide all

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:13.500
animator where you can use to decide all
 

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.200
animator where you can use to decide all
the like change I'm going to animate the

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:15.210
the like change I'm going to animate the
 

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:18.800
the like change I'm going to animate the
heart so this is another confusion

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:18.810
heart so this is another confusion
 

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:21.200
heart so this is another confusion
recyclerview where what doesn't adapter

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:21.210
recyclerview where what doesn't adapter
 

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:23.570
recyclerview where what doesn't adapter
position means a layout position like I

00:37:23.570 --> 00:37:23.580
position means a layout position like I
 

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.360
position means a layout position like I
can be that's only one position and we

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:26.370
can be that's only one position and we
 

00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:28.670
can be that's only one position and we
did it it was wrong so

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:28.680
did it it was wrong so
 

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.589
did it it was wrong so
see this example where we want your

00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599
see this example where we want your
 

00:37:30.599 --> 00:37:33.140
see this example where we want your
items the AP stands for adapter position

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:33.150
items the AP stands for adapter position
 

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.359
items the AP stands for adapter position
LP layout position they're all the same

00:37:35.359 --> 00:37:35.369
LP layout position they're all the same
 

00:37:35.369 --> 00:37:38.240
LP layout position they're all the same
it matches then the adapter says I move

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:38.250
it matches then the adapter says I move
 

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:40.010
it matches then the adapter says I move
the item and position to item at

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.020
the item and position to item at
 

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.859
the item and position to item at
position 5 so now if you look at it the

00:37:42.859 --> 00:37:42.869
position 5 so now if you look at it the
 

00:37:42.869 --> 00:37:45.799
position 5 so now if you look at it the
items their adapter position doesn't

00:37:45.799 --> 00:37:45.809
items their adapter position doesn't
 

00:37:45.809 --> 00:37:48.049
items their adapter position doesn't
match their layout positions recycle we

00:37:48.049 --> 00:37:48.059
match their layout positions recycle we
 

00:37:48.059 --> 00:37:50.240
match their layout positions recycle we
mostly say if you try to call the

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:50.250
mostly say if you try to call the
 

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:52.339
mostly say if you try to call the
adapter try to get the adapter position

00:37:52.339 --> 00:37:52.349
adapter try to get the adapter position
 

00:37:52.349 --> 00:37:54.620
adapter try to get the adapter position
on that field it will tell you that 5 so

00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:54.630
on that field it will tell you that 5 so
 

00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:57.019
on that field it will tell you that 5 so
you can safely access your adapter it's

00:37:57.019 --> 00:37:57.029
you can safely access your adapter it's
 

00:37:57.029 --> 00:38:00.109
you can safely access your adapter it's
just we did run a layout yet so when the

00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119
just we did run a layout yet so when the
 

00:38:00.119 --> 00:38:02.990
just we did run a layout yet so when the
layout runs items go to their correct

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000
layout runs items go to their correct
 

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.930
layout runs items go to their correct
positions and these are sync again so

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:05.940
positions and these are sync again so
 

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:08.510
positions and these are sync again so
it's right so if you for example in any

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520
it's right so if you for example in any
 

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.940
it's right so if you for example in any
event you try to get the wheel a ball

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:10.950
event you try to get the wheel a ball
 

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:12.500
event you try to get the wheel a ball
the other one then you would like to use

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:12.510
the other one then you would like to use
 

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:14.210
the other one then you would like to use
layout position because that's what the

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:14.220
layout position because that's what the
 

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:16.880
layout position because that's what the
user is see at that moment but if you

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:16.890
user is see at that moment but if you
 

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:18.620
user is see at that moment but if you
want to access the adapter remove or

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:18.630
want to access the adapter remove or
 

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:23.120
want to access the adapter remove or
modify use the adapter position so how

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:23.130
modify use the adapter position so how
 

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:25.519
modify use the adapter position so how
do we think we have seen a lot is what

00:38:25.519 --> 00:38:25.529
do we think we have seen a lot is what
 

00:38:25.529 --> 00:38:28.490
do we think we have seen a lot is what
we call my recycle calls on create that

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:28.500
we call my recycle calls on create that
 

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:31.130
we call my recycle calls on create that
means it needs a new view holder so it's

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:31.140
means it needs a new view holder so it's
 

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:32.839
means it needs a new view holder so it's
a common mistake oh I have a header view

00:38:32.839 --> 00:38:32.849
a common mistake oh I have a header view
 

00:38:32.849 --> 00:38:35.359
a common mistake oh I have a header view
holder if recycle asks for it let me

00:38:35.359 --> 00:38:35.369
holder if recycle asks for it let me
 

00:38:35.369 --> 00:38:38.599
holder if recycle asks for it let me
just cache and return it it told you to

00:38:38.599 --> 00:38:38.609
just cache and return it it told you to
 

00:38:38.609 --> 00:38:41.240
just cache and return it it told you to
create not to return the existing one it

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:41.250
create not to return the existing one it
 

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:45.049
create not to return the existing one it
will use it if it goes right so you

00:38:45.049 --> 00:38:45.059
will use it if it goes right so you
 

00:38:45.059 --> 00:38:47.089
will use it if it goes right so you
cannot do this you need to be creating

00:38:47.089 --> 00:38:47.099
cannot do this you need to be creating
 

00:38:47.099 --> 00:38:50.029
cannot do this you need to be creating
any view holders or get it from some

00:38:50.029 --> 00:38:50.039
any view holders or get it from some
 

00:38:50.039 --> 00:38:51.890
any view holders or get it from some
other pool that recycle if doesn't know

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:51.900
other pool that recycle if doesn't know
 

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:57.319
other pool that recycle if doesn't know
about so example so recycle pulls

00:38:57.319 --> 00:38:57.329
about so example so recycle pulls
 

00:38:57.329 --> 00:38:59.690
about so example so recycle pulls
upgrade we can reuse the views among

00:38:59.690 --> 00:38:59.700
upgrade we can reuse the views among
 

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.400
upgrade we can reuse the views among
different recycle views even in your own

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:01.410
different recycle views even in your own
 

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:04.400
different recycle views even in your own
components so let me create this one

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:04.410
components so let me create this one
 

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:06.980
components so let me create this one
giant pool for all of my application so

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:06.990
giant pool for all of my application so
 

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:08.420
giant pool for all of my application so
I don't create leaves again yeah

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:08.430
I don't create leaves again yeah
 

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:11.180
I don't create leaves again yeah
performance no you cannot do this either

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:11.190
performance no you cannot do this either
 

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:12.980
performance no you cannot do this either
because if you do this

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:12.990
because if you do this
 

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:15.289
because if you do this
first you are going to leak the context

00:39:15.289 --> 00:39:15.299
first you are going to leak the context
 

00:39:15.299 --> 00:39:17.029
first you are going to leak the context
these views are inflated per their

00:39:17.029 --> 00:39:17.039
these views are inflated per their
 

00:39:17.039 --> 00:39:19.519
these views are inflated per their
context they get the styles they inherit

00:39:19.519 --> 00:39:19.529
context they get the styles they inherit
 

00:39:19.529 --> 00:39:20.510
context they get the styles they inherit
a bunch of stuff

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520
a bunch of stuff
 

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.930
a bunch of stuff
so again if you leave the activity the

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:23.940
so again if you leave the activity the
 

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.519
so again if you leave the activity the
we will keep reference to the context

00:39:25.519 --> 00:39:25.529
we will keep reference to the context
 

00:39:25.529 --> 00:39:27.950
we will keep reference to the context
that will to the activity everything

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960
that will to the activity everything
 

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.319
that will to the activity everything
will leak your app will crash the second

00:39:30.319 --> 00:39:30.329
will leak your app will crash the second
 

00:39:30.329 --> 00:39:32.960
will leak your app will crash the second
problem is the ecosystems because the

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:32.970
problem is the ecosystems because the
 

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:34.760
problem is the ecosystems because the
context may change between activities

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:34.770
context may change between activities
 

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:36.950
context may change between activities
they may be loaded with different styles

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960
they may be loaded with different styles
 

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:39.410
they may be loaded with different styles
with different team so you cannot do

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:39.420
with different team so you cannot do
 

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.550
with different team so you cannot do
this you need to create a pool per

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:41.560
this you need to create a pool per
 

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:46.620
this you need to create a pool per
activity contacts okay so okay this is

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:46.630
activity contacts okay so okay this is
 

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.150
activity contacts okay so okay this is
another problem we've been seeing where

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160
another problem we've been seeing where
 

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.120
