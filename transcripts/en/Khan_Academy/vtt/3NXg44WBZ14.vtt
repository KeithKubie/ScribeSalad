00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.810
- [Instructor] So we are
interested in studying

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:05.030
the relationship between
the amount that folks study

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.370
for a test and their score on a test,

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.560
where the score is between zero and six.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.860
And so what we're going to do is go look

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.600
at the people who took the test,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.700
we're going to plot for each person

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.760
the amount that they
studied and their score,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.560
so for example, this data point is someone

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.380
who studied an hour and
they got a one on the test,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.470
and then we're going to
fit a regression line,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.500
and this blue regression line
is the actual regression line

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.240
for these four data points.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.670
And here is the equation
for that regression line.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.400
Now there's a couple of
things to keep in mind.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.670
Normally when you're doing
this type of analysis,

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.820
you would do it with far
more than four data points.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.950
The reason why I kept this to four

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.980
is because we are actually
going to calculate

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.680
how good a fit this
regression line is by hand.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.870
And typically, you
would not do it by hand.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.890
We have computers for that.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.480
Now, the way that we're going to measure

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.270
how good a fit this
regression line is to the data

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.420
has several names.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.420
One name is the standard
deviation of the residuals.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.960
Another name is the root
mean square deviation,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.550
sometimes abbreviated RMSD.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.790
Sometimes it's called
root mean square error.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.400
So what we're going to do
is, is for every point,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.920
we're going to calculate the residual,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.380
and then we're going to square it,

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.330
and then we're gonna add up

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.730
the sum of those squared residuals.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.757
So we're gonna take the
sum of the residuals,

00:01:32.757 --> 00:01:37.757
residuals squared, and then
we're going to divide that

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.060
by the number of data
points we have minus two.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.100
And we can talk in future videos,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.670
or a more advanced statistics class,

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.280
of why you divide by two.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.850
It's related to the idea that
what we're calculating here

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.090
is a statistic, and
we're trying to estimate

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.110
a true parameter as best as possible,

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.110
and n minus two actually
does the trick for us.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.200
But to calculate the root
mean squared deviation,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.960
we would then take a square root of this.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.920
And some of you might
recognize strong parallels

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.460
between this and how we calculated
sample standard deviation

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.140
early in our statistics career,

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.950
and I encourage you to think about it.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.910
But let's actually calculate it by hand,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.730
as I mentioned earlier in this video,

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.260
to see how things actually play out.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.890
So to do that, I'm going to give ourselves

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.780
a little table here, so let's
say that is our x value,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.534
in that column, let's
make this our y value,

00:02:31.534 --> 00:02:35.590
let's make this y-hat
which is going to be equal

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.590
to 2.5x minus two, and
then let's make this

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.730
the residual squared, which is going to be

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.420
our y value minus our y-hat value,

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.740
our actual minus our estimate
for that given x, squared,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.680
and then we're going to sum them all up,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.830
divide by n minus two,
and take the square root.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.890
So first, let's do this data point.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.000
So that's the point, one
comma one, one comma one.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.670
Now what is the estimate
from our regression line?

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.770
Well, for that x value,
when x is equal to one,

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.410
it's gonna be 2.5 times one minus two.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.520
So it's gonna be 2.5 times one minus two,

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.520
which is equal to 0.5, and
so our residual squared

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.610
is going to be one minus
0.5, one minus 0.5, squared,

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.860
which is equal to, that's
gonna be .5 squared,

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.830
which is going to be 0.25.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.740
Alright, let's do the next data point.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.560
We have this one right over here.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.430
It is two comma two.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.810
Now our estimate from the regression line,

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.793
when x equals two, is
going to be equal to 2.5

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.430
times our x value times two, minus two,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.090
which is going to be equal to three.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.030
And so, our residual
squared is going to be

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.030
two minus three, two minus three, squared,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.760
which is negative one squared,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.170
which is going to be equal to one.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.820
Then we can go to this point.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.580
So that's the point two
comma three, two comma three.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.420
Now, our estimate from our regression line

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.380
is going to be 2.5 times
our x value, times two,

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.380
minus two, which is going
to be equal to three,

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.570
and so our residual here
is going to be zero,

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.420
and you can see that that point
sits on the regression line.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.250
So it's going to be three
minus three, three minus three,

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.540
squared, which is equal to zero,

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.750
and then last but not least,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.800
we have this point right over here.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.500
When x is three, our y value,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.410
this person studied three hours,

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.560
and they got a six on the
test, so y is equal to six,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.570
and so our estimate from
the regression line,

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.160
you could say what you
would've expected to get

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.990
based on the regression line,
is 2.5 times our x value,

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.600
times three, minus two, is equal to 5.5.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.540
And so our residual squared
is six minus 5.5 squared,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.253
minus 5.5, squared, so it's
.5 squared, which is 0.25.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.460
So now, the next step, let me take the sum

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.850
of all of these square
residuals, so this is,

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.130
let me just write it this way.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.820
Should we just do it like this?

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.820
So the sum of the residuals,
residuals squared,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.260
is equal to, if I just sum all of this up,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.500
it's going to be point,
it's going to be 1.5.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.500
1.5, and then if I divide
that by n minus two,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.840
so if I divide by n minus two,
that's going to be equal to,

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.930
I have four data points,
so I'm gonna divide

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.730
by four minus two, so
I'm gonna divide by two,

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.930
and then I'm gonna want to
take the square root of that.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.730
Then I'm gonna want to take
the square root of that,

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.660
and so this is going
to get us, 1.5 over two

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.810
is the same thing as 3/4, so
it's the square root of 3/4,

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.030
or the square root of three over two.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.620
And you could use a calculator
to figure what that is,

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.000
to figure out what that is as a decimal,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.260
but this gives us a
sense of how good a fit

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.700
this regression line is.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.520
The closer this is to
zero, the better the fit

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.900
of the regression line.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.490
The further away from zero, the worse fit.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.710
And what would be the units

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.080
for the root mean square deviation?

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.730
Well, it would be in terms
of whatever your units are

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.950
for your y-axis; in this case,

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.910
it would be the score on the test.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.410
And that's one of the other
values of this calculation,

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.200
of taking the square root
of the sum of the squares

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.543
of the residuals dividing by n minus two.
