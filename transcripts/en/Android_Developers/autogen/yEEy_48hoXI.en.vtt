there several reasons we are keeping

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509
there several reasons we are keeping
 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.289
there several reasons we are keeping
this model on Android right and what the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299
this model on Android right and what the
 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.639
this model on Android right and what the
main reason is you know being in the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649
main reason is you know being in the
 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.440
main reason is you know being in the
regime States is an important indicator

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450
regime States is an important indicator
 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.020
regime States is an important indicator
to the system on what resources and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
to the system on what resources and
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.780
to the system on what resources and
activity can acquire because it's kind

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790
activity can acquire because it's kind
 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.760
activity can acquire because it's kind
of as the is you know important score

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770
of as the is you know important score
 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.819
of as the is you know important score
for example right the the camera service

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829
for example right the the camera service
 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.800
for example right the the camera service
discovery singleton resource right and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810
discovery singleton resource right and
 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.289
discovery singleton resource right and
the resumed activity is always going to

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299
the resumed activity is always going to
 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.990
the resumed activity is always going to
get that resource compared to all other

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000
get that resource compared to all other
 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.200
get that resource compared to all other
activities during the fall States

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210
activities during the fall States
 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.459
activities during the fall States
another important thing to notice that

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469
another important thing to notice that
 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.380
another important thing to notice that
we are now also factoring in the low

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390
we are now also factoring in the low
 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.800
we are now also factoring in the low

00:11:43.989 --> 00:11:43.999
navbar status bar customisation for
 

00:11:43.999 --> 00:11:47.410
navbar status bar customisation for
example right and this customization for

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:47.420
example right and this customization for
 

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.210
example right and this customization for
the entire screen would would have

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:49.220
the entire screen would would have
 

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.129
the entire screen would would have

when apps request conflicting

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:53.600
when apps request conflicting
 

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.499
when apps request conflicting
configuration so to that effect right we

00:11:56.499 --> 00:11:56.509
configuration so to that effect right we
 

00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:57.790
configuration so to that effect right we
have most of these configurations

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:57.800
have most of these configurations
 

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.980
have most of these configurations
