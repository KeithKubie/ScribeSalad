00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.959
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: It's my privilege today
to introduce Tony Wagner.

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:13.799
Who I consider to be one of the most innovative
and forward thinking thought leaders in education

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.320
today.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.580
I could read his long list of accomplishments.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.390
His work at Harvard.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.390
His work as a teacher.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.390
And as as principal.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.870
But you could read that all on his website
at Tony Wagner dot com if you'd like to.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.840
And I just wanna basically let you know that
this book that he's written "Creating Innovators:

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.600
The Making of Young People Who Will Change
the World" is really a fabulous read.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.910
We're gonna be selling it outside, right outside
there.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.370
You can buy a copy and have Tony sign it afterward
and he's gonna be kind of giving an overview

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.930
of the work he's seen in this space.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.040
So please welcome Tony Wagner.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.040
[applause]

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.040
&gt;&gt;Tony Wagner: Delighted.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.040
Good morning.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.260
Thank you, thank you.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.490
It's really a pleasure to be here.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.070
A lot more fun than being at Microsoft, where
I was three weeks ago.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.030
I have to tell you.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.030
[laughter]

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.190
But, that's not for attribution.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.079
How many of you here are parents?

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.180
Raise your hands.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.610
How many of you here are educators?

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.399
Raise your hands.

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:09.399
OK.

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.709
I love to begin with a quote from Einstein.

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:18.180
"The formulation of the problem is often more
essential than the solution."

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.119
We talk a lot about problem solving.

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.149
Problem identification is arguably the most
important skill of the 21st century.

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:30.320
For 25 years we've been talking about failing
schools and the need to reform education.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.979
Part of the problem is it's a little bit punitive
language.

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.529
Anybody wanna go to reform school?

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:36.640
Raise your hands.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.750
It's very punitive.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.750
[laughter]

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.740
But beyond that I think that problem is not
the right problem.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.670
If we merely aspire to bring our disadvantaged
students up to the levels of achievement of

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.909
our middle class students, we will fail all
of our students.

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.509
And put our economy in even greater jeopardy.

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.359
So that's what I wanna talk about.

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.559
Fundamentally the problem is this.

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:06.450
Our system of education is obsolete.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.960
And needs reinventing.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.190
Not reforming.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.450
And that is a completely different education
problem.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.450
And guess what?

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.010
Google is mostly to blame for that obsolescence.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.590
I'm about to explain why.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:28.180
Because of Google and other events, what one
knows today no longer matters?

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.629
How much you know is not a competitive advantage.

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:35.190
Information has become commoditized.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.909
It's like air.

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:37.909
It's like water.

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:39.760
It's on every internet connected device, growing
exponentially.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.500
How many of you had to memorize the periodic
table in high school?

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.500
Raise your hands.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.500
How many elements were there?

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.500
[quiet audience response]

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.790
I'm sorry, I didn't hear that answer.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.340
[audience members call out answers loudly]
[laughter]

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.700
Whatever answer you gave was wrong, because
two more were added last week.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.609
If you don't believe me Google it.

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:53.609
[laughter]

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.180
Ah, how many of you had to memorize the state
capitals?

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.180
Raise your hands.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.180
OK.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.180
Let's have a competition.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.090
How many of you would like to recite them
from memory while I Google them and let's

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.599
see who's quicker?

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.599
[laughter]

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:11.641
Memory is not something we need to think about
educating as we have in the past.

00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:13.440
The world no longer cares how much you know.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.459
What the world cares about is what you can
do with what you know.

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.349
And that is a completely different education
problem.

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.599
It's not about filling people up with more
knowledge.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.670
It's about skill and it's about will.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.220
So I'm gonna be talking about skill and will
in the context of education.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.030
Back in 2005, I read "The World Is Flat" by
Thomas Friedman.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.439
How many of you have read that?

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:40.370
Those of you who haven't I encourage you to.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.939
Most important book I've read in at least
a decade.

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:44.749
Scared the heck out of me.

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:50.340
Because as many of you know, Friedman describes
a world where increasingly any knowledge,

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:58.939
I'm sorry, any work that can be routinized
is very rapidly be off shored or automated.

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:00.080
And I talked with him recently.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.970
He said he got one thing wrong in that book.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:02.970
I said "What?"

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.760
He said, "The pace of change."

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.040
It's happening far, far more quickly than
he ever imagined.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.859
So I think the question becomes in a global
knowledge economy, what skills will our young

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:17.859
people need?

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.130
Will your children need?

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.670
To succeed.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.340
So that was a burning question for me back
then.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.810
And I decided to interview a very wide range
of leaders.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.750
Corporate leaders from Apple to Unilever.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.050
Leaders in the military.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.470
Community leaders.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.470
College teachers.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.210
Asking all of them "What are the skills that
matter most?

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.580
What are the gaps?"

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.900
And I came to understand there's a set of
core competencies every single student must

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.020
be well on the way to mastering before he
or she finishes high school.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.180
Some of you may have read my book "The Global
Achievement Gap" that describes this.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.840
Came out about four years ago.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.710
Very briefly they are: Number one, critical
thinking and problem solving.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.979
And fascinatingly, executives describe critical
thinking first and foremost as the ability

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.150
to ask really good questions.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.690
Try an interesting exercise.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.690
Do a learning walk.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:06.690
Observe classrooms.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.690
And listen for who is asking what kinds of
questions.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.930
Collaboration across networks and leading
by influence was number two.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.940
Agility and adaptability was number three.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.729
Initiative and entrepreneurialism was number
four.

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.190
Number five was, effective oral and written
communication.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.460
And it is by the way the number one complaint
of both college teachers and employers.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.410
Number six was accessing and analyzing information.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.320
Number seven was curiosity and imagination.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.419
So that book came out about three and a half
years ago.

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.300
And it describes the new skills.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.780
And the global achievement gap is the gap
between the new skills all students will need.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:55.900
Not just for a good career, but for continuous
learning and active and informed citizenship.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:01.889
Those skills versus what is taught and tested
even in our very best schools.

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:03.819
That's the global achievement gap.

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:09.270
That gap between the new skills all students
need as well as how they are motivated to

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.539
learn.

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:12.750
Versus what we're teaching and testing.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.750
So that's skill.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.460
So two things happened when that book came
out three and a half years ago.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.320
Number one, I got a kind of affirmation frankly
that stunned me.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.190
From literally from Taiwan to Singapore to
Helsinki to Bahrain to Thailand to Birmingham,

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.190
England.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.120
Around the world, people saying "Yep, these
are exactly the right skills, would you come

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.360
and talk to our audiences about them?"

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.840
From Wall Street to West Point, same message
exactly.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.030
But then the other thing happened.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.069
The global financial collapse.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:50.000
I saw students with a BA degree and about
30,000 dollars of debt on average coming home

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.669
to no job.

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.169
Now they had seemingly mastered many of these
skills.

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:57.030
But what was missing?

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.500
Why weren't they able to find jobs?

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.860
Or create jobs?

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:09.650
Right now today, the un- and under-employment
rate among college graduates 2005 and more

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.920
recent is 44 percent.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.129
[pause]

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:15.870
About 22 percent are completely unemployed.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:22.669
The other 22 percent have jobs that do not
require a college education.

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:23.669
What's the problem?

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:29.639
Well, as I came to try to understand it and
come to grips with the global economic collapse.

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:31.849
And mind you, I'm a recovering high school
English teacher.

00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:35.650
So what I knew about economics four years
ago you could put in a thimble.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.639
But I really studied it and I came to understand
a couple of things.

00:07:38.639 --> 00:07:44.360
Number one, our economy has become a more
and more and more dependent upon consumer

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.740
spending as the engine of our economy.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:53.260
Back at the end of World War II, nearly 50
percent of all jobs were manufacturing related.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:58.099
Now we don't make so much as we do buy stuff
other people have made.

00:07:58.099 --> 00:07:59.319
That's point one.

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:05.250
Point two, that consumer economy has been
fueled by debt.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.389
People putting money on their credit cards
as fast as they can.

00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:10.280
Pulling the money out of their houses as fast
as they could.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:16.090
The savings rate in 2007 was minus two percent.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:20.740
Leading me to conclude that perhaps we've
created an economy based on people frequently

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:26.509
spending money they do not have, to buy things
they may not need, threatening the planet

00:08:26.509 --> 00:08:29.160
in the process.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:36.640
Now, the question becomes, how do we become
less reliant on consumer spending?

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.950
Which is not sustainable economically, environmentally,
or spiritually in my opinion.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.700
How do we become less reliant on that?

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.840
What's gonna replace it?

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.480
What's gonna be the engine of growth?

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.280
What's gonna create jobs in the future?

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.970
So I read, over and over again, one word kept
coming up.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.780
Innovation.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.130
Now let me be clear, we're not just talking
about breakthroughs in science technology,

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.100
engineering and math.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.350
Innovation as I'm using it is broadly defined.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:09.790
Becoming a country that produces young people
who have more better ideas to solve more different

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:13.880
kinds of problems than what we have today.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.010
Young people who are creative problem solvers.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.430
That's the simplest definition of innovation.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.460
Someone who is a creative problem solver.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:24.830
First of all, a problem identifier, and then
a creative problem solver.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.750
Now, we've always been known as a country
that's been highly innovative.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:32.150
But is that because of or in spite of our
education system?

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:33.510
[audience chuckles]

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.150
[unintelligible] percent question for the
day.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.150
Are you ready for this?

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.640
I'm gonna say it so fast you won't have time
to Google it.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.290
What do Bill Gates, Edwin Land the inventor
of the Polaroid instant camera, Bonnie Raitt

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:45.960
the folk singer, and Mark Zuckerberg all four
have in common?

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.760
They were not college drop outs, I'm sorry.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.580
They were Harvard college dropouts.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.580
[laugher]

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.580
That's different.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.140
I mean, you know, Steve Jobs, he was just
a college dropout.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.380
Michael Dell, he was just a college dropout.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.310
These guys were Harvard college dropouts.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:05.630
So I decided to take on a very different kind
of research.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.590
I wanted to try to understand, what must we
do differently as parents?

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.650
As teachers?

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:11.720
As mentors?

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.320
And as employers?

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:19.250
To develop the capacities of many, many, many,
more young people to be creative problem solvers.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.250
To be innovators.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.250
In whatever they do.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:23.050
Not just STEM fields.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:24.540
Social innovators and entrepreneurs.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.510
Innovators in all domains.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.290
So I first interviewed a very wide variety
of young people in their twenties.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:32.580
Who were highly innovative.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.640
But again in a broad range of fields.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.820
Some were artists, musicians, social entrepreneurs.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:39.440
Some were in STEM fields.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.290
And then I studied their ecosystems.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:46.120
By that I mean I went and interviewed each
one of their parents.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.390
Trying to see if I could discern patterns
of parenting that had made a difference.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:54.290
I asked each one of them, "Was there a teacher
or a mentor?" who had made a significant difference

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.690
in their lives?

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.820
In their development as innovators.

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.450
30 percent could not name a single teacher.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.980
Almost all of those young people were from
disadvantaged backgrounds.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:11.070
Where their schools and teachers were not
what one finds here.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.180
The other 70 percent could name a teacher.

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.790
And you know the span of teachers was elementary
to graduate school.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:21.130
Then I went and interviewed each of those
teachers and mentors.

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:24.080
From these young innovators.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.080
Profiled.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:30.350
Talked to them and came to understand something
that I still to this day find shocking.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:35.980
In every single case, these teachers from
elementary to graduate school, were themselves

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.250
outliers in their educational settings.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.360
Their institutions.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.940
Teaching in ways that were very different
than their peers.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.770
But remarkably similar to one another.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:52.570
And further, when I went to those few schools
that we have identified as doing an outstanding

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:56.610
job of educating people to be innovators,
talking about High Tech High.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:59.250
I'm talking about Olin College of Engineering.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:01.430
I'm talking about The D School here at Stanford.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.720
I'm talking about the MIT Media Lab.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:09.830
When I visited those places, the kinds of
teaching I saw there was totally consistent

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:11.250
across those schools.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:16.690
And completely congruent with the ways in
which these young, these outlier teachers

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:18.900
whom I had interviewed were teaching.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:24.770
And so I came to understand that the culture
of learning that produces innovators.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.510
The work culture which we've been talking
about.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.870
It develops the capacity to innovate.

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.530
In a classroom or in a corporation indeed.

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:37.130
Is radically at odds with the culture of schooling
in most classrooms.

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.920
In five essential respects.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.210
Number one.

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.700
Culture of innovation is all about collaboration.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.700
Teamwork.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.700
Accountable teamwork.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.360
All of these teachers built accountable teamwork
into almost all of their assignments.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.870
Valued teamwork as much as individual achievement.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.940
Number two, the culture of learning to become
an innovator is all about problem based learning

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.820
using multiple disciplines.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:00.880
It's right here.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.000
Judy Gilbert director of talent here at Google
said to me: "If there's one thing academics

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.760
must understand is that problems can neither
be identified, let alone solved, within the

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.470
bright lines of individual academic disciplines."

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:18.630
The culture of schooling is all about becoming
a specialist.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:19.630
That's what we incent.

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.080
That's what we reward.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.580
First we divide and conquer the high school
universe.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:24.580
With curriculum.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.580
Carnegie units.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.770
Which have not changed in 125 years.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:31.480
Then when we go to college we're supposed
to have a major.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.060
Oh and we want to teach in college.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.720
We wanna have a, uh, doctorate.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:43.220
When I did my doctorate at Harvard, I was
told my first year that my dissertation would

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:49.540
be a conversation between myself and one or
two other people in the world.

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.540
Conversation with two people.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:51.540
For four years?

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:52.540
I don't think so.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.540
[audience chuckles]

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.110
I chose a different path.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:59.720
Got through Harvard but by other means.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.260
Number three.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:07.790
The world of innovation, learning to become
an innovator is learning how to make mistakes,

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:10.460
reflect on them, and learn from them.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.460
Iterate.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.440
I was down here at IDO, talked to folks there.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.200
They said "Our motto is 'Fail early and fail
often.'

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.270
There is no innovation without trial and error."

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:27.370
A student at Olin said "You know, we don't
even talk about failure here.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.290
We talk about iteration."

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:31.290
Very different world.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.670
The D School at Stanford they're sitting around
the table talking.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.370
"Actually, you know we were thinking, F is
the new A."

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:38.370
[laughter]

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.900
Try that out on your parents.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.110
[laughter]

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:45.530
Number four.

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:49.850
The culture of learning to become an innovator
is an active process.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:52.180
Where students are creators.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:56.200
Where students are producing real products
for real audiences.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:58.120
Solving real problems.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.350
So often the culture of schooling is the absolute
antithesis.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.270
It's about consuming, not creating.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:04.640
Sit and "git".

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:08.930
In fact, I wonder if that's where we learn
to be such good little consumers.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:14.760
We start out, that's how we get schooled 12,
16 years.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.731
Number five and most important, I think.

00:15:17.731 --> 00:15:21.370
I discovered that every single one of these
young innovators whom I profiled from both

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:27.580
advantaged and disadvantaged backgrounds was
intrinsically motivated.

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:33.790
And then when I looked at what their parents
and their teachers had done they too were

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.190
very focused on intrinsic motivation.

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:41.990
Radically at odds with the culture of schooling
which is all about carrots and sticks.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:46.510
As and Fs and pizza on Fridays if you get
good test scores.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.060
So what do these parents do?

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.270
What do these teachers do?

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:56.600
There was a pattern of play, to passion, to
purpose.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.800
Parents encouraging much more exploratory,
discovery based play.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.850
Simple toys.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:05.149
Sand, blocks, clay, water, paint.

00:16:05.149 --> 00:16:07.150
Lego toys as they got older.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.490
Toys without batteries.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.110
They limited screen time.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:15.360
They actively encouraged their kids to find
and pursue a passion.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.200
They gave them a rich buffet of things to
try out.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.100
Making sure though, that they didn't over
schedule their kid's times.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.090
So the kids still had time for more discovery
based play.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:30.510
But they encouraged them to try instruments
or Scouts or sports or whatever.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:34.980
Not insisting that they put in 10,000 hours
to become absolutely excellent at it.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:38.590
But that they really give it a try and see
if it's something they were interested in.

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:43.200
These parents as well as the teachers believed
it was more important that these kids find

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:48.490
an pursue a passion than they simply achieve
academically for its own sake.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:53.540
Teachers building time into every single unit
of study where students could investigate,

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:57.260
explore, create, invent, ask a question.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:17:01.070
And you know, the 20 percent time here at
Google comes immediately to mind, 'cause I

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:06.720
think the best teachers build 20 percent time
into each one of their classes.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:11.379
To insure that students have that time to
explore, invent, and create.

00:17:11.379 --> 00:17:17.620
I wonder, what would happen if we said "Why
shouldn't every teacher have 20 percent time?"

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.759
[audience response "Mmmm."

00:17:18.759 --> 00:17:19.759
]

00:17:19.759 --> 00:17:25.059
To pursue his or passions in the context of
teaching and learning.

00:17:25.059 --> 00:17:30.139
As these young people continue to explore
ideas and interests and their passions.

00:17:30.139 --> 00:17:32.059
Their passions didn't stay the same.

00:17:32.059 --> 00:17:33.059
They morphed.

00:17:33.059 --> 00:17:34.059
They evolved.

00:17:34.059 --> 00:17:37.259
Tell a quick story.

00:17:37.259 --> 00:17:40.940
Kirk Phelps grew up here in the Silicon Valley.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.450
Father worked at HP at the time.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:44.590
Passionate about science.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.009
Really totally passionate about science.

00:17:47.009 --> 00:17:51.850
By the age of middle school he's sort of working
in labs in the summer, washing out beakers.

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:52.850
Doesn't matter what he's doing.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.360
He's around science and scientists.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.350
Parents say "Oh, wow, let's go find the best
science school for him 'cause that's what

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.990
he's interested in now."

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.039
Knowing that it may change.

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:03.039
Got him into Exeter Academy.

00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:06.759
Because it was reputed to have the best of
the best science programs.

00:18:06.759 --> 00:18:11.970
By the end of the 11th grade Kirk has done
pretty much every science class there, and

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:12.970
he's kinda bored.

00:18:12.970 --> 00:18:16.679
The Harkness table, the famed idea of sitting
around and having a Socratic discussion.

00:18:16.679 --> 00:18:19.150
Well, it isn't quite like that.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:22.090
And Kirk says "I wanna leave.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:24.790
I wanna drop out."

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:28.669
What would you say as a parent to a kid who's
about to drop out of the most prestigious

00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:30.220
private school in the country.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.280
With no diploma.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.790
Well, I can tell you what Exeter said.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:36.260
They said "Oh, well you'll never get into
college."

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.260
Well, he did.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.909
He got into Stanford.

00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:40.870
For a combined BS/MS program.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.960
And he evolves.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:43.960
You know, at first he thinks he wants to be
a scientist.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.250
Then he thinks it's too lonely.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.639
He's drawn to computer science.

00:18:46.639 --> 00:18:52.629
But then the idea of writing code all day
that nobody would see didn't quite grab him

00:18:52.629 --> 00:18:53.629
either.

00:18:53.629 --> 00:18:55.480
So then he takes this extraordinary class.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.789
Taught by Ed Carryer right down the road here.

00:18:58.789 --> 00:19:02.530
In a smart product design lab.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:06.720
It's a combination of electrical engineering,
mechanical engineering, computer science.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.600
Where teams build things.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.600
Using those disciplines.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.029
They solve problems.

00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:13.509
They build things.

00:19:13.509 --> 00:19:15.509
Ed Carryer by the way is one of my outliers.

00:19:15.509 --> 00:19:16.970
He's taught at Stanford 20 years.

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.610
Has a PhD from Stanford.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:20.120
Ten years of industry experience.

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.580
He is a professor of practice with an annual
renewal contract.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:29.419
And he has to scrounge money every single
year for his smart product design lab.

00:19:29.419 --> 00:19:33.500
Kirk said he was hands down the very best
teacher he had ever had.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.529
Why does he not have tenure?

00:19:35.529 --> 00:19:41.270
For the same reason the faculty whom I interviewed
at Stanford, MIT, Harvard, Carnegie Mellon,

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:45.250
Tulane don't have tenure and will never get
tenure.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.279
Because they don't do research.

00:19:47.279 --> 00:19:49.299
Their focus is teaching.

00:19:49.299 --> 00:19:51.880
And teaching young people to be innovators.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.790
But that's not privileged by the university.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.049
So to finish the Kirk Phelps story.

00:19:57.049 --> 00:19:58.870
His passions have morphed.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:59.919
They've evolved.

00:19:59.919 --> 00:20:03.549
He now knows that he loves the combination
of electrical, mechanical scientific engineering.

00:20:03.549 --> 00:20:06.200
But what he really loves is to manage complex
projects.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.379
He become a teaching fellow for Ed Carryer.

00:20:09.379 --> 00:20:11.210
Totally excited about this.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.809
So what happens next?

00:20:12.809 --> 00:20:18.870
Two courses shy of both degrees, which were
concurrent degrees, he drops out.

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.790
Again.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.334
Now what do you say as a parent?

00:20:24.334 --> 00:20:25.334
[audience chuckles and mutters]

00:20:25.334 --> 00:20:28.509
Well, you might not worry too much when you
hear that, in fact, he was recruited by Apple

00:20:28.509 --> 00:20:31.990
to be the product manager for the very first
iPhone.

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:36.960
And today he is working at a startup called
Sun Run, which is developing a whole new model

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:42.419
for installing solar panels on residences.

00:20:42.419 --> 00:20:47.580
But I illustrate this story because it's a
wonderful story of play to passion to purpose.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:52.740
And purpose for young adults become an expression
of passion.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:56.080
But one that goes deeper, 'cause it's about
making a difference.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.100
It's about having an impact.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:03.440
And at the same time, it is a form of adult
play.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.980
So I'm gonna stop at this point, 'cause I
really wanna hear your questions, your comments,

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:07.980
your concerns.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:13.370
And we'll sort of take the conversation based
on where you want it to go.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:14.370
OK?

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.370
Questions.

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.370
Comments.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:17.370
Actually, you know what I'm gonna do?

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:18.370
I'm gonna break it up.

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:20.700
I'm gonna invite you for exactly two minutes
to turn to your neighbor and talk about the

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.090
conversation we just had so far.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:24.100
What struck you, what you didn't like.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.100
Did like.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.100
Agreed with.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.100
Disagreed with.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.220
Take two minutes, talk to each other.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.809
And generate some powerful questions.

00:21:30.809 --> 00:21:35.399
[audience chattering and laughing]

00:21:35.399 --> 00:21:39.330
OK, two minutes are up.

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.730
We have two people with microphones.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:44.010
Invite you to raise your hand.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.820
And the mic might mysteriously come to you.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.000
And first question is right here.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.120
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Hi Tony.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.120
Thanks for coming.

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.909
My name is Tara Canobbio and I work here at
Google in k12 education outreach.

00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:57.620
So much of what you said of course resonates
for who we are and we're actually quite proud

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.730
to say that our team works in this space a
lot.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:03.360
But the majority of the work we do is in kinda
after school programs.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.769
Experimental things we do with partners in
here.

00:22:05.769 --> 00:22:10.200
And I would ask of you, what are some effective
methods to be able to get in the traditional

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.880
schooling system with these ideas that you
talked about?

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.360
For example we're inviting administrators
to come here and observe some programs that

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.340
adhere to the concepts and the principles
that you talked about.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:23.340
But its' difficult for us to say, we're Google
we have these ideas, it's great, now you go

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.980
back in your classrooms and your school districts
and you change.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:27.980
How do we bridge that gap?

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:32.879
&gt;&gt;Tony Wagner: I think it's an incredibly
difficult challenge right now especially.

00:22:32.879 --> 00:22:40.840
Because as you all know increasingly we have
one curriculum in our schools.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.010
And it's test prep.

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:45.110
Public schools, independent schools, it doesn't
matter, it's test prep.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:47.789
If it's independent schools it's the advance
placement curriculum.

00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:50.289
I'm speaking now especially at the high school
level.

00:22:50.289 --> 00:22:53.610
So if you can't offer something that's gonna
improve test scores, chances are you're not

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.649
going to get the attention.

00:22:55.649 --> 00:23:00.180
So here's what I would recommend as a strategy
to consider.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.720
It's a language that I think we need to introduce
into education.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.690
You know Cisco's RND budget is 13 percent.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:08.649
Microsoft's is 17 percent.

00:23:08.649 --> 00:23:12.340
With your 20 percent rule you've got a 20
percent plus RND budget.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:17.990
Ask the principal, ask that superintendent,
"What's your RND budget?"

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:20.630
They don't have one.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:21.950
Doesn't exist.

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:24.679
So I think the argument is to go to leaders.

00:23:24.679 --> 00:23:26.470
Superintendents and school board members.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:28.139
And say "You want change.

00:23:28.139 --> 00:23:29.610
You want improvement.

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:31.940
You must invest in RND.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:35.190
There is no change or improvement without
RND."

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:41.340
So a simple idea would be to create a little
simple request for proposals from teams of

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:45.950
teachers to develop an interdisciplinary hands
on curriculum.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:50.559
More ambitiously, I'd like to see every large
school district or consortia of smaller school

00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:53.379
districts start a lab school.

00:23:53.379 --> 00:23:58.340
A charter-like school that would have some
of the same autonomies as a charter school

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.880
but district and/or state sponsored.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:06.110
Where there are intentionally developing the
new methodologies for teaching, learning,

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.580
and assessment in the 21st century.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.539
I think those are a couple of the steps we
need to take.

00:24:10.539 --> 00:24:16.570
But the whole idea is it's, I think is to
generate the understanding that we must have

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:20.240
RND in education in order to develop new and
better models.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.240
Other questions?

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.240
Yep?

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.950
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Hi, this is sort of a follow-up
to the previous question.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:27.860
&gt;&gt;Tony Wagner: Little closer please.

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:28.860
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Oh.

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:29.860
OK.

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:33.691
As government is a really big actor in this
space, I'm curious what you would do if you

00:24:33.691 --> 00:24:36.230
were Arne Duncan and are there any low-hanging
fruit?

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:41.280
&gt;&gt;Tony Wagner: I think the first and most
important problem we have is to understand

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.879
that what gets tested is what gets taught.

00:24:43.879 --> 00:24:44.879
Period.

00:24:44.879 --> 00:24:45.879
The end.

00:24:45.879 --> 00:24:46.879
In this country.

00:24:46.879 --> 00:24:51.700
And the business folks will tell you having
the wrong metric is worse than having none

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.200
at all.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:25:00.730
Our test results especially at the secondary
level tell us absolutely nothing about college,

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:04.059
career, or citizenship readiness.

00:25:04.059 --> 00:25:05.970
There are much better tests out there.

00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:09.090
There are assessments of critical thinking,
analytical reasoning, problem solving, and

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:10.090
writing.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:12.710
I have a chapter on it in The Global Achievement
Gap.

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:19.749
But basically we're going to have to, I think,
create accountability two dot oh at a national

00:25:19.749 --> 00:25:20.749
level.

00:25:20.749 --> 00:25:22.480
And incent the creation of very different
tests.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:25.340
Now there is a new generation of tests coming
down the pike.

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:30.230
But I worry that they are still too content
driven and still too much multiple choice.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:32.669
There's an international assessment called
PISA.

00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:35.200
Program for International Student Assessment.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:41.610
Three quarters of the PISA test is open ended
constructed response questions.

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:44.909
Only 25 percent multiple choice.

00:25:44.909 --> 00:25:50.860
And it really is a test of your ability to
apply what you've learned not merely regurgitate

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.130
what you've learned.

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:55.279
Those point in the direction of the kinds
of assessments we need.

00:25:55.279 --> 00:25:58.659
The only way we're gonna be able to afford
them is to stop this crazy notion of testing

00:25:58.659 --> 00:26:02.619
every single kid, every single year, grades
three through eight and then grades ten.

00:26:02.619 --> 00:26:08.899
We can accomplish the same level of accountability
by testing a demographically representative

00:26:08.899 --> 00:26:13.529
percentage of kids every second year or even
every third year and let districts develop

00:26:13.529 --> 00:26:16.509
local assessments that are aligned with these
better assessments.

00:26:16.509 --> 00:26:20.669
So for the same money we can get dramatically
better results.

00:26:20.669 --> 00:26:26.500
and we need an informed constituency of concerned
citizens and parents to advocate for accountability

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.519
two dot oh.

00:26:27.519 --> 00:26:29.639
Along with educators and business leader.

00:26:29.639 --> 00:26:33.740
Unless and until we have that advocacy, test
the skills that matter most.

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.610
That's the bump, bumper sticker.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:36.610
Right?

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:42.320
Unless and until we have that advocacy, Arne
Duncan and his successors are not gonna change

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.320
at all.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:46.649
'Cause they've invested too much time and
energy into accountability one dot oh, which

00:26:46.649 --> 00:26:48.019
is failing us totally.

00:26:48.019 --> 00:26:51.190
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Hi, are you familiar?

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:52.190
Right here.

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:53.190
&gt;&gt;Tony Wagner: Ah.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:55.210
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Are you familiar with the Waldorf
system.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.149
And if yes, what do you think about it?

00:26:57.149 --> 00:26:58.529
&gt;&gt;Tony Wagner: I don't know it well.

00:26:58.529 --> 00:27:01.380
But what I've read sounds absolutely intriguing.

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:07.429
The whole idea is a school that is really
an attempt to create a curriculum around what

00:27:07.429 --> 00:27:10.470
we know about childhood and adolescent development.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:12.070
I think it's' very intriguing.

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:15.519
Uh, what I know better is Montessori.

00:27:15.519 --> 00:27:19.039
And it's fascinating when I did research for
this new book I discovered things you may

00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:20.320
already know.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:26.860
But a huge number of the most successful innovators
and entrepreneurs in this area went to Montessori

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:27.860
schools.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.739
Including the co-founders of Google.

00:27:29.739 --> 00:27:31.080
Yes.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.980
We got a guy here who doesn't have a mic.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.260
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: [inaudible]

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.540
&gt;&gt;Tony Wagner: Alright.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:37.540
Where's the mic?

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:38.540
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: [inaudible]

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:39.540
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Hi.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:43.789
So I have one thing that frustrates me is
people's lack of ability to take risk, 'cause

00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:45.869
I think especially in older age.

00:27:45.869 --> 00:27:49.870
Because I think most young people do have
the idea and the ability.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:53.249
But they're held back by the money and the
prestige and the security.

00:27:53.249 --> 00:27:54.249
&gt;&gt;Tony Wagner: Right.

00:27:54.249 --> 00:27:59.730
&gt;&gt;Male #2: And I think to me, a lot of that
is due to the lack of choices for students.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:01.690
Especially in their younger age.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:07.509
And also I think societal, like, societal
pressure to sort of follow one straight path.

00:28:07.509 --> 00:28:14.850
Do you kind of come across anything, any innovative
approaches that can kind of bypass that and

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:17.529
just, give students more freedom?

00:28:17.529 --> 00:28:23.340
Or just kind of preventing people from getting
a degree in philosophy and then go into banking

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.340
and consulting afterwards?

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:25.340
&gt;&gt;Tony Wagner: Right.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:32.629
You know, it's, again it comes back to parents
and teachers and what messages they give kids.

00:28:32.629 --> 00:28:33.629
Right?

00:28:33.629 --> 00:28:37.610
So if you give the message "Look, pursue your
passions.

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:39.139
No matter where they lead you."

00:28:39.139 --> 00:28:40.730
I'll give another example.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:41.730
Another student.

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:43.429
Young innovator whom I profiled.

00:28:43.429 --> 00:28:45.559
Passionate about art from the age of seven.

00:28:45.559 --> 00:28:48.759
It's all she wanted to do was art.

00:28:48.759 --> 00:28:51.499
Now her parents were in the medical field.

00:28:51.499 --> 00:28:52.499
What do they know?

00:28:52.499 --> 00:28:53.950
They couldn't draw stick figures.

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:58.409
Let aloneóso what do you say to a child who
wants to do art?

00:28:58.409 --> 00:28:59.409
Right?

00:28:59.409 --> 00:29:01.289
That's all she cares about.

00:29:01.289 --> 00:29:05.909
Well, what they thought is "Oh, God she'll
never get a job."

00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:07.860
But they never said that.

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:13.460
What they did instead was turn a spare bedroom
into an artist's studio for her.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.559
So I won't tell you the whole long story,
but the version is, she graduates from high

00:29:16.559 --> 00:29:20.720
school with a wonderful portfolio of her artwork.

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.720
Doesn't get into the school of her choice.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:29.230
Goes to Carnegie Mellon, takes Randy Pausch's
course on entertainment design.

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:31.240
Catches on fire.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:36.370
Long story short she starts her own startup
called Wild Pockets.

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:40.730
Designing a web interface for 3D design.

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:43.480
Struggles through the worst recession in our
recent history.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:48.830
But manages for five years to keep she and
her 12 employees afloat until Auto Desk comes

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:49.830
along.

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:56.440
Buys her company and employs all of her colleagues
in their new wing.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.860
Their new business.

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:02.190
So here's now a kid who from the age of seven
only wanted to be an artist.

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:04.230
Whose parents totally supported that.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:09.570
She's now, at the age of 29, a senior executive
and very successful at Auto Desk.

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:13.110
And I think that would not have happened if
her parents had said "Well you know, really

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:14.549
you're not gonna make a living at art.

00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:16.049
You should just quit that."

00:30:16.049 --> 00:30:21.700
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Hi, I'm a ninth grade algebra teacher
in the area.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:25.149
And I wanna ask a question about the fifth
factor that you mentioned earlier.

00:30:25.149 --> 00:30:26.450
The intrinsic motivation.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:28.520
Which you said might be the most important
one.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:31.590
With the end of the school year coming up
I'm struggling to get my ninth gradersó

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:32.590
Excuse me.

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:36.400
To show a level of mastery to be able to be
tenth graders.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.649
They're not motivated by extrinsic factors
like grades.

00:30:39.649 --> 00:30:40.899
But I also don't see the intrinsic motivation.

00:30:40.899 --> 00:30:45.679
So I'm wondering from your experience as an
English teacher do you have any words of wisdom?

00:30:45.679 --> 00:30:47.970
How to develop that intrinsic motivation in
our kids.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:49.450
&gt;&gt;Tony Wagner: I do in English.

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:51.090
I'm not so sure about math. [chuckles]

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:52.090
[quiet laughter from audience]

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:57.330
I think that the dilemma in math is, how do
you make it real for kids when they take algebra?

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:04.489
How do you make something as abstract, something
that they understand they can and want to

00:31:04.489 --> 00:31:07.119
use every single day?

00:31:07.119 --> 00:31:11.070
I think that's the challenge in any kind of
advanced math.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:17.749
Beyond that, I think what kids really could
be engaged with in math, and need are statistics,

00:31:17.749 --> 00:31:21.019
probability, computation, and financial literacy.

00:31:21.019 --> 00:31:24.929
But we don't require any of those things in
school.

00:31:24.929 --> 00:31:25.929
Why?

00:31:25.929 --> 00:31:29.909
So maybe an end of the year unit where you're
thinking about a very applied way of using

00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:31.039
algebra.

00:31:31.039 --> 00:31:33.470
As it relates to something that is immediate
to them.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:34.570
I think that's the challenge.

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:36.049
How do you make it less abstract?

00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:39.379
More like a tool they want and need to use?

00:31:39.379 --> 00:31:45.249
I mean, what I did in terms of English, was
[clears throat].

00:31:45.249 --> 00:31:47.990
First of all, every student had a portfolio.

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:51.169
And this was back before digital portfolios.

00:31:51.169 --> 00:31:55.049
And every week I'd assign a particular genre
of writing or type of writing.

00:31:55.049 --> 00:31:56.489
Like childhood memoir.

00:31:56.489 --> 00:31:57.489
Description.

00:31:57.489 --> 00:31:58.489
Dialog.

00:31:58.489 --> 00:32:01.929
And every student brought one piece of writing
in every single week to read aloud.

00:32:01.929 --> 00:32:03.350
They didn't care what I thought.

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:07.039
But they cared a lot about their peer views.

00:32:07.039 --> 00:32:10.659
And they learned an enormous amount from everybody
trying to tackle the same problem.

00:32:10.659 --> 00:32:15.340
There's 17 and 25 ways of doing a childhood
reminiscence.

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.779
And then for me the grading became simpler.

00:32:17.779 --> 00:32:21.590
Because I graded students on a body of work.

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:26.639
And I said "Here's my standard for a B." which
is what I consider to be your standard of

00:32:26.639 --> 00:32:27.639
proficiency.

00:32:27.639 --> 00:32:30.739
And here is exemplars of B quality work.

00:32:30.739 --> 00:32:34.330
And now let's talk about what an A is and
what that should mean.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:41.139
But what I basically said is, I held the standard
constant and varied the time and support students

00:32:41.139 --> 00:32:43.610
needed to meet that standard.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:48.860
So the B was, a B, I mean students work was
considered incomplete until they met that

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:49.869
standard.

00:32:49.869 --> 00:32:50.999
And I don't care how long it took them.

00:32:50.999 --> 00:32:53.239
One student took an entire extra year.

00:32:53.239 --> 00:32:55.789
Not to say that he repeated the course.

00:32:55.789 --> 00:33:01.859
But continued to work until he met that standard
and finally got the credit he wanted.

00:33:01.859 --> 00:33:02.859
Yes?

00:33:02.859 --> 00:33:04.840
&gt;&gt;Male #4: So.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:05.840
Um.

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:06.840
Oh.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:11.970
Hi. [laughs] So I very much enjoyed your description
of your methodology.

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:16.759
Speaking with young innovators and looking
at that from a scientific perspective I couldn't

00:33:16.759 --> 00:33:22.100
help but wonder ifóI mean I understand you
can't do a randomized study and assign people

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:24.640
to different educational systems.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:30.249
But did you talk to people who were not innovators
and tried to find of those patterns were present

00:33:30.249 --> 00:33:31.980
or if they were not present?

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:34.270
And sort of look at the other side of the
equation?

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:39.429
&gt;&gt;Tony Wagner: Well, sadly, people who are
not innovators are pretty easy to find.

00:33:39.429 --> 00:33:40.429
[laughter]

00:33:40.429 --> 00:33:45.639
And you know what one finds is kind of something
of the polar opposite of what I've just been

00:33:45.639 --> 00:33:46.639
describing.

00:33:46.639 --> 00:33:50.080
Those kids frequently have "Tiger Moms" or
"Helicopter Parents."

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.230
Tiger moms driving them to do something that
they're not interested in.

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:56.330
Or helicopter parents who say "Look, you can't
make a mistake.

00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:58.799
We're building the resume for Harvard now.

00:33:58.799 --> 00:34:01.080
You can't take a risk."

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.980
So they, I didn't do it in a scientific sense.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.360
But having spent many years of teaching.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:09.970
I've spent 12 years in the classroom as a
high school English teacher.

00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:15.200
I've seen the alternative patterns and they're
all too common sadly.

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.580
I did something else though that may relate
to your question.

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:24.429
I talked to Joel Podolny who's vice president
of Human Resources at Apple and head of Apple

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:25.669
University.

00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:28.810
Now Joel's previous job, he was Dean of the
Yale School of Management.

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:31.760
And he's taught in both Stanford and Harvard's
business schools.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:33.530
And he has a PhD from Stanford.

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:40.290
I wanted to find out what he saw as the best
preparation for business schools for young

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:42.580
people to be innovators.

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:45.830
And he said "Look, you have to understand.

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:49.700
To get into Harvard or Stanford, you've learned
to play a game.

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.470
And a very safe game.

00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:55.180
Because that's the only way you get into Harvard
or Stanford.

00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:59.050
You go work for a place like Goldman Sachs
or whatever and then you go."

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:03.420
And he said "Problem one is, the kinds of
people who get there are not risk-takers.

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.700
They're not innovators.

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.720
They've had no experiences in innovation.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:09.730
Problem two is what they learn.

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:13.770
What they learned" in his words, "Is how to
squeeze more juice out of the orange.

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:19.230
Economies of scale versus how to grow better
oranges."

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:20.270
Which is innovation.

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:21.830
Other questions?

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:25.940
&gt;&gt;Male #5: So what if schools can't be fixed?

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:29.730
So, I'm basing this off of, there's another
set of researchers that came and talked to

00:35:29.730 --> 00:35:32.490
us last week that wrote a book called Race
Against The Machine.

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:37.430
It's all based on the idea that Moore's Law
is processing power and things are doubling

00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:38.790
every few years.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:40.990
And the world's just changing really fast.

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:42.990
What if schools will never change fast enough?

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:45.440
And teachers will never change fast enough
to keep up with this?

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:50.370
How will you use technology, in your research,
to fix this problem?

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:51.370
&gt;&gt;Tony Wagner: Yeah.

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:53.300
Well I think that's a really, really interesting
question.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:58.880
But first of all I can take you right now
to schools that are really doing an extraordinary

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.120
job of all the things I just described.

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.870
So it's' not true that schools can't change.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:06.170
If we think about startups.

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:08.030
And schools that are startups.

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.720
Then we see a completely different landscape.

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.750
Now let me be clear, I'm not saying all charter
schools are better.

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:16.680
I wanna be really, really clear about that.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:21.720
The research is quite clear that about 17
percent of charter schools outperform comparable

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.720
public schools.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:27.960
About 20 percent underperform comparable public
schools and the rest do no better.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.410
No different.

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:33.920
So I think we need to incent more RND through
lab schools.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:39.340
But having said that I think the whole issue
of technology is a fascinating one.

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:46.980
Since information knowledge is now commoditized,
we're seeing Coursera, Udacity, EdX all of

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:54.230
these online opportunities to acquire certification
for taking courses.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:56.230
But that's content.

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:57.970
What about skills?

00:36:57.970 --> 00:37:01.960
So here's my idea that I'm, I would love to
play with.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:08.501
What if you put together a blended learning
experience for the last two years of high

00:37:08.501 --> 00:37:10.080
school, first two years of college?

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.940
The blended learning would be a combination
of taking some of these courses for certification.

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:22.340
From EdX or Coursera . it would include an,
a face to face experience with this brand

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.820
new organization called Project Breaker.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:29.370
Where you work in a team to solve a problem,
create a product over a three month period.

00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:32.920
It would include taking the college and work
readiness assessment.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.020
One of these really good tests I describe.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:39.600
It would include a number of challenges that
you would undertake.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:44.670
All of which you would then put into your
digital portfolio.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:49.650
Pathbrite is my current favorite example of
a really interesting web model for digital

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:50.650
portfolio.

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:52.270
P-A-T-H-B-R-I-T-E.

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:57.320
And then you would submit your digital portfolio
to a panel of reviewers.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:03.040
Who would use valid external criteria for
determining whether or not you should earn

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.850
a certificate of initial mastery.

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:09.510
Which would suddenly be worth more than a
highs school diploma.

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:12.270
Because it's evidence of mastery.

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:15.930
And so suddenly colleges and employers were
see a body of work.

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.280
Not a piece of paper with some numbers on
it.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:22.440
It would have far more, I think, value in
the real world.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.400
Than what we see now.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.940
Certificate of advanced mastery would be equivalent
of two years of college.

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:33.550
I think we have to get past the idea that
every kid should or will or needs to go to

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:34.760
a four year college.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:35.760
That's lunacy.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.760
Yes please.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:40.090
I'm sorry we're gonna do a, hands, and mics.

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:41.090
Sorry.

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:46.000
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Hi, my wife is a cofounder of a
charter school in Atlanta that serves underprivileged

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
kids.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
And they do project based learning.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.040
But their big innovation is six kids per classroom.

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.040
&gt;&gt;Tony Wagner: Yeah.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:52.140
&gt;&gt;Male #6: And they're really focused on tutorial
style teaching.

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:57.240
I wanted to know if you have any research
or any insight into the optimal team size?

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.750
Or tutorial style versus applied?

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:03.510
&gt;&gt;Tony Wagner: Well there's a lot of research
about smaller classes.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:07.330
Smaller classes don't necessarily improve
learning and here's why.

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:12.290
You can lecture 15 kids as easily as you can
lecture 150.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:15.310
The teaching style has to change.

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:19.590
To take advantage of a smaller learning environment.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:26.970
And I think the learning size can vary depending
upon who the students are, what the task is,

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:31.810
but generally speaking, 15 to 20 is I think,
close to optimum.

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:36.440
And I spent a whole period of time researching
Finland's education system.

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.030
And made a documentary film many of you might
find interesting.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:40.540
It's called "The Finland Phenomenon."

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:43.390
You can get it on the web.

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:49.180
They have been at the business of systematically
reinventing their entire education system

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.800
for the entire country.

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.530
For over 40 years.

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:56.230
And they've come down to this idea of about
20 students per class.

00:39:56.230 --> 00:40:02.880
But they also have very, very highly trained
teachers who know how to use different groupings

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.880
of students.

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:07.320
And also a teacher who's a specialist in learning
difficulties.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:12.480
So if a student or if some students are shown
at a very early age to have learning difficulties,

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:15.400
they're pulled out for that extra help.

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:19.950
Think I only have time for one or two more.

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:20.950
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Just one more question.

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:25.200
It looks like most of us parents and educators
seem to want our students to succeed.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.180
But sometimes there's confusion about how
we define success.

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:33.380
What you mentioned about this whole idea about
a world where people are consuming for the

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:37.750
sake of consuming, and not because what the
real and what was meaningful.

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:42.680
I mean they're all stuck with big mortgages
and two car garages and thing that are not

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:43.950
making us happy.

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:47.580
So then, I mean that's sort of forcing us
to redefine success in a certain way.

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:48.970
But where do we begin on this, right?

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:52.860
When I look at my own kids and wanting to
see, I just want them to be happy.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.740
I really don't want them to be powerful CEO.

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.680
I mean it's OK if they become.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.940
But if they don't it's OK.

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:00.580
And I mean, but where does one start?

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:06.520
And you know, have you seen any trailblazers
out there in terms of schooling where people

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.820
are thinking philosophically in a different
way?

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.270
&gt;&gt;Tony Wagner: I think it's a wonderful question.

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:14.600
And I suppose where one starts is by defining
happiness.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:18.260
When you say you want your child to be happy,
how do you define happiness?

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:19.810
What does that mean?

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:23.240
Some people might define it as having, owning
a nice house.

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.100
Living in a great neighborhood.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:27.770
More and more young people saying "I don't
know that I ever wanna buy a house.

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:30.100
I'm not even sure I need or want to own a
car.

00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:33.560
I'll do zip car when I need to 'cause I prefer
to bike most places."

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.770
So I think the definitions of happiness may
be evolving and changing.

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:40.990
And I think that's the first place to start.

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:44.850
Then the schools, so often, a friend of mine
said, "When you pick your school, you pick

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:45.940
your complaint."

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:46.940
[laughter]

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:51.170
Unless you're fortunate enough to be in High
Tech High or send your kids to Montessori

00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:54.880
schools, I think there's no perfect school.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:42:00.690
So then you have to think about how do you
supplement what school is not offering by.

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:04.430
And also how do you advocate within the school
for 20 percent time within the class.

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:06.060
&gt;&gt;Female #3: What do you think of homeschooling?

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:07.810
&gt;&gt;Tony Wagner: I think it's a valid option.

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:09.270
I see more and more people doing it.

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:11.630
I get that question in almost every audience
now.

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:13.520
Time for one more question.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.760
&gt;&gt;Female #4: Hi, my name is Allie.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.420
I'm a resident sophomore in college.

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:23.030
And I guess I'm kind of the product of this
assessment one point oh that you talk of.

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:26.130
I did my STAR testing in California schools.

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:27.420
I did my AP testing.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.020
I got into Harvard.

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:30.300
I'm now a Google intern.

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:32.050
And I guess it's a little selfish.

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:34.220
But is there like something wrong with me?

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:35.220
[laughter]

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.460
I mean, you kind of keep hating on the system,
but.

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.610
&gt;&gt;Tony Wagner: Um, we'll talk later.

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:41.610
[laughter]

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:42.710
No, come on.

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:46.290
I mean there are people for whom that is not
a crippling environment.

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:50.800
There are people who know how to thrive in
that environment and can do well.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.850
You know, I don't mean to sound critical.

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:59.140
I'm simply suggesting that for many people,
that is not a formula that they can or need

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:01.050
to or want to follow.

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:03.120
If it worked for you that's fine.

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.940
I have daughter who went to Brown.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:06.670
She's OK by that.

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:08.560
She's now a teacher by the way.

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:09.560
[laughter]

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:14.300
I think the issue is not what you went through,
what hoops you jumped through.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.020
But where do you wanna go?

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.270
What do you wanna contribute?

00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:23.170
Paraphrasing Steve Jobs, you know "What's
the ding in the universe you wanna make?"

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:24.170
So I'm gonna stop now.

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:26.240
But lemme, I've got a surprise for you.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:31.160
This new book, Creating Innovators, was a
collaboration with Bob Compton with whom I

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.450
did the "Finland Phenomenon" documentary.

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:38.170
Bob shot more than 60 videos to accompany
the book.

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:40.750
He said to me "I couldn't just write a book
about innovation.

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:42.160
It has to be innovative."

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:47.840
So embedded throughout the book are series
of codes which you scan with your Smartphone

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:48.840
with the right software.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:50.410
And you see all of these different videos.

00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:55.950
And what we did was put together a nine minute
compilation of the videos that you'll find

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:56.950
throughout the book.

00:43:56.950 --> 00:44:00.520
Now, Maggie you may have to help me find,
so I just go to QuickTime, right?

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:01.520
Alright.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.520
So we're set.

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:05.090
So this is just a quickie to give you a sneak
[inaudible]

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:08.290
&gt;&gt;Dean Kamen: Oxygen to life.

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:13.660
I mean I don't know any other way to define
innovation other that it's what drives us

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:15.050
to the next level.

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:16.580
[quiet percussive music]

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:23.260
&gt;&gt;Amanda Alonzo: I think innovation is the
ability to look at a problem or a question

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:26.620
in a new way.

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:33.450
To have a passion for that question and make
it meaningful.

00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:35.420
[music continues]

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:40.870
&gt;&gt;Tom Friedman: CQ plus PQ is always greater
than IQ.

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:46.770
That is, you give me a young person with a
high curiosity quotient and a young person

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:50.520
combines that with a high passion quotient
to pursue their curiosity.

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:55.300
I'll always take that young person over someone
with a high IQ.

00:44:55.300 --> 00:45:00.200
Because when you get young people who are
curious and then they have a passion to pursue

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:05.360
their curiosity, good things tend to happen.

00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.950
[music continues]

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:14.630
&gt;&gt;Larry Rosenstock: The future lies for our
country to become more productive.

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:16.630
We need people to innovate.

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:20.440
We need people to create and you start with
your young.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.090
[sound of drill]

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:27.550
&gt;&gt;Annemarie Neal: Raising someone with that
intention that they'll be an innovator is

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:32.430
actually different than raising a child that
you want to behave all the time and be quite

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:33.430
compliant.

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:36.600
How do I help create an environment for this
child to be curious?

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:43.470
I'm going to ask a lot of questions and not
be in any way inhibited by the answers that

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:45.300
he comes up with.

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:48.540
He's in a school system that also provides
that same type of an environment.

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:50.260
So he gets it in school.

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:53.240
And then we continue to foster it at home.

00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:57.210
But the goal is to let him ask as many questions
as possible.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:06.800
And for us to always think in terms of, let's
be curious about what's in front of us.

00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:07.800
[music continues]

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:10.380
&gt;&gt;David Kelley: Everybody is created naturally,
look at what happens in kindergarten.

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:13.820
I mean you just go into a kindergarten class
and walking the streets.

00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:16.520
Just totally coming up with ideas that nobody,
they'll interview a second grader.

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:18.310
And they'll have all kinds of ideas that you
never thought of, right.

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:19.310
Because their minds are free to do that.

00:46:19.310 --> 00:46:28.760
So I think the school system kind of trains
that out of a lot of us.

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:32.540
[dark percussive music]

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:39.380
&gt;&gt;Jennifer Winters: Our school really gives
kids enough time for, to really get invested

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:40.380
in something.

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:41.570
To really figure it out.

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:43.410
It's not a quick study of something.

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:45.670
If you're interested in blocks, you can build
with blocks.

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:48.630
For a two hour period of time.

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:51.240
And really sort of experiment with materials.

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:55.800
We talk about these basic open ended materials
that we have for children every single day.

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:56.960
There's blocks.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.120
There's clay.

00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.850
There's easel painting.

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:02.160
There's sand and water.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.320
[music continues]

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:07.720
&gt;&gt;Beth Wise: In that environment children
have a way to work with each other.

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.820
And it's very collaborative.

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.320
[music continues]

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:20.700
&gt;&gt;Male Speaker #1: The philosophy of High
Tech High is founded largely on the idea of

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:25.320
kids making, doing, building, shaping, and
inventing stuff.

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.320
Along with teachers.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:31.120
And you can see when you're here that we're
producing things because when you're producing

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:32.760
things you're also consuming those technologies.

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:37.970
But when you're consuming those technologies
you're not necessarily producing [unintelligible]

00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:41.070
those technologies.

00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:44.180
[music continues]

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:53.260
&gt;&gt;Richard Miller: The science part is simply
the power tools behind you that make you do

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.260
it faster.

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:55.260
And more efficiently.

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:57.960
It's not in fact, what engineering is all
about.

00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.680
[music continues]

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:08.610
The curriculum at Olin requires that all students
have a series of courses in design.

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:13.430
And in fact, the day they arrive they begin
designing and building things.

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:17.270
They haven't yet had the calculus and the
physics background material.

00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:18.930
But that's OK.

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:23.030
Because design thinking doesn't require science.

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:26.600
Design thinking actually has a lot in common
with art.

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:29.980
[slower music]

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:31.680
It's about asking the right questions.

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:34.790
It's about having the right insights and perceptions.

00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:39.740
Do whatever it takes to increase the level
of student engagement so that they are intrinsically

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:40.740
motivated.

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:42.030
They ask the right questions.

00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:44.460
They're empowered to use technology to find
them.

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:47.160
And they're committed to making a positive
difference in the world.

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.070

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.900
[synthesizer plays]

00:48:52.900 --> 00:49:05.510
&gt;&gt;Semyon Dukach: I think that there's a class
of young people that really wanna change the

00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:07.100
world.

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:10.290
[music continues]

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:14.860
They come from countries like the US.

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:19.390
And some have had pretty comfortable backgrounds
and others have had to work very hard.

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:21.270
But they're really motivated to try to make
a difference.

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:27.870
And there's a whole movement of organizations
that are on the edge of non-profits and for-profits.

00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:29.600
That really have a social mission.

00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.300
But also want to, they don't want to just
ask for donations.

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:35.250
They want to run it as a business to keep
themselves honest.

00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:41.690
&gt;&gt;Amy Smith: It's really important for students
to find out what is their passion.

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:42.690
Right?

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:44.490
There's plenty of problems in the world.

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:46.300
And we're, no one's gonna solve all of them.

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:49.540
So why not choose the one that means the most
to you?

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:50.910
[music continues]

00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:55.380
&gt;&gt;David Sengeh: We have lots of amputees in
Sierra Leon.

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:59.500
I do have a lot of amputee friends from the
war.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.860
Where couple thousand people were maimed.

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:07.070
Allow the users to work in different terrains.

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:09.590
To work in a rainy season.

00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:14.310
To do things on ground that is not level.

00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:17.210
But also have it be low cost.

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:18.210
And have it be enabling.

00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:20.370
Have them to have another dimension to their
lives.

00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:23.240
They have to be able to do more than just
walk.

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:27.150
They have to be able to do their basic general
work.

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:28.150
[quiet music]

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:32.040
&gt;&gt;Shanna Tellerman: I've always really wanted
to make a real impact in the world.

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:33.500
That's the biggest desire I've had.

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:37.680
I want to feel like what I'm doing every day
matters.

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:40.610
And it matters in a bigger way than myself.

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:45.360
So when I was doing art, the biggest struggle
I had was that I felt like art has meaning

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:48.850
to people but I wasn't really changing the
world with my art.

00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:54.310
And so the desire I started having in high
school and even in college was how can my

00:50:54.310 --> 00:50:55.870
art be more extended.

00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:59.010
How can creativity be more extended and have
a bigger impact?

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:00.240
[quiet slow music continues]

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.970
&gt;&gt;Laura White: I'm not afraid of poverty.

00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:03.970
I'm really not.

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:05.610
I think that's really important.

00:51:05.610 --> 00:51:14.711
I want to improve the society that I live
in. and I believe that I can make it work

00:51:14.711 --> 00:51:16.150
of it's doing the right thing.

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:17.210
[music continues]

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:19.760
&gt;&gt;Jamien Sills: I can't reinvent the foot.

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:23.080
But I can reinvent the shoe or the way the
shoe is made.

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:27.683
I always say, if I'm able to take an image
from my mind and make something out of it

00:51:27.683 --> 00:51:28.850
and then share that with the world, it means
everything to me.

00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:35.840
&gt;&gt;Jodie Wo: Everyone's here for a reason.

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:41.790
And if you're here and you have a talent or
this ability to do something, if you're not

00:51:41.790 --> 00:51:45.210
gonna utilize it, you've basically like, are
taking away from the world.

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:53.400
You're not giving it, you're not playing your
role in this big ecosystem of things.

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:54.420
I have the capacity to do it.

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:56.680
So I need to do it.

00:51:56.680 --> 00:52:03.271
If I'm not, then I'm not only failing myself,
but I'm failing the world.

00:52:03.271 --> 00:52:04.271
[melodious music]

00:52:04.271 --> 00:52:06.930
&gt;&gt;Tony Wagner: The one thing that cannot be
commoditized is innovation.

00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:15.040
It is increasingly clear to me that young
people who are capable of innovating in whatever

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:17.630
they do, not just high tech stuff.

00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:19.540
But in any kind of job.

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:22.530
Are really going to have richer, more satisfying
lives.

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:26.690
And many better opportunities to earn a decent
living.

00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:29.510
To have interesting and challenging and rewarding
work.

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:34.370
So rather than all kids college ready, what
I've come to see is that we need to think

00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:38.570
about all students, all children, innovation
ready.

00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:43.140
And that poses a profound set of challenges
for us.

00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:44.140
As parents.

00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:45.140
As teachers.

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:46.140
As mentors.

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:47.140
As employers.

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:55.540
What must I do to enable my child or my student
to be innovation ready.

00:52:55.540 --> 00:53:05.470
[rhythmic music swells]

00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:10.500
Our success is measured more or less by the
rate of innovation.

00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:11.790
[music fades]

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:17.600

Tony?
