that's sort of not mentioned but is
worth pointing out is that to avoid

building a house of cards we want to

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400
building a house of cards we want to
 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.580
building a house of cards we want to
make sure that the data are collected

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590
make sure that the data are collected
 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.740
make sure that the data are collected
all of this is sort of hypothetical or

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750
all of this is sort of hypothetical or
 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.780
all of this is sort of hypothetical or
moot unless there's data to begin with

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790
moot unless there's data to begin with
 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.810

and so I'm really excited that to avoid

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820
and so I'm really excited that to avoid
 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.460
and so I'm really excited that to avoid
building a house of cards and to have

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470
building a house of cards and to have
 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.920
building a house of cards and to have
quality data that we can talk about and

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930
quality data that we can talk about and
 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.000
quality data that we can talk about and
that we can address some of these issues

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010
that we can address some of these issues
 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.790
that we can address some of these issues
is we have a panel focused on the plan

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800
is we have a panel focused on the plan
 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.640
is we have a panel focused on the plan

curation and we think that in this way

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930
curation and we think that in this way
 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.900
curation and we think that in this way
we are able to put together some new

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910
we are able to put together some new
 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.440
we are able to put together some new
solutions and approaches and I think I

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450
solutions and approaches and I think I
 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.319
solutions and approaches and I think I
hope anyway that that you'll be able to

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329
hope anyway that that you'll be able to
 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.349
hope anyway that that you'll be able to
see some of those as I as I continue

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359
see some of those as I as I continue
 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:11.460

with my presentation today well alright
so at California digital library we do

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010
so at California digital library we do
 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.240
so at California digital library we do
actually use the research data life

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250
actually use the research data life
 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.260
actually use the research data life
cycle to inform how we develop our

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270
cycle to inform how we develop our
 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.110
cycle to inform how we develop our
services and approaches we think about

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120
services and approaches we think about
 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.560
services and approaches we think about
this actually in a really active way and

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570
this actually in a really active way and
 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.320

look for this to actually become even
 

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:22.920
look for this to actually become even
more super-powered I think of it as a

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:22.930
more super-powered I think of it as a
 

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:28.100
more super-powered I think of it as a
really super charged tool here's a an

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:28.110
really super charged tool here's a an
 

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.480

it's really become quite popular and so

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:33.670
it's really become quite popular and so
 

00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.150
it's really become quite popular and so
I really think this is a tool you might

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:36.160
I really think this is a tool you might
 

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.719

want to take a look at I've brought some

00:08:38.719 --> 00:08:38.729
want to take a look at I've brought some
 

00:08:38.729 --> 00:08:41.430
want to take a look at I've brought some
cards that are out in the lobby I think

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440
cards that are out in the lobby I think
 

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.670
cards that are out in the lobby I think
that you can take along with you if you

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:44.680
that you can take along with you if you
 

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.890
that you can take along with you if you
want to remember the URLs up in the

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:46.900
want to remember the URLs up in the
 

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.420
want to remember the URLs up in the
upper left hand corner but you can pick

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:48.430
upper left hand corner but you can pick
 

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.990
upper left hand corner but you can pick
up card on your way out and that'll help

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000
up card on your way out and that'll help
 

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.820
up card on your way out and that'll help
you keep it in mind let's say oops I'm

00:08:59.820 --> 00:08:59.830
you keep it in mind let's say oops I'm
 

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.310
you keep it in mind let's say oops I'm
really having a challenge so here's my

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320
really having a challenge so here's my
 

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.520
really having a challenge so here's my
gizmo all right next up is easy ID and I

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:05.530
gizmo all right next up is easy ID and I
 

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:05.890
gizmo all right next up is easy ID and I
am

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:05.900

service manager for this one this is a

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:07.970
service manager for this one this is a
 

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.060
service manager for this one this is a
long term or persistent identifiers

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:10.070
long term or persistent identifiers
 

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.330
long term or persistent identifiers
service and I put it in the plan segment

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:13.340
service and I put it in the plan segment
 

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.120
service and I put it in the plan segment
because long term identifiers are not

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.130
because long term identifiers are not
 

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.240
because long term identifiers are not
just for data citation they are also a

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:19.250
just for data citation they are also a
 

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.720
just for data citation they are also a

librarianship but my point here is that

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:56.930
librarianship but my point here is that
 

00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:58.420
librarianship but my point here is that
in the upper right-hand corner there's a

00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:58.430
in the upper right-hand corner there's a
 

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:01.750
in the upper right-hand corner there's a
bar graph showing responses to the

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:01.760
bar graph showing responses to the
 

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.400

planning we asked a number of our

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:13.820
planning we asked a number of our
 

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:16.480
planning we asked a number of our
specific questions about sort of

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:16.490
specific questions about sort of
 

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.460
specific questions about sort of

when it comes to data management do your

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:20.660
when it comes to data management do your
 

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:22.480
when it comes to data management do your
data conform to disciplinary standards

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:22.490
data conform to disciplinary standards
 

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:24.430
data conform to disciplinary standards
do you generate metadata that conforms

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440
do you generate metadata that conforms
 

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.069
do you generate metadata that conforms
to disciplinary standards and there are

00:14:27.069 --> 00:14:27.079
to disciplinary standards and there are
 

00:14:27.079 --> 00:14:28.990
to disciplinary standards and there are
big bars over on the right for I'm not

big bars over on the right for I'm not
 

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.540
big bars over on the right for I'm not
sure and in fact in the survey for every

possible answer

00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:34.279
possible answer
 

00:14:34.279 --> 00:14:35.800
possible answer
at least twenty percent of respondents

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:35.810
at least twenty percent of respondents
 

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.679
at least twenty percent of respondents
picked that so a lot of uncertainty and

00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:38.689
picked that so a lot of uncertainty and
 

00:14:38.689 --> 00:14:40.269
picked that so a lot of uncertainty and
a real willingness to accept some help

00:14:40.269 --> 00:14:40.279
a real willingness to accept some help
 

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:45.489
a real willingness to accept some help
in this in this area I know you can't

00:14:45.489 --> 00:14:45.499
in this in this area I know you can't
 

00:14:45.499 --> 00:14:47.170
in this in this area I know you can't
read this one in that that's actually my

point so like any large research

00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:50.899
point so like any large research
 

00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:52.840
point so like any large research
university Cornell actually has a lot of

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:52.850
university Cornell actually has a lot of
 

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.309
university Cornell actually has a lot of
services of infrastructure to help

00:14:54.309 --> 00:14:54.319
services of infrastructure to help
 

00:14:54.319 --> 00:14:56.079
services of infrastructure to help
researchers do what they need to do but

00:14:56.079 --> 00:14:56.089
researchers do what they need to do but
 

00:14:56.089 --> 00:14:57.730
researchers do what they need to do but
it's widely distributed so the teeny

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:57.740
it's widely distributed so the teeny
 

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.369
it's widely distributed so the teeny
tiny text is categories of data

management services and all the places

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:01.970
management services and all the places
 

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.369
management services and all the places
on the Cornell campus where you could

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:03.379
on the Cornell campus where you could
 

00:15:03.379 --> 00:15:06.989
on the Cornell campus where you could
find that and obviously researchers are

00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:06.999
find that and obviously researchers are
 

00:15:06.999 --> 00:15:09.429
find that and obviously researchers are
interested in considering external

00:15:09.429 --> 00:15:09.439
interested in considering external
 

00:15:09.439 --> 00:15:10.869

services things that come from their

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:10.879
services things that come from their
 

00:15:10.879 --> 00:15:12.879
services things that come from their
domains or maybe commercial services so

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:12.889
domains or maybe commercial services so
 

00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:15.069
domains or maybe commercial services so
my point here is just that even on

00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:15.079
my point here is just that even on
 

00:15:15.079 --> 00:15:17.290
my point here is just that even on
campus it's a little bit overwhelming to

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:17.300
campus it's a little bit overwhelming to
 

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.199
campus it's a little bit overwhelming to
sift through what's available and

00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:19.209
sift through what's available and
 

00:15:19.209 --> 00:15:21.519
sift through what's available and
personally I wouldn't mind a concierge

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:21.529
personally I wouldn't mind a concierge
 

00:15:21.529 --> 00:15:24.340
personally I wouldn't mind a concierge
like figure to help me sift through all

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:24.350
like figure to help me sift through all
 

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.720
like figure to help me sift through all
that and find what's important so this

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:27.730
that and find what's important so this
 

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.220
that and find what's important so this
evolution and policies uncertainty about

00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:30.230
evolution and policies uncertainty about
 

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.970
evolution and policies uncertainty about
day management practices and sort of

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:33.980
day management practices and sort of
 

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.470

bewildering array of services that

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:35.480
bewildering array of services that
 

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.210
bewildering array of services that
researchers might avail themselves of

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:37.220
researchers might avail themselves of
 

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.730

are really what prompted us to form the

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:39.740
are really what prompted us to form the
 

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.470
are really what prompted us to form the
research data management service group a

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:41.480
research data management service group a
 

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.860
research data management service group a
little over two years ago I just want to

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:44.870
little over two years ago I just want to
 

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:46.720
little over two years ago I just want to
pull out a couple key points from our

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:46.730
pull out a couple key points from our
 

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:49.780
pull out a couple key points from our
mission statement one is that it's a

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:49.790
mission statement one is that it's a
 

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.269
mission statement one is that it's a
collaborative campus-wide group I'm with

00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:52.279
collaborative campus-wide group I'm with
 

00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:54.040
collaborative campus-wide group I'm with
library there's a lot of library effort

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:54.050
library there's a lot of library effort
 

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:55.629
library there's a lot of library effort
in this group but it's really important

00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:55.639
in this group but it's really important
 

00:15:55.639 --> 00:15:58.420
in this group but it's really important
for the success of this group and for

00:15:58.420 --> 00:15:58.430
for the success of this group and for
 

00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:00.280
for the success of this group and for
researchers that this is not a library

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:00.290
researchers that this is not a library
 

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.040
researchers that this is not a library
only effort the second point I want to

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:03.050
only effort the second point I want to
 

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:04.929
only effort the second point I want to
pull out is that we really do bring

00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:04.939
pull out is that we really do bring
 

00:16:04.939 --> 00:16:06.699
pull out is that we really do bring
people in from all over campus which

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:06.709
people in from all over campus which
 

00:16:06.709 --> 00:16:09.340
people in from all over campus which
brings deep expertise from different

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:09.350
brings deep expertise from different
 

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.869
brings deep expertise from different
disciplines but also functionary

00:16:10.869 --> 00:16:10.879
disciplines but also functionary
 

00:16:10.879 --> 00:16:13.799
disciplines but also functionary
functional areas so different aspects of

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:13.809
functional areas so different aspects of
 

00:16:13.809 --> 00:16:17.350
functional areas so different aspects of
information technology policy things

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360
information technology policy things
 

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:21.189
information technology policy things
like that and then just the last two

00:16:21.189 --> 00:16:21.199
like that and then just the last two
 

00:16:21.199 --> 00:16:22.569
like that and then just the last two
points are the two things that we really

00:16:22.569 --> 00:16:22.579
points are the two things that we really
 

00:16:22.579 --> 00:16:25.119
points are the two things that we really
do which is to help researchers create

00:16:25.119 --> 00:16:25.129
do which is to help researchers create
 

00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:27.069
do which is to help researchers create
and implement data management plans and

00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:27.079
and implement data management plans and
 

00:16:27.079 --> 00:16:28.809
and implement data management plans and
then to help connect them with the

00:16:28.809 --> 00:16:28.819
then to help connect them with the
 

00:16:28.819 --> 00:16:30.669
then to help connect them with the
research data management services that

00:16:30.669 --> 00:16:30.679
research data management services that
 

00:16:30.679 --> 00:16:32.439
research data management services that
they might need at any point in the

00:16:32.439 --> 00:16:32.449
they might need at any point in the
 

00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:34.389
they might need at any point in the
research process whether that was part

00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399
research process whether that was part
 

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:37.389
research process whether that was part
of a plan or not so that's what we're

00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:37.399
of a plan or not so that's what we're
 

00:16:37.399 --> 00:16:39.819
of a plan or not so that's what we're
about a little bit about how we're

00:16:39.819 --> 00:16:39.829
about a little bit about how we're
 

00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:43.600
about a little bit about how we're
organized the main thing to know is that

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:43.610
organized the main thing to know is that
 

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.699
organized the main thing to know is that
it is a virtual organization and it's a

00:16:45.699 --> 00:16:45.709
it is a virtual organization and it's a
 

00:16:45.709 --> 00:16:47.590
it is a virtual organization and it's a
campus-wide collaboration so there's no

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600
campus-wide collaboration so there's no
 

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.000

because it's due tomorrow the second
point I'd like to pull out is that we

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:33.480
point I'd like to pull out is that we
 

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.510
point I'd like to pull out is that we
strive to promote best practices and

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520
strive to promote best practices and

time and resource constraints the
 

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:43.910
time and resource constraints the
researchers face and also with a healthy

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:43.920
researchers face and also with a healthy
 

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.820
researchers face and also with a healthy
respect for the diversity of approaches

that different disciplines it take to

that different disciplines it take to
 

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:53.540
that different disciplines it take to
research and research data the like I

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:53.550
research and research data the like I
 

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.640
research and research data the like I
said bring diverse expertise to the

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:55.650
said bring diverse expertise to the
 

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:58.670
said bring diverse expertise to the
table but also are realistic about the

00:19:58.670 --> 00:19:58.680
table but also are realistic about the
 

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.290
table but also are realistic about the
limits of that expertise and will refer

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:00.300
limits of that expertise and will refer
 

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.240
limits of that expertise and will refer
people out when we reach those limits

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:02.250
people out when we reach those limits
 

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.640
people out when we reach those limits
and my next point about confidentiality

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:04.650
and my next point about confidentiality
 

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:07.250
and my next point about confidentiality
is a really key one we do sometimes need

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:07.260
is a really key one we do sometimes need
 

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.930
is a really key one we do sometimes need
to talk amongst ourselves to provide

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:08.940
to talk amongst ourselves to provide
 

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.270
to talk amongst ourselves to provide

that the best service and comprehensive
 

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.760
that the best service and comprehensive
service but that any information that we

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:13.770
service but that any information that we
 

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.380
service but that any information that we
have about someone's research is

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:15.390
have about someone's research is
 

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:17.570
have about someone's research is
confidential it stays within the group

00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:17.580
confidential it stays within the group
 

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.910
confidential it stays within the group
we found early on as we started

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:19.920
we found early on as we started
 

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.860
we found early on as we started
consulting on data management plans that

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:21.870
consulting on data management plans that
 

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.050
consulting on data management plans that
sometimes someone come for us to come to

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:24.060
sometimes someone come for us to come to
 

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.120
sometimes someone come for us to come to
us for help and be a little bit

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:26.130
us for help and be a little bit
 

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:28.100
us for help and be a little bit
reluctant to say much about the research

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:28.110
reluctant to say much about the research
 

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:30.080
reluctant to say much about the research
that they're doing and it's really not

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:30.090
that they're doing and it's really not
 

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:33.020
that they're doing and it's really not
possible to provide substantive input to

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:33.030
possible to provide substantive input to
 

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.790
possible to provide substantive input to
a data management plan if you can't talk

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:34.800
a data management plan if you can't talk
 

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.500
a data management plan if you can't talk
freely with someone about their research

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:36.510
freely with someone about their research
 

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.380
freely with someone about their research
so it's crucial that we guarantee people

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:39.390
so it's crucial that we guarantee people
 

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.210
so it's crucial that we guarantee people
confidentiality when it comes to

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:41.220
confidentiality when it comes to
 

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:46.490
confidentiality when it comes to
research information and then the last

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:46.500
research information and then the last
 

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.800
research information and then the last
point is that we're not on commission we

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:48.810
point is that we're not on commission we
 

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:51.950
point is that we're not on commission we
refer researchers to the services that

00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679
worldwide about 400 in in the United
 

00:24:33.679 --> 00:24:40.210
worldwide about 400 in in the United
States and what we do is we archive data

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:40.220
States and what we do is we archive data
 

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:44.999
States and what we do is we archive data
we curate it we preserve it and

00:24:44.999 --> 00:24:45.009
we curate it we preserve it and
 

00:24:45.009 --> 00:24:48.399
we curate it we preserve it and
disseminated and we also teach people

00:24:48.399 --> 00:24:48.409
disseminated and we also teach people
 

00:24:48.409 --> 00:24:50.169
disseminated and we also teach people
how to use it so we have a summer

00:24:50.169 --> 00:24:50.179
how to use it so we have a summer
 

00:24:50.179 --> 00:24:52.509
how to use it so we have a summer
program that last summer had about a

00:24:52.509 --> 00:24:52.519
program that last summer had about a
 

00:24:52.519 --> 00:24:54.159
program that last summer had about a
thousand more than a thousand

00:24:54.159 --> 00:24:54.169
thousand more than a thousand
 

00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:57.940
thousand more than a thousand
participants so we've been advising

00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:57.950
participants so we've been advising
 

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.249
participants so we've been advising
people in the social sciences about how

00:25:00.249 --> 00:25:00.259
people in the social sciences about how
 

00:25:00.259 --> 00:25:02.289
people in the social sciences about how
to manage their data for a long time

00:25:02.289 --> 00:25:02.299
to manage their data for a long time
 

00:25:02.299 --> 00:25:07.089
to manage their data for a long time
this is the latest edition of our guide

00:25:07.089 --> 00:25:07.099
this is the latest edition of our guide
 

00:25:07.099 --> 00:25:09.909
this is the latest edition of our guide
for data collection it's the fifth

00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919
for data collection it's the fifth
 

00:25:09.919 --> 00:25:13.089
for data collection it's the fifth
edition we now have put it up on the web

00:25:13.089 --> 00:25:13.099
edition we now have put it up on the web
 

00:25:13.099 --> 00:25:14.950
edition we now have put it up on the web
so we can change it more often because

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960
so we can change it more often because
 

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:19.029
so we can change it more often because
things are changing so fast and so I and

00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039
things are changing so fast and so I and
 

00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:21.779
things are changing so fast and so I and
as you can see we have a data life cycle

00:25:21.779 --> 00:25:21.789
as you can see we have a data life cycle
 

00:25:21.789 --> 00:25:24.729
as you can see we have a data life cycle
concept there too I'm not going to talk

00:25:24.729 --> 00:25:24.739
concept there too I'm not going to talk
 

00:25:24.739 --> 00:25:26.139
concept there too I'm not going to talk
about everything that's in there I've

00:25:26.139 --> 00:25:26.149
about everything that's in there I've
 

00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:27.940
about everything that's in there I've
picked out some things that I think are

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:27.950
picked out some things that I think are
 

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:30.580
picked out some things that I think are
problematic that I want to want to

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:30.590
problematic that I want to want to
 

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.430
problematic that I want to want to
emphasize so I'm going to talk about

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:32.440
emphasize so I'm going to talk about
 

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.190
emphasize so I'm going to talk about
three areas confidentiality and

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:36.200
three areas confidentiality and
 

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.000
three areas confidentiality and
disclosure risk

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:39.010
disclosure risk
 

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:42.310
 
provenance and metadata which are

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320
provenance and metadata which are
 

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.540
provenance and metadata which are
particular problems in our disciplines

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:45.550
particular problems in our disciplines
 

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:51.100
particular problems in our disciplines
so we you know when we collect data we

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:51.110
so we you know when we collect data we
 

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:53.470
so we you know when we collect data we
promise people that there will that the

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:53.480
promise people that there will that the
 

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.890
promise people that there will that the
benefits of collecting the data outweigh

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:56.900
benefits of collecting the data outweigh
 

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.440
benefits of collecting the data outweigh
the harm and we have an obligation to

00:25:59.440 --> 00:25:59.450
the harm and we have an obligation to
 

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:01.990
the harm and we have an obligation to
protect the confidentiality of the

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000
protect the confidentiality of the
 

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.530
protect the confidentiality of the
information that people give us so there

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:05.540
information that people give us so there
 

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.320
information that people give us so there
are a number of things that people could

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:08.330
are a number of things that people could
 

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:12.010
are a number of things that people could
do to make their data more shareable if

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:12.020
do to make their data more shareable if
 

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.620
do to make their data more shareable if
they in the area of confidential data if

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:14.630
they in the area of confidential data if
 

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:18.460
they in the area of confidential data if
they thought about them in advance and

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:18.470
they thought about them in advance and
 

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:20.080
they thought about them in advance and
I'm fortunately going to have to go

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:20.090
I'm fortunately going to have to go
 

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:22.180
I'm fortunately going to have to go
through these things very fast but I did

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:22.190
through these things very fast but I did
 

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.820
through these things very fast but I did
want to mention some of them the the

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:24.830
want to mention some of them the the
 

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:29.560
want to mention some of them the the
biggest barrier to sharing data in many

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:29.570
biggest barrier to sharing data in many
 

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:31.480
biggest barrier to sharing data in many
disciplines is the informed consent

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:31.490
disciplines is the informed consent
 

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:34.210
disciplines is the informed consent
process because many up till recently

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:34.220
process because many up till recently
 

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:37.710
process because many up till recently
many I arbys were telling people to use

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:37.720
many I arbys were telling people to use
 

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.300
many I arbys were telling people to use
informed consents from the biomedical

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:40.310
informed consents from the biomedical
 

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:43.210
informed consents from the biomedical
community that were really designed to

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:43.220
community that were really designed to
 

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.820
community that were really designed to
keep to prevent data sharing rather than

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:45.830
keep to prevent data sharing rather than
 

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:48.700
keep to prevent data sharing rather than
to share it that language is actually

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:48.710
to share it that language is actually
 

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:53.500
to share it that language is actually
discouraged by by NIH and there are a

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:53.510
discouraged by by NIH and there are a
 

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:56.050
discouraged by by NIH and there are a
number of things that people can do to

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:56.060
number of things that people can do to
 

00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:00.640
number of things that people can do to
avoid that we in our guide we talk about

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:00.650
avoid that we in our guide we talk about
 

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.770
avoid that we in our guide we talk about
some things that that you shouldn't say

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:02.780
some things that that you shouldn't say
 

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.990
some things that that you shouldn't say
and we also have some examples of

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:05.000
and we also have some examples of
 

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.090
and we also have some examples of
language that that people can use

00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:09.100
language that that people can use
 

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:13.060
language that that people can use
secondly this is an area that is not

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:13.070
secondly this is an area that is not
 

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:15.160
secondly this is an area that is not
well developed but we actually have some

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:15.170
well developed but we actually have some
 

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:18.070
well developed but we actually have some
a colleague who's doing a research

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080
a colleague who's doing a research
 

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.110
a colleague who's doing a research
project on this there are a number of

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.120
project on this there are a number of
 

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.660
project on this there are a number of
design features in the way that people

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:22.670
design features in the way that people
 

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:25.810
design features in the way that people
collect data that make data more

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:25.820
collect data that make data more
 

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:29.200
collect data that make data more
difficult to share because it's more

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:29.210
difficult to share because it's more
 

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:31.690
difficult to share because it's more
identifiable so there are a lot of

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:31.700
identifiable so there are a lot of
 

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.080
identifiable so there are a lot of
things like geocoding longitudinal data

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:35.090
things like geocoding longitudinal data
 

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:39.550
things like geocoding longitudinal data
that are naturally make data harder to

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:39.560
that are naturally make data harder to
 

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.420
that are naturally make data harder to
share but people could reduce some of

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:43.430
share but people could reduce some of
 

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:45.340
share but people could reduce some of
those risks if they thought about them

00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:45.350
those risks if they thought about them
 

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:48.550
those risks if they thought about them
in advance so the simplest one I think

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:48.560
in advance so the simplest one I think
 

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:49.800
in advance so the simplest one I think
is

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:49.810
is
 

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:54.580
is
is that if people take data from one

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:54.590
is that if people take data from one
 

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.550
is that if people take data from one
geographic location there are certainly

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:57.560
geographic location there are certainly
 

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.130
geographic location there are certainly
some savings in cost there but it makes

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:00.140
some savings in cost there but it makes
 

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:01.930
some savings in cost there but it makes
it much more difficult to share it

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:01.940
it much more difficult to share it
 

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.480
it much more difficult to share it
because the the data is more

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:04.490
because the the data is more
 

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:06.430
because the the data is more
identifiable so there are a number of

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:06.440
identifiable so there are a number of
 

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.140
identifiable so there are a number of
things that we're we're trying to

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:08.150
things that we're we're trying to
 

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:12.340
things that we're we're trying to
develop to help people designs safer

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:12.350
develop to help people designs safer
 

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.710
develop to help people designs safer
designs to make to reduce disclosure

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720
designs to make to reduce disclosure
 

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:19.570
designs to make to reduce disclosure
risk finally there are things that can

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:19.580
risk finally there are things that can
 

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:22.870
risk finally there are things that can
be done to the data afterwards to make

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880
be done to the data afterwards to make
 

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.990
be done to the data afterwards to make
it to reduce the risks of disclosure and

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000
it to reduce the risks of disclosure and
 

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.690
it to reduce the risks of disclosure and
this has become a quite a well developed

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:28.700
this has become a quite a well developed
 

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:33.010
this has become a quite a well developed
developed area and there are strategies

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:33.020
developed area and there are strategies
 

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:38.140
developed area and there are strategies
that people can use to share data that

00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:38.150
that people can use to share data that
 

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:41.380
that people can use to share data that
does have a risk of disclosure in safe

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:41.390
does have a risk of disclosure in safe
 

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:45.460
does have a risk of disclosure in safe
ways and one of the the most important

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:45.470
ways and one of the the most important
 

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:47.590
ways and one of the the most important
ones that's that we're working on in a

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600
ones that's that we're working on in a
 

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.420
ones that's that we're working on in a
number of people in not only in the US

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:49.430
number of people in not only in the US
 

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:51.190
number of people in not only in the US
but in Europe have been working on is

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200
but in Europe have been working on is
 

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.710
but in Europe have been working on is
this next to last one what we call a

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:53.720
this next to last one what we call a
 

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.590
this next to last one what we call a
virtual data Enclave which is a remote

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:56.600
virtual data Enclave which is a remote
 

00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.770
virtual data Enclave which is a remote
access system where the data is is kept

00:28:59.770 --> 00:28:59.780
access system where the data is is kept
 

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.080
access system where the data is is kept
in in a safe location but you give

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:02.090
in in a safe location but you give
 

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:05.380
in in a safe location but you give
people access to it over the internet so

00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:05.390
people access to it over the internet so
 

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:10.750
people access to it over the internet so
they can do their work so provenance one

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:10.760
they can do their work so provenance one
 

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:14.200
they can do their work so provenance one
of the biggest problems in the social

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:14.210
of the biggest problems in the social
 

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:17.050
of the biggest problems in the social
sciences is that we don't actually have

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:17.060
sciences is that we don't actually have
 

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.990
sciences is that we don't actually have
a tradition of lab notebooks if we had

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:20.000
a tradition of lab notebooks if we had
 

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.790
a tradition of lab notebooks if we had
lab notebooks we would be better off

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:21.800
lab notebooks we would be better off
 

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.100
lab notebooks we would be better off
people would be recording things there

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:24.110
people would be recording things there
 

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:26.530
people would be recording things there
are a lot of things that people should

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:26.540
are a lot of things that people should
 

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.990
are a lot of things that people should
be recording under the heading of what a

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:29.000
be recording under the heading of what a
 

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.120
be recording under the heading of what a
librarian or an archivist would call

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:31.130
librarian or an archivist would call
 

00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.130
librarian or an archivist would call
Providence that people don't think of

00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:33.140
Providence that people don't think of
 

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.440
Providence that people don't think of
that way but I want to highlight that

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:35.450
that way but I want to highlight that
 

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:39.250
that way but I want to highlight that
that we need to train our researchers to

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:39.260
that we need to train our researchers to
 

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.700
that we need to train our researchers to
think in this way and I wanted to

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:42.710
think in this way and I wanted to
 

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:45.760
think in this way and I wanted to
highlight one thing in particular that I

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:45.770
highlight one thing in particular that I
 

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:49.890
highlight one thing in particular that I
think falls under the heading of

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:49.900
think falls under the heading of
 

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:53.200
think falls under the heading of
provenance which is response rates if

we're going to share data openly the
 

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.570
we're going to share data openly the
people using that data need to know the

people using that data need to know the
 

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:02.120
people using that data need to know the
characteristics of the data so

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:02.130

that solves all the problems but I think

00:32:40.899 --> 00:32:40.909
that solves all the problems but I think
 

00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:42.039
that solves all the problems but I think
that that's coming we're actually

throughout the whole process ultimately
 

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:03.190
throughout the whole process ultimately
I believe that that's one of the most

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200
I believe that that's one of the most
 

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.200
I believe that that's one of the most
important things that we can do for the

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:05.210
important things that we can do for the
 

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:07.600
important things that we can do for the
researchers which is to develop

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:07.610
researchers which is to develop
 

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:11.409
researchers which is to develop
workflows and tools that like and data

00:33:11.409 --> 00:33:11.419
workflows and tools that like and data
 

00:33:11.419 --> 00:33:13.510
workflows and tools that like and data
up is is a good example of this that

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:13.520
up is is a good example of this that
 

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.539
up is is a good example of this that
assists them in capturing the metadata

00:33:16.539 --> 00:33:16.549
assists them in capturing the metadata
 

00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:18.340
assists them in capturing the metadata
so that we have the full metadata

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:18.350
so that we have the full metadata
 

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:20.620
so that we have the full metadata
because if the metadata is captured

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:20.630
because if the metadata is captured
 

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:22.390
because if the metadata is captured
while the data is being collected it

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:22.400
while the data is being collected it
 

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.610
while the data is being collected it
will be more complete it will be part of

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:24.620
will be more complete it will be part of
 

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.580
will be more complete it will be part of
part of their process and ultimately the

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:27.590
part of their process and ultimately the
 

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:29.860
part of their process and ultimately the
data will be much more useful so thank

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:29.870
data will be much more useful so thank
 

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:32.740

sharing and biomedicine we see these
 

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:38.210
sharing and biomedicine we see these
changes as liberating the data and they

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:38.220
changes as liberating the data and they
 

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.130

fascinating group of talks so as people

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:35.790
fascinating group of talks so as people
 

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:37.760
fascinating group of talks so as people
were speaking I jotted down some ideas

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:37.770
were speaking I jotted down some ideas
 

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:40.070
were speaking I jotted down some ideas
so I'll do my best to summarize these in

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:40.080
so I'll do my best to summarize these in
 

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.670
so I'll do my best to summarize these in
some coherent form at the first one that

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680
some coherent form at the first one that
 

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.140
some coherent form at the first one that
occurred to me is people were talking

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:45.150
occurred to me is people were talking
 

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.690
occurred to me is people were talking
and especially right after like we have

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:47.700
and especially right after like we have
 

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.100
and especially right after like we have
the privilege of being right after the

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:49.110
the privilege of being right after the
 

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:51.320
the privilege of being right after the
two keynote speakers and so this in some

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:51.330
two keynote speakers and so this in some
 

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:54.020
two keynote speakers and so this in some
sense can I think come into coming to

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:54.030
sense can I think come into coming to
 

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:56.420
sense can I think come into coming to
our discussion I think a lot of this

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:56.430
our discussion I think a lot of this
 

00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:58.550
our discussion I think a lot of this
discussion really implies questions

00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:58.560
discussion really implies questions
 

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.590
discussion really implies questions
about values and about free

00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:00.600
about values and about free
 

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.330
about values and about free
coming and so this is also from the

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:02.340
coming and so this is also from the
 

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.220
coming and so this is also from the
keynotes this morning particularly

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:04.230
keynotes this morning particularly
 

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:06.680
keynotes this morning particularly
issues on why we're sharing data and

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:06.690
issues on why we're sharing data and
 

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:09.440
issues on why we're sharing data and
many speakers have touched on utility

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:09.450
many speakers have touched on utility
 

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:12.410
many speakers have touched on utility
and use and downstream effects and so on

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:12.420
and use and downstream effects and so on
 

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:14.780
and use and downstream effects and so on
all of which I am in complete agreement

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:14.790
all of which I am in complete agreement
 

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:17.330
all of which I am in complete agreement
with but I think there is a larger

00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:17.340
with but I think there is a larger
 

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.670
with but I think there is a larger
question here about notions of

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680
question here about notions of
 

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.740
question here about notions of
reproducibility and validation of

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:21.750
reproducibility and validation of
 

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:23.660
reproducibility and validation of
results and verification and I think

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:23.670
results and verification and I think
 

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:25.780
results and verification and I think
this is really the core of why

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:25.790
this is really the core of why
 

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:28.010
this is really the core of why
scientists and researchers are

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:28.020
scientists and researchers are
 

00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:29.660
scientists and researchers are
interested in sharing their data at all

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:29.670
interested in sharing their data at all
 

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:31.130
interested in sharing their data at all
and this can't be forgotten in the

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.140
and this can't be forgotten in the
 

00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:34.340
and this can't be forgotten in the
discussion and if this becomes a

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:34.350
discussion and if this becomes a
 

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:37.550
discussion and if this becomes a
discussion of open data is a good and an

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:37.560
discussion of open data is a good and an
 

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.340
discussion of open data is a good and an
end in itself it becomes extremely broad

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:40.350
end in itself it becomes extremely broad
 

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:43.700
end in itself it becomes extremely broad
and I think this is something that at

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:43.710
and I think this is something that at
 

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:45.980
and I think this is something that at
least in my background as a researcher

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:45.990
least in my background as a researcher
 

00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:47.570
least in my background as a researcher
it's very difficult to wrap your mind

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:47.580
it's very difficult to wrap your mind
 

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:52.700
it's very difficult to wrap your mind
around what this means it also speaks to

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:52.710
around what this means it also speaks to
 

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:54.500
around what this means it also speaks to
this question of utility as well if we

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:54.510
this question of utility as well if we
 

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:56.600
this question of utility as well if we
think about reproducibility is a framing

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:56.610
think about reproducibility is a framing
 

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:59.690
think about reproducibility is a framing
issue it opens the door to things like

00:45:59.690 --> 00:45:59.700
issue it opens the door to things like
 

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.290
issue it opens the door to things like
well how are these data used in research

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:02.300
well how are these data used in research
 

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.940
well how are these data used in research
publications it makes sense now to have

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:04.950
publications it makes sense now to have
 

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:07.220
publications it makes sense now to have
this notion of linking to a research

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:07.230
this notion of linking to a research
 

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:09.980
this notion of linking to a research
paper and linking to specific results it

00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:09.990
paper and linking to specific results it
 

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:14.240
paper and linking to specific results it
also means that issues in terms of what

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:14.250
also means that issues in terms of what
 

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:15.830
also means that issues in terms of what
methods were used in the implementation

00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:15.840
methods were used in the implementation
 

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.960
methods were used in the implementation
and software and how are these data

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:17.970
and software and how are these data
 

00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:19.880
and software and how are these data
actually implemented or turned into

00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:19.890
actually implemented or turned into
 

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:22.070

scientific findings becomes part of the

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:22.080
scientific findings becomes part of the
 

00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.770
scientific findings becomes part of the
conversation as I think it should be how

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:24.780
conversation as I think it should be how
 

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:27.620
conversation as I think it should be how
have we managed to use this data and are

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:27.630
have we managed to use this data and are
 

00:46:27.630 --> 00:46:30.380
have we managed to use this data and are
those tools then available to be used to

00:46:30.380 --> 00:46:30.390
those tools then available to be used to
 

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:32.870
those tools then available to be used to
be inspected to validate existing

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880
be inspected to validate existing
 

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.910

results I think this is really a joint

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:34.920
results I think this is really a joint
 

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:39.080
results I think this is really a joint
conversation between not just data that

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:39.090
conversation between not just data that
 

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:42.080
conversation between not just data that
we that support published results but

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:42.090
we that support published results but
 

00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:43.850
we that support published results but
also in the software and the methods and

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:43.860
also in the software and the methods and
 

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:45.890
also in the software and the methods and
the code that was applied to the data to

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:45.900
the code that was applied to the data to
 

00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:47.780
the code that was applied to the data to
generate those same results so this is

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:47.790
generate those same results so this is
 

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:50.030
generate those same results so this is
thinking that comes from this framing of

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040
thinking that comes from this framing of
 

00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:55.010
thinking that comes from this framing of
reproducibility so it coming down from

00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:55.020
reproducibility so it coming down from
 

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.420
reproducibility so it coming down from
that sort of high level view a little

00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:56.430
that sort of high level view a little
 

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:58.400
that sort of high level view a little
bit and speaking more more closely to

00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:58.410
bit and speaking more more closely to
 

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:00.530
bit and speaking more more closely to
the discussion this morning I'm

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:00.540
the discussion this morning I'm
 

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:04.520
the discussion this morning I'm
interested in things like how libraries

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:04.530
interested in things like how libraries
 

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:06.500
interested in things like how libraries
and how the efforts that have been

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:06.510
and how the efforts that have been
 

00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:09.230
and how the efforts that have been
described here interact with existing

00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240
described here interact with existing
 

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.570

and we heard quite a

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:14.490
and we heard quite a
 

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:17.210
and we heard quite a
bit of discussion from George about how

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:17.220
bit of discussion from George about how
 

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.010
bit of discussion from George about how
this intersects with work that they're

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:19.020
this intersects with work that they're
 

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:22.430
this intersects with work that they're
doing in IPC sr this is something where

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440
doing in IPC sr this is something where
 

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.730
doing in IPC sr this is something where
a recurrent theme that occurred to me as

00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:25.740
a recurrent theme that occurred to me as
 

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:28.670
a recurrent theme that occurred to me as
people were speaking is who's really

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:28.680
people were speaking is who's really
 

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.170
people were speaking is who's really
responsible for what pieces of this

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:30.180
responsible for what pieces of this
 

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.550
responsible for what pieces of this
puzzle and how do they really come

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:31.560
puzzle and how do they really come
 

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:33.740
puzzle and how do they really come
together this is something that also

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:33.750
together this is something that also
 

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:35.270
together this is something that also

important many people this morning
 

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:15.260
important many people this morning
touched on issues of provenance and

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:15.270
touched on issues of provenance and
 

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:17.750

need a coherent discussion about values

00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480
need a coherent discussion about values
 

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:48.560
need a coherent discussion about values
and about framing to structure the way

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:48.570
and about framing to structure the way
 

00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:50.420
and about framing to structure the way
that we move forward all of these people

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:50.430
that we move forward all of these people
 

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:52.099
that we move forward all of these people
that I mentioning will be part of the

in and and where is the model for how
 

00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:01.330

all these different groups work together

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:01.340
 
 

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:04.700
 
where's the where do community members

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:04.710
where's the where do community members
 

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:06.380
where's the where do community members
give feedback into this so if I'm a

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:06.390
give feedback into this so if I'm a
 

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:09.170
give feedback into this so if I'm a
researcher and I'm using data that has

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:09.180
researcher and I'm using data that has
 

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:12.020
researcher and I'm using data that has
been carefully structured and annotated

00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:12.030
been carefully structured and annotated
 

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:15.260
been carefully structured and annotated
and so on how do I tell people that it

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:15.270
and so on how do I tell people that it
 

00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:16.820
and so on how do I tell people that it
didn't work is this something that goes

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:16.830
didn't work is this something that goes
 

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:19.190

through citation system this is

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200
through citation system this is
 

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:21.050
through citation system this is
certainly something that is important is

00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:21.060
certainly something that is important is
 

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:23.030

we've heard a number of times this
morning is the fact that you can use

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:25.740
morning is the fact that you can use
 

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:27.530
morning is the fact that you can use
data for

00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:27.540
data for
 

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:29.350
data for
research questions it was not originally

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:29.360
research questions it was not originally
 

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.550
research questions it was not originally
intended for it can be linked to other

00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:31.560
intended for it can be linked to other
 

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:34.520
intended for it can be linked to other
data and so things like field-based

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:34.530
data and so things like field-based
 

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:36.770
data and so things like field-based
standards and vocabularies and so on

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:36.780
standards and vocabularies and so on
 

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:38.120
standards and vocabularies and so on
that people have been talking about

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:38.130
that people have been talking about
 

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:39.680
that people have been talking about
which are absolutely essential and

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:39.690
which are absolutely essential and
 

00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:42.080
which are absolutely essential and
important there's no way they can extend

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:42.090
important there's no way they can extend
 

00:49:42.090 --> 00:49:43.880
important there's no way they can extend
to cover all these possible uses of the

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:43.890
to cover all these possible uses of the
 

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:45.980
to cover all these possible uses of the
data so how do you feed back in and how

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:45.990
data so how do you feed back in and how
 

00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:47.420
data so how do you feed back in and how
do people say well this was effective

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:47.430
do people say well this was effective
 

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:48.890
do people say well this was effective
this needs to be updated this was not

00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:48.900
this needs to be updated this was not
 

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:51.140
this needs to be updated this was not
clear at all that's also I think

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:51.150
clear at all that's also I think
 

00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:54.490
clear at all that's also I think
something that is part of the discussion

00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:54.500
something that is part of the discussion
 

00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:57.440
something that is part of the discussion
so I think I think my main point that I

00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:57.450
so I think I think my main point that I
 

00:49:57.450 --> 00:50:00.170
so I think I think my main point that I
want to make his respondent is not to

00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:00.180
want to make his respondent is not to
 

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:03.230
want to make his respondent is not to
get mired in the details but also to

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240
get mired in the details but also to
 

00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:05.870
get mired in the details but also to
have this higher level discussion that

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880
have this higher level discussion that
 

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.610
have this higher level discussion that
can help structure what is a very

00:50:07.610 --> 00:50:07.620
can help structure what is a very
 

00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:11.120
can help structure what is a very
complicated problem with many different

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:11.130
complicated problem with many different
 

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:12.890
complicated problem with many different
groups with many different backgrounds

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:12.900
groups with many different backgrounds
 

00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:17.650
groups with many different backgrounds
and framings on how this is to be solved

00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:17.660
and framings on how this is to be solved
 

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:21.050
and framings on how this is to be solved
what else the other point that I wanted

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:21.060
what else the other point that I wanted
 

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:26.290
what else the other point that I wanted
to make too is I see a parallel between

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:26.300
to make too is I see a parallel between
 

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:30.770
to make too is I see a parallel between
researcher involvement in data sharing

00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:30.780
researcher involvement in data sharing
 

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:36.560
researcher involvement in data sharing
and in open data to research or

00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:36.570
and in open data to research or
 

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:40.030
and in open data to research or
publication and what I mean by that is

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:40.040
publication and what I mean by that is
 

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:42.440
publication and what I mean by that is
many issues in the open access movement

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:42.450
many issues in the open access movement
 

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:45.380
many issues in the open access movement
and things that people have been upset

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:45.390
and things that people have been upset
 

00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:48.070
and things that people have been upset
about stem from the fact that

00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:48.080
about stem from the fact that
 

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.510
about stem from the fact that
researchers do sign their copyright over

researchers do sign their copyright over
 

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:52.400
researchers do sign their copyright over
to publishers and they willingly sign

particularly over the last few years but

particularly over the last few years but
 

00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:02.330

I also see particularly with all this

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:02.340
I also see particularly with all this
 

00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:04.670
I also see particularly with all this
hype and excitement about big data and

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680
hype and excitement about big data and
 

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.260
hype and excitement about big data and

you sign that say things like you're not

you sign that say things like you're not
going to share the data and this is

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240
going to share the data and this is
 

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:35.780
going to share the data and this is
something where if we do the same thing

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:35.790
something where if we do the same thing
 

00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:38.030
something where if we do the same thing
that we did is researchers when we're

00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.040
that we did is researchers when we're
 

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.740
that we did is researchers when we're
publishing our papers and we just

00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:39.750
publishing our papers and we just
 

00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:40.859
publishing our papers and we just
blindly sign

00:51:40.859 --> 00:51:40.869
blindly sign
 

00:51:40.869 --> 00:51:42.690

out-thinking and without pushing back on

00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:42.700
out-thinking and without pushing back on
 

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.789
out-thinking and without pushing back on
this will be in this same situation with

00:51:44.789 --> 00:51:44.799
this will be in this same situation with
 

00:51:44.799 --> 00:51:47.940
this will be in this same situation with
open access with open data and this is

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:47.950
open access with open data and this is
 

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:49.559
open access with open data and this is
something where we should know better

00:51:49.559 --> 00:51:49.569
something where we should know better
 

00:51:49.569 --> 00:51:52.559
something where we should know better
now with our experience with publication

00:51:52.559 --> 00:51:52.569
now with our experience with publication
 

00:51:52.569 --> 00:51:54.239
now with our experience with publication
and this also I think should be

00:51:54.239 --> 00:51:54.249
and this also I think should be
 

00:51:54.249 --> 00:51:55.769
and this also I think should be
something that's in our discussion and

00:51:55.769 --> 00:51:55.779
something that's in our discussion and
 

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:58.109
something that's in our discussion and
this is something that can come from

00:51:58.109 --> 00:51:58.119
this is something that can come from
 

00:51:58.119 --> 00:52:00.690
this is something that can come from
this framing around reproducibility so

00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:00.700
this framing around reproducibility so
 

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.970
this framing around reproducibility so
as a researcher enters into an agreement

00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:02.980
as a researcher enters into an agreement
 

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:04.529
as a researcher enters into an agreement
with industry which can be

00:52:04.529 --> 00:52:04.539
with industry which can be
 

00:52:04.539 --> 00:52:06.930
with industry which can be
extraordinarily productive one of the

00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:06.940
extraordinarily productive one of the
 

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:08.430
extraordinarily productive one of the
things that should be discussed at the

00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:08.440
things that should be discussed at the
 

00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:11.390
things that should be discussed at the
outset is how do I make this work

00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.400
outset is how do I make this work
 

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:13.499
outset is how do I make this work
reproducible now there are all these

00:52:13.499 --> 00:52:13.509
reproducible now there are all these
 

00:52:13.509 --> 00:52:18.059
reproducible now there are all these
issues that were highlighted in our

00:52:18.059 --> 00:52:18.069
issues that were highlighted in our
 

00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:20.039
issues that were highlighted in our
talks to do with confidentiality to do

00:52:20.039 --> 00:52:20.049
talks to do with confidentiality to do
 

00:52:20.049 --> 00:52:21.329
talks to do with confidentiality to do
with and these issues can be worked

00:52:21.329 --> 00:52:21.339
with and these issues can be worked
 

00:52:21.339 --> 00:52:23.970
with and these issues can be worked
around but we need to default to this

00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:23.980
around but we need to default to this
 

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:25.349
around but we need to default to this
notion that it's going to be

00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359
notion that it's going to be
 

00:52:25.359 --> 00:52:27.809
notion that it's going to be
reproducible work we are going to have

00:52:27.809 --> 00:52:27.819
reproducible work we are going to have
 

00:52:27.819 --> 00:52:29.609
reproducible work we are going to have
open data we're going to have open code

00:52:29.609 --> 00:52:29.619
open data we're going to have open code
 

00:52:29.619 --> 00:52:31.349
open data we're going to have open code
and methods around this work when it

00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359
and methods around this work when it
 

00:52:31.359 --> 00:52:34.380
and methods around this work when it
goes to publication and we can deal with

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:34.390
goes to publication and we can deal with
 

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:50.059
goes to publication and we can deal with
exceptions but the default is openness

00:52:50.059 --> 00:52:50.069
 
 

00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:53.489
 
sorry thank you so we have some time for

sorry thank you so we have some time for
questions comments if I could actually

00:52:56.970 --> 00:52:56.980
questions comments if I could actually
 

00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:59.749
questions comments if I could actually
just make a comment on Victoria's

00:52:59.749 --> 00:52:59.759
just make a comment on Victoria's
 

00:52:59.759 --> 00:53:02.339
just make a comment on Victoria's
response she mentioned then the need for

00:53:02.339 --> 00:53:02.349
response she mentioned then the need for
 

00:53:02.349 --> 00:53:06.059
response she mentioned then the need for
not only data being available uh from

00:53:06.059 --> 00:53:06.069
not only data being available uh from
 

00:53:06.069 --> 00:53:07.729
not only data being available uh from
scientific publications but also the

00:53:07.729 --> 00:53:07.739
scientific publications but also the
 

00:53:07.739 --> 00:53:10.829
scientific publications but also the
algorithms the statistics the you know

00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:10.839
algorithms the statistics the you know
 

00:53:10.839 --> 00:53:13.140

software that was used in the analysis

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:13.150
software that was used in the analysis
 

00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:14.989
software that was used in the analysis
and a particular paper for example and

00:53:14.989 --> 00:53:14.999
and a particular paper for example and
 

00:53:14.999 --> 00:53:18.120
and a particular paper for example and
didn't have time but we're doing a

00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:18.130
didn't have time but we're doing a
 

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:21.390
didn't have time but we're doing a
software catalogue planned as well in

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:21.400
software catalogue planned as well in
 

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:22.680
software catalogue planned as well in
addition to the data catalog and that's

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:22.690
addition to the data catalog and that's
 

00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:32.280
addition to the data catalog and that's

particular communities and I think
 

00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:34.590
particular communities and I think
that's important part and I kind of said

that's important part and I kind of said

that's important part and I kind of said
globally at the beginning that we're

filled with big data and there are some

other activities where the data really

other activities where the data really
do interoperate and it would be

do interoperate and it would be
 

00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:50.790
do interoperate and it would be
considered big data by pretty much

will need to be come together and so I

see bd2k as a major force in moving that

00:57:04.499 --> 00:57:04.509
see bd2k as a major force in moving that
 

00:57:04.509 --> 00:57:07.019
see bd2k as a major force in moving that
process forward and I also see the

00:57:07.019 --> 00:57:07.029
process forward and I also see the
 

00:57:07.029 --> 00:57:10.319

policy part of bd2k as not giving the

policy part of bd2k as not giving the

ultimate you know uber answer but really
moving that forward and the way to do

00:57:14.849 --> 00:57:14.859
moving that forward and the way to do
 

00:57:14.859 --> 00:57:16.890
moving that forward and the way to do
that I think is to develop data sharing

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:16.900
that I think is to develop data sharing

and to one way to do that of course is

00:57:21.749 --> 00:57:21.759
and to one way to do that of course is
 

00:57:21.759 --> 00:57:23.910
and to one way to do that of course is
to bring peer review into it so if a

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920
to bring peer review into it so if a
 

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:26.099
to bring peer review into it so if a
particular community is hesitant to

00:57:26.099 --> 00:57:26.109
particular community is hesitant to

particular community is hesitant to
share their data or there really isn't

share their data or there really isn't
 

00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:29.219
share their data or there really isn't
much of a reason to share their data

00:57:29.219 --> 00:57:29.229
much of a reason to share their data
 

00:57:29.229 --> 00:57:31.919
much of a reason to share their data
maybe that peer review process will be a

00:57:31.919 --> 00:57:31.929
maybe that peer review process will be a
 

00:57:31.929 --> 00:57:33.779
maybe that peer review process will be a
little gentler on them then if they're

00:57:33.789 --> 00:57:35.130
little gentler on them then if they're
coming from the community where it's

coming from the community where it's

00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359
data and they're saying they're not
 

00:57:37.359 --> 00:57:40.019
data and they're saying they're not
going to and I think at first blush you

00:57:40.019 --> 00:57:40.029
going to and I think at first blush you
 

00:57:40.029 --> 00:57:41.729
going to and I think at first blush you
might think well that's not fair but

00:57:41.729 --> 00:57:41.739
might think well that's not fair but
 

00:57:41.739 --> 00:57:43.380
might think well that's not fair but
humans are humans and you have to do

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:43.390
humans are humans and you have to do
 

00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:45.089
humans are humans and you have to do
things that work with human behavior and

00:57:45.089 --> 00:57:45.099
things that work with human behavior and
 

00:57:45.099 --> 00:57:48.079
things that work with human behavior and
I think this way we'll take those

00:57:48.079 --> 00:57:48.089
I think this way we'll take those
 

00:57:48.089 --> 00:57:50.219
I think this way we'll take those
communities we're sharing where they're

00:57:50.219 --> 00:57:50.229
communities we're sharing where they're
 

00:57:50.229 --> 00:57:51.839
communities we're sharing where they're
on the verge of wanting to share and

00:57:51.839 --> 00:57:51.849
on the verge of wanting to share and
 

00:57:51.849 --> 00:57:55.319
on the verge of wanting to share and
kind of push them over that barrier and

00:57:55.319 --> 00:57:55.329
kind of push them over that barrier and
 

00:57:55.329 --> 00:57:57.120
kind of push them over that barrier and
bring in these other communities as well

00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:57.130
bring in these other communities as well
 

00:57:57.130 --> 00:57:58.949
bring in these other communities as well

you persuade an individual researcher
who might be reluctant to share data one

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:12.790
who might be reluctant to share data one
 

01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:15.030

question we hear over and over again is

01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:15.040
question we hear over and over again is
 

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.370
question we hear over and over again is
which data am I supposed to share and so

01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:17.380
which data am I supposed to share and so

research often start with what's the

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:21.970
research often start with what's the
 

01:00:21.970 --> 01:00:24.000
research often start with what's the
publication date based on and this then

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:24.010
publication date based on and this then
 

01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:26.010
publication date based on and this then
touches on the ideas that Victoria

01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:26.020
touches on the ideas that Victoria
 

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:27.510
touches on the ideas that Victoria
highlighted about reproducibility and

01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520
highlighted about reproducibility and
 

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:31.099
highlighted about reproducibility and
they understand that they've shared

01:00:31.099 --> 01:00:31.109
they understand that they've shared
 

01:00:31.109 --> 01:00:33.359
they understand that they've shared
representations of their data in figures

01:00:33.359 --> 01:00:33.369
representations of their data in figures
 

01:00:33.369 --> 01:00:35.670
representations of their data in figures
so it's not a huge step to move from

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680
so it's not a huge step to move from
 

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.260
so it's not a huge step to move from
sharing the figure to the data that

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:37.270
sharing the figure to the data that
 

01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:39.059
sharing the figure to the data that
we're used to create it so that's often

01:00:39.059 --> 01:00:39.069
we're used to create it so that's often
 

01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:42.510
we're used to create it so that's often
kind of a door opener for us and and to

kind of a door opener for us and and to

the other point about universities

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:45.190
the other point about universities

the other point about universities
rather aggressive interests in

rather aggressive interests in
 

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:49.410
rather aggressive interests in
intellectual property yeah we encounter

01:00:49.410 --> 01:00:49.420

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:51.030
intellectual property yeah we encounter
that it's especially problematic for

something that all i can say is yes we

01:00:59.760 --> 01:00:59.770
something that all i can say is yes we
 

01:00:59.770 --> 01:01:02.400
something that all i can say is yes we
struggle with that so i just wanted to

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:02.410
struggle with that so i just wanted to
 

01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:04.440
struggle with that so i just wanted to
make one point actually following on

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:04.450
make one point actually following on
 

01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:05.640
make one point actually following on
gail's point the most compelling

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:05.650
gail's point the most compelling
 

01:01:05.650 --> 01:01:07.410
gail's point the most compelling
argument that i found is this notion of

01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:07.420
argument that i found is this notion of
 

01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:08.910
argument that i found is this notion of
reproducibility i don't think there's

01:01:08.910 --> 01:01:08.920
reproducibility i don't think there's
 

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.740
reproducibility i don't think there's
any scientist who wants to produce non

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:10.750
any scientist who wants to produce non
 

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:12.539
any scientist who wants to produce non
reproducible work and that's something

01:01:12.539 --> 01:01:12.549
reproducible work and that's something
 

01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:15.030
reproducible work and that's something
that is highly concerning to them i have

this was also broadly reflected in the

and this hat this does happen with data

and our standards absolutely should be

01:01:33.039 --> 01:01:33.049
and our standards absolutely should be
 

01:01:33.049 --> 01:01:35.950
and our standards absolutely should be
better but but you can pick up citations

01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:35.960
better but but you can pick up citations
 

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.200
better but but you can pick up citations
it's not that you put your data set out

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:38.210
it's not that you put your data set out
 

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:39.609
it's not that you put your data set out
there you'll immediately get scooped on

01:01:39.609 --> 01:01:39.619
there you'll immediately get scooped on
 

01:01:39.619 --> 01:01:41.470
there you'll immediately get scooped on
your next paper you usually get a few

01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:41.480
your next paper you usually get a few
 

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.779
your next paper you usually get a few
weird citations and so on from people

01:01:43.779 --> 01:01:43.789
weird citations and so on from people
 

01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:45.130
weird citations and so on from people
who have found but uses for your data

01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:45.140
who have found but uses for your data
 

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:48.849
who have found but uses for your data
you didn't expect and then arguments

01:01:48.849 --> 01:01:48.859
you didn't expect and then arguments
 

01:01:48.859 --> 01:01:51.339
you didn't expect and then arguments
like this is good for science or this is

01:01:51.339 --> 01:01:51.349
like this is good for science or this is
 

01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:53.109
like this is good for science or this is
something that will help people and so

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119
something that will help people and so
 

01:01:53.119 --> 01:01:55.270
something that will help people and so
on tend to fall flat this is something

01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:55.280
on tend to fall flat this is something
 

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.250
on tend to fall flat this is something
that the researcher really needs to see

01:01:57.250 --> 01:01:57.260
that the researcher really needs to see
 

01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:58.720
that the researcher really needs to see
the direct benefit that they're going to

01:01:58.720 --> 01:01:58.730
the direct benefit that they're going to
 

01:01:58.730 --> 01:02:01.029
the direct benefit that they're going to
they're going to have from this they may

01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:01.039
they're going to have from this they may
 

01:02:01.039 --> 01:02:02.680
they're going to have from this they may
agree with all this other stuff but you

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:02.690
agree with all this other stuff but you
 

01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:04.510
agree with all this other stuff but you
know everyone's under an enormous amount

01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:04.520
know everyone's under an enormous amount
 

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.010
know everyone's under an enormous amount
of pressure just even keep their jobs

01:02:06.010 --> 01:02:06.020
of pressure just even keep their jobs
 

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.750
of pressure just even keep their jobs
and so on so we have to be respectful of

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760
and so on so we have to be respectful of
 

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.140
and so on so we have to be respectful of
that I think with regard to IP issues

01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:11.150
that I think with regard to IP issues
 

01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:13.240
that I think with regard to IP issues
this is a very serious problem at the

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:13.250
this is a very serious problem at the
 

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:15.730
this is a very serious problem at the
institutional level and traditionally

01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:15.740

tech transfer offices have been

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:17.150
tech transfer offices have been
 

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:20.559
tech transfer offices have been
concerned with patents particularly in

01:02:20.559 --> 01:02:20.569
concerned with patents particularly in
 

01:02:20.569 --> 01:02:23.170
concerned with patents particularly in
biotech and the notion the stems back

01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:23.180
biotech and the notion the stems back
 

01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:25.510
biotech and the notion the stems back
from Vidal in 1980 and the notion was

01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520
from Vidal in 1980 and the notion was
 

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:28.260
from Vidal in 1980 and the notion was
this is actually a means for enabling

01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:28.270
this is actually a means for enabling
 

01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:31.089
this is actually a means for enabling
transparency that the notion was there

01:02:31.089 --> 01:02:31.099
transparency that the notion was there
 

01:02:31.099 --> 01:02:32.740
transparency that the notion was there
was all sorts of technology locked up

01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:32.750
was all sorts of technology locked up
 

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:34.809
was all sorts of technology locked up
there and if we only gave universities

01:02:34.809 --> 01:02:34.819
there and if we only gave universities
 

01:02:34.819 --> 01:02:36.670
there and if we only gave universities
institutions rights over this for

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:36.680
institutions rights over this for
 

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.890
institutions rights over this for
example patent rights and so on then

01:02:38.890 --> 01:02:38.900
example patent rights and so on then
 

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:40.089
example patent rights and so on then
this could be much more transparent

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:40.099
this could be much more transparent
 

01:02:40.099 --> 01:02:41.589
this could be much more transparent
because we would have to disclose it

01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599
because we would have to disclose it
 

01:02:41.599 --> 01:02:43.089
because we would have to disclose it
through the patent process so this is

01:02:43.089 --> 01:02:43.099
through the patent process so this is
 

01:02:43.099 --> 01:02:46.359
through the patent process so this is
becoming a problem now because as we're

01:02:46.359 --> 01:02:46.369
becoming a problem now because as we're
 

01:02:46.369 --> 01:02:49.299
becoming a problem now because as we're
sharing code and software as part of

01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:49.309
sharing code and software as part of
 

01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:52.329
sharing code and software as part of
being reproducible researchers and now

01:02:52.329 --> 01:02:52.339
being reproducible researchers and now
 

01:02:52.339 --> 01:02:53.980
being reproducible researchers and now
we come into conflict with a tech

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:53.990
we come into conflict with a tech
 

01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:55.450
we come into conflict with a tech
transfer office who says well maybe you

01:02:55.450 --> 01:02:55.460
transfer office who says well maybe you
 

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:57.809
transfer office who says well maybe you
shouldn't be opening that quite so

01:02:57.809 --> 01:02:57.819
shouldn't be opening that quite so
 

01:02:57.819 --> 01:03:00.789
shouldn't be opening that quite so
widely because it's patentable perhaps

01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799
widely because it's patentable perhaps
 

01:03:00.799 --> 01:03:03.069
widely because it's patentable perhaps
and so that is something where I think

01:03:03.069 --> 01:03:03.079
and so that is something where I think
 

01:03:03.079 --> 01:03:04.720
and so that is something where I think
we just need to take a very strong

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:04.730
we just need to take a very strong
 

01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:07.660
we just need to take a very strong
stance that if transparency is what

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:07.670
stance that if transparency is what
 

01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:09.250
stance that if transparency is what
we're about then that's what we're about

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:09.260
we're about then that's what we're about
 

01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:11.829
we're about then that's what we're about
as scientists if it's money making for

01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839
as scientists if it's money making for
 

01:03:11.839 --> 01:03:13.390
as scientists if it's money making for
institutions this is a different

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:13.400
institutions this is a different
 

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.039
institutions this is a different
discussion and I think that's something

01:03:15.039 --> 01:03:15.049
discussion and I think that's something
 

01:03:15.049 --> 01:03:17.319
discussion and I think that's something
where you know in 1983 we didn't have

01:03:17.319 --> 01:03:17.329
where you know in 1983 we didn't have
 

01:03:17.329 --> 01:03:19.359
where you know in 1983 we didn't have
computational methods and legislators

01:03:19.359 --> 01:03:19.369
computational methods and legislators
 

01:03:19.369 --> 01:03:20.380
computational methods and legislators
certainly weren't thinking about

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:20.390
certainly weren't thinking about
 

01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:22.210
certainly weren't thinking about
software patentability in these issues

01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:22.220
software patentability in these issues
 

01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:24.370
software patentability in these issues
but right now in my experience with a

01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:24.380
but right now in my experience with a
 

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:26.049
but right now in my experience with a
number of institutions the tech transfer

01:03:26.049 --> 01:03:26.059
number of institutions the tech transfer
 

01:03:26.059 --> 01:03:28.269
number of institutions the tech transfer
offices are feeling out this issue and I

01:03:28.269 --> 01:03:28.279
offices are feeling out this issue and I
 

01:03:28.279 --> 01:03:29.559
offices are feeling out this issue and I
don't think they've come to any

01:03:29.559 --> 01:03:29.569
don't think they've come to any
 

01:03:29.569 --> 01:03:31.170
don't think they've come to any

resolutions on it and I think this is a

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:33.320
resolutions on it and I think this is a
 

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.200
resolutions on it and I think this is a
good time to have this discussion in

01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:35.210
good time to have this discussion in
 

01:03:35.210 --> 01:03:36.490
good time to have this discussion in
this debate and it's not just about

01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:36.500
this debate and it's not just about
 

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.830
this debate and it's not just about
patent it's also about copyright and

01:03:38.830 --> 01:03:38.840
patent it's also about copyright and
 

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.930
patent it's also about copyright and
ownership in software and these are

01:03:40.930 --> 01:03:40.940
ownership in software and these are
 

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:42.700
ownership in software and these are
things where we need to be very clear

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:42.710
things where we need to be very clear
 

01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:44.200
things where we need to be very clear
that what we're supporting here is

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:44.210
that what we're supporting here is
 

01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:46.870
that what we're supporting here is
reproducible research thank you i want

01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880
reproducible research thank you i want
 

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.300
reproducible research thank you i want
to make sure we get here from a wide

to make sure we get here from a wide

NYU libraries and this question is

01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:58.240
NYU libraries and this question is
 

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:03.430
NYU libraries and this question is
primarily for Michael because I was

01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:03.440
primarily for Michael because I was

primarily for Michael because I was
interested in your use case about you

01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:05.870
interested in your use case about you
 

01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:07.570
interested in your use case about you
know a researcher who's about to submit

01:04:07.570 --> 01:04:07.580
know a researcher who's about to submit
 

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:10.680
know a researcher who's about to submit
a paper who then also submits their data

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:10.690
a paper who then also submits their data
 

01:04:10.690 --> 01:04:14.110
a paper who then also submits their data
because if the data is valuable in and

01:04:14.110 --> 01:04:14.120
because if the data is valuable in and
 

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.720
because if the data is valuable in and
of itself then what happens if the paper

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:16.730
of itself then what happens if the paper
 

01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:19.480
of itself then what happens if the paper
isn't published right so first of all

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:19.490
isn't published right so first of all
 

01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:20.830
isn't published right so first of all
they're not submitting your data there's

01:04:20.830 --> 01:04:20.840
they're not submitting your data there's
 

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.240
they're not submitting your data there's
submitting information about the data

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:22.250
submitting information about the data
 

01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:25.450
submitting information about the data
set so it's a separate process that it

01:04:25.450 --> 01:04:25.460
set so it's a separate process that it
 

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:27.940
set so it's a separate process that it
makes the barrier lower the idea with

01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:27.950
makes the barrier lower the idea with
 

01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:31.960
makes the barrier lower the idea with
that is and they're different we've had

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:31.970
that is and they're different we've had
 

01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:33.280
that is and they're different we've had
different discussions about how this

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:33.290
different discussions about how this
 

01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:35.560
different discussions about how this
might be done one could imagine that

01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:35.570
might be done one could imagine that
 

01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:40.870
might be done one could imagine that
this would be done once the so there are

01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880
this would be done once the so there are
 

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.840
this would be done once the so there are
a couple of things and I think a lot of

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:43.850
a couple of things and I think a lot of
 

01:04:43.850 --> 01:04:45.370
a couple of things and I think a lot of
this has do the fact that it was a kind

01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:45.380
this has do the fact that it was a kind
 

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:47.620
this has do the fact that it was a kind
of a short and time scale here so

01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:47.630
of a short and time scale here so
 

01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:49.270
of a short and time scale here so
there's a lot of depth to this there's a

01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:49.280
there's a lot of depth to this there's a
 

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.970
there's a lot of depth to this there's a
possible we've also discussed allowing

01:04:51.970 --> 01:04:51.980
possible we've also discussed allowing
 

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:54.040
possible we've also discussed allowing
people to submit information about data

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:54.050
people to submit information about data
 

01:04:54.050 --> 01:04:57.310
people to submit information about data
sets that are never published in a

01:04:57.310 --> 01:04:57.320
sets that are never published in a
 

01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.350
sets that are never published in a
scientific paper or form the basis there

01:04:59.350 --> 01:04:59.360
scientific paper or form the basis there
 

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.200
scientific paper or form the basis there
and so so in that case it wouldn't be

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:02.210
and so so in that case it wouldn't be
 

01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:03.940
and so so in that case it wouldn't be
particularly problematic I think that

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:03.950
particularly problematic I think that
 

01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:05.710
particularly problematic I think that
might be the easiest way to to address

01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:05.720
might be the easiest way to to address
 

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:09.250
might be the easiest way to to address
the question but our focus really is on

01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:09.260
the question but our focus really is on
 

01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:11.710
the question but our focus really is on
the scientific literature published by

01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:11.720
the scientific literature published by
 

01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:14.170
the scientific literature published by
NIH funded researchers that sort of

01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:14.180
NIH funded researchers that sort of
 

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:18.299
NIH funded researchers that sort of
initial focus

01:05:18.299 --> 01:05:18.309
 
 

01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:19.799
 
the other panelists would like to

the other panelists would like to
 

01:05:19.809 --> 01:05:23.309
the other panelists would like to
respond to that I believe there was a

respond to that I believe there was a
 

01:05:23.319 --> 01:05:29.819
respond to that I believe there was a
question back there Mike roster from

I'll direct this towards Michael you
talk about you're creating a catalog of

01:05:36.539 --> 01:05:36.549
talk about you're creating a catalog of
 

01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:38.370
talk about you're creating a catalog of
information about data sets where does

01:05:38.370 --> 01:05:38.380
information about data sets where does
 

01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:40.890
information about data sets where does
the NIH expect the data sets to be so

01:05:40.890 --> 01:05:40.900
the NIH expect the data sets to be so
 

01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:44.370
the NIH expect the data sets to be so
that's that's a separate issue and it

01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:44.380
that's that's a separate issue and it
 

01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:47.549
that's that's a separate issue and it
will depend on for example the data

01:05:47.549 --> 01:05:47.559
will depend on for example the data
 

01:05:47.559 --> 01:05:50.549
will depend on for example the data
sharing plan if again if the expectation

01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:50.559
sharing plan if again if the expectation
 

01:05:50.559 --> 01:05:52.199
sharing plan if again if the expectation
is that the person will submit the data

01:05:52.199 --> 01:05:52.209
is that the person will submit the data
 

01:05:52.209 --> 01:05:55.309
is that the person will submit the data
to GenBank that's where the data will be

01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319
to GenBank that's where the data will be
 

01:05:55.319 --> 01:05:58.799
to GenBank that's where the data will be
right now we have actually put together

01:05:58.799 --> 01:05:58.809
right now we have actually put together
 

01:05:58.809 --> 01:06:02.789
right now we have actually put together
some 45 website a portal that you can

01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799
some 45 website a portal that you can
 

01:06:02.799 --> 01:06:04.709
some 45 website a portal that you can
actually access i don't have the URL I'm

01:06:04.709 --> 01:06:04.719

afraid a 45 large data repositories

01:06:09.079 --> 01:06:09.089
afraid a 45 large data repositories
 

01:06:09.089 --> 01:06:13.009
afraid a 45 large data repositories
supported by NIH that accept data and

01:06:13.009 --> 01:06:13.019
supported by NIH that accept data and
 

01:06:13.019 --> 01:06:16.439
supported by NIH that accept data and
that provide data to people upon request

01:06:16.439 --> 01:06:16.449
that provide data to people upon request
 

01:06:16.449 --> 01:06:19.229
that provide data to people upon request
and we would be using that kind of thing

01:06:19.229 --> 01:06:19.239
and we would be using that kind of thing
 

01:06:19.239 --> 01:06:21.299
and we would be using that kind of thing
to encourage people to submit their data

01:06:21.299 --> 01:06:21.309
to encourage people to submit their data
 

01:06:21.309 --> 01:06:23.999
to encourage people to submit their data
to large repositories in all in if

01:06:23.999 --> 01:06:24.009
to large repositories in all in if
 

01:06:24.009 --> 01:06:25.499
to large repositories in all in if
that's not going to be the case in all

01:06:25.499 --> 01:06:25.509
that's not going to be the case in all
 

01:06:25.509 --> 01:06:28.259
that's not going to be the case in all
cases you could imagine somebody

01:06:28.259 --> 01:06:28.269
cases you could imagine somebody
 

01:06:28.269 --> 01:06:31.109
cases you could imagine somebody
generating a small data set that is not

01:06:31.109 --> 01:06:31.119
generating a small data set that is not
 

01:06:31.119 --> 01:06:33.929
generating a small data set that is not
there's no repository that exists for it

01:06:33.929 --> 01:06:33.939
there's no repository that exists for it
 

01:06:33.939 --> 01:06:36.029
there's no repository that exists for it
in that case if the data are available

01:06:36.029 --> 01:06:36.039
in that case if the data are available
 

01:06:36.039 --> 01:06:37.829
in that case if the data are available
for sharing they might say send me an

01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839
for sharing they might say send me an
 

01:06:37.839 --> 01:06:40.859
for sharing they might say send me an
email now this gets back to my point

01:06:40.859 --> 01:06:40.869
email now this gets back to my point
 

01:06:40.869 --> 01:06:44.009
email now this gets back to my point
about this whole thing being first steps

01:06:44.009 --> 01:06:44.019
about this whole thing being first steps
 

01:06:44.019 --> 01:06:46.019
about this whole thing being first steps
so that's the ultimate answer would be

01:06:46.019 --> 01:06:46.029
so that's the ultimate answer would be
 

01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:48.539
so that's the ultimate answer would be
you know data what all data would have a

01:06:48.539 --> 01:06:48.549
you know data what all data would have a
 

01:06:48.549 --> 01:06:52.079
you know data what all data would have a
home and and we're not there yet but the

01:06:52.079 --> 01:06:52.089
home and and we're not there yet but the
 

01:06:52.089 --> 01:06:54.120
home and and we're not there yet but the
idea here is working toward that and I

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:54.130
idea here is working toward that and I
 

01:06:54.130 --> 01:06:59.160
idea here is working toward that and I
think that as as this paradigm starts to

01:06:59.160 --> 01:06:59.170
think that as as this paradigm starts to
 

01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:01.650
think that as as this paradigm starts to
change a little people will see the need

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:01.660
change a little people will see the need
 

01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:03.390
change a little people will see the need
or not see the need for having

01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:03.400
or not see the need for having
 

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:06.169
or not see the need for having
repositories for certain kinds of data

01:07:06.169 --> 01:07:06.179
repositories for certain kinds of data
 

01:07:06.179 --> 01:07:08.849
repositories for certain kinds of data
so the answer is they won't reside in

01:07:08.849 --> 01:07:08.859
so the answer is they won't reside in
 

01:07:08.859 --> 01:07:11.039
so the answer is they won't reside in
any particular place but you will know

01:07:11.039 --> 01:07:11.049
any particular place but you will know
 

01:07:11.049 --> 01:07:15.719
any particular place but you will know
where it does reside hello my name is

01:07:15.719 --> 01:07:15.729
where it does reside hello my name is
 

01:07:15.729 --> 01:07:18.769
where it does reside hello my name is

say a patent is a much better

01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880
say a patent is a much better

publication than what we normally

publication than what we normally
publish and it's expensive to do that's

01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:47.460
publish and it's expensive to do that's
 

01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:50.900
publish and it's expensive to do that's
the problem the other thing is this what

they generate a benefit and therefore

01:08:12.049 --> 01:08:12.059
they generate a benefit and therefore
 

01:08:12.059 --> 01:08:14.749
they generate a benefit and therefore
generate a benefit for the originator of

generate a benefit for the originator of
the data there's a lot of talking how

01:08:18.079 --> 01:08:18.089
the data there's a lot of talking how
 

01:08:18.089 --> 01:08:20.809
the data there's a lot of talking how
expensive it is but no talk on how

me let me address your first question so
that that's right so patents and

01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040
that that's right so patents and
 

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.039
that that's right so patents and
copyright are in the Constitution and

I think you might be misled about patent

I think you might be misled about patent

heard anyone say that they think a

heard anyone say that they think a

heard anyone say that they think a
patent is a better scientific

01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759
patent is a better scientific
 

01:09:11.759 --> 01:09:13.640
patent is a better scientific
publication than a publication and I'm

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:13.650
publication than a publication and I'm
 

01:09:13.650 --> 01:09:15.589
publication than a publication and I'm
presuming what you mean is perhaps it's

01:09:15.589 --> 01:09:15.599
presuming what you mean is perhaps it's
 

01:09:15.599 --> 01:09:17.629
presuming what you mean is perhaps it's
more clear I'm not a hundred percent

01:09:17.629 --> 01:09:17.639
more clear I'm not a hundred percent
 

01:09:17.639 --> 01:09:20.629

data gets cited more I mean it's she's

01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239
data gets cited more I mean it's she's
 

01:12:12.239 --> 01:12:15.709
data gets cited more I mean it's she's
shown that to be true and so it's a

01:12:15.709 --> 01:12:15.719
shown that to be true and so it's a
 

01:12:15.719 --> 01:12:19.280
shown that to be true and so it's a
direct benefit to folks that share so I

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:19.290
direct benefit to folks that share so I
 

01:12:19.290 --> 01:12:21.050
direct benefit to folks that share so I
mean I'm looking forward to hearing more

I do think there's other other aspects
to what we're getting at and that would

that is responsibility not just to other
scientists but to the public to the
