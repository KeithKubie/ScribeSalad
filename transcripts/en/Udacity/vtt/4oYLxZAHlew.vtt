00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.860
&gt;&gt; So, we talked about needing a text editor.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.230
Which one, give any preferences? Which one should we use?

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.650
&gt;&gt; I personally use Sublime. I mean, there's,

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.380
there's lots of good choices out there but.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.030
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.070
&gt;&gt; Sublime is what I use.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.100
&gt;&gt; So, and is that available in Windows, Mac, both?

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.030
&gt;&gt; It's on both, yeah.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.170
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.290
&gt;&gt; So I think I actually use Sublime two.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.970
&gt;&gt; Sublime two, okay.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.978
&gt;&gt; This is, this is a slightly older version so.

00:00:20.978 --> 00:00:23.192
&gt;&gt; Okay cool, so I'm going to download for OS X, and I

00:00:23.192 --> 00:00:27.010
mentioned that if I had a Windows machine I would get something similar.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.160
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.860
&gt;&gt; And we will let that do it's thing.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.260
Alright, so we just downloaded it and I am going to

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.200
search for it now, for some reason it didn't open

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.850
automatically. And I am going to drag it over to applications.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.520
And now we're in Applications and if she scroll

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.550
down, we've got Sublime. So let's open it up.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.790
&gt;&gt; Oop, there it is.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.470
&gt;&gt; Fine, that's it? We're ready to start going?

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.150
&gt;&gt; We're ready.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.820
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.
