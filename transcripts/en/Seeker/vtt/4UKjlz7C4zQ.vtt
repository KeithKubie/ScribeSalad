00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.790
Alcohol and energy drinks are a match made
in HELL!

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:13.160
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and if you’re
someone over the age of 21, who frequents

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.270
dance clubs - then chances are, you’ve probably
combined alcohol and energy drinks at least

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.270
once in your life.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:20.270
It makes sense, right?

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.750
You’re tired, and you have no energy - but
you still wanna party.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.510
Well, stop doing that - cause according to
science, it’s bad for your health.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.590
The rate of emergency rooms visits involving
energy drinks has doubled between 2007 and

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.739
2011, prompting the FDA to ban most pre-mixed
alcoholic energy drinks.

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.319
Unfortunately, that ban doesn’t extend to
bars - who still happily serve customers all

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:43.960
kinds of alcoholic energy drink concoctions.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.139
A 2012 study found that people who combine
energy drinks with alcohol were 600% more

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:55.569
likely to suffer from heart palpitations,
and 400% more likely to suffer from tremors,

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:59.769
irritability, and insomnia - than people who
drink alcohol alone.

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.320
But heart problems aren’t the only side
effect of doing this.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.420
There are also psychological effects that
explain why this combination is so bad for

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.420
your body.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.770
Numerous studies have shown that mixing energy
drinks and alcohol not only increases your

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.560
likelihood of being in an accident, it also
impairs your judgment in two key ways: by

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.060
making you think you’re less drunk than
you actually are, and by making you crave

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.560
alcohol more strongly.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.220
A series of experiments published in 2012,
found that people who consumed alcoholic energy

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.359
drinks rated their own intoxication as being
lower - than people who had identical blood

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:35.680
alcohol levels, but with no energy drinks.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.490
Other studies have also shown that people
who have alcoholic energy drinks, tend to

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.640
consume more alcohol and drink for longer
- partly because the caffeine buzz, which

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.460
can last for up to 6 hours - eliminates those
feelings of tiredness that usually cause someone

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.729
to stop drinking.

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.270
Even sodas, which contain significantly less
caffeine than energy drinks - have been shown

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.359
to heighten intoxication.

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:01.409
And in fact, diet sodas - will get you drunk
even faster, because there’s no sucrose

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.090
there to slow down the gastric emptying of
alcohol.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.019
So the next time you’re at the club and
decide you need to perk up - just don’t.

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.780
The added energy just isn’t worth it.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.200
What are you thoughts on this?

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.920
Do you frequently mix energy drinks with alcohol?
and how does doing so, make you feel?

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.480
