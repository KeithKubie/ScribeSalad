1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,350
The Joe Rogan experience. So I mean, yeah,

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:09,530
I'm with you in that I am
ridiculously optimistic.

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,980
Oh that's good. I think that
I think people, I mean I'm,

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,600
I follow Steven Pinker's logic of that.

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:20,930
People will sort of look at the horrible
things that we have today and say,

6
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:24,630
God, this world is terrible. Now.
There are definitely terrible aspects,

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,590
but this is without doubt the greatest
time ever to be alive that we've ever

8
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:31,710
seen, at least in recorded human
history. I would agree with that.

9
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:34,290
I think communication
is a giant part of that.

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:34,841
It is.

11
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:39,730
This is this global a world which we
thought was going to be beautiful thing.

12
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:41,860
And then people said, oh no,
it's a hellish thing. In fact,

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,790
it's got beautiful aspects and some
hellish aspects as any invention has.

14
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:50,320
You know, like Internet, hey, you can
teach someone how to save their life on,

15
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,050
on the Internet. Ah, you can also teach
online and make a bomb on the incident,

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,500
you know? So I think this is always
there. Every next step we get,

17
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,090
we will have some positives.

18
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:01,420
Then we'll hit all the negatives and
then we'll go back to small positive.

19
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:06,160
So yeah, I've, I've got to be able to miss
it. Yeah. Well I am an optimistic person.

20
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:10,180
I otherwise it just wouldn't be here.
But this military aspect that I mentioned,

21
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:13,750
I'm flipping back to that. But yeah,
I do try and think I need to do this.

22
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,450
I think that's a good thing to do. Now.
I need to do that. If a 10, nine years,

23
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,610
I've been saying I'm going to politics,
so I'm going next year,

24
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,070
but it might not be a general election.
I try and plan ahead because I can't,

25
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,710
I can't if I randomized it,

26
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,130
like just float because a lot of people
do find out this happened and then that

27
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:30,040
happened. And then I was like, and
that could be a wonderful life,

28
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:33,580
but I have my river analogy. If
you're canoeing down the river, um,

29
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,610
if you go at the same speed as the river,
they could throw you under rocks.

30
00:01:36,611 --> 00:01:38,860
He could give you a wonderful ride.
It could be anything,

31
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,500
but it's up to the river.
Whereas I pedal like crazy.

32
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,030
Sometimes I back pedal like crazy.

33
00:01:43,031 --> 00:01:46,080
I have actively backpedaled
against things and,

34
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,870
and sometimes usually I'm peddling faster
than the speed of the river to try and

35
00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:54,190
guide myself through. You see that
whenever do these canoeing. Um,

36
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,560
well anyone driving a boat through
the river and when I looked look

37
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,380
at human interactions objectively,

38
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:05,440
part of me has to consider that there's
a possibility that we need all this

39
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:10,781
negative in order to reinforce the
positive that there is some component of

40
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:16,370
human life that desires or,

41
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,600
or relies upon negative
things to reinforce positive
things that this yin and

42
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:26,600
Yang that we, we exist
under that, this, this,

43
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,760
that we see the horrors of war and
horrific poverty and all these terrible

44
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:33,350
things in the horrible violence.

45
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,620
We see this and it actually serves to
reinforce our desire for positive things

46
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:43,630
and reinforce and push our society in
a more positive direction. I mean, I'm,

47
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,020
I almost think that this is when we see
national tragedies and shootings and all

48
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:50,720
these different, terrible,
terrible things, there's,

49
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,690
there's all this fear and
anger and frustration,

50
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:58,040
but there's also action and the action
might meet new might think there's a lack

51
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:02,530
of action by politicians are a lack of
action by the police or a lack of action

52
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:03,230
by,
you know,

53
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:08,230
whoever we think should be responsible
for mitigating these horrible situations

54
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:13,120
that happen. But publicly, the, the,
the, the social fabric of the world,

55
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:15,010
the way people communicate and interact,

56
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,610
I think it reinforces our
desire to not have that happen.

57
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,820
It reinforces our understanding
of peace and our love of peace.

58
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,260
And I think that these,
these bad things that we see in our world,

59
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:32,920
they're almost propel us towards a
better world because human beings are

60
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,490
constantly striving for
improvement and innovation.

61
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,840
This is one of the things that we do.

62
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:40,780
We want things to be better and
bigger and faster and stronger.

63
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:44,080
And we want our society to be better at
all times. We never say this is good.

64
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:48,080
Let's keep it just the way it is.
We never, we never say that. So my,

65
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,180
my thought is that even this, even what
we were experiencing in this country,

66
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:52,600
we like,

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,320
it seems at times that were almost like
on the brink of civil war between the

68
00:03:56,321 --> 00:04:00,220
right and the left and people align
on both sides and conflating people's

69
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:03,880
opinions and changing people's
perspectives in order to
suit their own narrative

70
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,050
that I think that this ultimately all
this [inaudible] you see it from the

71
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:10,900
outside and you look at and go,
what the fuck are we doing?

72
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,310
I think it's a natural part of the
way human beings figure out life.

73
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,330
I shall respond to, sure. Yeah. I,

74
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,900
I think, I think almost the same as you.
I would not take it slightly differently.

75
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:31,590
I've noticed that humanity only sometimes
gets going and does things when he's

76
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:35,160
right up against the wall. You know,
somebody that needs these things to go on.

77
00:04:35,161 --> 00:04:36,540
If you took a wellbore to scenario.

78
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,860
We went right to the wire on that and
then suddenly we came back and maybe not

79
00:04:40,861 --> 00:04:45,480
even, it wasn't even the political
will on that. It was just actually,

80
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,660
if the Japanese haven't bombed
Pearl Harbor, we wouldn't you guys,

81
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:53,240
we wouldn't have had you guys
in us with us for a DNA to, yes,

82
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,460
all that. All the, the,
the forces and the,

83
00:04:56,461 --> 00:05:00,990
the money and the almond and the tanks
and the shermans coming in. You know,

84
00:05:00,991 --> 00:05:05,220
we needed that coming in and without
the Russian people we wouldn't have won

85
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,740
world war two and that was,
and they were in this agreement.

86
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,840
So I can't quite work out humanity. I do
think positive. I do think the negatives,

87
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:16,350
you can appreciate the positives more.
I do think one thing on, on the Brexit,

88
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:17,910
Brexit hate thing that's been going on,

89
00:05:17,911 --> 00:05:19,470
there's a lot of young people
are coming on and saying, well,

90
00:05:19,471 --> 00:05:20,670
so we're going to lose all this stuff.

91
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,000
The ability we could travel to to
Europe without visas. We can work there,

92
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:25,790
we could retire there,
we can get a healthcare.

93
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,640
They're all costs you and that's going
to tell you we cut off and we are roaming

94
00:05:29,641 --> 00:05:34,520
charges are going to go out with the old
that people are valuing what they, uh,

95
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,180
they could lose a lot more.
So yeah, the Yin and Yang,

96
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:43,170
the you can, I think, I think
it's gonna go on this way.

97
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:45,510
And also some people once,
once we get to a good place,

98
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,280
I've noticed that a lot
of people will say, okay,

99
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:49,530
I'm not going to be
politically active anymore.

100
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,410
I'm just going to carry on doing my life
and getting other people can sort of

101
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:55,530
things that I've noticed that people
will get activated to get to a result.

102
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,060
Maybe an election result, something
or a referendum or whatever it is.

103
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,000
And then they'll, they will just
back off. They get frustrated,

104
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,890
they get faster or they just
think, well, that's done.

105
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:06,770
That's bagged and in a positive way maybe.
And just say,

106
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:08,960
but now I'm not even gonna pay
attention to what's going on,

107
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,110
but things will start
rolling backwards. So, um,

108
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,240
I think we're going to
keep having it like that.

109
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,980
Maybe the but the percentage of
positive things to negative things.

110
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:22,610
It's never changed over all the years.
Over the last 10,000 years.

111
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,760
It's just there's more people in the
world doing more positive things and doing

112
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,780
well and negative things.

113
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,540
Maybe humanity hasn't changed cause
I brain sizes haven't changed.

114
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,700
Even back to the cavemen days,
you know,

115
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:33,620
even back for the last
hundred thousand years,

116
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,990
the size of our brains is not moved.
So we,

117
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,630
if you went back to
seven 70,000 years ago,

118
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,870
we would still be able to
have conversations like
this even though we wouldn't

119
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:44,510
have the radios and things.
It'd be more on our tribe.

120
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,390
I think I'll try B is better than you
are trying to say. Actually Steve,

121
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:49,100
I don't know if our tribe
is better than that tribe.

122
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:51,620
I just think liberals are similar than
some good people that drive in this same

123
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:52,550
shit as in that drive.

124
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,310
We need to maybe trade with them
or we can go to war with them,

125
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:57,410
but then we could die
lot and Shelly could die.

126
00:06:57,411 --> 00:07:00,530
And Kenny and Roger and number 22,
you know,

127
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,410
because those conversations were
happening in this slightly different way I

128
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:08,330
think all the way back. And it wasn't
all just bring me food. You Nice,

129
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:12,980
good three fight. It wasn't that, it was
maybe, you know, millions of years ago,

130
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:15,620
but not 700,000 years ago.

131
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:17,960
And we only started speaking
a hundred thousand years ago.

132
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,790
What we've developed since
then, I'm fascinated by us
as human beings because we,

133
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,120
we, uh, we were just another
animal and now we are,

134
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,930
we are kind of amazing animal.
We've fermented beautifully.

135
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:32,030
We landed on the bloody moon.
You guys landed on the moon,

136
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:35,890
which I as a child thought that we
landed on the moon, but in fact you guys,

137
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,930
I did them, but they, they Apollo
11, they kept it quite open.

138
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,290
I think Michael Collins in the command
module. So this is for the world.

139
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:46,850
And there was this kind of feeling. And
Neil Armstrong is, it's a nice, yeah,

140
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,660
I grabbed hold of that as a kid. I was
growing up, you know, but younger than me.

141
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,980
But it's pretty weird thing to think that
we went from not being able to talk to

142
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:59,000
space travel in a hundred thousand years.
I mean, that's what they think, right?

143
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:02,960
They think that people didn't have real
language. 100,000 folks be two genetic.

144
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,370
Um, I think it's about a hundred thousand
years ago. That's when it came to,

145
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,590
and the first words we said was,
let's go to the moon in 100,000.

146
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,730
What's your name? Jack
Kennedy. Okay. Jack. Good idea.

147
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:15,050
But let's put it on the
back burner for the moment.

148
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,600
What do you think happened
that turned us into this?

149
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,360
Do you ever stop and think about that?
Well,

150
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,610
I don't think it's a bloke
upstairs floating in the
clouds because they used to

151
00:08:22,611 --> 00:08:24,600
live in the clouds and then we flew
through the clouds and no one ever had

152
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:29,570
mentioned, hey, he's not in the cloud.
So I, it's a randomized thing, you know,

153
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:33,140
I think these random like dinosaurs
hundred and 65 million years of those

154
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:36,890
bastards, right? And all
they did was eight, uh,

155
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,930
kill eight cold pool and, and
have sex. That's all they did.

156
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,090
Those four things for 165 million years,

157
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:47,930
we've had 300 years since
the enlightenment of human
rights and democracy and

158
00:08:47,931 --> 00:08:50,960
stuff like that. If we, if we say
the Great Greeks did a great thing,

159
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:53,960
but it really is lost, we're going to do
is they had 165 million years of that.

160
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:57,120
But why did they come along when we
had all these creatures in the sea and

161
00:08:57,121 --> 00:09:00,300
suddenly huge ones, something
happened, something twisted,

162
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,230
randomizing thing. It's,
I, I, we, we, I know.

163
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,200
Maybe we'll never know,

164
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,560
but it has happened and I just don't
think a bloke did it upstairs with a big

165
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:11,011
beard.
He said,

166
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:16,011
now is the time that you speak and now
you make handbags and now fight wars with

167
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,670
the MG 42 bow. Now, you know,

168
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,733
I just,

169
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,060
I just think it happened and we need
to roll with it and try and make humans

170
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,530
work on this planet, because then
we're going to be going a mile soon.

171
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,110
And you can just say it the future,
if we got it going on Mars at some,

172
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:37,620
but the margins, because we want to vote,
we've got our own Martian government.

173
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:42,280
You sure you earthlings, you know, they're
going to treat us the same way. Yeah.

174
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:45,300
Ricans treat the British. Yeah. And
then the has come back and attack us.

175
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,200
The [inaudible] you could just see
that in some sort of, you know,

176
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:52,670
how did you turn the light? Sure. Yeah.
Definitely happy. You know, and I,

177
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,870
so I, I, I despair about
humanity and I, and I,

178
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,650
and I, I celebrate humanity. Yeah.
