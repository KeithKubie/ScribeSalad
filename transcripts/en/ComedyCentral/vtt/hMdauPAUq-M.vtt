Welcome to<i> The Nightly Show.</i>

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:19.085
I am Larry Wilmore
as they are saying.

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:20.820
(laughter)

00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:22.321
Yes, man.

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:23.556
So... Whew!

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.058
After the exhausting drama

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:26.759
of the Republican
and Democratic conventions,

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:28.394
<i> The Nightly Show</i> went on break
last week,

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:31.264
and so, it seems,
did Donald Trump's goddamn mind.

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:33.499
(laughter)

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:36.335
Right? Man.

00:00:36.368 --> 00:00:39.605
I mean, the man packed
so much crazy into one week

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:42.075
that our show tonight
will be four hours. Um...

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:44.077
(laughter, whooping)

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.746
Someone tell Hardwick
we're going long, baby!

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:47.914
(laughter)

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:49.449
So let's get started.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:50.783
Time for the Unblackening.

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:52.285
♪ ♪

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:56.022
(screaming)

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:58.591
(both screaming)

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:01.294
(Trump screaming)

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:02.862
All right there.
That's a nice...

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:05.465
-The nice compact version of
that is very nice. -(laughter)

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:07.600
So Trump started his week
by criticizing

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:09.535
the Muslim family
of a U.S. war hero.

00:01:09.568 --> 00:01:11.537
He then doubled down
on his insults.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.475
And he then KFC
doubled down on his insults.

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:16.709
(laughter)

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.712
Seriously, guys, eating KFC
With a knife and fork is no way

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:21.814
to honor
a fallen American colonel.

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:23.616
-(laughter)
-I said it.

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.852
I said it. I said it, okay?

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:27.653
(applause and cheering)

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:29.655
Yeah. Thank you.

00:01:29.688 --> 00:01:32.291
And... and as if offensive
comments and petty tweets

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:33.659
about the Khan family

00:01:33.692 --> 00:01:35.661
didn't show enough disrespect
for our military,

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:36.896
just look
what happened on Tuesday

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.065
when he got this fun new gadget.

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:41.200
During a rally
in Virginia yesterday,

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:43.369
Trump said that he was handed
a Purple Heart

00:01:43.402 --> 00:01:46.339
from a retired officer
who supported him.

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:49.509
I said, man, that's like...
that's like big stuff.

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:52.578
I always wanted
to get the Purple Heart.

00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:54.580
This was much easier.

00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:57.517
(audience groaning)

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.219
"This was much easier"?

00:02:00.252 --> 00:02:02.555
Donald, a Purple Heart is
the highest honor bestowed

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:05.591
to those are who were wounded or
killed when serving our country.

00:02:05.624 --> 00:02:09.061
It isn't some toy prize you get
in a McDonald's happy meal.

00:02:09.094 --> 00:02:10.696
(laughter)

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.899
Nor... nor is it
the literal purple heart

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:15.434
of beloved McDonald's character
Grimace.

00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:17.436
-(laughter, applause)
-Right?

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.806
(groaning)

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.943
Still, after stealing
this Purple Heart,

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:27.079
the GOP's Hamburglar went after
one of our nation's

00:02:27.112 --> 00:02:30.016
most famous
Purple Heart recipients.

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.552
You know, never been
a big fan of John McCain,

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:36.522
and, uh, I just hate the way
our veterans have been treated

00:02:36.555 --> 00:02:39.025
by John and other people.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:41.527
Okay. (sighs)

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.598
He thinks "five and a half years
a POW" John McCain...

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:47.600
is the person disrespecting
veterans right now.

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:48.634
You know what?

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:51.470
(stammering):
That... I...

00:02:51.503 --> 00:02:53.439
(laughter)

00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:56.909
-(woman whoops)
-I've run out of words

00:02:56.942 --> 00:03:00.613
to call this fool an idiot
or to call this idiot a fool.

00:03:00.646 --> 00:03:01.981
I... I can't...

00:03:02.014 --> 00:03:03.316
You know, here you go.

Uh, by the way, guys, thank you

And I wonder
if you can help me out.

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:32.011
Um, I've just run out of words.

00:03:32.044 --> 00:03:34.513
-No problem, Larry. We got this.

00:03:34.546 --> 00:03:37.650
It is with honor that we bestow

-Paul Ryan.

00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:19.358
And while I'm at it...

00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:22.962
I hold in the highest esteem...

00:04:22.995 --> 00:04:25.064
Senator John McCain.

(mumbling inaudibly)

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:51.824
I'll tell you guys,
it's hard to tell

00:04:51.857 --> 00:04:54.427
when he seems the most crazy--
when he's reading from a script

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.996
or when he goes off of it,
right?

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:00.866
Here he is, expertly displaying
his non-grasp of foreign policy

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:03.502
and geography

00:05:03.535 --> 00:05:05.905 line:0%

-You could...

-Sorry.
-(applause, whooping)

I don't know.

00:05:36.668 --> 00:05:37.869
That's right. But you could.

00:05:37.903 --> 00:05:40.740
You could stay at a Days Inn
and induce it from the pictures

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:43.709
in a<i> USA Today. </i>
Come on! Come on!

00:05:43.742 --> 00:05:45.878
All right, guys, so after
an historically awful week,

00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:48.147
Donald Trump has dropped
precipitously in the polls,

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.649
and his media surrogates
have a lot to explain.

00:05:50.682 --> 00:05:53.786
But they always manage to avoid
actually explaining anything.

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:56.255 line:0%
This is not what we should be
talking about right now, Victor.

00:05:56.288 --> 00:05:57.723 line:0%
We should be talking
about Hillary Clinton.

00:05:57.756 --> 00:06:00.760 line:0%
The issue is not Mr. Khan
and, uh, Donald Trump.

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:04.130 line:0%
The issue really is, uh,
you know, radical jiham...

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:06.298 line:0%
radical Islamic jihad...

00:06:06.331 --> 00:06:08.734
Do<i> you</i> believe
this election could be rigged?

00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:10.503
I think what he's talking about

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:14.407
is the very unfair media
coverage that Republicans get.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.975
See how they did that?

00:06:16.008 --> 00:06:17.810
-(laughter)
-This is what happens

00:06:17.843 --> 00:06:19.845
when you drink
the Trump Kool-Aid-- it...

00:06:19.878 --> 00:06:20.813
-(laughter)
-No. It's true.

00:06:20.846 --> 00:06:22.481
It's like if
you're in the position

00:06:22.514 --> 00:06:24.917
of having to defend
Jeffrey Dahmer, right?

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.253
It's, like, "Okay, did Jeffrey
Dahmer eat those people?"

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:29.855
"You're asking me
if it's fair to judge people

00:06:29.888 --> 00:06:33.259
-"based on an<i> eating</i> disorder?
-(laughter)

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:35.828
I don't think you want me
to answer that."

00:06:35.861 --> 00:06:37.797
(exhales)

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.866
In other words,
Trump surrogates, your candidate

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:43.035
is a cannibal and
should not be in charge

00:06:43.068 --> 00:06:45.171
of running the country,
all right?

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:47.940 line:0%
So, to help us unpack this is
Trump's chief media strategist

00:06:47.973 --> 00:06:50.543 line:0%
and on-air communications
coordinator, Stephanie Spencer.

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:54.046 line:0%
(cheers and applause)

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:57.883
Okay, all right, so, Stephanie,

00:06:57.916 --> 00:06:59.652
let me ask you
a very direct question.

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:02.655
Why isn't Trump better informed
on foreign policy?

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:07.326 line:0%
If what you're asking me is why
the Clinton-Obama foreign policy

00:07:07.359 --> 00:07:10.396 line:0%
is so horrible,
I think the American people

00:07:10.429 --> 00:07:11.864 line:0%
want an answer to that, as well.

00:07:11.897 --> 00:07:12.798
Okay, no, no, no, no.

00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:14.300
Okay, see, no, no, no.

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:15.468
See, you just did it.

00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:17.069
See, that wasn't
what I was asking.

00:07:17.102 --> 00:07:18.871
You-you just changed
the question.

00:07:18.904 --> 00:07:19.972
I'm not gonna let you
get away with this.

00:07:20.005 --> 00:07:21.240
Just answer this
simple question:

00:07:21.273 --> 00:07:25.411
why isn't Trump better informed
on foreign policy?

00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:28.914
Just so we're on the same page,
your question to me is...

00:07:28.947 --> 00:07:30.182
Go ahead.

00:07:30.215 --> 00:07:31.317
-Why...
-Yes.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.551
-isn't...
-Yes.

00:07:32.584 --> 00:07:33.886
crooked Hillary Clinton

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:36.856
answering questions
about her e-mails?

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:38.591
I agree with Bernie Sanders.

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:40.826
We need to know more
about her damn e-mails.

00:07:40.859 --> 00:07:43.496
No, you didn't hear that right.

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:45.731
I think you just refuse
to answer anything...

00:07:45.764 --> 00:07:46.832
November!

00:07:46.865 --> 00:07:48.834
(laughter)

00:07:48.867 --> 00:07:50.669
November? What?

00:07:50.702 --> 00:07:52.404
Well, you just asked,
when will Donald Trump

00:07:52.437 --> 00:07:54.540
win this election
in a historic landslide?

00:07:54.573 --> 00:07:55.741
I didn't just ask that!

00:07:55.774 --> 00:07:56.775
I never said tha...

00:07:56.808 --> 00:07:57.877
that's not even close
to what I said!

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.178
I completely agree, Larry!

00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:00.446
We're on the same page.

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:02.681
What happened in Benghazi
was a tragedy,

00:08:02.714 --> 00:08:04.683
and Hillary Clinton still
has not answered for it.

00:08:04.716 --> 00:08:05.718
I never said that.

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:07.887
This is so frustrating.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.288
Oh, no...
let me try this.

00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:11.857
Your candidate is such
an enormously undisciplined

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:16.629
(bleep) show, that you can't
even engage in simple, human,

00:08:16.662 --> 00:08:20.032
back-and-forth communication
because to do so would probably

00:08:20.065 --> 00:08:22.735
lead to you having to admit
that there is absolutely

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:25.104
no reason anyone should vote
for Donald Trump.

00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:26.438
100%!

00:08:26.471 --> 00:08:30.142
I'm glad we're seeing eye to eye
on this, Larry.

00:08:30.175 --> 00:08:33.412
Wait, you actually agree
with me?

00:08:33.445 --> 00:08:38.884
Yes, just like you said,
Donald Trump is the only

00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:43.155
candidate in-in this race who
will make America great again!

00:08:43.188 --> 00:08:45.124
-I never said that.
-January!

00:08:45.157 --> 00:08:46.892
Stop it!

00:08:46.925 --> 00:08:47.927
Stephanie Spencer, everyone.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.928
We'll be right back.

00:08:48.961 --> 00:08:50.827
You can't answer a question!
