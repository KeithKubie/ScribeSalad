00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:10.010
A warm cozy fire is a mesmerizing activity
whether it's in a fireplace or at a campground,

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.030
but seriously…

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:21.500
Watching fire might actually be GOOD 
for you.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.779
The burning of a yule log is a tradition in
some European countries around Christmastime

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.150
-- in the States we just pull it up online
-- campfires are great for the summertime

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.230
and a great way to hold me closer is get a
tiny dancing candle-flame…

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.329
Stories of when ancient man first harnessed
fire come off as even more important than

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.940
inventing the wheel!

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.030
And now a study published in Evolutionary
Psychology hypothesizes humans EVOLVED BENEFITS

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.470
by sitting around a fire.

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.899
Fire is tied to warmth, light, protection,
food and power.

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.780
In the ancient world fire could help keep
you alive, but also provide some form of beauty

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.120
and contemplation.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.320
Researchers from the University of Alabama
asked 226 adults to watch a VIDEO of a fireplace,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.630
and report on their experiences.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.090
They used a video of a crackling fire (with
sound) and on average blood pressure decreased

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.090
five percent!

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.140
The longer the participants watched, the lower
their blood pressure.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.540
The REASON is tough to test, but evolutionary
psychologists believe it might have to do

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.100
with social behavior.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.510
Archeologists have determined Homo erectus
was the first human to use fire -- and that

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.369
was nearly two million years ago.

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.560
From an evolutionary perspective, ancient
humans who spent time around fire would be

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.640
protected and warm, but they could also cook
food.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.280
The cooking of food set us apart from the
primates, and allowed a larger brain to develop.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.009
Cooking lowers the caloric requirements for
digestion, decreases risk of foodborne illness,

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.020
increases food preservation and so on…

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.740
But what about the not obvious things, for
example, a fire is the earliest example of

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.290
humans using artificial light to extend their
day!

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.729
Anthropologists point out, once darkness sets
in, most daywalkers go to sleep, letting the

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.810
nocturnal creatures take over the land.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.040
But with fire, homo erectus and her offspring
could stay up late, fashioning tools, socially

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.650
bonding, and facilitating their own betterment!

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.019
On top of that, psychologists began to think
about how fire affected REM sleep!

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.090
Apes and monkeys only spend as much as 15
percent of the night in REM, whereas modern

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.629
humans are around 25 percent.

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.680
Having a fire nearby meant for uninterrupted
sleep, as it warded off predators and let

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.760
homo erectus get a better napus.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.430
That allowed ancient man to cement their long-term
memories, have vivid dreams and create procedural

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.430
memories.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.079
Those long-term memories meant better learning
and comprehension, so tools could be manufactured

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.110
or complex plans could be hatched.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.280
We banded together around fires and it was
a place of safety.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.159
Over time, humans probably evolved a kinship
with fire and a tie to home and safety!

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:09.670
This would explain the deep-seated feeling
of calm when we hear, see and feel a fire.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.469
The sound and the smell, the warmth and the
light were a big part of helping shepherd

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:14.960
us into modernity!

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.819
Admittedly, this is a lot of scientific guesswork.

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.310
We can't go back in time and observe our own
ancient ancestors, so they're using information

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.609
gleaned from psychology, archeology, and the
theories of evolution -- but it does SEEM

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:28.999
to fit.

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:29.999
What do you think?

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:30.999
Do you hate campfires?

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:45.939
Does the smoke always follow you around too?
