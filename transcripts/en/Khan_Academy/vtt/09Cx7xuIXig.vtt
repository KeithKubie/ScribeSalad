00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.770
The owner of a restaurant
wants to find out more about

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.020
where his patrons
are coming from.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.140
One day, he decided
to gather data

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:10.650
about the distance
in miles that people

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.930
commuted to get
to his restaurant.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.750
People reported the
following distances traveled.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.940
So here are all the
distances traveled.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.250
He wants to create
a graph that helps

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.170
him understand the
spread of the distances--

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.210
this is a key word--
the spread of distances

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.520
and the median distance
that people traveled

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.570
or that people travel.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.700
What kind of graph
should he create?

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.542
So the answer of what kind
of graph he should create,

00:00:39.542 --> 00:00:41.500
that might be a little
bit more straightforward

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.440
than the actual creation of the
graph, which we will also do.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.670
But he's trying to visualize
the spread of information.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.360
And at the same time,
he wants the median.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.950
So what a graph captures
both of that information?

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.090
Well, a box and whisker plot.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.520
So let's actually try to
draw a box and whisker plot.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.980
And to do that, we need to
come up with the median.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.880
And we'll also see the median
of the two halves of the data

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.380
as well.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.796
And whenever we're trying to
take the median of something,

00:01:09.796 --> 00:01:11.680
it's really helpful
to order our data.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.220
So let's start off by
attempting to order our data.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.940
So what is the
smallest number here?

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.760
Well, let's see.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.650
There's one 2.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.240
So let me mark it off.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.560
And then we have another two.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.250
So we've got all the 2's.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.180
And then we have this 3.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.430
Then we have this 3.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.230
I think we've got all the 3's.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.890
Then we have that 4.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.690
Then we have this 4.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.090
Do we have any 5's?

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.590
No.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.350
Do we have any 6's?

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.850
Yep.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.490
We have that 6.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.670
And that looks like the only 6.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.291
Any 7's?

00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:49.790
Yep.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.790
We have this 7 right over here.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.460
And I just realized
that I missed this 1.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.070
So let me put the 1 at
the beginning of our set.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.494
So I got that 1
right over there.

00:01:58.494 --> 00:01:59.660
Actually, there was two 1's.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.576
I missed both of them.

00:02:00.576 --> 00:02:04.340
So both of those 1's
are right over there.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.260
So I have the 1's,
2's, 3's, 4's, no 5's.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.789
This is one 6.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.039
There was one 7.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.230
There's one 8 right over here.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.090
And then, let's see, any 9's?

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.920
No 9's.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.560
Any 10s?

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.060
Yep.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.660
There's a 10.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.700
Any 11s?

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.010
We have an 11 right over there.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.060
Any 12s?

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.620
Nope.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.210
13, 14?

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.660
Then we have a 15.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.830
And then we have a
20 and then a 22.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.230
So we've ordered all our data.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.360
Now it should be relatively
straightforward to find

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.162
the middle of our
data, the median.

00:02:41.162 --> 00:02:42.620
So how many data
points do we have?

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.402
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:51.860
So the middle number
is going to be

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.940
a number that has 8
numbers larger than it

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.520
and 8 numbers smaller than it.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.520
So let's think about it.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.470
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.090
So the number 6 here is
larger than 8 of the values.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.990
And if I did the
calculations right,

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.230
it should be smaller
than 8 of the values.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.020
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.390
So it is, indeed, the median.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.340
Now, when we're trying to
construct a box and whisker

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.530
plot, the convention is,
OK, we have our median.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.230
And it's essentially dividing
our data into two sets.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.560
Now, let's take the median
of each of those sets.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.810
And the convention is to
take our median out and have

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.240
the sets that are left over.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.520
Sometimes people leave it in.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.910
But the standard convention,
take this median out.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.450
And now, look
separately at this set

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.700
and look separately at this set.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.680
So if we look at this first
bottom half of our numbers

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.060
essentially, what's the
median of these numbers?

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.530
Well, we have 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8 data points.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.000
So we're actually going to
have two middle numbers.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.725
So the two middle numbers
are this 2 and this 3,

00:04:00.725 --> 00:04:02.460
three numbers less
than these two,

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.785
three numbers greater than it.

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.410
And so when we're
looking for a median,

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.580
you have two middle numbers.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.260
We take the mean of
these two numbers.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.910
So halfway in between
two and three is 2.5.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.720
Or you can say 2 plus 3
is 5 divided by 2 is 2.5.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.440
So here we have a median
of this bottom half of 2.5.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.160
And then the middle
of the top half,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.970
once again, we
have 8 data points.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.030
So our middle two
numbers are going

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.550
to be this 11 and this 14.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.940
And so if we want to take the
mean of these two numbers,

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.730
11 plus 14 is 25.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.610
Halfway in between
the two is 12.5.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.300
So 12.5 is exactly
halfway between 11 and 14.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.480
And now, we've figured
out all of the information

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.620
we need to actually
plot or actually

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.000
create or actually draw
our box and whisker plot.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.080
So let me draw a number line,
so my best attempt at a number

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.900
line.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.280
So that's my number line.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.930
And let's say that this
right over here is a 0.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.610
I need to make sure I get all
the way up to 22 or beyond 22.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.150
So let's say that's 0.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.190
Let's say this is 5.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.240
This is 10.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.060
That could be 15.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.080
And that could be 20.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.460
This could be 25.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.650
We could keep
going-- 30, maybe 35.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.630
So the first thing we might
want to think about-- there's

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.070
several ways to draw it.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.280
We want to think about
the box part of the box

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.260
and whisker
essentially represents

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.150
the middle half of our data.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.720
So it's essentially trying to
represent this data right over

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.660
here, so the data between the
medians of the two halves.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.720
So this is a part
that we would attempt

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.360
to represent with the box.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.070
So we would start right
over here at this 2.5.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.244
This is essentially
separating the first quartile

00:06:02.244 --> 00:06:04.660
from the second quartile, the
first quarter of our numbers

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.580
from the second
quarter of our numbers.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.913
So let's put it right over here.

00:06:07.913 --> 00:06:10.260
So this is 2.5.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.710
2.5 is halfway between 0 and 5.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.100
So that's 2.5.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.390
And then up here, we have 12.5.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.650
And 12.5 is right
over-- let's see.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.580
This is 10.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.490
So this right over here would be
halfway between, well, halfway

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.890
between 10 and 15 is 12.5.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:32.640
So let me do this.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.720
So this is 12.5 right over here.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.110
So that separates
the third quartile

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.460
from the fourth quartile.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.530
And then our boxes,
everything in between,

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.696
so this is literally the
middle half of our numbers.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.110
And we'd want to show
where the actual median is.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:51.735
And that was actually
one of the things

00:06:51.735 --> 00:06:54.064
we wanted to be able
to think about when

00:06:54.064 --> 00:06:55.480
the owner of the
restaurant wanted

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.420
to think about how far
people are traveling from.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.130
So the median is 6.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.800
So we can plot it
right over here.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.880
So this right here is about six.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.120
Let me do that same pink color.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.620
So this right over here is 6.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.700
And then the whiskers of
the box and whisker plot

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.480
essentially show us
the range of our data.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.412
And I can do this in a different
color that I haven't used yet.

00:07:21.412 --> 00:07:22.370
I'll do this in orange.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.036
So essentially, if
we want to see, look,

00:07:24.036 --> 00:07:25.640
the numbers go all
the way up to 22.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.265
So they go all the
way up to-- so let's

00:07:27.265 --> 00:07:29.520
say that this is
22 right over here.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.850
Our numbers go all
the way up to 22.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.490
And they go as low as 1.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.950
So 1 is right about here.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:43.840
Let me label that.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.040
So that's 1.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.586
And they go as low as 1.

00:07:47.586 --> 00:07:48.460
So there you have it.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.150
We have our box
and whisker plot.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.150
And you can see if you
have a plot like this,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.610
just visually, you
can immediately

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.110
see, OK, what is the median?

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.502
It's the middle of
the box, essentially.

00:07:57.502 --> 00:07:58.710
It shows you the middle half.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.293
So it shows you how
far they're spread

00:08:00.293 --> 00:08:02.450
or where the meat
of the spread is.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.320
And then it shows, well, beyond
that, we have the range that

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:10.020
goes well beyond that or how
far the total spread of our data

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:10.520
is.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.790
So this gives a pretty good
sense of both the median

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:17.056
and the spread of our data.
