time in a creativity spaces is ensuring
 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.469
time in a creativity spaces is ensuring
that our designers have they've got the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479
that our designers have they've got the
 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.090

you look at that design of the iTouches
iPhones iPods and it's just the best

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369

of where design wins out over

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750
of where design wins out over
 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.620
of where design wins out over
functionality and it delivers to now you

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630
functionality and it delivers to now you
 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.450
functionality and it delivers to now you
know you gotta make sure it does both

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460
know you gotta make sure it does both
 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.090

but really consumer choice and even

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100
but really consumer choice and even
 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.310
but really consumer choice and even
paying a premium is a lot of cases down

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320
paying a premium is a lot of cases down
 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.510
paying a premium is a lot of cases down
to the design so creativity is very very

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
to the design so creativity is very very
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.270
to the design so creativity is very very
critical in that space
