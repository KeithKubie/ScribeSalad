00:00:00.624 --> 00:00:02.453
- [Voiceover] Preaching to the Choir

00:00:02.453 --> 00:00:04.810
the Health Benefits of Singing.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.906
This is going to be interesting.

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:07.065
I like to sing.

00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:08.324
All right.

00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:10.133
So in 2013, and just a reminder,

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.733
when they put these
numbers in brackets here

00:00:12.733 --> 00:00:15.578
they're numbering the
sentences in this paragraph.

00:00:15.578 --> 00:00:17.183
That's different than
when they put the numbers

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.340
in these gray boxes,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.067
that's when they're going to
refer to actual questions.

00:00:20.067 --> 00:00:22.018
And in general when they start putting,

00:00:22.018 --> 00:00:23.928
they don't do these for
all of the sentences

00:00:23.928 --> 00:00:25.065
in these passages,

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:26.369
but when they do do these,

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.096
they tend to do them for the sentences

00:00:28.096 --> 00:00:29.538
in a paragraph,

00:00:29.538 --> 00:00:31.286
and they'll probably ask
us some question about

00:00:31.286 --> 00:00:33.540
whether a sentence is
appropriate in a certain place,

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.349
or should it have been
moved around somehow,

00:00:35.349 --> 00:00:37.299
so let's put ourselves
in that frame of mind,

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:38.722
especially for this first paragraph

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:40.936
that ends with this kind of question one.

00:00:40.936 --> 00:00:42.276
So question one is probably going to refer

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:45.995
to the sentence structure
order in this paragraph,

00:00:45.995 --> 00:00:47.661
so let's read it.

00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:52.090
In 2013, 32.5 million
adults in the United States,

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.181
roughly ten percent of the population,

00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:57.552
sang in choirs, and England
is home to more than

00:00:57.552 --> 00:01:00.620
3000 active choral groups.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.860
All right, a lot of people
in the United States

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.014
and England sing in choirs.

00:01:04.014 --> 00:01:07.488
Choir singing is a popular pastime.

00:01:07.488 --> 00:01:09.884
Well they've already
established that choir,

00:01:09.884 --> 00:01:11.815
I mean, this data right
here is kind of telling us

00:01:11.815 --> 00:01:13.766
that choir singing is a popular pastime,

00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:16.243
I almost feel like this
sentence should maybe go

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:18.960
before the, you know, choir
singing is a popular pastime

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.551
and then you give the evidence.

00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:23.559
In 2013, 32.5 million
adults in the United States,

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:25.143
roughly ten percent of the population,

00:01:25.143 --> 00:01:27.093
sang in choirs, and England
is home to more than

00:01:27.093 --> 00:01:29.755
3000 active choral groups.

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:31.279
Makes sense to me that sentence two

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:32.883
should actually go first.

00:01:32.883 --> 00:01:35.034
These singers often
report an increased sense

00:01:35.034 --> 00:01:37.902
of well-being and comaradarie,

00:01:37.902 --> 00:01:42.514
but does this hobby actually
result in better health?

00:01:42.514 --> 00:01:44.931
According to multiple
scientific studies, singing -

00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:48.305
especially with others -
provides concrete benefits

00:01:48.305 --> 00:01:50.154
to the heart and brain,

00:01:50.154 --> 00:01:52.734
which I happen to believe, as well.

00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:55.232
So let's see, I'm
guessing, not even looking,

00:01:55.232 --> 00:01:57.873
I'm voiding looking at this just yet,

00:01:57.873 --> 00:02:00.474
that they're gonna ask
us about sentence two,

00:02:00.474 --> 00:02:02.546
because it feels like it has to go first.

00:02:02.546 --> 00:02:04.294
To make the paragraph most logical,

00:02:04.294 --> 00:02:06.528
sentence two, I was
right, and I'm serious,

00:02:06.528 --> 00:02:08.317
I didn't look at this beforehand.

00:02:08.317 --> 00:02:09.841
So I like to do this real time,

00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:11.750
so that I can empathize.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.659
Sentence two should be placed

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.585
at the beginning of the
paragraph, for sure.

00:02:16.585 --> 00:02:19.633
That establishes that
choir singing is a popular

00:02:19.633 --> 00:02:21.339
pastime, then they give evidence

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:23.067
that it is a popular pastime.

00:02:23.067 --> 00:02:24.305
And then, you know,
here we're talking about

00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:25.504
the number of singers,

00:02:25.504 --> 00:02:27.699
and then they reference these singers,

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:32.685
so it makes sense if two goes
first, then one, then three.

00:02:34.486 --> 00:02:35.766
On to the second paragraph,

00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:37.372
and the second question.

00:02:37.372 --> 00:02:41.943
A 2013 study at Sweden's
University of Gothenburg

00:02:41.943 --> 00:02:45.012
examined the heart
rates of 18 young people

00:02:45.012 --> 00:02:48.811
as they sang and hummed for unison.

00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:51.370
All right, for just sounds strange,

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.361
you don't do things for unison,

00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:56.064
you do things in unison.

00:02:56.064 --> 00:02:57.974
And so let's see, question two,

00:02:57.974 --> 00:03:00.594
well that's going to be in unison,

00:03:00.594 --> 00:03:02.036
and that's just a standard convention,

00:03:02.036 --> 00:03:03.927
if you're talking about doing something

00:03:03.927 --> 00:03:05.877
you don't say for unison or on unison

00:03:05.877 --> 00:03:07.014
or at unison, you say,

00:03:07.014 --> 00:03:09.433
Hey, we're going to do this in unison.

00:03:09.433 --> 00:03:13.415
So that, for sure, is going to be in.

00:03:13.415 --> 00:03:14.145
Let's actually keep going,

00:03:14.145 --> 00:03:16.807
I think we can do question
three of this video too.

00:03:16.807 --> 00:03:18.880
Heart rate variability (HRV),

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.830
the increase and decrease in heart rate,

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.314
occured simultaneously with the subjects'

00:03:22.314 --> 00:03:25.645
slowed breathing while singing.

00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:28.184
This combination of fluctuating heart rate

00:03:28.184 --> 00:03:31.050
and slowed breathing are called

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.569
respiratory sinus arrhythmia,

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.723
and has been proven to
reduce the likelihood

00:03:35.723 --> 00:03:37.246
of cardiovascular disease,

00:03:37.246 --> 00:03:41.696
a prior finding independent
of the 2013 study.

00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:44.641
All right, so this first, this are is off,

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:45.700
because they're talking about,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.064
what's the subject of this sentence.

00:03:48.064 --> 00:03:51.742
It's this combination of
fluctuating heart rate

00:03:51.742 --> 00:03:52.709
and slowed breathing

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.581
that are talking abot what
this combination is about,

00:03:55.581 --> 00:03:57.816
but the subject is this combination

00:03:57.816 --> 00:04:00.482
and that's singular, we're
talking about this combination,

00:04:00.482 --> 00:04:02.116
a combination here.

00:04:02.116 --> 00:04:05.119
So it's singular, we
say this combination are

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:07.489
respiratory sinus arrhythmia,

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.866
no, you say this combination is called

00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:12.386
respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

00:04:12.386 --> 00:04:15.901
So this is going to be is right over here.

00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:18.968
So is called, because it's a singular,

00:04:18.968 --> 00:04:20.553
this combination is called

00:04:20.553 --> 00:04:23.540
respiratory sinus arrhythmia,

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.648
and it has been proven
to reduce the likelihood

00:04:26.648 --> 00:04:30.752
of cardiovascular disease,
a prior finding independent

00:04:30.752 --> 00:04:33.333
of the 2013 study.

00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:34.227
So the way it's written right now

00:04:34.227 --> 00:04:36.055
is really there's no pause here.

00:04:36.055 --> 00:04:37.741
You know, I like to just kind of pause

00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:40.037
after it has been proven
to reduce the likelihood

00:04:40.037 --> 00:04:42.658
of cardiovascular disease.

00:04:42.658 --> 00:04:43.979
And then maybe adding some kind of a

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.351
prior finding independent
of the 2013 study.

00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:51.455
So let's see what they have here.

00:04:51.455 --> 00:04:55.295
So, no change, no, I don't like that.

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:58.201
This one, a prior finding independent

00:04:58.201 --> 00:05:00.476
of the 2013 study, that might be fine,

00:05:00.476 --> 00:05:01.512
it's a (mumbling)

00:05:01.512 --> 00:05:03.199
it's giving us a little
bit of extra information

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.433
but we don't need it, so I like that.

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:07.851
Putting a semi colon there,

00:05:07.851 --> 00:05:11.285
a prior finding independent
of the 2013 study,

00:05:11.285 --> 00:05:13.479
you're adding another
kind of clause there,

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.531
it feels like it's just
hanging on the end,

00:05:15.531 --> 00:05:17.278
I wouldn't do that.

00:05:17.278 --> 00:05:20.488
And then a prior finding
independent of the

00:05:20.488 --> 00:05:22.418
2013 study, with a colon,

00:05:22.418 --> 00:05:23.739
colon, I view that as kind of

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:26.787
giving more clarification or enumeration,

00:05:26.787 --> 00:05:29.387
and this is kind of
giving more clarification.

00:05:29.387 --> 00:05:32.536
But I definitely like the parentheses

00:05:32.536 --> 00:05:34.243
right over here because
it's making it clear

00:05:34.243 --> 00:05:38.530
that this last part,
that it has been proven

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.760
to reduce the likelihood
of cardivascular disease,

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.812
and they're just giving us, in a parenthetical,

00:05:43.812 --> 00:05:48.384
a prior finding independent
of the 2013 study.

00:05:50.404 --> 00:05:52.813
We're now on question five,

00:05:52.813 --> 00:05:55.556
People feel a keen sense of bonding

00:05:55.556 --> 00:05:57.425
when they sing together.

00:05:57.425 --> 00:05:59.031
All right, so that sentence seems

00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:00.289
like it's grammatically correct,

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:01.813
but let's see what the question says.

00:06:01.813 --> 00:06:04.800
Which choice most effectively establishes

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.888
the main topic of the paragraph?

00:06:07.888 --> 00:06:08.660
Okay, I see,

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.554
they either want us to say,

00:06:09.554 --> 00:06:10.773
Okay, we can have no change

00:06:10.773 --> 00:06:12.541
and say this sentence
is what we would keep

00:06:12.541 --> 00:06:14.064
as our topic sentence.

00:06:14.064 --> 00:06:15.690
Or maybe we would replace it with

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.519
one of these other options.

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:19.713
Well to figure out how we can establish

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:21.460
the main topic of the paragraph

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.390
I guess we're gonna have
to read the paragraph.

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.711
So I would actually probably

00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:27.534
come back to question five after reading,

00:06:27.534 --> 00:06:29.994
after going all the way
through question nine.

00:06:29.994 --> 00:06:32.350
So let's see if we can
do that in this video.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.418
Singing stimulates the right temporal lobe

00:06:35.418 --> 00:06:38.851
of the brain and releases endorphins.

00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:43.097
Endorphins blunt pain and
engender feelings of pleasure.

00:06:43.097 --> 00:06:45.232
So this right over here,

00:06:45.232 --> 00:06:46.450
so for number six,

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.731
to just kind of do a period

00:06:47.731 --> 00:06:49.375
and then do another sentence,

00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:51.448
it's not grammatically incorrect.

00:06:51.448 --> 00:06:53.054
I mean, it's fine to say that singing

00:06:53.054 --> 00:06:54.618
stimulates the right temporal lobe

00:06:54.618 --> 00:06:56.486
of the brain and releases endorphins,

00:06:56.486 --> 00:06:57.482
that's a sentence.

00:06:57.482 --> 00:06:59.332
And then to say endorphins blunt pain

00:06:59.332 --> 00:07:01.261
and engender feelings of pleasure.

00:07:01.261 --> 00:07:04.064
But these two sentences
are very connected,

00:07:04.064 --> 00:07:06.787
in fact, the second
sentence right over here

00:07:06.787 --> 00:07:10.140
is giving us clarity
on what endorphins are.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.985
So I would think about,
I would think about

00:07:12.985 --> 00:07:15.726
kind of connecting them
a little bit better.

00:07:15.726 --> 00:07:17.697
So let's see what the choices are,

00:07:17.697 --> 00:07:20.663
what the choices are here.

00:07:20.663 --> 00:07:23.284
So the first one is,

00:07:23.284 --> 00:07:25.418
oh they actually didn't
put no change here,

00:07:25.418 --> 00:07:27.043
so they definitely want us to change it

00:07:27.043 --> 00:07:29.644
I guess the way this is written.

00:07:29.644 --> 00:07:31.980
So the first choice is singing stimulates

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.869
the right temporal lobe of the brain

00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:35.454
and releases endorphins,

00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:38.603
which end up blunting
and engendered feelings

00:07:38.603 --> 00:07:39.355
of pleasure.

00:07:39.355 --> 00:07:40.128
Now that's not right, I mean,

00:07:40.128 --> 00:07:42.602
just even, look if you end up blunting

00:07:42.602 --> 00:07:46.324
and engender, those two verbs aren't even

00:07:46.324 --> 00:07:50.042
in the same tense.

00:07:50.042 --> 00:07:53.638
Blunting, blunting,
yeah, this is, you know,

00:07:53.638 --> 00:07:55.488
blunting and endgendered,

00:07:55.488 --> 00:07:59.225
it's breaking your parallel
construction, so to speak.

00:07:59.225 --> 00:08:00.831
Endorphins, which blunt,

00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:01.501
let's see.

00:08:01.501 --> 00:08:03.512
Singing stimulates the right temporal lobe

00:08:03.512 --> 00:08:05.361
of the brain and releases endorphins,

00:08:05.361 --> 00:08:10.361
which blunt pain and engender
feelings of pleasure.

00:08:10.928 --> 00:08:12.187
Yeah, that one could work

00:08:12.187 --> 00:08:14.728
and it connects them better.

00:08:14.728 --> 00:08:15.621
Let's see C,

00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:17.185
endorphins, but they blunt,

00:08:17.185 --> 00:08:18.343
no, you don't want to contradict it,

00:08:18.343 --> 00:08:21.228
we're just explaining what endorphins do.

00:08:21.228 --> 00:08:22.833
As this last choice,

00:08:22.833 --> 00:08:24.784
endorphins, and they blunt.

00:08:24.784 --> 00:08:25.801
No, I think this is very clear,

00:08:25.801 --> 00:08:27.141
when you say which blunt,

00:08:27.141 --> 00:08:29.213
you're clarifying what endorphins do,

00:08:29.213 --> 00:08:30.574
so I like B there.

00:08:30.574 --> 00:08:31.936
All right, let's keep going.

00:08:31.936 --> 00:08:35.450
So now we can go to question seven,

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:39.900
So cortisol, a hormonal reaction to stress

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.679
and the secretion of
which the brain controls,

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:46.198
decreases after choir singing.

00:08:46.198 --> 00:08:47.925
All right, so cortisol's a stress hormone

00:08:47.925 --> 00:08:50.039
and it decreases after choir singing.

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:54.528
Meanwhile, oxytocin,
which the brain interprets

00:08:54.528 --> 00:08:57.841
as a feeling of emotional
bonding, is increased.

00:08:57.841 --> 00:08:59.730
So these are describing ways that make

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.070
people feel better

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:02.370
and I want to read this entire paragraph,

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.914
because at the end I want to go back

00:09:03.914 --> 00:09:06.718
to question five and think
about the topic sentence.

00:09:06.718 --> 00:09:08.628
So all of these good things are happening.

00:09:08.628 --> 00:09:11.514
In a study at Oxford Brookes University,

00:09:11.514 --> 00:09:14.215
researchers surveyed 375 people

00:09:14.215 --> 00:09:17.486
who either sang alone, sang in a choir,

00:09:17.486 --> 00:09:20.535
or participated in organized sports.

00:09:20.535 --> 00:09:22.179
Those who sang in choir

00:09:22.179 --> 00:09:24.333
reported the highest levels of happiness.

00:09:24.333 --> 00:09:25.288
So everything we're talking about is,

00:09:25.288 --> 00:09:29.270
Wow, this choir singing really
can make people happier.

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:33.172
So, and their kind of
citing kind of chemical,

00:09:33.172 --> 00:09:34.777
we can point to kind of chemical things

00:09:34.777 --> 00:09:35.954
happening in the brain that are

00:09:35.954 --> 00:09:37.845
actually associated with more happiness

00:09:37.845 --> 00:09:39.490
and less stress.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:42.111
Due to its positive side effects,

00:09:42.111 --> 00:09:44.245
therapists have used choir singing

00:09:44.245 --> 00:09:47.169
as an element for those dealing

00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:50.441
with depression and chronic pain.

00:09:50.441 --> 00:09:53.367
So I kind of like the due to
its positive side effects,

00:09:53.367 --> 00:09:54.687
because that is the reason why

00:09:54.687 --> 00:09:56.150
therapists would use it.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:00.477
So let's look at the other choices.

00:10:00.477 --> 00:10:03.139
So I like due to, that's my default,

00:10:03.139 --> 00:10:05.496
so despite its positive side effects

00:10:05.496 --> 00:10:06.918
therapists have used choir singing

00:10:06.918 --> 00:10:08.706
no, I mean they're using it because

00:10:08.706 --> 00:10:10.169
of the positive side effects,

00:10:10.169 --> 00:10:11.733
due to the positive side effects.

00:10:11.733 --> 00:10:12.973
This isn't a contradiction to the fact

00:10:12.973 --> 00:10:14.455
that it is positive side effects.

00:10:14.455 --> 00:10:15.430
It's not, if, you know,

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.340
despite the fact that it's bad for people,

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.560
therapists are using it,

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.297
that would be a reason
to use the word despite.

00:10:22.297 --> 00:10:23.821
But no, that doesn't make sense.

00:10:23.821 --> 00:10:26.137
In addition to its positive side effects,

00:10:26.137 --> 00:10:27.886
therapists have used choir singing

00:10:27.886 --> 00:10:29.227
as an element for those dealing

00:10:29.227 --> 00:10:30.791
with depression and chronic pain.

00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:31.827
Well it's not in addition.

00:10:31.827 --> 00:10:34.122
It's saying it's giving the cause of it

00:10:34.122 --> 00:10:36.053
because due to its positive side effects,

00:10:36.053 --> 00:10:37.962
this is why therapists are thinking about

00:10:37.962 --> 00:10:40.360
using it as a way to deal with depression

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.148
and chronic pain.

00:10:42.148 --> 00:10:44.058
And then besides, once again,

00:10:44.058 --> 00:10:46.841
it's not a besides the
therapists have used

00:10:46.841 --> 00:10:49.583
choir singing, that's because due to the

00:10:49.583 --> 00:10:50.436
positive side effects,

00:10:50.436 --> 00:10:52.916
it isn't on top of or another thing

00:10:52.916 --> 00:10:54.643
that's seemingly unrelated.

00:10:54.643 --> 00:10:57.202
So I'd definitely would go with no change.

00:10:57.202 --> 00:10:59.457
Now let's go to question eight.

00:10:59.457 --> 00:11:01.895
And once again, I'm
using a prototype version

00:11:01.895 --> 00:11:03.928
where it says six out
of five, seven out five,

00:11:03.928 --> 00:11:06.427
obviously it should not be out of five

00:11:06.427 --> 00:11:07.991
because there's more
than five questions here.

00:11:07.991 --> 00:11:09.657
Let's go to question eight.

00:11:09.657 --> 00:11:11.647
So due to its positive side effects

00:11:11.647 --> 00:11:13.334
therapists have used choir singing

00:11:13.334 --> 00:11:15.407
as an element for those dealing

00:11:15.407 --> 00:11:17.459
with depression and chronic pain.

00:11:17.459 --> 00:11:19.145
An element feels a little weird,

00:11:19.145 --> 00:11:20.263
an element of what,

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:24.733
let's see with what the other options are.

00:11:24.733 --> 00:11:26.520
An accessory for those dealing with

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.243
depression and chronic pain.

00:11:29.243 --> 00:11:32.086
An accessory I imagine more of a bit of a,

00:11:32.086 --> 00:11:34.241
you know, it wouldn't be a process

00:11:34.241 --> 00:11:37.166
like a choir singing, it
wouldn't be an activity,

00:11:37.166 --> 00:11:40.173
I wouldn't call an activity an accessory,

00:11:40.173 --> 00:11:41.372
or piece.

00:11:41.372 --> 00:11:46.247
Well, accessory doesn't feel right there,

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:47.142
let's see,

00:11:47.142 --> 00:11:48.563
choir singing as a supplement

00:11:48.563 --> 00:11:50.656
for those dealing with depression

00:11:50.656 --> 00:11:53.277
and chronic pain.

00:11:53.277 --> 00:11:54.496
A supplement could be good,

00:11:54.496 --> 00:11:57.523
because, you know, you
wouldn't make this the primary

00:11:57.523 --> 00:11:59.616
treatment if someone has severe depression

00:11:59.616 --> 00:12:00.998
or chronic pain, you wouldn't just say,

00:12:00.998 --> 00:12:02.685
Hey, why don't you go start in a choir,

00:12:02.685 --> 00:12:04.188
go start singing in a choir?

00:12:04.188 --> 00:12:05.935
There's other things that the therapist

00:12:05.935 --> 00:12:08.373
would probably do to help alleviate

00:12:08.373 --> 00:12:10.974
or deal with the depression
and chronic pain.

00:12:10.974 --> 00:12:12.173
But it would be a supplement

00:12:12.173 --> 00:12:14.509
above and beyond, above and beyond

00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:17.069
what kind of the more
traditional methods might be.

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:19.548
This could be something
to do on top of that.

00:12:19.548 --> 00:12:21.498
Now an addendum, an addendum, once again,

00:12:21.498 --> 00:12:22.940
this is like something that you add on

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:23.874
to other things,

00:12:23.874 --> 00:12:25.845
it's kind of like a supplement.

00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:27.979
But, you know, I view
an addendum to kind of

00:12:27.979 --> 00:12:32.979
a presentation, or to a
kind of a position paper,

00:12:33.301 --> 00:12:35.681
or something, something
I add on to the back of

00:12:35.681 --> 00:12:38.137
something like that, like a proposal.

00:12:38.137 --> 00:12:40.534
I wouldn't use that word if I'm talking,

00:12:40.534 --> 00:12:43.867
you know, kind of treatment
or dealing with something.

00:12:43.867 --> 00:12:45.918
And that's how I kind
of feel about accessory,

00:12:45.918 --> 00:12:47.787
accessory is something that adds on,

00:12:47.787 --> 00:12:49.414
but I think of an accessory as more of

00:12:49.414 --> 00:12:50.916
a watch or a purse or something,

00:12:50.916 --> 00:12:53.416
not as much as an element

00:12:53.416 --> 00:12:55.244
to kind of go above and beyond

00:12:55.244 --> 00:12:58.555
the existing treatment.

00:12:58.555 --> 00:13:01.440
I like the word supplement here.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.026
Well, let's keep going.

00:13:03.026 --> 00:13:05.789
A study from an arts and
health research center

00:13:05.789 --> 00:13:08.836
in Canterbury, England followed,

00:13:08.836 --> 00:13:11.741
a study from an arts and
health research center

00:13:11.741 --> 00:13:14.973
in Canterbury, England followed
the progress of patients

00:13:14.973 --> 00:13:17.064
diagnosed with depression for a year

00:13:17.064 --> 00:13:19.036
after they joined a choir.

00:13:19.036 --> 00:13:22.226
Sixty percent of patients
reported improved mental health

00:13:22.226 --> 00:13:23.445
at the end of the year.

00:13:23.445 --> 00:13:26.959
And some were no longer experiencing

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:29.925
suffering from clinical depression.

00:13:29.925 --> 00:13:32.160
So experiencing suffering,

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.603
that sounds weird,

00:13:33.603 --> 00:13:35.215
you would I would say, no longer suffering

00:13:35.215 --> 00:13:37.727
from clinical depression, maybe?

00:13:37.727 --> 00:13:39.211
Or no longer experiencing

00:13:39.211 --> 00:13:41.568
symptoms of clinical depression?

00:13:41.568 --> 00:13:42.501
But I wouldn't have experiencing

00:13:42.501 --> 00:13:43.538
and suffering there,

00:13:43.538 --> 00:13:45.021
I would get rid of one of them.

00:13:45.021 --> 00:13:47.072
Let's see what our options are.

00:13:47.072 --> 00:13:50.343
And some were no longer reporting

00:13:50.343 --> 00:13:54.611
that they were suffering
from clinical depression.

00:13:54.611 --> 00:13:55.890
I mean, that reads well.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.389
And some were no longer reporting

00:13:58.389 --> 00:14:00.930
that they were suffering
from clinical depression.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.960
But it still feels a little bit heavy.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.830
You know, reporting that
they were suffering,

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.044
is that necessary, could you just say,

00:14:07.044 --> 00:14:09.463
Some were no longer suffering.

00:14:09.463 --> 00:14:10.743
Let's see this next one.

00:14:10.743 --> 00:14:13.912
And some were no longer suffering
from clinical depression

00:14:13.912 --> 00:14:17.630
by the end of the year.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:21.063
Well, this one is tempting,

00:14:21.063 --> 00:14:22.466
but we already said

00:14:22.466 --> 00:14:25.329
at the end of the year,
at the end of that year,

00:14:25.329 --> 00:14:27.972
and then to say by the
end of that year, again?

00:14:27.972 --> 00:14:29.841
Sixty percent of patients
reported mental health

00:14:29.841 --> 00:14:31.304
at the end of that year

00:14:31.304 --> 00:14:33.559
and some were no longer suffering

00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:36.158
clinical depression by
the end of that year,

00:14:36.158 --> 00:14:37.805
you're saying by the
end of that year twice,

00:14:37.805 --> 00:14:39.429
that's redundant.

00:14:39.429 --> 00:14:41.420
If it just said suffering
from clinical depression

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.371
I actually wouldn't mind this choice.

00:14:43.371 --> 00:14:46.013
Let's see, I hope D works out well.

00:14:46.013 --> 00:14:49.040
Sixty percent of patients
reported improved mental health

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.483
at the end of that year

00:14:50.483 --> 00:14:53.490
and some were no longer
clinically depressed.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.216
Yeah, that feels good.

00:14:55.216 --> 00:14:56.090
Nice and clean.

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:57.736
Gets the point across.

00:14:57.736 --> 00:14:59.157
All right, so we've answered through nine,

00:14:59.157 --> 00:15:00.154
we go to remember, we skipped five

00:15:00.154 --> 00:15:01.941
because five is about,

00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:03.689
well, what's a good topic sentence

00:15:03.689 --> 00:15:07.954
for that entire paragraph?

00:15:07.954 --> 00:15:09.317
So everything they talked about

00:15:09.317 --> 00:15:10.373
up here they're just talking about,

00:15:10.373 --> 00:15:11.877
Hey, look, it makes people feel

00:15:11.877 --> 00:15:13.644
feelings of pleasure

00:15:13.644 --> 00:15:15.717
and they even see it in the endorphins,

00:15:15.717 --> 00:15:17.769
you feel less stress hormone,

00:15:17.769 --> 00:15:22.502
gets decreases, you feel
feeling of emotional bonding

00:15:22.502 --> 00:15:25.103
goes up, and, you know, to
give even more evidence,

00:15:25.103 --> 00:15:27.012
they say the researchers have even used it

00:15:27.012 --> 00:15:29.654
to help alleviate, to
deal with the depression

00:15:29.654 --> 00:15:31.055
and chronic pain.

00:15:31.055 --> 00:15:32.681
So let's see, these choices,

00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:35.383
singing in a choir can
help prevent depression.

00:15:35.383 --> 00:15:37.881
Well, that's the second
half of the paragraph

00:15:37.881 --> 00:15:39.527
does talk about that,

00:15:39.527 --> 00:15:40.971
but that's not the whole paragraph.

00:15:40.971 --> 00:15:42.676
The whole paragraph isn't
just about depression.

00:15:42.676 --> 00:15:45.826
They're using depression as an example of

00:15:45.826 --> 00:15:48.649
how singing in a choir can
help make you feel better.

00:15:48.649 --> 00:15:51.941
So I wouldn't say that this is a topic,

00:15:51.941 --> 00:15:54.684
if this was the topic sentence,

00:15:54.684 --> 00:15:55.700
I don't know whether I would

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.081
go as heavily on all of
this other stuff here,

00:15:57.081 --> 00:15:59.337
I'd probably just start right over here.

00:15:59.337 --> 00:16:01.490
Let's see, the brain
tends to respond favorably

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.563
to group singing.

00:16:03.563 --> 00:16:06.773
Yeah I think, I think this is good,

00:16:06.773 --> 00:16:08.175
the brain tends to respond favorably

00:16:08.175 --> 00:16:09.027
to group singing,

00:16:09.027 --> 00:16:10.551
let's see how this reads.

00:16:10.551 --> 00:16:12.725
The brain tends to respond
favorably to group singing.

00:16:12.725 --> 00:16:15.144
Singing stimulates the right temporal lobe

00:16:15.144 --> 00:16:16.585
of the brain and releases endorphins.

00:16:16.585 --> 00:16:18.679
Yeah, we go straight into
talking about the brain.

00:16:18.679 --> 00:16:22.377
Endorphins blunt pain
and engender feelings

00:16:22.377 --> 00:16:22.944
of pleasure,

00:16:22.944 --> 00:16:24.123
so we're talking about all the ways

00:16:24.123 --> 00:16:25.179
that the brain reacts.

00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:26.928
And even when we're
talking about depression,

00:16:26.928 --> 00:16:29.812
we're talking about how it helps the brain

00:16:29.812 --> 00:16:31.620
deal with these things.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.400
So yeah, I like choice C there, so yeah,

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.182
we've done all the way
through question nine.

00:16:38.182 --> 00:16:42.267
So the next video we can
do that last few questions.

00:16:42.267 --> 00:16:44.400
So we're now on question ten,

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.163
and in question ten they
just have a box here

00:16:47.163 --> 00:16:48.524
without any of the underline,

00:16:48.524 --> 00:16:49.682
so they're not gonna ask us to

00:16:49.682 --> 00:16:50.311
actually change something,

00:16:50.311 --> 00:16:51.714
they're probably going to ask
us something more generally

00:16:51.714 --> 00:16:53.664
about the paragraph,

00:16:53.664 --> 00:16:55.290
so let's see what they ask us.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:56.936
At this point, so they
are asking something

00:16:56.936 --> 00:16:58.276
more general about the paragraph,

00:16:58.276 --> 00:17:00.674
at this point the writer
is considering adding

00:17:00.674 --> 00:17:02.340
the following sentence.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.965
So this is a sentence that
would go right at the beginning

00:17:03.965 --> 00:17:05.367
of this paragraph.

00:17:05.367 --> 00:17:08.354
Scientists do not yet know
all the benefits of singing,

00:17:08.354 --> 00:17:11.198
but the communal process that
singing in a choir provides

00:17:11.198 --> 00:17:13.514
has many postive side effects.

00:17:13.514 --> 00:17:15.992
Should the writer make this addition here?

00:17:15.992 --> 00:17:18.452
So let me finish reading this paragraph.

00:17:18.452 --> 00:17:20.219
But it doesn't seem an unreasonable thing,

00:17:20.219 --> 00:17:21.662
this is what the, you know,

00:17:21.662 --> 00:17:23.023
this is the concluding paragraph,

00:17:23.023 --> 00:17:25.602
you kind of want to tie
everything together,

00:17:25.602 --> 00:17:28.081
and so this is really
what the passage is about,

00:17:28.081 --> 00:17:30.235
scientists do not yet
know all the benefits

00:17:30.235 --> 00:17:32.064
of singing, but the communal process

00:17:32.064 --> 00:17:33.975
that singing in a choir provides

00:17:33.975 --> 00:17:36.005
has many positive side effects.

00:17:36.005 --> 00:17:37.792
The second part, the communal process

00:17:37.792 --> 00:17:38.971
that singing in a choir provides

00:17:38.971 --> 00:17:40.616
has many positive side effects

00:17:40.616 --> 00:17:42.059
seems to be what the passage is about,

00:17:42.059 --> 00:17:44.883
but let's see how they
close out the paragraph.

00:17:44.883 --> 00:17:46.895
So if we went with this,

00:17:46.895 --> 00:17:48.865
so it has many positive side effects.

00:17:48.865 --> 00:17:50.937
&gt;From the changes in
heartbeat and breathing

00:17:50.937 --> 00:17:53.030
that result in a healthier heart,

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.494
to the reduction of cortisol,

00:17:54.494 --> 00:17:55.875
and the production of endorphins

00:17:55.875 --> 00:17:57.865
that lower stress and increase happiness.

00:17:57.865 --> 00:17:59.958
So it does look like it's listing the

00:17:59.958 --> 00:18:01.077
many positive side effects,

00:18:01.077 --> 00:18:02.783
so I'm feeling pretty good about this.

00:18:02.783 --> 00:18:05.668
And then, well, this
is actually over here,

00:18:05.668 --> 00:18:07.151
isn't a complete sentence,

00:18:07.151 --> 00:18:08.695
it's saying from the changes in heartbeat

00:18:08.695 --> 00:18:10.869
and breathing that result
in a healthier heart

00:18:10.869 --> 00:18:12.495
for the reduction of cortisol

00:18:12.495 --> 00:18:15.055
and production of
endorphins that lower stress

00:18:15.055 --> 00:18:16.009
and increase happiness,

00:18:16.009 --> 00:18:17.188
then we go into question 11,

00:18:17.188 --> 00:18:18.244
there should be a comma here

00:18:18.244 --> 00:18:19.076
to kind of complete this,

00:18:19.076 --> 00:18:21.149
we're saying from this to that to this,

00:18:21.149 --> 00:18:22.938
and then we need to make our statement.

00:18:22.938 --> 00:18:24.400
So there should be a comma,

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.793
choir singing fulfills humans
by letting them create art

00:18:27.793 --> 00:18:29.093
while being part of a group.

00:18:29.093 --> 00:18:30.840
So this is good, let's go
straight to question 11,

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.689
put that comma in there.

00:18:32.689 --> 00:18:37.119
Luckily there's a choice
that has a comma here.

00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:38.337
'Cause it's really just completing,

00:18:38.337 --> 00:18:39.475
we're just starting it, saying from this

00:18:39.475 --> 00:18:41.100
to that to that,

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.686
now let's make our statement,

00:18:42.686 --> 00:18:44.575
comma, let's make our statement,

00:18:44.575 --> 00:18:46.464
you need a complete,

00:18:46.464 --> 00:18:48.679
just the from part right over here

00:18:48.679 --> 00:18:50.365
that is not a complete sentence.

00:18:50.365 --> 00:18:52.093
So with that out of the way,

00:18:52.093 --> 00:18:54.287
that we want to put a comma here,

00:18:54.287 --> 00:18:55.221
and not start a new sentence,

00:18:55.221 --> 00:18:57.354
let's go back to question ten.

00:18:57.354 --> 00:19:00.565
So let's see, so the choices are, yes,

00:19:00.565 --> 00:19:02.576
we could put this first thing

00:19:02.576 --> 00:19:06.639
because it reinforces the
primary claim of the passage.

00:19:06.639 --> 00:19:09.281
Yeah, it doesn't seem crazy.

00:19:09.281 --> 00:19:10.032
Let's just read that again,

00:19:10.032 --> 00:19:11.645
scientists do not yet,
let's start with this,

00:19:11.645 --> 00:19:12.645
scientists do not yet
know all the benefits

00:19:12.645 --> 00:19:14.919
of singing, but the communal process

00:19:14.919 --> 00:19:16.716
that singing in a choir provides

00:19:16.716 --> 00:19:19.133
has many positive side effects.

00:19:19.133 --> 00:19:22.892
&gt;From the changes in
heartbeat and breathing

00:19:22.892 --> 00:19:24.397
that result in a healthier heart

00:19:24.397 --> 00:19:25.777
to the reduction of cortisol

00:19:25.777 --> 00:19:26.996
and production of endorphins

00:19:26.996 --> 00:19:29.129
that lower stress and increase happiness,

00:19:29.129 --> 00:19:31.263
comma, lowercase C,

00:19:31.263 --> 00:19:33.457
choir singing fulfills
humans by letting them

00:19:33.457 --> 00:19:35.550
create art while being part of a group.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.704
Yeah, this whole everything right here

00:19:37.704 --> 00:19:39.268
is actually going to be one sentence

00:19:39.268 --> 00:19:40.751
because we're going to put the comma here.

00:19:40.751 --> 00:19:41.524
And so to start with this

00:19:41.524 --> 00:19:42.742
we don't know all the benefits,

00:19:42.742 --> 00:19:44.388
but it has many positive side effects

00:19:44.388 --> 00:19:46.074
and then we list them all here,

00:19:46.074 --> 00:19:47.618
and then we say choir fulfills humans

00:19:47.618 --> 00:19:48.918
while letting them create art

00:19:48.918 --> 00:19:49.874
while being part of a group.

00:19:49.874 --> 00:19:50.930
Yeah, I like this.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:52.881
It's a yes because it offers
additional information

00:19:52.881 --> 00:19:54.912
that supports the claim of the passage.

00:19:54.912 --> 00:19:57.329
Now this doesn't give
us any new information,

00:19:57.329 --> 00:19:58.894
it's just tying things together,

00:19:58.894 --> 00:20:00.134
so I wouldn't pick B.

00:20:00.134 --> 00:20:02.226
No, because it provides
information unrelated

00:20:02.226 --> 00:20:03.343
to the passage.

00:20:03.343 --> 00:20:04.928
Well, first of all, it
is related to the passage

00:20:04.928 --> 00:20:06.411
but it's not providing new information,

00:20:06.411 --> 00:20:09.114
so choice C is definitely not the case.

00:20:09.114 --> 00:20:10.901
No, because it distracts from the focus

00:20:10.901 --> 00:20:12.344
of the previous paragraph.

00:20:12.344 --> 00:20:16.022
No, if anything it's kind of a nice tie in

00:20:16.022 --> 00:20:17.707
from the previous paragraph

00:20:17.707 --> 00:20:18.479
because the previous paragraph was saying,

00:20:18.479 --> 00:20:20.084
All these clues we have

00:20:20.084 --> 00:20:21.872
about the different ways choir singing

00:20:21.872 --> 00:20:23.660
might help the brain.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.286
And but you know these were just clues,

00:20:25.286 --> 00:20:26.748
we don't know exactly how the brain works,

00:20:26.748 --> 00:20:28.151
we don't know exactly the mechanism

00:20:28.151 --> 00:20:30.629
by which choir singing makes our brain

00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:32.316
do all of these positive things,

00:20:32.316 --> 00:20:33.738
so it's nice that they said

00:20:33.738 --> 00:20:35.972
that they don't know
all of the answers yet,

00:20:35.972 --> 00:20:38.818
but, and then it does have
many positive side effects,

00:20:38.818 --> 00:20:40.382
and then we list those side effects

00:20:40.382 --> 00:20:42.636
and we kind of close it all up together.

00:20:42.636 --> 00:20:46.029
Yes, so I feel good
about A for question ten.

00:20:46.029 --> 00:20:48.792
And then B for 11,

00:20:48.792 --> 00:20:51.718
where we definitely don't want this thing

00:20:51.718 --> 00:20:53.242
over here in the public sentence.

00:20:53.242 --> 00:20:55.295
And once again, I'm using
a prototype version of this

00:20:55.295 --> 00:20:57.230
so this is a little bit of a (mumbling)

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:58.727
it says question 11 out of 11.

00:20:58.727 --> 00:21:01.076
Anyway, you get the point.
