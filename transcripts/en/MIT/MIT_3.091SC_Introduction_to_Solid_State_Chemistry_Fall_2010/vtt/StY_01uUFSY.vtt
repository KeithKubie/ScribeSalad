00:00:21.868 --> 00:00:22.620
SAL: Hi.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.250
I'm Sal.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.750
Today we're going to solve
problem number two of test

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.160
three of fall 2009.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.580
Now before you attempt the
problem, there are certain

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.870
things that you need to know
to solve the problem.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.480
One is mechanical properties
of metal and also the

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.280
properties of amorphous metals,
which are known as

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.530
metallic glasses, and
how to draw crystal

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.430
structures given to you.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.590
The problem reads as follows--

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.760
for a given alloy composition,
explain why the yield strength

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.750
of the amorphous form, the
metallic glass, is greater

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.880
than that of the crystal form.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.690
Now in order to answer this
question, you want to start

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.380
thinking about the mechanical
properties that these two raw

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:16.320
materials have. So if I look
at a metal, I know that the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.280
way a metal deforms before it
reaches classic deformation--

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.960
it deforms the planes sliding
past one another--

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.260
so it's known as slip.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.000
So I know that metals--

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:45.080
they form via slip and slip is
facilitated by dislocations

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.940
and you should know what a
dislocation is by now, which

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.650
is just a line imperfection
in your crystal.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:02:01.640
So slip is facilitated
by dislocations.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.530
So I know that my metal has
planes that are arranged

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.370
because it's a nice
crystallographic structure--

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.820
and that the slip--

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.070
when it undergoes deformation,
that this is actually assisted

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.060
by dislocation.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.880
So having dislocations helps
to form our metal.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.420
So now I want to start thinking
about what a metallic

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.830
glass has-- so the
amorphous form.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.790
So if I look at the
metallic glass--

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.840
and all I'm doing here is
comparing the basic properties

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.970
between the two--

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.890
so this is going to get
me metallic glass.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.670
I know that for metallic
glass, there's

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.670
no long range order.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.450
So the fact that there's no long
range order means that

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.340
these metallic glasses don't
form a perfect crystal array.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.490
And that lack leads to metallic
glasses having no

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.740
dislocations.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.380
So if a metal slip is
facilitated by dislocations

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.700
and if a metallic glass doesn't
have dislocations,

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.780
then I would assume, just by
comparison between the two,

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.270
that the threshold for one of
the materials to yield would

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.720
be due to the fact that--

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.990
whether or not I have
dislocations.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.420
So with this argument, I would
say that the metallic glass

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.350
has a higher yield strength
than my metal

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.220
because of this property.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.010
So that--

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.610
if you did that-- if you went
ahead and wrote all that out

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.340
for your answer in part A, you
should be able to get most of

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.160
the points for this problem.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.170
Now part B--

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.980
it asks, on each of the
following separate drawings of

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.240
one face of an FCC unit cell--

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.890
FCC stands for face
centered cubic--

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.560
indicate one of each
of the following.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.650
So now we're going to
move on to part B--

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.800
and part B wants--

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.540
there's three scenarios.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.600
One--

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.350
it wants us to indicate on
a face of a crystal, a

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.150
substitutional impurity--

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:55.090
so substitutional impurity.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.120
So if I look at--

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.525
if I draw a face--

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.180
here.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.690
I can--

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.600
so to find out what the
definition of a substitutional

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.250
impurity is, I know that it's
not going to be anything that

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:29.140
can be just embedded
in between atoms--

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.410
like an interstitial.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.630
I know that it's going to be
a substitutional impurity.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.780
So if this is one of the
faces of your crystal--

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.480
and it's FCC, which is face
centered, from the face-- the

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.230
face is centered on the center
of an atom on your face.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:52.150
Then I would say that if I
substitute this out for a

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:59.600
different atom of type B
compared to these atoms, then

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.910
that's a substitutional impurity
because that atom is

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:03.930
not the same as the other.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.390
It's like having silver and
gold, for example, in

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.610
composition.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.135
And then it also asks
for the second part.

00:06:14.135 --> 00:06:16.300
So that's number one.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:24.410
For number two, it wants us
to demonstrate a vacancy.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:30.520
Now a vacancy is simply an atom
missing from a normal

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.160
lattice site on your
crystal array.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:47.240
So if I draw again another face,
then I can leave that

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.790
blank and I can go ahead and I
can point and I can say that

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.350
the vacancy is actually--

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.165
sits right here.

00:06:53.165 --> 00:06:54.506
So this is my vacancy.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.540
There's no atom that's there.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.860
It moved out of its place.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:05.170
So that's another defect
that we put in there.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:11.260
And for three, it asks, an
interstitial impurity.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.890
So what's interstitial?

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:31.610
Well, an atom that can fit in
between two atoms that are

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.750
different than the
one that fits.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:44.980
So if I draw again an FCC face,
I notice that there's

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:49.590
certain spots where an atom of
a different composition can

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:56.780
fit and I can go ahead and
I can just put a--

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:00.060
that's an atom of different
composition and that can very

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.070
simply be your interstitial.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:10.010
So that's your interstitial
impurity.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.360
So knowing the definitions,
you're able to answer this

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.150
problem very simply.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:18.130
There was no math involved in
this and all you needed to

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.170
know was knowledge of our
mechanical properties of

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.800
metals versus amorphous metals,
which are known as

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.080
metallic glasses.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:30.340
And knowing that information,
you're able to answer a

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:34.090
question like this, which is
pretty simple after you finish

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:35.360
and you think about it.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.310
And if you didn't know
what FCC was--

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:40.310
which stands for face centered
cubic, you could have probably

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:42.130
lost a lot of points
on this problem.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.740
But if you know that, if you
know how to draw it, then

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.820
you're good to go.
