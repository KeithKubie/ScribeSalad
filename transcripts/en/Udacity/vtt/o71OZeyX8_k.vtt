One thing that might have made you uneasy,

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.090
is that when we selected our header element, we simply chose a class name and

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.910
assumed it to be unique, or hoped it was.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.870
Typically, you cannot make the assumption that a class name is unique

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.380
to a given element.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.520
IDs are typically reserved as unique identifiers that don't show up

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.340
on any other HTML or DOM nodes throughout the page.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.890
But classes could, and often are, applied to many different HTML tags.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.040
We can test whether navbar static top

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.070
was indeed unique by using d3's selectAll function.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.310
SelectAll works in just the same way as select.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.120
Except for instead of returning one,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.560
it returns all the elements that match the selection.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.920
As you can see here,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.470
I'm trying to select every header with class navbarstatic top on the page.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.720
Luckily for us, what gets returned is a single element.
