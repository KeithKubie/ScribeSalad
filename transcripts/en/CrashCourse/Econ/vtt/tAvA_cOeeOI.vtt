00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.520
Hi, I’m Adriene Hill. This is Crash Course Economics,
and today we’re talking about foreign aid.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.520
Want to guess what percent of the America’s budget goes to foreign aid? It’s right around 1%

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.160
But most Americans have no idea that it’s
that small.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.390
A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found
the average guess

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.030
was that 26% of the budget went to helping
other countries.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:29.860
[Theme Music]

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.480
The fact that Americans overestimate their
government’s foreign aid so drastically

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.460
might help explain why so many think we’re
overspending on aid.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.339
The Kaiser study found that more than half
of people surveyed said the US was too generous.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.040
But when they found out the total expenditure was closer to 1% of the budget, that number fell to 28%.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.820
Foreign aid is basically the transfer of money, stuff or services from a country or international organization,

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.749
that's intended to help out another country
and its people.

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:00.909
The Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:07.200
estimates that aid spending by the richest
countries was more than $135 billion in 2014.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.440
Of that, nearly $33 billion came from the
U.S. The U.K. chipped in more than $19 billion.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.380
Germany added $16 billion. France, $10 billion.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.780
When you look at which countries give the most as a percentage of gross national income, the most generous nation is Sweden.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.899
U.S. Foreign Aid goes to a hundred-plus countries
around the world --

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.959
and is set aside for goals like peace and
security, democracy and human rights,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.840
economic growth, improvements to health and
education systems,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.600
humanitarian assistance after disasters, and
protecting the environment.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.700
But why do countries spend so much to help
out non-residents?

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.900
Out of the kindness of their collective hearts?
Or for some other more...complicated... reasons?

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.360
Historians say the modern age of international
aid really began after World War II,

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.840
when a number of still-to-this-day significant
international institutions were established.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.030
The World Bank was set up in 1944 as the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.200
with the job of helping Europe rebuild.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.920
The United Nations was created in 1945, as “a general international organization to maintain peace and security".

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.680
And the IMF came into existence, also in 1945,

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.590
with the job of helping to oversee the international
monetary system.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.190
In 1947, Secretary of State George Marshall
addressed the graduating class at Harvard,

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.870
with an offer of financial support for European
countries in their efforts to rebuild.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.220
He said: “It is logical that the United
States should do whatever it is able

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.330
to do to assist in the return of normal economic
health to the world,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.730
without which there can be no political stability
and no assured peace.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.159
Our policy is not directed against any country, but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos”

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.150
The speech marked the birth of what’s known
as the Marshall Plan.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.400
The U.S. gave out $13 billion dollars in aid, which, if you adjust for inflation, is morethan $130 billion dollars today.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.140
The goal was to help restore production in
Europe, to expand trade,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.610
and to a small degree, to try to keep communism
from spreading.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.319
The United Kingdom got about a quarter of
the total aid.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.159
France got about 18%, West Germany got about
a tenth of the money.

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.330
The rest was spread to the the smaller western
European countries. And it worked.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.549
The countries that took assistance saw their
GNPs jump,

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.569
in some places their economies were doing
better than they were BEFORE the war.

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.519
In 1949, President Truman effectively extended
the Marshall Plan

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.189
to other developing countries around the world.

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:31.049
George Marshall received the Nobel Prize for
Peace.

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.750
The plan worked on both strategic and humanitarian
fronts.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.770
The Marshall Plan helped legitimize and lay the groundwork for U.S. foreign aid programs that have come since.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:47.840
During the Cold War, the U.S. and its allies, along with the Soviets and its allies, used international aid as a political tool.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.020
Basically trying to win allegiances, and punish
countries who didn’t seem quite loyal enough.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.719
Once the Cold War ended, foreign aid transitioned
from geopolitical carrot and stick

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:01.140
toward more actual humanitarian and economic
aims.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:08.100
Adjusting for inflation, in 1960 total international aid to countries in sub-Saharan Africa was about $6 billion.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.420
That rose to $46 billion in 2011.
Why?

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.479
Governments got more interested in trying
to help lift people out of poverty

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.799
and improve economic conditions for the poorest
countries.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:25.000
Sub-saharan African nations also receive significant
aid to help fight HIV and AIDS.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.460
In 2015, the U.S. planned to send Kenya $486
million in assistance to combat HIV.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.280
But international aid doesn’t always go to the poorest countries or the countries fighting epidemics.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.500
Some research has found donor countries are more likely to send aid to former colonies or strategic partners.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.420
For example, the U.S. sends hundreds of millions
of dollars to Israel

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.780
and more than a billion dollars a year to Egypt, mostly earmarked to promote Peace and Security.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.680
France has focused its aid on its former colonies.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.080
And Japan directs aid to countries with similar
political interests.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.639
Donor countries also tend to want to write big checks to countries that are moving toward democracy.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.840
And, donor countries sometimes use international aid to encourage trade with the recipient country.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.020
Like say if the U.S. sends aid to a country that turns around and uses that aid to buy U.S. exports.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.440
It can help the U.S.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.840
The greater amount of trade a donor country
does with a recipient country,

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.330
the more aid the recipient country is likely
to get.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.030
Now, it probably goes without saying that
big donations don’t guarantee results in

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.410
the outcomes a donor country is looking for.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.009
There are quite a few ways that foreign aid
programs go wrong,

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:35.060
including when countries don’t coordinate
their aid,

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.240
when they don’t involve the recipient country
in figuring out how to allocate the money,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.240
and when the recipient country is run by corrupt leaders, who don’t use the aid for its intended goals.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.360
Some economists say foreign aid actually encourages corruption, by helping keep bad governments in power.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.420
As for whether or not international aid can actually encourage long-term-economic-growth in poor countries,

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.170
economists are divided on that.
Some say it doesn’t.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:06.480
Others think aid can help foster growth in countries with good macroeconomic policies are already in place.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.440
And others are even more optimistic saying
aid encourages growth period.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.000
I think we can call that debate “unsettled”.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.490
And even what seems like a non-controversial
idea,

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.430
like sending food into a country suffering
from famine, has detractors.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.840
Economists argue that food aid increases the
local supply of food,

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.289
which reduces the cost of food, and hurts
local farmers.

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:31.050
So, in theory, lower prices could lower food
production.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.810
Which is exactly what you don’t want in
a famine.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.569
Luckily, for those who like to feel good about
helping out in the world,

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:40.050
there’s research showing foreign aid can
be a positive force.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.270
Especially in the field of public health:

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.169
Public health aid has nearly eradicated the
parasitic Guinea Worm in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:51.479
In 1986, there were 3.5 million cases of Guinea
Worm reported.

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:54.659
In 2015, there were 126 cases.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.199
All thanks to a program of education about
simple water treatment

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:01.439
and medical practices that stop the spread
of the parasite.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.940
According to the World Health Organization,
between 2000 and 2015,

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.040
the number of new cases of malaria fell by
more than a third.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.040
Malaria death rates fell 60% during the same
years.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:17.490
Between 2000 and 2015, new HIV infections
are down 35%.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.660
AIDS related deaths have fallen by nearly
a quarter.

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:25.020
The WHO estimates 7.8 million lives have been
saved.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.389
We’ve been talking a lot about government
aid to foreign countries so far,

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:32.809
but there are lots of other ways money goes
from one country to help people in others.

00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:35.380
Like remittances.
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.440
Remittances are basically the money that migrants
and immigrants send to their home country.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.110
Turns out this happens a lot.
And a lot of money gets sent home.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:49.020
In 2013, by the UN’s count, there were 230 million people living outside the country they were born in.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.120
And all that movement bumps up world incomes,

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:55.319
by letting workers move to places they might
make more money.

00:07:55.319 --> 00:08:00.419
Once they start making more money, many immigrants start sending some of that money back to their families.

00:08:00.419 --> 00:08:06.479
The World Bank says total global remittance
flows were $542 Billion in 2013.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.140
$404 Billion of that went to developing countries.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.970
That’s more than three times the size of
government foreign aid assistance.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.040
And who’s getting all that money? $70 billion
in remittances went to India.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:23.380
$60 billion went to China, $25 billion went to the
Philippines and $22 billion were sent to Mexico.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:28.560
In Tajikistan, remittances are equal to more
than 40% of the country’s GDP.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.080
Remittances were equal to about quarter of
GDP in Nepal and Moldova.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.440
And, according to the World Bank, remittances can have a significantly positive effect on the home country,

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:43.400
where the money is going, leading to a reduction
in poverty, larger health and education expenditures,

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.230
better access to technology, less child labor.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.250
But, not everyone is convinced.

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:53.000
There are economists who warn that remittances
can foster a dependency on outside money.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.730
That they dis-incentivize growth in the home
economy.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.720
And make it overly susceptible to the global
economy.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.020
There’s also widespread concern about the
rates that immigrants pay to send remittances.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:08.260
On average, migrants around the world pay
8.4% to send money home.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:14.960
Some countries are trying to push that down to 5%, which could save migrants around $14 billion a year.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.160
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.530
There’s another significant source of help
for developing countries,

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:23.510
money from non-profit organizations and intergovernmental organizations.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.190
You’ve likely heard of some of these:

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:30.280
UNICEF, Red Cross, Red Crescent, the World
Food Programme, Doctors Without Borders, Oxfam.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.460
The list is much, much longer.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.320
These organizations gather money from individuals,
corporations and from governments,

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:41.030
and provide humanitarian aid and disaster
relief around the world.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:45.090
There are also thousands of smaller charities
that promise to give foreign aid.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:51.550
According to a study by the Urban Institute, in the U.S. alone, there are 5600 nonprofits that work internationally.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:59.080
That sounds like a lot, until you consider they make up only about 2% of all nonprofit organizations in the US,

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:03.480
and gather 2% of the revenue of the
charitable nonprofit sector.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.280
It’s probably worth noting here that there’s a difference between public charities and private foundations.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:13.180
Both are both tax-exempt charitable organizations
under the U.S. tax code.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:17.720
Public charities get a bigger portion of their
support from the general public and the government.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.100
Private foundations are typically controlled
by a small group of people,

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:25.280
and get most of their support from a small
number of donors and investment money.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.540
Because private foundations are less beholden
to the public,

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.640
they are more likely to support agendas THEY
want.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.180
Even if they don’t have widespread social
support.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.940
With any charity that asks for your money,

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:40.500
you should do your homework, and make sure
it actually does what it says it will do with donations.

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:45.520
There are plenty of fraudulent or just poorly
managed charitable organizations out there.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.120
So, next time there is a disaster overseas
and you want to send money,

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.590
read up before you text $100 to an organization.

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:56.550
And make sure that organization is going to
use the money to actually do some good.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:00.900
There are websites like charity navigator
and guidestar that make this easy.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.630
Which brings us to a last point before we
finish up.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:08.350
There are plenty examples out there of wasted
foreign aid. Of bad-actor charities.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:14.700
But try not to let that make you too cynical about helping out, both as a taxpayer and as a philanthropist.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.920
There are programs and organizations that
do good and save lives.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.400
There are ways to actually help people who
need help around the world.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.040
All right. Thanks for watching. See you next
week.
