&gt;&gt; ERIC: Hi. My name is Eric and I work on
Android. I'm here to tell you about some cool

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.639
features of the Android 1.5 release. One of
the main additions we've introduced in this

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:17.000
update is the virtual keyboard. It has a bunch
of cool features. You can set it up so that

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.730
as you type, it gives you tactile feedback
by vibrating the screen. A pretty handy trick

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.359
if you're not used to typing on the touch
screen. It also gives suggestions and autocorrects

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:35.579
your spelling so that you can type quickly
and easily. The virtual keyboard works in

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.200
any application: Gmail, the browser, SMS,
and even third party apps. But what's also

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:49.510
nice is that apps have the ability to flip
between landscape and portrait mode. So the

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.030
virtual keyboard is great. But if you don't
feel like typing or if you're searching for

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.390
a long or a hard to spell phrase, you can
simply say your search using search by voice.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.450
Another new set of features we've added to
Android includes video recording, playback,

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:13.760
and sharing. Recording a video is really straightforward,
simply point and shoot. Say "hi," Jim.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.280
&gt;&gt; JIM: Hi.
&gt;&gt; ERIC: Sharing videos with friends couldn't

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.720
be easier. Simply click "Share" and choose
how to share it. You can e-mail, SMS, or even

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:35.950
upload directly to YouTube. Jim, you and your
funny hat are about to get famous. And while

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.200
the upload happens in the background, you
can continue using the phone as usual: make

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.960
a call, text, or even record and upload a
new video. Another cool feature is the ability

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.060
to customize your phone with home screen widgets
that provide immediate access to valuable

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.560
information and applications. The phone comes
preloaded with great widgets like calendar,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.050
a music player and Google Search. We're really
excited to see what new widgets developers

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.640
come up with next. You can find these new
widgets and of course great applications in

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.610
Android Market. For more information on Android
