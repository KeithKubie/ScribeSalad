00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.230
The right answer is four times. And I

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.220
sort of walked through that for you hopefully

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.190
you got that. Basically, the kernel has to

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.610
copy from the client address space into the kernel

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.980
buffer. That's the first copy. The second copy

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.770
is, the kernel has to copy from the kernel

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.550
buffer into the server. And then the third

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.390
time when the procedure is completed, the server procedure

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.110
is completed, the kernel has to copy it from the server address

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.010
using the kernel, and then the fourth time, it's going to be copied from

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.020
the kernel buffer into the client. So it's tough being moved from

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.410
the user address space... Through the kernel and back out happens four times.
