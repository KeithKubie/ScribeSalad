1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,270
The general gun experience.
No.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,780
One thing that exists now that really
didn't exist when Obama was running for

3
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:11,040
president is the impact of social media.
It's just tenfold what it used to be.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,460
But with that also comes this reality
that we're living in right now where

5
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:20,460
there's only a few companies that are
controlling the discourse in this country.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,470
Yeah. I mean, you really have
essentially a Facebook, Google, youtube,

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,340
Twitter, and Facebook owns Instagram.
That's right. And there's, you know,

8
00:00:29,341 --> 00:00:33,170
a couple of other small ones, but
that's the bulk of our discourse. Yeah.

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,380
What concern do you have about these
private companies controlling the vast

10
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,760
majority of communication
between people on social media?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,990
It's extremely dangerous. It's extremely
dangerous when you think about it.

12
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:51,710
And there's a few things. There's, gosh,

13
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,220
with Facebook and Google for
that matter. You know, they,

14
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,200
they can set their algorithms,
uh,

15
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,400
Mark Zuckerberg with Facebook and said
his algorithm to control what information

16
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:04,650
is coming across our
news feed in Facebook.

17
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,480
What are the stories that we're seeing?
Instagram, same thing with Google.

18
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:11,220
They can control.
When you punch in something,

19
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:15,990
what are the first stories that you're
going to see a on the first page that

20
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:17,380
pops up?
Uh,

21
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,790
when you think about that kind of power
of influence that has on the American

22
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:28,971
people literally being held within the
hands of a couple of people unchecked and

23
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:32,670
without oversight or transparency,
it's incredibly dangerous.

24
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,010
Talk about free speech.

25
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,020
There's just been news recently about
Facebook banning certain individuals,

26
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,240
uh, from having Facebook
accounts because of their speech.

27
00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:46,860
They disagree with the
speech that they're,

28
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,390
they're using are the things
that they're talking about,

29
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:51,060
the ideas that they're pushing forward,

30
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,830
unchecked first amendment rights
going completely out the window.

31
00:01:55,831 --> 00:02:00,420
And the argument is a don't apply because
it's a private company, right? Yes.

32
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:04,380
But they're trying to get
the best of both worlds. Um,

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,010
the fact that that, you know,
they're claiming to say, hey,

34
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:12,020
this is a free space for open
communication for everyone. Right.

35
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,060
While at the same time going and
saying, actually, you know what, Joe,

36
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:16,560
I don't like what you're
saying about this.

37
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:20,790
So we're going to ban you and
whoever your friends are from,

38
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,770
from this conversation. Um,
I think that's, that's a
big problem. It undermines,

39
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,640
it undermines our first amendment rights.
When you look at privacy,

40
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,510
the privacy concerns of all
the information that they're
collecting and Facebook

41
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:36,990
from us, all the information that
they're collecting from us, uh,

42
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,760
with Google and how they're monetizing
that and selling or sharing that

43
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:46,761
information with other people with really
without our knowledge or agreement.

44
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,140
Or You, you're fully sober
guy did not sober guy. Yeah,

45
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:56,880
I was a mess. I mentally,
I felt like a mess.

46
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:59,710
I mean I was, I never killed anybody
or anything, but I was at, I mean,

47
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,550
I'm an alcoholic.

48
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,600
Yeah. I shit in the girl's
shoe and yeah, I had some fun.

49
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:08,350
Oh yeah. Girl Shoe. Why
what'd she do to you? Uh,

50
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,920
nothing just invited me to stay at
her house. I don't remember doing it.

51
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:14,890
I was in a blackout or
whatever, but um, yeah,

52
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:19,840
I was all fucked up and then I woke up
and, uh, I had to Piss so bad. Like,

53
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:23,260
I just woke up in the bed and I was like,
I got a Penn and I was like,

54
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,950
I don't know where I am. I actually
had a flight, I had to cross.

55
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,040
I was going to the Seattle comedy
competition. Did you ever do that? No.

56
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,800
It was like, it's like a month long
competition and uh, yeah. And it's not,

57
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,350
they call it Seattle, but it's like
actually all over Washington state.

58
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,750
It's like a, you drive like three hours
a night. It's pretty crazy. Yeah. But,

59
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:47,350
um, I had to like be there
the next day for a month.

60
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:52,351
I had like a 10:00 AM flight and I woke
up at like nine 20 in the morning and

61
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:54,970
this girl's bed and I was like,
I gotta get the Hell Outta here.

62
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:57,700
But first I gotta Piss. If I piss in
this woman's bed, it's going to be,

63
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,410
it's going to be horrible.

64
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,520
So I ran to the bathroom and found the
bathroom pissed for like a half hour,

65
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,090
you know, those. And I've tried to like
put my shit to get my, I'm all fucked up.

66
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,470
And then I came out into her living
room and her table had been like,

67
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,920
smashed like a Chris Farley fucking table.

68
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,990
And you're that feeling
when you're fucked up,

69
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:19,780
we are looking at something and
you're like, that was definitely me.

70
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,320
I can just feel like, ah, I'm pretty
sure I'm responsible for that.

71
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,050
And then I was like,
I gotta go find my clothes.

72
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:28,720
So I went back into her room and uh,

73
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,130
on the way there I saw like
kind of like footprints of poop.

74
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,540
And then I came in and she had a high
top Nike sneaker that just had like a big

75
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,900
yeah.
And there was some little pieces around.

76
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,470
And then there was like a big puddle
of urine too. Like I didn't just,

77
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,880
cause you never just shit.
So I like pissed and shit,

78
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,470
but I got it inner sneaker, like I
fucking nailed it. Purpose. Well I think,

79
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,740
I mean I was in a blackout so by,

80
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,450
but I think what happened was I thought
it was a toilet because that's not like

81
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:05,140
my sense of humor. I'm not like a, I've
never been like a take a shit places.

82
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,980
So I think I just saw a cylinder twin.
Well if it's dark,

83
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:10,830
it looks it's black and it's a whole,

84
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,460
how big is her fucking choose
real big feat. It was, um,

85
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,430
it was a big woman now, so I shit
in there. And then what did what,

86
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,560
did you lose contact with her
after this or no, so I was like,

87
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:25,840
I gotta get Outta here cause
I gotta go catch this flight.

88
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:29,950
So I took my sock and put it on like
a, like a puppet, like a hand puppet,

89
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,820
a sock puppet and just kind of picked
it up that way and then turn the sock

90
00:05:33,821 --> 00:05:35,730
inside out. Right. Which is like,

91
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,440
like almost like a shit in
the sock and threw that away.

92
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:42,670
And I tried to wipe up as much of
the, she asleep? No, no, they're gone.

93
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,460
Oh my God. I thought it's
like nine 30 in the morning.

94
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,360
I thought I just went so crazy
that they all fled their own home.

95
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,020
So then I get in the cab to go to
the airport. I'm missing my flight.

96
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,830
And I texted the girl and I was
like, I'm so, I want to kill myself.

97
00:05:56,831 --> 00:06:00,460
Like can never I can show. Sorry. Did
you tell her that? I shouldn't know.

98
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,430
I figured she knew. So she wrote back.
It's okay. Yeah. Uh, it was, it was crazy.

99
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,740
Crazy night. It was fun or
whatever. And I was like, man,

100
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:11,600
this girl must fucking party. Like,
she's just like, okay, with the shooting,

101
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,800
I was like,
this woman's wild.

102
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,310
Historically there's been
bears. I mean, he's got,

103
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,400
they've got like 40 or 50 bears in
this little confined space. I mean,

104
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:20,690
there's nothing,
there's no more,

105
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,380
no greater abomination of nature
that I can imagine than a solitary,

106
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:27,680
largely solitary animals. So the confined
to a bunch of them of the species.

107
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,750
And then historically they have ripped
each other apart. And Dude, it's crazy.

108
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:36,680
I can actually delve into marine
lens history deeper than I can. Uh,

109
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,260
you get to hear the full spectrum of
some of the things that happen in bear in

110
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:42,800
mind. And it's important to note. It
was a different time, different times,

111
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,110
different things happen. And that's
just, that was the, that was the,

112
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,080
that was the norm. It's, it's, you know,

113
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,180
starkly contrasting time to
when marina and started. So,

114
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,030
but the stories are like really,
um,

115
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,870
it's jawdropping it's really
jaw dropping stuff, but

116
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,660
it's on one hand when you have children
and you bring a child to the zoo,

117
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,230
on one hand it's really fascinating to
watch this little person look at all

118
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:13,970
these different animals and freak out and,
and see how amazing it is.

119
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,720
But that's the only pro is
introducing human beings,

120
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:22,580
like little human beings in
particular to these animals.

121
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:27,790
Everything else is a con except for the
animals that are like really endangered

122
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,890
and they protect them and help breed them.

123
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:34,520
And then sometimes they were responsible
for some reintroduction efforts.

124
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,610
But other than that, it's
an animal prison man. Weird.

125
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,620
I don't take the position or ideal,
I don't,

126
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:42,650
I'm not at this person that's trying
to represent an ideology necessarily.

127
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:43,970
I'm not against all zoos,

128
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:48,170
but I have to say that there's nothing
more sad than seeing elephants. Cats,

129
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,730
bears. I mean, cats, man, the cats, when
they're pacing back and forth, I mean,

130
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,340
just get him out of there. Who
serve, whose purpose are you serving?

131
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,220
Is that good for you? I mean, seeing an
animal that's got zoo coast, this, I mean,

132
00:07:58,221 --> 00:07:59,450
it's a, it's, it's,

133
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,570
it's a mental case and we don't know
what the fuck's going on in their head.

134
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:04,730
So we have no idea who those
people just to watch and think,

135
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:07,160
this is just maybe normal or something.
Right. A lot of people were not.

136
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,250
See because the veil is only now it's
sort of coming off and people are started

137
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,800
now getting the truth, uh, on the matters.

138
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,510
You start to see things for what they are.

139
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,780
Like if Tom Cruise decided to come out
of Tom Cruise is gay and he decided to

140
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:20,060
come out,
like that'd be a real problem.

141
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,570
You know what? I was talking to somebody
about this the other day, you know,

142
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,210
it would be a hilarious movie idea,

143
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:29,580
a gay couple because Tom
Cruise and John Travolta,

144
00:08:29,581 --> 00:08:34,290
John Travolta,
John Travolta gets kidnapped and gay.

145
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:38,790
Tom Cruise has to save his gay husband
John Travolta and, but other than that,

146
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,230
it's a real action movie.
Wow. It's just gay. I like it.

147
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,820
Would that be fucking cool?
Like just a straight get,

148
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,190
if anyone out there's a screenwriter
that have addict cause I'm never going to

149
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:52,890
write it.
Would that fly when people enjoy that?

150
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,670
Like if it was really good like
John Wick style? I think it would,

151
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,580
I really think it would if it was,
if the guy does kick,

152
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:04,581
it's not like gay guys are like a feet
and if I know plenty of like rough gay

153
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:09,120
guys that will whoop your
ass bro. Bears Bro. They got,

154
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,490
they got their own ground. That's how
fucking bad these guys are. Uh, yeah,

155
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:17,670
I too really it would be fucking so cool.
Like,

156
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:20,490
and he was gonna yet cause that's how I
feel with someone like drunk coming out.

157
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:22,290
I'm like, I don't care. Okay.

158
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,310
I know it's never come up are we've
been good friends for a decade.

159
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,360
Just never came up. Yeah. Like it. He
didn't seem that interested in women,

160
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,360
but I don't,
I also don't think he's not introduced.

161
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:36,810
Just maybe there's definitely a spectrum.
Right. And so people are Joseph.

162
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,670
Yeah. And that's fine too.
Yeah. Yeah. I'm also not Matt,

163
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,980
like if I were on the spectrum, I
think I would absolutely do it. Yeah.

164
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,520
I'm just not on the spectrum like I,
but in terms of opportunity,

165
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:53,040
there's a lot of nights a year, Joe.
Oh yeah. There's 365 nights a year.

166
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:56,050
Oh yeah, you can, you're not going
to do the Pussy Dick Pussy. Yeah.

167
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,310
Go back and you go back and forth.
Same Nice. Split it up. Dahmer.

168
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,700
I had the best joke about that.
He goes, he goes, I, he goes,

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,830
this is how little I give a fuck.
He goes,

170
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:09,060
I wish I was gay just so I could
come out. Yeah. It was, I wish,

171
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,930
I wish I had a secret like that.
Yeah.

172
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,230
That's how little I give a fuck.
It's true.

173
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,170
It's like his joke about I'm
gaining weight for a movie.

174
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,370
I don't know what the movie is yet,
but it's fucking great joke.

175
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,180
Um, yeah, but the gay action movie
would fantastic. I like it. I do too. I,

176
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,070
within a year or two,
people would be definitely ready for it.

177
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,990
You want to hear the scariest Ai
Story? I know. Oh, it's old, right?

178
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,120
It's like an dim the
lights from the catalog,

179
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,630
but it's from like the early
days and gather round children.

180
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,990
This is like early days of Darpa.
Okay.

181
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:51,210
And this is when we were really seriously
afraid that the Russians were going to

182
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:52,410
send,
you know,

183
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,670
a hundred thermo nuclear warheads at
Washington and take out the whole country.

184
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,990
Okay. Right. So Darpa sets up this
station at the top of the world,

185
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:06,330
um, to monitor the Soviet
launch. So that, you know,

186
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:11,331
cause it only takes 24 minutes for an
ICBM to get from the launch pad in Russia

187
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:17,580
to hit New York or Washington. Okay.
So we set up the station up there,

188
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:23,100
um, and to monitor this. So we would
have some kind of a jump on this. Okay.

189
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:25,950
Like we'd learned at about eight
minutes. My God, the, you know,

190
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,060
it was a radar station.

191
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:32,630
That station called the [inaudible] site
or Jay site is connected to the no rad

192
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:36,150
station in Cheyenne Mountain, you know
the one from the movies, right. Okay.

193
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,900
And it's like the first week of business
and the guys that are sitting there in

194
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:46,110
the station looking for the alert are
sitting there and they've been trained

195
00:11:46,111 --> 00:11:50,010
like the alerts never go off and all of
a sudden the alerts go from one, two,

196
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:52,530
three, four. Number
five is end game. Okay?

197
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:57,830
So information that the technicians
are getting is now 1000 Soviet thermo

198
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:03,901
nuclear missiles are on their way to
Washington DC with 99.9% certainty.

199
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,200
Actual story. Okay, the guy panics but he
trusts, he says, wait a minute, you know,

200
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:12,880
cause he supposed to
now give a launch code,

201
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,980
let's try and get the
generals on the phone.

202
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:17,270
They can't get the Pentagon
general in charge of no Rad.

203
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,970
They get a Canadian guy named general
Sleeman and slim and you know,

204
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,390
my God, we should we launch, should
we launch Slamon's like wait a minute.

205
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,100
Human thought.

206
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:32,460
He remembered that the night before he
thought he saw Chris Jeff on TV at the

207
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:36,460
UN. You know that him, he's famously
banging his shoe and he says,

208
00:12:36,461 --> 00:12:39,910
where's Cruise Jeff? Right now
they check. He's in New York City.

209
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,860
Why would the Soviets send a thousand
nuclear weapons are way while their own

210
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,160
leaders in New York. They
said, I don't know sir,

211
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:53,161
but the radar returns are reporting this
and they're so someone had the idea at

212
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:56,230
that be mu site to go outside

213
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,450
and lo and behold,
what was there a big full moon.

214
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:07,410
The system was reading the moon moving
and misinterpreted it as a thousand

215
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,610
nuclear thermonuclear ICBM.

216
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,880
BMS coming crummy didn't launch.

217
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,300
So we came that close to the
end of the world. I mean,

218
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,660
and it's an astonishing story.
The documents are now declassified,

219
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:28,110
but is this an actual indication of
why that element of human intervention,

220
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,790
why trust, why other information like, oh,

221
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:37,420
I think I saw Khrushchev on the TV
last night is so important because the

222
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:42,421
machine said with 99.9%
certainty this is happening,

223
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,750
you ma, we must launch in
retaliation. True Story.
