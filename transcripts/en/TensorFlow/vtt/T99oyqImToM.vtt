00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.380
TIM DAVIS: Dance Like
enables you to learn

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.740
how to dance on a mobile phone.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.070
CHRIS MCCLANAHAN: TensorFlow
can take our smartphone camera

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.790
and turn it into a powerful
tool for analyzing body pose.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.290
ANDREW SELLE: We
have team at Google

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.820
that had developed
an advanced model

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.525
for doing pose segmentation.

00:00:19.525 --> 00:00:21.400
So we were able to take
their implementation,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.400
convert it into TensorFlow Lite.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.550
Once we had it there, we
could use it directly.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.070
SHIKHAR AGARWAL: To run all
the AI and machine learning

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.920
models to detect
body parts, it's

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.210
a very computationally
expensive process,

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.650
where we need to use
the on-device GPU.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.440
TensorFlow library
made it possible so

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.500
that we can leverage all
these resources, the compute,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.507
on the device and give
a great user experience.

00:00:46.507 --> 00:00:48.090
ANDREW SELLE: Teaching
people to dance

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.920
is just the tip of the iceberg.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.970
Anything that involves movement
would be a great candidate.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.710
TIM DAVIS: And so that
means people who have skills

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.230
can teach other
people those skills.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.230
And AI is just this layer
that really just interfaces

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.610
between the two things.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.055
When you empower
people to teach people,

00:01:05.055 --> 00:01:06.930
I think that's really
when you have something

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.460
that is game changing.
