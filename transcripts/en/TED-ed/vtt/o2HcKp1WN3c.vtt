00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:10.436
My name is Shayna Cody,

00:00:10.436 --> 00:00:13.119
and I go to Bard High School Early College.

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:14.716
I'm a twin.

00:00:14.716 --> 00:00:18.285
I'm so competitive with my twin sister.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:21.092
We compete about everything.

00:00:21.092 --> 00:00:23.874
When my sister finishes homework before me,

00:00:23.874 --> 00:00:25.584
she usually rubs it in my face.

00:00:25.584 --> 00:00:28.815
We're just so competitive about everything.

00:00:28.815 --> 00:00:32.804
I think a fully-rounded education is not just sitting there

00:00:32.804 --> 00:00:34.629
doing the work that's required of you,

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:37.396
but actually taking the time to, like, focus in

00:00:37.396 --> 00:00:41.962
and learn what you can out of your classes.

00:00:41.962 --> 00:00:43.402
I feel like, whatever I do,

00:00:43.402 --> 00:00:47.439
I want to be the best at what I do.

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:49.404
Failure is not an option.

00:00:51.388 --> 00:00:53.846
My dream job when I leave school

00:00:53.846 --> 00:00:56.610
is to become a cardiologist.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.652
Every Saturday morning, I go to a program

00:00:59.652 --> 00:01:02.387
called The Lang Youth Medical Program.

00:01:02.387 --> 00:01:04.256
It's a pre-medical program where we prepare

00:01:04.256 --> 00:01:06.499
to become doctors.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:07.840
It's a six-year program.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.268
I got in at 7th grade in my middle school,

00:01:10.268 --> 00:01:13.145
and they stay with you all the way up until 12th grade.

00:01:13.145 --> 00:01:14.666
We learn about viruses,

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:17.736
we learn about the body.

00:01:17.736 --> 00:01:19.506
I feel I've grown a whole lot

00:01:19.506 --> 00:01:21.580
since I've been in high school.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.506
I feel like I've had to grow up.

00:01:23.506 --> 00:01:24.710
You can't be the same person

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.561
that you were when you went in there,

00:01:26.561 --> 00:01:30.345
otherwise, you're not going to get anything out of it.
