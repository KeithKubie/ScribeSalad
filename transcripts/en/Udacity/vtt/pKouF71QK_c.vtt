00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.380
The correct answer is, everything after the opening

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.170
em tag is italicized. If your browser crashes you

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.340
should quit using Internet Explorer, and you know,

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.130
maybe this last answer is more truthful than joke,

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.500
because [LAUGH] there's definitely a world in which

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.690
browsers behave in a somewhat. Unpredictable manner, but I

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.820
think in this in this simple example, everything

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.270
after the em tag should be italicized. And let's

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.510
let's try it out in our browser just to be certain. Okay, text is where I left

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.820
it. No closing em tag, update. Cool, everything's still

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.025
italicized. If I were to you know, move this

00:00:37.025 --> 00:00:41.720
em tag closing em tag here. And update, we

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.720
can see that HTML straightens up because just the

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.060
em is around this phrase. Enough of those simple

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.820
tags, let's learn something a little bit more complex.
