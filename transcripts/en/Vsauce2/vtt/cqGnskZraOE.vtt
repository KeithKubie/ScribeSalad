00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.930
A bird-inspired drone developed by EPFL uses
artificial wings made of fiberglass covered

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.600
in nylon which allow for easier maneuverability
in high winds.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.170
And SALTO the leaping robot from UC Berkeley
has the highest robotic vertical jump and

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.180
can even wall jump look at SALTO I love SALTO.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.180
Vsauce!

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.180
Kevin here.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.460
This is Mind Blow!

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.779
Kissenger lets you send and receive kisses
through your phone.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.800
The attachment features high precision force
sensors under a silicon lip to measure your

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.890
kiss and transmit it to the device on the
kiss receiver’s phone.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.179
This actually isn’t a new idea in fact Mind
Blow #16 back in 2011 and on Vsauce1…and

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:50.410
Mind Blow #46 in 2012 covered prototypes for
robot kissing devices.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.229
There’s even another device called Kissenger
by a company called Lovotics.

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:59.929
But it looks like this new kissenger from
mixed reality lab is the most practical yet

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:05.400
since it's significantly more compact and
interfaces directly with your phone.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.440
BAE Systems envisions a future where lenses
are made with laser beams controlling hot

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.440
air bubbles.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.230
The Laser Developed Atmospheric Lens system
creates lenses by layering hot air bubbles

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.780
on colder air using laser pulses which then
refract light.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.170
This concept is similar to how how current,
solid lenses made of plastic or glass work

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.310
but making one out of air would allow it to
be much larger and maneuverable.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.950
This technique could also be used to deflect
laser attacks by dispersing the beam.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.940
So basically like laser beam shields in sci
fi movies.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.260
But this is just a concept for now - no prototypes.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.390
Yet.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.730
WaveOptics is developing wearable augmented
reality technology to overlay computer graphics

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.240
on the real world.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.140
Their headset, nicknamed “the ghost” is
designed for developers and not as a consumer

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.280
device, and they say their fully transparent
display creates sharp holograms with a wide

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.400
field of view.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.979
Their proof of concept videos show how this
could be used in work and leisure scenarios

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.799
- basically getting one step closer to turning
the world into a videogame.

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.709
ICAROS is a fitness flying virtual reality
game controller machine.

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.909
The active VR experience connects wirelessly
to a headset and demands your full body to

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.319
control flying through the game.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.189
Navigating inside the rings requires shifting
your weight and is more like a futuristic

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.079
exercise device than a gaming peripheral.

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:39.030
Alright that's the last VR story for this
episode...okay one more VR story.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.400
AxonVR wants you to feel virtual reality.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.650
The HaptX is a haptic textile that can provide
vibration, tactile and thermal feedback for

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.239
feeling virtual shape, texture, weight and
temperature.

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.930
They claim the range of touch varies from
the brush of a butterfly’s wing to the impact

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.169
of a punch and the goal is for their system
to be available in theme parks and arcades

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:04.769
and not likely in your house.

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:05.769
Unfortunately.

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.040
A soft robotic sleeve can restore normal blood
flow after heart failure.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.129
Traditionally, a failing heart has its blood
removed and passed through tubes and pumps

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.919
which increase the risk of blood clotting
but this new device works without contacting

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:21.919
blood.

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:26.189
There’s still more work to be done before
this moves onto human trials but soft robot

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.260
heart pumping is awesome and I just wanted
to show you.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.260
So yeah.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.569
The sun and footsteps are all that’s needed
to power these new streetlights.

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:43.700
EnGoPlanet installed kinetic tiles in Las
Vegas to help power streetlights, wifi hotspots,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.719
video surveillance and USB ports for mobile
device charging.

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:52.840
The panels generate between 4 to 8 watts from
pedestrian foot traffic and dependent upon

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.079
the success of this four light trial, the
plan is to roll out large-scale installations

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.819
on the Vegas strips and New York City parks.

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.579
EnChroma are glasses designed to alleviate
red-green color blindness.

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:12.470
The lenses feature a patent pending multinotch
filter which cut out sharp wavelength of light

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.470
to enhance specific colors and separate the
red and green cones.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.070
This helps to counter the overlap between
red and green which affects those with that

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.630
form of color blindness.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.920
They allow people, for instance to easily
identify the color difference between a green

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.340
traffic light from a blue sky background.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.600
Finally, researchers at Intel Labs created
an algorithm for mobile robots to navigate

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.150
cluttered environments.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.400
The quadcopter is able to reach its goal through
this maze and navigate two hundred interwoven

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.360
strings and twenty poles.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.510
It's a fun drone obstacle course.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.620
I’m gonna leave you with large-scale programmable
disassembly of tiny robots.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.090
And as always - thanks for watching.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:11.630
Sound waves are picked up by this wonderful
mechanical ear, the microphone, which is really

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.860
a glorified telephone transmitter.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:20.690
The power from the microphone is amplified
about ten million times by these vacuum tubes,

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.900
making the voice current strong enough to
operate the machine that photographs the sound.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.040
Do you follow me?

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:36.060
And then this amplified current, is carried
by wires along through the theater and down

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:42.310
to the screen on the stage to connect with
the loudspeakers.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:49.280
This is a typical layout of the stage set
with two horns behind the screen.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:54.440
The receivers connected to the horns convert
the electrical vibrations back into sound

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.570
waves exactly the way the telephone receiver
operates.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:03.310
So that while the picture is being shown the
sound, which was recorded, is reproduced in

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.700
step with the picture.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.340
The screen is full of small holes so that
the horns may be placed behind the screen

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.190
to let the sound through.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.560
This gives the illusion that the sound is
coming from the image of the speaker.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.610
Simple, isn't it?

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.960
Huh?
