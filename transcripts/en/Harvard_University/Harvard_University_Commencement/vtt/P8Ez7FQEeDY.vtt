00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:11.190
Congratulations Class of 2018 we should
be so proud of ourselves for all our

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.080
accomplishments and hard work and bla
bla bla bla bla bla bla

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.020
this week we have been hearing that
non-stop friends and family take

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.779
pictures of us as if we were the John
Harvard statue itself hug us to make up

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.850
for our lack of physical contact over
the past four years and continually

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.640
commend us on the most wonderful
achievement of our lives thus far

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.800
Harvard but let's be honest with
ourselves it's been far from a smooth

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.140
journey let's not forget that you
contracted mono within the first week of

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.910
arriving to campus you sold your soul to
David Malin for an I took CS50 t-shirt

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.620
you never dated anyone seriously or at
all and your grandma is panicking how

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.280
could you do this to her you
concentrated in English or in economics

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.310
but you still can't explain inflation
you got a 32% on your or go mid term and

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.259
worse a b-plus in the Hebrew Bible you
slacker you drank more wine than water

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.820
and wished more than once that someone
had stopped you from finishing those

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.880
scallion pancakes at the Kong over four
years you made a total of three phone

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.110
calls home and you stopped practicing
the piano you were so good and now

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.170
you're still in the job search process
these things take time mom and dad so to

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.909
all that I say congratulations

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.229
we did make it through a significant
amount though we trekked through a

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.179
hundred and ten inches of snow freshman
year broke thousands of plastic forks

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.129
eating red spice chicken during the HUD
strike and came to realize those wisdom

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:16.640
tooth surgeries were actually the mumps
we learned a whole new language in which

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.769
blocking meant make making your first
harvard enemies long distance meant an

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.819
eight minute shuttle ride and advising
meant receiving an email once a semester

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.019
we learned to question our surroundings
I've heard some interesting ones over

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:44.930
the past few years such as is anyone in
the Lampoon funny how does Crimson key

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.540
measure facial symmetry does Harvard
model Congress actually attend any

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.780
conferences during their fully funded
vacations why would women want to join

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.010
the Hasty Pudding or anyone for that
matter

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.459
why do Harvard acapella groups purposely
arrange their music to sound off-key and

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.329
what does she mean when she says she
took on her position as punch master of

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:17.310
the bee to truly make a difference
these are all valid questions and for

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.969
answers please email Dean Khurana at FAS.
harvard.edu with USGSO sanctions in

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:29.909
the subject line for a guaranteed quick
response but how much of this really

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:35.609
matters from the moments we walked for
the yard as wide-eyed freshmen as former

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:39.450
valedictorians debate champions and
team captains

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.099
we have questioned our choices and
performances we enrolled in a course

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:49.709
without realizing called rejection 10a
which although tough was still more

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:56.609
tolerable than expose 20 in my first two
years of college I went through eight

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.349
comp processes and got into only two of
those organizations I was rejected from

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.329
classes anyone wanting to write a
25-page paper on carbon taxes should be

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:13.139
allowed to do so and worse I was quaded
and with each apparent failure or

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:21.389
letdown I questioned myself was I not
smart enough not talented enough not

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:27.690
Upper East Side enough but the number of
times we applied to expose 40 or the

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.070
number of times we comp the advocate and
still didn't get in or the number of

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.389
times we sat on a bench during a
basketball game is not what defines us

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:42.180
what matters is what we did next
we found the strength to try again to

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.979
discover another creative outlook and to
wake up the next morning and train even

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:53.909
harder what matters is that we learn
from our mistakes to never again speak

00:04:53.909 --> 00:05:00.830
to a crimson reporter and to only go to
UHS if you wanted an IV after yardfest

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:08.639
so tomorrow when we exit these gates we
will take with us not only our GPAs or

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:14.820
hoops prizes or capacity to write a
20-page paper in one night but also our

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:21.389
grit and determination our ability to
face the inevitable challenges ahead we

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:27.150
will of course also take with us our
understanding of very useful theoretical

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.080
models and hype
medical thought experiments a perception

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.590
that 7 minutes late is still on time and
a dependence on Lesley Kerwin to tell us

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:44.700
when to wear our snow boots we have much
to be grateful for Thank You Harvard for

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.590
giving us friends to wake us up for our
9 a.m. finals for giving us grad

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.260
students to lead us through four hours
of silence in section and for somehow

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:02.940
making our SLS's count as SPU's so
family and friends to couch our cameras

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:09.800
open your arms for that hug and join me
in celebrating the class of 2018

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.660
let's celebrate all the battles we have
lost and all the messes we have made

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:25.260
class of 2018 keep venturing keep
falling down and keep getting right back

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:37.100
up thank you
