00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880
 

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.300
Welcome to the presentation
on torque.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.060
So, if you watched the
presentation on the center of

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.690
mass, which you should have, you
might have gotten a little

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.850
bit of a glancing view
of what torque is.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.350
And now we'll do some
more in detail.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.680
So in general, from the center
of mass video, we learned, if

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.745
this is a ruler and this is the
ruler's center of mass.

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:26.330
 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.259
And if I were to apply force at
the center of mass, I would

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.820
accelerate the whole ruler in
the direction of the force.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.810
If I have the force applying at
the center of mass there,

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.240
the whole ruler would accelerate
in that direction.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.510
And we'd figure it out by
taking the force we're

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.000
applying to it and dividing
by the mass of the ruler.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.020
And in that center of mass
video, I imply-- well, what

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.040
happens if the force
is applied here?

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.050
Away from the center of mass?

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.960
Well, in this situation, the
object, assuming it's a free

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.750
floating object on the Space
Shuttle or something, it will

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.450
rotate around the
center of mass.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.410
And that's also true, if we
didn't use the center of mass,

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.810
but instead we fixed
the point.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.110
Let's say we had
another ruler.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.310
Although it has less height
than the previous one.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.160
Instead of worrying about its
center of mass, let's say that

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.930
it's just fixed at
a point here.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:23.980
Let's say it's fixed here.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.450
So if this could be the hand
of a clock, and it's nailed

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.510
down to the back of the
clock right there.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.160
So if we were trying to rotate
it, it would always rotate

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.170
around this point.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.800
And the same thing
would happen.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.830
If I were to apply a force at
this point, maybe I could

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.550
break the nail off the back of
the clock, or something, but I

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.830
won't rotate this needle or
this ruler, or whatever you

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.770
want to call it.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.440
But if I would apply a force
here, I would rotate the ruler

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.440
around the pivot point.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.010
And this force that's applied a
distance away from the pivot

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.080
point, or we could say from the
axis of rotation, or the

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.190
center of mass.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.770
That's called torque.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.949
And torque, the letter for
torque is this Greek, I think

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.860
that's tau, it's a curvy T.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.640
And torque is defined as
force times distance.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.560
And what force and what
distance is it?

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.030
It's the force that's
perpendicular to the object.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.960
I guess you could say to
the distance vector.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.170
If this is the distance vector--
let me do it in a

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.110
different color.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.790
If this is the distance vector,
the component of the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.750
force is perpendicular to
this distance vector.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.100
And this is torque.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.320
And so what are its units?

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.810
Well, force is newtons, and
distance is meters, so this is

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.570
newton meters.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.010
And you're saying, hey Sal,
newtons times meters, force

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.440
times distance, that looks
an awful lot like work.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.840
And it's very important to
realize that this isn't work,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.300
and that's why we won't
call this joules.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.130
Because in work, what
are we doing?

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.010
We are translating an object.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.960
If this is an object, and I'm
applying a force, I'm taking

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.610
the force over the distance
in the same

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.000
direction as the force.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.880
Here the distance and
the force are

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.750
parallel to each other.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.910
You could say the distance
vector and the force vector

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.850
are in the same direction.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.090
Of course, that's
translational.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.350
The whole object
is just moving.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.940
It's not rotating or anything.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.340
In the situation of torque,
let me switch colors.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.000
The distance vector, this is the
distance from the fulcrum

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.770
or the pivot point of the center
of mass, to where I'm

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:34.840
applying the force.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.640
This distance vector is
perpendicular to the force

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.790
that's being applied.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.930
So torque and work are
fundamentally two different

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.940
things, even though their
units are the same.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.660
And this is a little
bit of notational.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.610
This distance is often called
the moment arm distance.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.960
And I don't know where
that came from.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.250
Maybe one of you all can write
me a message saying where it

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.180
did come from.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.200
And often in some of your
physics classes they'll often

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.400
call torque as a moment.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.970
But we'll deal with
the term torque.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.280
And that's more fun, because
eventually we can understand

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.630
concepts like torque
horsepower in cars.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.230
So let's do a little bit of
math, hopefully I've given you

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.930
a little bit of intuition.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.510
So let's say I had this ruler.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.780
And let's say that this is its
pivot point right here.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.960
So it would rotate around
that point.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.220
It's nailed to the wall
or something.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.990
And let's say that I apply a
force-- Let's say the moment

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.760
arm distance.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.532
So let's say this distance,
let me do it

00:04:41.532 --> 00:04:43.690
in different color.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.740
Let's say that this distance
right here is 10 meters.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:57.300
And I were to apply a force of 5
newtons perpendicular to the

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.710
distance vector, or to dimension
of the moment arm,

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.040
you could view it either way.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.300
So torque is pretty easy
in this situation.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:11.580
Torque is going to be equal to
the force, 5 newtons, times

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.010
the distance, 10.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.816
So it would be 50
newton meters.

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.910
And you're probably saying,
well, Sal, how do I know if

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.490
this torque is going to be
positive or negative?

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.880
And this is where there's just a
general arbitrary convention

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.550
in physics.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.190
And it's good to know.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.150
If you're rotating clockwise
torque is negative.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.990
Let me go the other way.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.930
If you were rotating
counterclockwise, like we were

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.650
in this example, rotating
counterclockwise, the opposite

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.250
direction of which a clock
would move in.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.560
Torque is positive.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.540
And if you rotate clockwise
the other

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.250
way, torque is negative.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.680
So clockwise is negative.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.390
And I'm not going to go into
the whole cross product and

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.210
the linear algebra of torque
right now, because I think

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.790
that's a little bit
beyond the scope.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.450
But we'll do that
once we do more

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.160
mathematically intensive physics.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.190
But, so, good enough.

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.790
There's a torque of
50 newton meters.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.390
And that's all of the torque
that is acting

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.040
on this object .

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.330
So it's going to rotate
in this direction.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.910
And we don't have the tools yet
to figure out how quickly

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:10.660
it will rotate.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.010
But we know it will rotate.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.510
And that's vaguely useful.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.100
But what if I said that the
object is not rotating?

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:24.940
And that I have another
force acting here?

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:35.180
And let's say that that force
is-- I don't know, let me make

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.570
up something, that's 5
meters to the left

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.820
of the pivot point.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:44.000
 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.130
If I were tell you that this
object does not rotate.

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.610
So if I tell you that the object
is not rotating, that

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:56.340
means the net torque on this
ruler must be 0, because it's

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:00.380
not-- its rate of change of
rotation is not changing.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.860
I should be a little exact.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:07.600
If I'm applying some force here,
and still not rotating,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.020
then we know that the net torque
on this object is 0.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.730
So what is the force
being applied here?

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.750
Well, what is the net torque?

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.170
Well, it's this torque, which
we already figured out.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.740
It's going in the clockwise
direction.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.340
So it's 5-- Let me do it
in a brighter color.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.480
5 times 10.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.960
And then the net torque.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.580
The sum of all the torques
have to be equal to 0.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:32.510
So what's this torque?

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.480
So let's call this f.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.750
This is the force.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.790
So, plus-- Well, this force is
acting in what direction?

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.110
Clockwise or counterclockwise?

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.810
Well, it's acting in the
clockwise direction.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.710
This force wants to make the
ruler rotate this way.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.040
So this is actually going
to be a negative torque.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.570
So let's say, put a negative
number here times f, times its

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.630
moment arm distance, times
5, and all of this

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.930
has to equal 0.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:05.300
The net torque is 0, because the
object's rate of change of

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.990
rotation isn't changing, or if
it started off not rotating,

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.660
it's still not rotating.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:16.300
So here we get 50 minus
5 f is equal to 0.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.440
That's 50 is equal to 5 f.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.290
f is equal to 10.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.700
If we follow the units all the
way through, we would get that

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.460
f is equal to 10 newtons.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.220
So that's interesting.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.289
I applied double the force
at half the distance.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:38.409
And it offsetted half the force
at twice the distance.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:41.059
And that should all connect, or
start to connect, with what

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:43.309
we talked about with mechanical
advantage.

00:08:43.309 --> 00:08:45.270
You could view it
the other way.

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:48.160
Let's say these are people
applying these forces.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.430
Say this guy over here is
applying 10 newtons.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:51.410
He's much stronger.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.240
He's twice as strong as
this guy over here.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.310
But because this guy is twice
as far away from the pivot

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.820
point, he balances
the other guy.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.810
So you can kind of view it
as this guy having some

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.340
mechanical advantage or having
a mechanical advantage of 2.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.330
And watch the mechanical
advantage videos if that

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:07.910
confuses you a little bit.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.550
But this is where to
torque is useful.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:13.600
Because if an object's rate of
rotation is not changing, you

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.200
know that the net torque
on that object is 0.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.910
And you can solve for the
forces or the distances.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.460
I'm about to run out of
time, so I will see

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.380
you in the next video.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:23.880
