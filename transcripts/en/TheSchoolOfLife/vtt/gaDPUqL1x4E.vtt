00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.560
One of the risks of social life is that we
will in the course of an evening or in the

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.510
kitchen at a party end up trapped with a person
of excessive conviction or, to put it more

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:17.320
colloquially, a bore. Bores can be found harbouring
any manner of obsessions: they may be deeply

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.070
concerned about grammar (and the ever increasing
misuse of the subjunctive) or believe that

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.890
modern architecture has alienated us from
ourselves; they may be horrified by the predatory

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.320
nature of contemporary capitalism or disgusted
by the whingeing of the environmental movement;

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.140
they might hate feminism or see misogyny in
every corner of life. Bores aren’t necessarily

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.290
wholly misguided, they may be making some
very good points along the way; but our discomfort

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.530
in their company arises from the intensity
and relentlessness of their manner. We long

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.340
that they might fall silent or, more realistically,
allow us to run away. Part of the reason why

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.950
bores bore is that we sense they are not being
entirely honest with us. They are certainly

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.759
upset, but the real reasons why don’t seem
on offer. We feel – in the midst of their

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.740
explanations – that their intensity is drawing
heat from a source beyond the argument as

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.429
they define it. They may well be emphasising
a range of studiously impersonal political,

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:21.020
economic or social factors, but we intuit
that there must be a more personal story from

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.279
which we, and their conscious selves, have
been carefully shielded. It’s a general

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:32.829
truth, in no way humiliating, that our seemingly-objective
adult concerns often have their roots in incidents

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:38.170
of personal vulnerability that unfolded long
ago and that may be awkward to recover and

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.979
discuss. Perhaps, when we were young, our
father lost his job to a corporation that

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.539
relocated their offices to south-east Asia:
the pay-off was relatively generous but the

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.749
shame intense for the family. Or perhaps we
have been passed over for promotion many times

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:58.840
by a young and conspicuously fashionable management
team with an interest in contemporary design.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.919
Or maybe there was once a woman we liked very
much, who was doing a PhD in gender studies

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:08.660
on the work of Julia Kristeva and who showed
signs of interest but then went off with a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.660
rival. It left us quite upset for a while.
We may not like to remember these incidents,

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.960
let alone tell new acquaintances about them
at parties. Yet they are still active within

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.840
us and seek some way, however disguised, of
expressing themselves. But all we know consciously

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.710
is that capitalism is the most abusive and
unsustainable economic system ever devised,

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.230
that modern architecture has shamefully forgotten
the nobility of the Classical tradition as

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.000
embodied by the works of Bramante and Schinkel
and that feminists are out to systematically

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.910
destroy the foundations of male earning power
in advanced economies. When we come across

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.410
such ardent views, it isn’t that we want
to hear less, it’s rather that we would

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.110
ideally want to hear more – but in another
direction, inwards rather than further into

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.630
socio-cultural and economic abstractions.
And we want to do this not from prurience

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.900
but because social life is guided by a wish
to encounter the reality of other people – which

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.030
is here being arcanely denied. Our boredom
is at base an impatient resentment at being

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.290
held at bay from the genuine traumas of another’s
life. The bore is never just other people.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.620
It is – in given areas – also always us.
When we take a psychological audit of our

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.710
intellectual ideas, we all stand to discover
that some of our concerns owe their intensity

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.631
to personal experiences which are hard to
define and frightening to own up to. This

00:03:33.631 --> 00:03:39.340
alerts us to how we might in the future respond
to the speeches of the over-zealous. The task

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.069
isn’t to engage head on with the matter
apparently at stake, it’s to gently try

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.590
to shift the conversation away from its official
target to its origins; sympathetically asking

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.380
when the issue first emerged and what more
personal associations might surround it. Even

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.790
if we never get there, the knowledge of the
structure of the problem should make us careful

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:07.380
not to engage people of excessive conviction
in too many prolonged head-to-head arguments.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.980
There is no point trying to list why capitalism
is not the worst system ever devised, why

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.719
modern architecture has its high-points and
why feminism remains necessary. This would

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:21.220
be to believe that the other’s rage was
a kind of intellectual error that could be

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.599
magically resolved with the help of one or
two deft ideas. The kind conversationalist

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:32.240
is more compassionately pessimistic. They
accept that the roots of certain of our convictions

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.860
lie deeply tangled in frightened, anxious
parts of the psyche unlikely to be accessible

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.979
outside psychotherapy. We’re so aware that
it could sound patronising to treat people

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:49.060
as less self-aware than they believe themselves
to be, we overlook that it may sometimes also

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.300
be the height of generosity to keep in mind
the complicated role that denied personal

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.889
wounds play in our ardent convictions. And
we should hope that others will repay us the

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.620
favour the next time we find ourselves delivering
long and ever more intense speeches about

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:14.240
the decline in handshaking, the colonisation
of Ecuador and the corruption of the English language.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:23.840
Did you know that The School Of Life is actually a place?  Ten places infact campus' all over the world from

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.240
