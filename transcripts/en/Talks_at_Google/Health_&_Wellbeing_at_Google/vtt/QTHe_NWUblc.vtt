[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.590
SPEAKER 1: Tulku Lobsang is
a Buddhist master, doctor

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.550
of Tibetan medicine, and
purveyor of transformation,

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.760
student of Dalai Lama, winner
of 14th Dalai Lama Award

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.890
of Excellence in Health
and Spirituality.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.660
He has reached the high level
of rinpoche and incarnate Lama.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.445
His teachings are
mostly related to wealth

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:29.710
of body, mind, and life.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.560
He is frequently wanted for
giving talks and workshops

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.650
at European business
schools and companies.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.890
His teachings apply to Buddhist
psychology and Tibetan medicine

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.220
techniques to influence
authentically [INAUDIBLE],,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.480
diversity in the workforce, and
freeing oneself from burnout.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.740
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Tulku.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.707
And I will give you a massive
thank you for coming to here.

00:00:54.707 --> 00:00:55.540
Thank you very much.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.340
TULKU LOBSANG: I think our
main subject today is how

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.209
the burnout--

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.940
correct?

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.315
I think that is
the main subject.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.590
Maybe I say this way first.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:28.000
In the Buddhist
tradition, relaxation

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.870
is the wisdom without learning.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.380
Relaxation is become
medicine without doctor.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.180
But in this modern
world, relaxation

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.660
we don't have so
much higher value.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.870
We think relaxation
means nothing important.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:06.020
But relaxation have many
things to give in our mind,

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.930
in our body, in our life.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:19.470
But they have one problem,
relaxation and laziness

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.880
is I'm used to tell same
mother and a different father.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.790
Yes, we don't know
what we really have.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.490
We don't know what we
are really practicing.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.040
Many people believe they're
practicing relaxation.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.666
But maybe we're
practicing the laziness.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.450
And we never thought--

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.260
or we never think laziness
how much have a power.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.321
But laziness is the
king of our life.

00:02:55.321 --> 00:03:00.980
He make trouble, all
kind of transformation.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.860
That's the reason Buddha
[INAUDIBLE] and he say,

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.770
laziness make you a dead
person without dying.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.450
You're not dead, but you look
like dead because of laziness.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.240
I'm sure many people you
say me, I'm not so lazy

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.630
person because I'm so busy.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.970
That's possible.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.866
But we have three
kind of laziness.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.840
We have laziness who
don't want to do anything.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.230
And this mean I'm
called gross laziness.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.080
It's not so dangerous, laziness.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.600
Everybody see you
are lazy, maybe

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.080
you also feel you are lazy.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.760
I don't know.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.090
And then, we have a
second kind of laziness.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.680
And the laziness who
always want to do tomorrow.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.630
In the Buddhism, we have
a special name this.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.385
But I'm just using
my simple English.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.710
Yes, laziness who always
want to do tomorrow.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.345
And this we call
subtle laziness.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.000
As who want to do
tomorrow is make

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.764
we have more stress than who
don't want to do anything.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.760
Correct?

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.750
Laziness who say, I don't want
to do anything, it's a problem,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.640
but it's not so complicated.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.900
It's clear.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.950
Very, very honest,
very, very authentic.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.054
But laziness who say, I
do tomorrow, you don't--

00:04:36.054 --> 00:04:37.470
you don't say, I
don't want to do.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.700
But you say, I do it tomorrow.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.580
And the second laziness we
call subtle laziness, but more

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.390
intelligent laziness.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.590
But one of the big,
strongest laziness

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.230
what we experience this
21 century, number third.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.720
And this is very difficult
to translate very well,

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:07.140
but we say laziness who always
want to do other things.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.880
I hope we translate--

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.620
I hope I make
translate perfectly.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.240
And the laziness who always want
to do other things, or laziness

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.400
who always need to
do other things.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.110
But I think better
is laziness who

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.180
always want to do other things.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.620
This name we call
great subtle laziness.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.800
We call hidden laziness.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.260
Nobody see you are lazy.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.110
You also don't
believe you are lazy.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.310
But this is a very, very
intelligent laziness.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:40.490
That is the killer of our
happiness, our health,

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:46.190
or to make stress
and [INAUDIBLE],,

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.560
the number third laziness.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.872
Why I talk here is
because of the relaxation.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:13.410
The relaxation is, I say, is
the wisdom without learning.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:18.680
Relaxation is the
medicine without doctors.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.820
Relaxation, happiness
without reason.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.440
Yes.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:34.970
But laziness is so
near with relaxation,

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.100
we really don't
know what we have

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.140
or what we're really practicing.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:47.850
Therefore, I recommend
to everyday life

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.100
to practice relaxation.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.920
But to practice relaxation
means you don't--

00:06:53.920 --> 00:07:01.380
I mean, relaxation does not mean
you need to do things slowly.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.150
Sometimes people misunderstand.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:07.960
Relaxing means it needs to
be slowly walk, slowly walk.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.061
OK, that's also good.

00:07:10.061 --> 00:07:10.560
Correct.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.380
Or sometimes people
think relaxation means

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.505
don't do anything.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:28.650
However, that's the
reason meditation

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:32.210
become very important.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:40.120
Meditation is-- meditation
is the way to relax.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.560
Yes, but what do
we need to relax?

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.270
What do we need to relax?

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:49.280
Relax our efforts.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.530
We are a world of effort.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.200
We are a world of the effort.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.560
Means we are world
of the condition.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.150
We are never free
of a condition.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:09.300
No matter how you success, we
are never free of a condition.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:15.030
Yes, that means we are
a world of the effort.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:23.000
And this effort-- sometimes
our effort becomes force.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.430
Force?

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.960
Effort, force,
whatever you call,

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.620
and that's make we are stress,
and burn out, or depression.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.299
I know we are not
enlightened world.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:42.210
We are a world of the condition.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.010
Means we are a
world of the effort.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:48.010
We are world of the effort means
we are world of the action.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.750
Whatever we want to
change in this world,

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.970
somehow we need action.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:03.670
But the action is not the
only way to solve things.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.880
But without action, also your
possible things to solve.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.020
Example, relaxation.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.980
Therefore, what we
relax and relax effort.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:23.630
But the very interesting
thing, sometimes we say relax.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.370
I say relax.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.310
Then mostly people
think they know relax.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.250
But I'm very interested
in when I say relax,

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:37.210
what picture in your
mind, in your head?

00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:38.490
I'm very interested in.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.260
I say, please, relax.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.190
What kind of a picture
comes in your mind?

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:48.780
Somewhere you sit,
lay down, oh, relax.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:53.015
What kind of a picture is come
in your mind when I say relax?

00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:07.610
However, what I want to
say, in my philosophy,

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:18.800
we believe 98 our troubles,
or 98 our problems,

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.530
the projection of your mind.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.830
Only two problems is not
projection of your mind.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:32.120
But 98-- yes, all
kind of problems--

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.610
is the projection of mind.

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:40.670
You relax five to 10
minutes, all this 98 problems

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:44.514
dissolve or disappear herself.

00:10:44.514 --> 00:10:45.055
It's amazing.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.240
Relaxation you
don't need to learn.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.260
Relaxation is beyond religion.

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.670
Relaxation beyond culture.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:02.270
Relaxation is beyond philosophy.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.415
Relaxation is beyond science.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.270
Something we never
need to learn.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:11.120
What?

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.380
Relaxation.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.370
But the problem, we don't
have anything something

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:18.440
we don't learn.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.800
That is a problem.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.580
That's the reason
I say relax, then

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:28.200
you start to thinking,
OK, how I do?

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.180
Because you always used to do
everything with your learning.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:36.660
But something you don't need to
learn and you become nervous.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.570
You don't believe how
possible this is a function?

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.390
And therefore, you
need to learn to relax.

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:43.710
And you never success to relax.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:50.420
Maybe you learn everything
OK, except relaxation.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.500
But let's say we start
to say, hello, relax.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.110
You say, OK.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.730
Then you start to try to relax.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.631
You try to do relax.

00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:11.130
You see?

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.650
I say don't do anything.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:19.630
That's what I'm talking.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:23.860
But you say, yes, OK, I'm trying
to relax, I'm trying to relax.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:27.940
You try to relax
that is not relax.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.520
Don't do relax.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.190
But you see, you
don't have-- we don't

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:34.955
have something we not learn.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.200
Therefore, you try to relax.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:44.000
And then, you go to relax
and this make you stress.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.090
Then many people say, I think
I'm not good with meditation.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.280
I think so, I'm not
good with meditation.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.770
Meditation is not function me.

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:57.430
I think the problem we
don't cut to the point.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.400
Maybe I like to
say maybe this way.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:16.690
Therefore, relaxation is
the medicine of all problem.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:27.870
Therefore, maybe you
try to every morning--

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:32.270
every morning try to
have a small relaxation,

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.980
five to 10 minutes.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:38.690
Each three hour, try to
remember the relaxation.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:42.650
Because each three hour,
our mind start to forget it,

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:46.621
what we promised ourself,
or what we give instruction

00:13:46.621 --> 00:13:47.120
ourself.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:52.820
That is-- again--

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:03.200
What I want to say, just
a simple relaxation--

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.740
to relax you don't
need to speak English.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.270
Really, that's a good thing?

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:11.360
You don't need to be Buddhism.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.490
You don't need to speak English.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:19.350
Relaxation is, I
think, maybe universal.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.780
I mean, you don't
need to speak German,

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.355
or you don't need to
speak Tibetan to relax.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:44.320
Therefore, you make-- five to 10
minutes make simple relaxation.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.490
I just tell you the small
tips or small methods.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:54.460
It's the 98 your
problems is disappear.

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:56.880
Look like weather of today.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:02.500
Weather of today, Seattle have
very beautiful weather today.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:07.090
Just all clouds
disappear, empty space.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:15.800
In the similar, just after
10 minutes, after 10 minutes

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:28.400
or after five minutes of your
relaxation, you open your eyes.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.020
And then, you see two problems.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:35.500
After relaxation, you
don't see three problems.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:37.480
Only you see two problems.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.630
I guarantee you.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:41.310
I'm just joking.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:44.910
USA very much like guarantee.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:47.440
I see in your
televisions always,

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.030
yes, now guarantee,
guarantee, call now,

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.990
guarantee, give
back, or something.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.470
You always have this
kind of very much energy.

00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:58.390
Europe you go is
nobody guarantee.

00:15:58.390 --> 00:15:59.215
Everybody relax.

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.693
Very loud, guarantee,
I look away I

00:16:04.693 --> 00:16:06.250
see on your
television you always

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.650
have this advertisement
somewhere you find

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.600
a way, guarantee, guarantee.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.650
OK.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.810
Yes, very good.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.480
Therefore, my
conclusion is after--

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:28.360
after 10 to five
minutes relaxation

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.520
there are only two
problem remain.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.550
They no have a three problem.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:38.425
And this two problem is
also not really problem.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:47.190
What I want to say
here, once you relax,

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.590
you only see two problem
no matter what kind of you

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.840
have problem.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.960
What I mean this
two problem may be--

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.630
no matter what kind
of problem you have,

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:01.220
maybe you possible change,
maybe you no possible change.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.478
That's all.

00:17:03.478 --> 00:17:10.710
You possible change your
problem, it's not a problem.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:14.490
You possible change your
problem, it looks like problem,

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:16.349
but really, really
not a problem.

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:21.410
Isn't it?

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:25.740
And you problem you
no possible change,

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.730
how possible something
unchangeable become

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.720
your problem?

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.540
Correct?

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.900
Well, let's-- we need to be
a little more intelligent.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.350
Something changeable is not
really, really, really problem

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.230
because I possible change.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:44.090
If something unchangeable,
how possible this

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.260
become problem you?

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:49.090
Let's be a little intelligent.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:52.720
Cows also not take
unchangeable things a problem.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.560
We are human beings.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.610
Maybe we are a little more
intelligent than cows.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:03.370
But I need to say
something here.

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:09.970
We human beings have one thing
something cows don't have.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:15.250
Cow is not enough
intelligent to change others.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:17.785
That's the only reason
cows why is relax.

00:18:20.375 --> 00:18:21.750
I'm just joking.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.540
Sometimes you look in the cows--

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.490
sometimes I go, it's
not so bad to be cow.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.150
Sometimes you look in
their face, it's quite OK.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:41.010
I'm just joking.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.470
Cows is-- cow don't know
how to change others.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.980
Changing others
is the main reason

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:56.940
why we have stress, and
burn out, depressions.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:01.090
In my philosophy, changing
others is always wrong.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.220
No matter you have right.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.340
No matter right.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:16.680
Changing others is one of the
great humans ever know to--

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.450
one of the great ever humans
possible make a mistake.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:27.810
But remember, we all
possible help others.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.720
But we no possible
change others.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.630
And the help and the
change is very near again.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:38.010
I told you before relax and
the laziness is so near,

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.680
we misunderstand similar.

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.300
We misunderstand
change and help.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.740
Yes, we need to help others.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.510
We also need help others.

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:53.440
Everybody need help until
we are in this world.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:57.340
Until we are in this
world, we always need help.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.800
You say, yes or no,
no make a different.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.730
You always need help.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:02.630
Isn't it?

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:06.080
We are born also with help,
not you just born yourself.

00:20:08.731 --> 00:20:09.230
Correct?

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:11.590
You're just not born yourself.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:14.500
Correct?

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.010
In your life, also not leave,
you not just leave yourself.

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:19.560
You also need the
help of others.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.240
Also, after dead,
or you're dying,

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.270
you not possible
just die yourself.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.820
You always need help of others.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:31.900
They no have a moment of we
don't need help of the others.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.030
We always need the
help of others.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:44.890
However, changing others is--

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:48.220
I'm used to tell people
whoever want unhappy,

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:52.240
please don't forget
to change others.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.560
That's all.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.260
You don't know how
to make unhappy?

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.790
Simple, just you
practice change others.

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:02.290
You don't believe me, you
try to with your girlfriend

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.300
or your boyfriend.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.950
You just not make big change.

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:08.730
Maybe you have big problem,
just make small change.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:17.390
Name of the help we always
try to change others.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.330
That's the reason in my
philosophy always say,

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:30.320
changing others is one
of the biggest mistake

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:34.350
ever have in human history.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:36.900
We no more how to change
others, we no more

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.070
how to make more problem.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:50.380
However, what I want to
say here changing yourself

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.800
we always say wisdom.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.780
Helping others is your power.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:03.990
Helping others is your power
and the power without--

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:08.640
helping others is your
power, power without taking.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.430
Power without you taking.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:17.950
Whenever you need to take power
and that's make you tired.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.290
But somehow, we need power.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.920
We need the power
because this world,

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.450
world of the action,
action need power.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:26.200
I understand.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.890
But power you need
to receive naturally.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:30.160
How?

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.950
With help.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.390
I'm sure then what mean help?

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:37.570
Or I don't have so much
money, how possible

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:40.840
I'm helping others?

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.090
You just smile at somebody.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.070
That's enough to help others.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:49.735
You don't need to give
millions of money.

00:22:49.735 --> 00:22:52.150
Help means you just say hello.

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:53.290
That's already help.

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:55.630
You just say smile.

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:56.760
It's already help.

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:05.480
Therefore, helping
others is your power.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.140
Changing yourself
is your wisdom.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:13.160
Helping others is
your happiness.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.260
Then nothing have more
happiness than that.

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:21.870
Changing yourself is freedom.

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:26.250
What we need, what we want,
happiness and freedom.

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:29.220
Freedom is not-- freedom--

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:33.540
OK, I say this way, freedom
is some kind of realization.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:37.890
It's not something you
possible really make, I think.

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:48.440
Therefore, my conclusion,
our topic today, stress

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:53.770
and burnout,
especially burn out--

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.680
I'm sure I give a
few other techniques.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:24:01.340
But I just want to
tell the relaxation.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:05.770
Relaxation name we call
wisdom without learning.

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:10.350
Therefore, please, don't
learn how to relax.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:13.130
And please, don't do relax.

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:15.880
Don't try to relax.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.530
Then hopefully, you
know what I mean.

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:21.160
And the relaxation is
not something you receive

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.380
and something you discover.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.600
Relaxation is not
something you receive,

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.950
something you discover.

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.455
That means you
don't try to relax.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:33.850
Just be.

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:40.310
Therefore, I'm
used to tell people

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:44.280
relax without make relax.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:49.560
Therefore, maybe 21 minutes
practice, maybe every morning,

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.110
is your possible.

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:54.450
21 minutes of the
practice, maybe.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.840
I just want to say this,
21 minutes of practice.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.500
That's 21 minutes
of the practice.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.810
Change is your one day.

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:07.240
Change over one day is
become change of your life

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.760
because life is never
come bigger than one day.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.810
You're born one day.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:13.830
You live one day.

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:15.300
You die one day.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:19.080
Tomorrow is not exist.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.750
It's exist, but does
not really exist.

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:23.200
Tomorrow never come.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:28.210
Therefore, I'm used to tell
people yesterday is dead.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:32.760
Tomorrow is not the born.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:35.820
Today is the only what you
have, but that's enough.

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:39.840
Therefore, today is the day.

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:42.000
Today you are happy.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.410
I call you have a happy life.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:45.900
Therefore, I never tell people
try to have a happy life.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.720
I always say try to
have a happy day.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.430
Because life is
too long, too big.

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:51.155
We have confuse.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.840
However, this life
is still 100 years.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:00.150
Our body is made
to stay 100 years.

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:03.215
Anybody stay more than 100
years, you are illegal.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.140
Please, don't stay.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.030
You are illegally
stay in this planet.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:15.620
After 100 years, are
against the nature.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:16.290
You need to die.

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:21.530
I'm sorry to say this.

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:24.780
OK, some people I'm sure stay.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:28.840
However, mother planet is
just a beautiful hotel.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:35.860
I don't say this is
home, but is hotel.

00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.630
Please don't act look like home.

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:40.500
Just act look like hotel.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:45.190
Means don't try to own things
and try to just use things.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:47.890
Don't try to own things.

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:51.070
And just try to
make enjoy things.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:55.740
But sometimes humans
so much focused owning.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:59.070
You try to buy, own.

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:00.540
Look like you stay forever.

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.280
But not in this beautiful hotel.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.770
You not only stay 100 years.

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:06.180
What's 100 years?

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.850
Maybe I'm now 40 years
old, maybe we are--

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:11.640
maybe same age
around many people.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:18.345
But after 20,000 day, I'm
nearly 90 years, or 95,

00:27:18.345 --> 00:27:22.710
or 96 years old,
after 20,000 days.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.290
The famous life,
life is so famous.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:29.500
Everybody just be in the life.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.070
Life is famous.

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:37.870
You calculate it,
it's only 20,000 days.

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:41.650
What do you make so complicated?

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.510
It's very important talk,
I'm sorry to say it, death.

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:46.360
Death makes you more
relaxed and calm.

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:54.280
It's not nice, but
it's good message.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:58.080
Sometimes our ego is growing
so much, and then better

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.040
to think death.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.655
And then, you come more calm
and you're more realistic.

00:28:01.655 --> 00:28:02.530
You're more grounded.

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:04.120
Otherwise, sometimes
you too much fly.

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:17.040
Therefore, after 20,000 day,
you all, we all, is dead people.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.380
And especially people who
don't believe in next life,

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:20.520
this is your last chance.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.570
It's OK, you don't believe
in next life, very OK.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:29.140
I also make some joke in Europe.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:33.840
I would say, we need many people
who don't believe in next life

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.870
because that is the only
way to reduce population.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:43.110
Nature way, voluntarily nobody--

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:44.290
you just decide yourself.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.560
So I say, oh, very good,
we need more people who

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.309
don't believe in next
life because then we

00:28:51.309 --> 00:28:52.700
have less human beings.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.240
Just joking.

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.420
I'm just joking.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.310
Let's say we have a 20,000 day.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.330
You count yourself.

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:03.530
I don't think we have more
than 20,000 day mostly.

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:10.420
In the 20,000 day,
10,000 day we sleep.

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:15.020
And that's it, sleep.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:19.380
And then we left 10,000 day
more and maybe 8,000 day,

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:23.330
or 7,000 day, we go to
work to sit on chair,

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:26.780
whatever chair, gold chair,
or diamond chair, is a chair.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.310
You sit in the one chair.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:30.080
And you're working.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.560
And then you're
left the 2,000 day.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.120
And 1,000 day maybe
you're not happy.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.450
Or I don't know.

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:37.710
Then you left 1,000 day.

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:40.020
1,000 day means
maybe is three years.

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:43.290
And you need preparation
to check out in the hotel.

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:45.360
Mr. Death is calling
your room number

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.960
and he speaks all languages.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:49.290
He never make a mistake.

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:50.580
He never make mistake.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:55.100
Once he call your room number,
he never make a mistake.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.230
Correct?

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:59.480
Let's we are guests in
one beautiful hotel.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.490
Five star hotel, I call.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:06.080
Five star hotel means the planet
made with the five elements.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.440
They have many planets in the
space, but they have maybe--

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.750
they don't have so many
look like our planet.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:15.690
I'm sure they have
countless because infinite.

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:18.170
Yes, we are in the best planet.

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:20.640
It's five star, five elements.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.300
Therefore, let's make enjoy.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:32.710
Yes, you see life is shorter
and you have less stress.

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:35.590
I think, me, this way,
maybe some people not.

00:30:38.935 --> 00:30:40.420
Maybe, yes?

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:45.290
But however, is we
are just in the hotel.

00:30:50.416 --> 00:30:54.670
Yes, it's a beautiful
hotel, but we are hotel.

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:59.115
Therefore, just relax.

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:10.110
Therefore, I'm used to
tell sometimes people

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:13.840
may be Mr. Death calling
your room number.

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.720
Then you start to say,
hey, hello, Mr. Death,

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.060
but I'm so important person.

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.990
I have so many things to do,
but please you call tomorrow.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:23.510
Correct?

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:26.320
You possible save, but no.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.480
And then, maybe you
say, hello, Mr. Death, I

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.760
know I'm in your hotel,
but I have much money.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:33.000
I give every night
10,000 Euro gift.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.810
Please extend my stay.

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:37.410
And Mr. Death is laughing
with the deep voice.

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:38.680
He say, ha, ha, ha.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.110
He laughing.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:41.950
He's just laughing at you.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:42.880
He say, I'm sorry.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.170
Never try again this, he say.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:50.110
He say, my hotel is so
famous in this planet.

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:53.200
These next 100 years
already booked.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.080
And you, tomorrow, need
to check out before 12:00.

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:56.650
I'm sorry.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.230
Therefore, my conclusion,
what I want to say.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.530
Life is short.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.960
It's only 20,000 days.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.120
Why are we fighting so much?

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.340
I know everybody fighting.

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:19.630
Fighting to look like we
need to be here forever.

00:32:19.630 --> 00:32:24.070
Everybody worries look like
we need to stay here forever.

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:26.980
But it's only 20,000 day.

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:31.350
What you need more
than just 20,000 day?

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:34.380
Let's be intelligent.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:35.920
But be more realistic.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.690
Therefore, what I want to
say, every morning maybe

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:55.850
you try to 10 minutes
some exercise.

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:57.990
What kind of exercise no matter.

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:06.150
Any exercise or you just create
your own exercise, whatever.

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.900
The exercise
release the tensions

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.410
and the blocks of your body.

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.740
Yes, you make 10
minutes exercise.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.500
I don't think that's
a big problem.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.710
And then, 10 minutes
you make relaxation.

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.970
10 minutes relaxation.

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.940
After 10 minutes relaxation,
I give you two kind

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:34.110
of wisdom words or something.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:40.245
OK, totally you need, I
would say, 21 minutes.

00:33:40.245 --> 00:33:41.900
I think maybe I'm
a little too much,

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:44.450
maybe I'm [INAUDIBLE]
of the talking here.

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:48.780
But in the 21 minutes,
possible change your life.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:50.180
I'm not saying this in Europe.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:53.520
Nobody come then.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:57.440
I say 21 minutes practice
change your life.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.960
I think they don't believe me.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.070
Sometimes I need to come
different country I need

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:04.802
to talk little different way.

00:34:04.802 --> 00:34:06.260
Everybody have a
different culture.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:16.840
However, 10 minutes exercise,
10 minutes relaxation.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:21.579
After all of the 20 minutes, I
want you to say two sentence.

00:34:25.469 --> 00:34:29.110
The sentence you say this way.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.300
You open eyes.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.520
Before you give any
action, before you

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:36.690
give any, any action,
mentally, verbally, physically,

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:40.350
before you give any
action, just you relax.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:42.960
You're just calm, pure
and in the nature.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.000
And you say this way.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.670
First, action in
your mind, you say,

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:51.199
I do my best in this world.

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:56.790
You really not only
saying somewhere.

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:59.550
You really say in the
bottom of your heart.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:00.870
You don't do this way.

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:04.380
I do my best.

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:05.610
Correct?

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:10.320
I do my best, not this way.

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.210
Or you look your iPad,
you say, I do my best.

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:13.710
Hello.

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:16.280
No, that's not
make you different.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.870
You really relax.

00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:21.370
Calm and you go
deep in your inside,

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:24.600
at the bottom of your
heart, middle of your bones,

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:28.260
through your blood, you
really feel the sentence.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:36.290
You say, I do my best in this
world in myself or others.

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:41.380
Then you say, but after
whatever happen, I accept it.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:48.820
I do my best, still
something go wrong.

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:49.940
I accept it.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:57.430
In this world, world
is never go perfect.

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:59.470
World is never go perfect.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:02.010
Never go best.

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:05.860
There always need
someplace to accept it.

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:07.540
That is the only solution.

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:17.740
That's name what Buddhism is
called kindness and compassion.

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:19.072
We do our best.

00:36:19.072 --> 00:36:19.780
This is kindness.

00:36:23.226 --> 00:36:26.300
After something go
wrong, we accept it.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.722
This is compassion.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:36.260
But kindness is very
near attachment.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:40.670
Kindness is very
near attachment.

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:48.875
Compassion is very near
sometime sadness or anger.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.870
Therefore, sometimes
we very easy to--

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:56.910
sometime we go to
practice a kindness,

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:59.370
we only want to practice
kindness nice people,

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:01.050
beautiful people.

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:01.810
Correct?

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:02.730
You're very nice.

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:04.920
I want to be kind.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.640
But maybe this is not kindness.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.130
This is attachment.

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:10.662
Therefore, attachment,
kindness we misunderstand.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:19.100
Sometimes compassion and
sadness, compassion or sadness

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:22.460
or anger, we also misunderstand.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:27.055
Therefore, my conclusion,
you have two simple practice.

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:35.870
10 minutes exercise, and
then relaxation, and then

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:36.590
two sentence.

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:40.940
The sentence you
say, I do my best.

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:46.200
After something go
wrong, I accept it.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:46.710
That's it.

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:51.870
Therefore, I'm used to
tell people making joke,

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:55.680
you go back now home maybe
your house is going on fire,

00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:00.060
and you don't forget to tell
your house I did my best,

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:04.050
but I now accept it.

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:05.580
House, I did your best.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.860
But now you just
decide to go fire.

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:11.460
I accept it, but maybe this
not happen again, again.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.830
I better make one picture.

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:17.820
You make one selfie picture,
but don't put in the Facebook.

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:19.160
You don't receive insurance.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:32.340
Therefore, somebody ask me, some
businessman, he ask me Tuklu,

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.200
it looks like you are happy.

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:39.090
And you have any special
method how to be happy?

00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:41.820
Then I just make a joke.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:47.130
I have a small method, but
you don't tell anybody.

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:50.580
You tell this and
you lose your job.

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:53.250
And then he said, what is that?

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:56.530
I said, if you really
want to be happy,

00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.270
you need to be a little crazy.

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:04.175
Not big crazy, OK?

00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:07.310
We have so many crazy people,
but not completely crazy.

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:08.415
But be a little crazy.

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:15.060
Because life is crazy.

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:18.450
Anyway, therefore
my conclusion I

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:24.330
wanted to show you a small
exercise, very small exercise.

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:27.750
And then short relaxation
and then the sentence.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:29.290
That's OK?

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:31.220
It's good?

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.110
Yes.

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:37.270
OK, the exercise is
a very, very small.

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:43.815
I want you to close your
fists this way and also here.

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:50.320
These areas, very
important areas.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:53.690
However, you make somehow--

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:56.880
somehow you look like this way.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:01.680
And the 21 seconds, I want
you all of the muscles--

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.880
faces also I want to do this.

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.690
OK, but I don't make
a picture of you.

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:15.150
Look like you have
pain, but without pain.

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:19.590
21 second and you do this.

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:22.850
And then, relax.

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:24.510
That's OK?

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:25.770
You are ready?

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:26.769
That's simple--

00:40:26.769 --> 00:40:29.310
Sorry, before we do this I want
you to make one self massage.

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:33.965
Warm up your palms.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:46.890
And to make- massage
is very good.

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.650
OK.

00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:00.590
Yes, are you ready?

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:05.630
OK, 21 second you
make tight everything.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:15.360
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:19.810
19, is power, power, power,
together everything, together.

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:23.110
21 minutes, please.

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:27.290
21, breathe out.

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:28.220
I want you do this.

00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.350
One time more this exercise.

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:37.570
OK?

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:42.110
With holding the breath, 21
seconds you hold the breath.

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:44.820
And the longest holding
this breath record

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:47.230
is 25 minutes officially.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.360
But some of Tibetans,
some Indians,

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.950
they hold two day, three
days, but is not they

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:53.780
practice official place.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:42:00.100
But let's say not hold
20 minutes, 25 minutes,

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:03.310
only just 21 seconds.

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:06.340
Hold your breath in the navel
and to make tight everything

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.170
again.

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:10.300
Because we increase
wind and the fire.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:13.220
With this exercise, we increase
in the wind and the fire.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:14.620
And then we'll relax.

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.990
And then we come
in earth and water.

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:19.120
And then all balance.

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:22.250
That's the secret.

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:23.740
Ready?

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:24.685
Breath breathe in.

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:29.390
Hold your breath.

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:33.690
OK, tight, 21 seconds.

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:43.990
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:47.036
full power, full power,
21 minutes, breathe out.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.690
I think we don't need
the 10 minutes exercise.

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:00.490
Now we one make
breath, breathe in.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:08.590
And this exercise
increase wind and fire.

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:10.400
Now we mix more relaxation.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:11.935
We keep straight our spine.

00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:19.450
Now we connect the
earth and the water.

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:47.850
Relax all of your efforts.

00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:54.550
Just be without any effort
in your body and your mind.

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:10.570
You go deeper, relax.

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:12.220
And you discover
this inner space.

00:44:18.707 --> 00:44:22.240
The nature of this
inner space is peace.

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:07.050
Thank you very much.

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:09.990
Then you say these two sentence.

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:11.580
I do my best.

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:15.790
After whatever
come, I accept it.

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:18.820
And then, you never have
a problem with life.

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:20.760
You know exactly how swim.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:24.220
Life is look like ocean.

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.770
We are in the ocean.

00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:27.940
We are not in the land.

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:29.350
We are in the ocean.

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:32.350
The solution only swim.

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:36.290
I know nobody wants to
swim, but you need to swim.

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:39.710
But remember, to swim
we need to relax.

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:41.980
Otherwise, long swim.

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:48.290
Life is the wave of the
ocean, wave of change.

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:50.425
We just need to swim,
but we need to relax.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:56.850
And then my last two
sentence or three sentence,

00:45:56.850 --> 00:46:03.440
whenever you have stress or
burnout, whatever you have,

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.320
you need more energy.

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.610
We have one small solution.

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:12.980
The shower, shower
in my tradition

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:16.310
is a shower is very,
very spiritual practice.

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:19.940
Shower with fresh water,
not hot, not cold.

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:23.000
Just fresh water.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:23.810
Just shower.

00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:27.680
You stay under the water
maybe 5 to 10 minutes.

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:28.580
And you come out.

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:30.204
You don't believe
what change you have.

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:37.610
But the problem, we don't
believe that because too cheap,

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:40.160
too easy.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:45.810
I'm sorry, but too
cheap and too easy.

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:48.090
But just shower.

00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:53.930
Shower, give you a new
mind, new body, new life.

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:56.270
It's amazing.

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:59.480
And the second thing is you
really don't want burnout,

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:00.840
stress.

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:04.760
They have one thing you
practice everyday life.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.070
Like people.

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:09.080
Like people.

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.400
How many people you like?

00:47:13.683 --> 00:47:14.754
AUDIENCE: 6 billion.

00:47:14.754 --> 00:47:16.170
TULKU LOBSANG: 6
billion, exactly.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:23.900
Therefore, practice
to like people.

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:25.160
Understand?

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.430
Like people, but that's not
mean all people is good.

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:31.340
That's nothing to do
good, or right, or wrong.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:33.020
Just try to like people.

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:37.610
Like people because
people is the big problem.

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:40.370
Who make we are stress,
who make we are burnout,

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:42.390
maybe who make we are unhappy.

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:44.810
Therefore, try to like people.

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:47.780
Maybe you go to the
outside sometimes just

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:52.970
try to scream yourself
I like people.

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:54.440
I know you say I like trees.

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:55.400
Trees is good.

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:58.100
But the tree never make
your problem so much.

00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:01.730
You don't like trees,
it not big, big problem.

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:03.440
But the people is a problem.

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:07.760
Therefore, we need to
practice like people.

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.440
I think this give
you more energy.

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:10.640
This If you more happy.

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:13.290
And you maybe many
good things have.

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:17.960
And then, my last words, whoever
want more stress, burnout,

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.355
don't forget to change others.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.270
And thank you very much.

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:24.200
And I'm finished.

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.180
I think our time is
somehow finished,

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:29.080
but maybe I give one or
two time to have question.

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:29.900
Is OK?

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:31.640
AUDIENCE: So my
question for you is

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.230
a lot of times I
feel like when I'm

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:35.420
trying to do things
efficiently, which

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:40.490
means to do it at the shortest
amount of effort, that caused

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:43.430
me to be stressed or upset.

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:47.690
So is there something
about that, being efficient

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:49.980
versus happy, is there
anything about that

00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:51.000
you will want to say?

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:59.600
TULKU LOBSANG: OK, I just make
a very short answer give here.

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:06.420
But I think it's most important
whatever you do before.

00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:13.280
Whatever you give some actions
is very important to relax.

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:17.060
Once you relax, and you
see everything clear.

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:20.720
Once you see everything
clear, all of your actions

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.250
make different you.

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:27.310
But the problem we make
action first and then we think

00:49:27.310 --> 00:49:28.760
is after.

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:32.060
And then, always is
we do so many things,

00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:34.040
but very little things happen.

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.710
But then people
always think, OK, I

00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:38.740
want to happen everything fast.

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:42.770
But then relax is the
opposite of happening fast.

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:44.660
Therefore, we know
to relax first.

00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:47.050
And we try to action first.

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:50.150
But first you relax.

00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:52.010
You relax and relax.

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:55.610
Once you relax,
everything's more clear.

00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:57.890
Once you clear, then
you give action.

00:49:57.890 --> 00:50:02.217
Then each your actions make
all different, I think.

00:50:02.217 --> 00:50:03.050
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:05.265 --> 00:50:06.890
AUDIENCE: So I have
a question, though,

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:09.896
how about when other
people try to change us?

00:50:09.896 --> 00:50:12.510
How do we react to
[INAUDIBLE] as the people want

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:13.574
to change us?

00:50:13.574 --> 00:50:16.240
Let's say my wife want to change
me and it's making me stressed.

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.260
Then how I handle this case?

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:22.580
TULKU LOBSANG: OK, I think then
you send your wife with me,

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:23.135
and I talk.

00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:28.150
I'm just joking.

00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.795
I'm sorry.

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:40.830
That's always very--
is a challenge.

00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:45.470
We have some kind of
a story, a saying.

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:48.200
One day they have the
story of the mother

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.490
and the wife is fighting.

00:50:49.490 --> 00:50:51.530
Mother and the wife is fighting.

00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:53.810
And my mother and
my wife is fighting.

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:56.870
My wife always say
your mother is no good.

00:50:56.870 --> 00:51:00.080
And then, my mother say
always your wife is not good.

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:02.590
And in between, I'm suffering.

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:05.390
And then, always my mother
say your wife is not good.

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:08.810
But I know my wife is
not complete not good.

00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:10.940
And I always try to explain.

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.915
Then my mother fight more.

00:51:12.915 --> 00:51:15.930
And then my wife says
my mother is not good.

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:18.870
And then I know it's
not everything, too.

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:20.990
Then I try to always
talk something.

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:25.910
And then, my wife is more fight.

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:28.910
That's means we all
have more fight.

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:32.340
Then solution, when
your wife say--

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:34.920
I'm giving a round answer.

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:38.890
The solution, your wife say your
mother is no good many things

00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:41.550
and the best you be silence.

00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:49.971
You say, OK, You say,
OK, yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:51:49.971 --> 00:51:50.470
Why?

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:52.250
Because the truth
is not important.

00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:55.110
Help is more important.

00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:59.190
Truth is not-- because
truth is not fixable.

00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:00.870
Truth is not important.

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:04.152
Help is more important.

00:52:04.152 --> 00:52:04.860
We have a saying.

00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:07.610
Therefore, my wife
say my mother no good.

00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:09.730
It's not true, but
the best I say yes.

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:10.354
Yes.

00:52:10.354 --> 00:52:11.520
I don't need to give reason.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:12.940
I say yes and yes.

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:15.510
And my mother say
your wife is not good.

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:18.140
Then I also say yes and yes.

00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:19.740
I say OK, OK, OK.

00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:22.680
Then she less talk,
less talk hopefully.

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:26.910
And then one day maybe
you all come one table.

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:29.040
Then they both start to talk.

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.680
And the best you be
head down and don't

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:34.620
say anything and silence.

00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:36.960
We say something look like this.

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:39.690
Therefore, I don't have
a really perfect answer.

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:41.700
Just I give an example.

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:44.250
Yes, I don't have a really,
really perfect answer,

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:46.230
some quick answers there.

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:49.920
Therefore, truth
is not important.

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:53.720
Help is more important.

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:55.370
Truth is not important.

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:58.870
Help is important.

00:52:58.870 --> 00:53:01.290
Because truth is not flexible.

00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:03.770
Therefore, you need
to be flexible.

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:07.791
Therefore, more help, then
you need to say yes, yes.

00:53:07.791 --> 00:53:08.290
It's OK.

00:53:08.290 --> 00:53:10.610
Be flexible.

00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:11.327
That's it.

00:53:11.327 --> 00:53:12.160
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:13.201
TULKU LOBSANG: Thank you.

00:53:13.201 --> 00:53:15.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:18.060
TULKU LOBSANG: Yes, yes, yes.

00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:21.060
Thank you.

00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:22.292
OK?

00:53:22.292 --> 00:53:26.040
AUDIENCE: Are you
relaxed all the time?

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.740
TULKU LOBSANG: Me, no,
no, not all the time.

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.000
No, I'm more relaxed.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.160
I say yes.

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:35.560
I relax generally,
but not always.

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:37.800
But generally, I quite relax.

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.080
But not some time.

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:40.870
Sometimes not.

00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:47.100
But generally, I have
a very clear decision.

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.860
I have a very, very
clear decision.

00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:50.700
That's help me.

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.710
I have one general,
clear decision.

00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:54.750
I need some time every
day some decisions,

00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:58.310
but I have a very clear
picture and a clear understand,

00:53:58.310 --> 00:54:01.440
and this maybe me
help generally calm.

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:04.560
But sometimes small
things make me a problem.

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:10.010
Something big thing
happen, I'm always calm.

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:12.970
But very small things
happen and maybe you--

00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:16.260
I don't know-- you say bring
food in the 10:00 and you five

00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:18.500
minutes late sometime those--

00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:19.860
the very very small things.

00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:22.110
Therefore, I need more
careful the small things.

00:54:22.110 --> 00:54:22.920
The big things.

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:25.500
I'm already exercised,
training myself.

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:29.280
Any big problems coming,
I'm more relaxed, more calm.

00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:34.640
But the small, very small
problems, I'm sometimes--

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:37.110
and that sometimes
makes me bothered.

00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:39.540
Therefore, I need more training
with the small problems

00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:43.216
to also make a calm,
not only big problems.

00:54:43.216 --> 00:54:45.090
Therefore generally, I
feel little more calm.

00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:48.477
OK?

00:54:48.477 --> 00:54:50.310
AUDIENCE: I was curious
if you had any tips.

00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:53.400
I think I find myself suffering
from that subtle laziness

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:55.680
that you were talking about.

00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:59.960
How can you escape that
trap of being subtly lazy?

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:03.620
Is it through relaxation,
meditation, or do

00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:06.705
you have any specific
advice about how to become--

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:14.520
TULKU LOBSANG: The laziness,
they have many antidotes.

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.310
But most important
laziness antidote

00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:21.750
is motivation and believe.

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:27.540
Believe and motivation is
the antidote of the laziness.

00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:35.640
But we always say I need
a reason to motivate.

00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:36.630
I need a reason.

00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:38.130
I need the reason.

00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:40.530
I need a reason to motivate.

00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:42.900
My reason is too small.

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:45.840
And my motivation is too small.

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:47.820
My motivation is too small.

00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:48.990
My belief is too small.

00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:50.190
My belief is too small.

00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:52.320
My practice too small.

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:56.430
Therefore, you need reason.

00:55:56.430 --> 00:55:59.860
When you want bigger reason,
you need to big understand.

00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:04.770
You more understand, you really
understand, you have a reason.

00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:07.890
You have a more reason,
and you're motivated.

00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:09.600
You're motivated,
you'll believe.

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.240
You believe, you practice.

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:14.230
You practice and
you become success.

00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:18.680
Therefore, I think, I'm
sure relaxation always good.

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:21.120
Wherever you have
laziness, I think

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:24.220
first you need to go to deeper
yourself, make a discussion

00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.110
yourself.

00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:29.760
And you need to find
a big, big reason--

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:33.600
you need a big reason to
find that to motivate.

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:34.890
Reason is motivate.

00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:38.190
Sometimes our
reason is too small.

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:42.106
I say why you meditate?

00:56:42.106 --> 00:56:43.530
Oh, I think, I don't know.

00:56:43.530 --> 00:56:44.610
Some people say good.

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:46.380
Therefore, I come here.

00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:48.900
You see, your
reason is so small.

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:51.990
And clear you don't
practice this two time,

00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:53.100
three time, you never do.

00:56:56.330 --> 00:56:57.510
Why?

00:56:57.510 --> 00:57:01.820
And I say why, you need
to give big reason.

00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:03.710
To reason, you
need to understand.

00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:06.740
You more understand, hopefully,
you have more reason.

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:08.250
You have more reason.

00:57:08.250 --> 00:57:10.320
And the reason is the power.

00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:12.098
And that's make real motivate.

00:57:14.850 --> 00:57:17.060
Something look like this.

00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:20.370
Therefore, maybe go to
retreat, two, three day.

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:22.760
And to make discussion yourself.

00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:25.590
You don't reject it all
kind of mind and just you

00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:27.960
make every mind,
all kind of mind,

00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:31.620
let's make invite to
make come, and speak,

00:57:31.620 --> 00:57:36.240
and to discuss, and to
make big meeting yourself.

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:38.250
And then, maybe
you come together.

00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:41.490
You have some-- then you
make one conclusion possible

00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:42.840
yourself.

00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:46.420
Because the laziness
is a big problem.

00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:49.360
And you lose believe yourself.

00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:51.260
Once you're lazy--

00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:53.790
Example, today I give you
a new mind, let's say.

00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:54.470
I talk.

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:56.167
I'm not a good talker,
but when I'm talk

00:57:56.167 --> 00:57:57.250
maybe you have a new mind.

00:57:57.250 --> 00:58:00.580
You come more exciting OK,
maybe I'll do this way.

00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.180
That is good.

00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:05.430
But then the other mind
start to saying you,

00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:09.310
yes, you you always say I
do, but you never did it.

00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:11.330
I don't believe you.

00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:13.820
And then you go down.

00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:15.860
You see, you always
try to motivate,

00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:21.980
but the deep mind, mind who
stay with you last 25 years,

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:23.600
he always don't believe you.

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:26.570
Because 25 years you
always promise yourself,

00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:29.220
but you never did it.

00:58:29.220 --> 00:58:30.800
Yes, but then new mind.

00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:31.800
You go to somewhere.

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.090
Somebody talk so many thing.

00:58:33.090 --> 00:58:33.960
New mind born.

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:35.730
He say, yes, I want to do now.

00:58:35.730 --> 00:58:39.800
And this old mind
say hey, you know,

00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:41.320
better you don't so exciting.

00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:42.300
I know this man.

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:45.570
25 years, but he never do.

00:58:45.570 --> 00:58:48.286
And then, again, you--

00:58:48.286 --> 00:58:49.460
you see?

00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:53.480
Therefore, I think make
big [INAUDIBLE] yourself.

00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:56.600
Make deep look inside to
make a discussion yourself

00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:59.290
to bring one big reason.

00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:02.270
Reason is a power.

00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:05.730
And that's make motivation.

00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:08.760
OK, thank you very much.
