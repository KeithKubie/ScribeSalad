00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.228
SPEAKER 1: So what
we're going to do

00:00:04.228 --> 00:00:05.748
is just have a
really brief panel.

00:00:05.748 --> 00:00:08.382
We're going to ask them to
introduce themselves and tell

00:00:08.382 --> 00:00:10.194
a little bit about their story.

00:00:10.194 --> 00:00:11.676
I have like one
or two questions.

00:00:11.676 --> 00:00:14.269
But really, this
is about you asking

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.122
the questions that are
interesting to you.

00:00:16.122 --> 00:00:18.080
ANSELM BAIRD-SMITH: Hi,
I'm Anselm Baird-Smith.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.580
I was actually--
despite my name,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.788
I'm French, raised in France.

00:00:20.788 --> 00:00:23.760
I did my studies
here in a school

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.650
I'm very glad to be able to do
some advertising for [FRENCH]

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.065
Institut superieur
d'Electronique de Paris.

00:00:29.065 --> 00:00:30.315
And that was computer science.

00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:32.945
This was back in the
days, unfortunately.

00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:37.000
After that, I did a PhD
at Paris VI Jussieu.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.820
And after this, I pretty much
went more or less directly

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.345
to California.

00:00:42.345 --> 00:00:44.750
So we're in '97.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.640
Sun Microsystems was the
place to be at that time.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.352
So I went to Sun Microsystems.

00:00:49.352 --> 00:00:51.060
Sun Microsystems
invited me to join them.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.850
And after three
years there, I felt

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.350
like I didn't come to Silicon
Valley to be in a big company.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.382
So I figured I should join
the start up, which I did.

00:01:00.382 --> 00:01:04.162
Irony turns out that
real names [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:04.162 --> 00:01:06.394
very first company
that actually did

00:01:06.394 --> 00:01:08.130
a commercial deal
is Google in '99.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.561
After this-- so
this company failed

00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:11.602
for all sorts of reasons.

00:01:11.602 --> 00:01:16.066
I then went to do my own
company, Distributed Database,

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.050
which was a massive failure.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.538
We spent a year
writing software.

00:01:19.538 --> 00:01:21.794
And we realized by
the end of that year

00:01:21.794 --> 00:01:24.002
that we had no customers,
which is kind of a problem.

00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:26.130
So the VCs told us very
nicely that they would not

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.616
fund us anymore.

00:01:27.616 --> 00:01:29.437
And then, I joined eBay.

00:01:29.437 --> 00:01:30.853
EBay was the first
time I actually

00:01:30.853 --> 00:01:32.098
ran a consumer website.

00:01:32.098 --> 00:01:35.810
And that was fascinating to me.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.708
One of my [INAUDIBLE]
things was to actually--

00:01:38.708 --> 00:01:40.962
I implemented the spell
checker for descriptions

00:01:40.962 --> 00:01:43.055
of eBay items, which
is probably something

00:01:43.055 --> 00:01:44.987
that if you've got
an eBay item, you'll

00:01:44.987 --> 00:01:48.851
know what I mean by this, the
vocabulary in eBay descriptions

00:01:48.851 --> 00:01:49.840
in listings.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.870
After another two
years at eBay, this guy

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.195
at Sun that I had worked
with several years

00:01:56.195 --> 00:01:58.909
before told me that I should
meet with some other guy

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.304
and have lunch with
him, which I did.

00:02:01.304 --> 00:02:03.290
And this guy convinced
me over lunch

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.915
that I should do this
startup with him.

00:02:04.915 --> 00:02:08.248
And he promised me that if
I joined him, I'd be CTO.

00:02:08.248 --> 00:02:08.914
It'd be awesome.

00:02:08.914 --> 00:02:10.552
He'd get some money,
and that we'll

00:02:10.552 --> 00:02:12.825
have an office in two weeks,
all of which became true,

00:02:12.825 --> 00:02:13.324
literally.

00:02:13.324 --> 00:02:15.154
I called my wife
after I had lunch.

00:02:15.154 --> 00:02:16.195
I said, I'm leaving eBay.

00:02:16.195 --> 00:02:17.020
She was not happy.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.510
I did leave eBay.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.700
And literally, that was June 15.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.296
On July 1, we had offices
in Palo Alto, $10 million

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:26.944
in the bank, and we
were ready to fly.

00:02:26.944 --> 00:02:29.110
MICHEL MUNIE: So I started
out-- I lived in Chicago.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.651
I went to the
University of Illinois.

00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:33.120
I did math and computer
science for undergrad.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.160
I also came out to California.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.900
However, I was sure that I
was going to be an academic,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.810
and I was going to do
nothing useful purposefully.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.484
I wanted to be very academic.

00:02:42.484 --> 00:02:43.400
So I went to Stanford.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.280
I got a PhD.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.085
Around the end of the PhD,
as is natural in California,

00:02:51.085 --> 00:02:52.930
I got involved in a startup.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.150
So I started a startup with
my advisor and my office mate.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.870
We raised money from
Kleiner Perkins.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.530
And so our idea was that
maybe 10 years ago, or maybe

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.830
15 years ago, Yahoo had
organized the web manually.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.715
And then after that,
Google came along

00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:12.812
and did this wonderful job
algorithmically saying,

00:03:12.812 --> 00:03:14.270
we're not going to
have a directory

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.089
structure of the internet.

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:18.380
We're going to have algorithms.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.260
And it's going to be better.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.760
And it's going to
be more efficient.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.900
And your life will be nice.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.250
And we had a similar idea.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.590
We thought we'd do something
for your friends in social.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.215
Like right now,
Facebook is essentially

00:03:28.215 --> 00:03:29.370
a directory structure.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.960
Google+ is a
directory structure.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.880
Twitter is just a list.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.560
And you can do something more.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.440
And you can make
people better friends,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.630
and I think better people.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:38.735
So we worked on that.

00:03:38.735 --> 00:03:42.345
We had some
interesting technology

00:03:42.345 --> 00:03:44.820
and got to work with
great investors.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.250
And then also, we had a
conversation with Google.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.570
At the time, it
was Vic Gundotra.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.141
And we had dinner with him.

00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:54.640
And something very
similar happened.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.480
Soon after that,
we were acquired.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.856
I've been at Google for
almost two years now.

00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:01.230
MARTIN GORNER: So
hi, I'm Martin.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.580
Most of you know me
by now because I also

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.455
organized this event with all
of the amazing speakers that

00:04:07.455 --> 00:04:08.670
joined us today.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.800
So thanks to all of them.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.910
And yes, actually,
I spent two years

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.495
at STMicroelectronics
freshly out of college

00:04:19.495 --> 00:04:22.117
in Bristol in the UK.

00:04:22.117 --> 00:04:28.290
Right after that, I joined
a startup called Mobipocket.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.050
And this startup was then
something that was strange.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.555
And some people even
told us that it was evil.

00:04:36.555 --> 00:04:40.400
We wanted to make
books electronic.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.980
So we were, in 2000, when
e-books were kind of hot--

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:51.100
because at that point,
Microsoft invested in the idea.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.610
And we pioneered e-books on PDAs
at that point, so PalmPilots,

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.798
pocket PCs, and so on.

00:04:57.798 --> 00:05:01.010
This ran I can't
say successfully.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.270
But it ran.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.350
There were people
who were telling us

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.692
that what we were
doing was useless.

00:05:08.692 --> 00:05:12.000
Publishers were mostly telling
us that what we were doing

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.870
was evil, that we
would destroy culture.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.805
What they meant
by that is that we

00:05:16.805 --> 00:05:20.190
were disrupting their
existing business model.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.570
But when you talk
to a publisher,

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.910
he calls that,
"destroying culture."

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.686
But on the other hand, we also
had users where [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:31.686 --> 00:05:34.480
I remember in those
days, reading on a PDA

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.665
was not so easy.

00:05:35.665 --> 00:05:38.640
We didn't have retina
screens in those days.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.785
We had one sci-fi series
that had 16 volumes.

00:05:42.785 --> 00:05:47.930
For some reason, we didn't get
the rights to volume number 16.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.490
And we had complaints,
people who read all the 15

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.055
volumes on their
shitty PalmPilot PDA.

00:05:55.055 --> 00:05:59.650
And they were complaining,
where is volume 16?

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.180
So it was engaging, definitely.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.260
But it wasn't a bang,
nothing like that.

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.740
And then, something very bad
happened-- the smartphone.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.080
So PDAs died because
phones became PDAs.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.430
But phones, if you
remember at that time,

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.910
had screens even smaller
than a PalmPilot.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:26.130
And the first smartphones
had these postage stamp

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.640
sized screens where reading
was completely impossible.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.650
It's challenging on
a PalmPilot, but it's

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.184
completely impossible on one of
those Nokias of the early days.

00:06:37.184 --> 00:06:41.100
And so even our not so
great business when boom.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.920
But they still believed in it.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.350
And, well, it just happened
that around 2005, Amazon

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.940
had this crazy idea that they
would change their business

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.322
model from physical books
to electronic books.

00:06:55.322 --> 00:06:57.155
And they started shopping
around for someone

00:06:57.155 --> 00:06:58.755
who had the technology.

00:06:58.755 --> 00:07:02.890
And we happened to have the
technology, the technology

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:06.260
for creating the books, the
file format, the distribution,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:09.201
the catalog, the reading
technology on mobile devices--

00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:10.103
the whole set.

00:07:10.103 --> 00:07:13.260
There was nothing, so we
had to do the whole set.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.600
And we were happy enough
to b acquired by Amazon

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.655
to actually make the Kindle.

00:07:18.655 --> 00:07:19.940
And it's funny.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.840
Nobody here talks about the
post-acquisition experience,

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.310
which-- I talked
with all of you guys,

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.460
and it was pretty
terrible for all of us.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.990
So I know that all of you are
dreaming of being acquired.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.200
But be warned.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.008
Being acquired is the
end of your startup.

00:07:40.008 --> 00:07:42.420
You'll get money to walk away.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.492
Or you'll get money, you'll
work on something else

00:07:45.492 --> 00:07:47.655
in the company where
you were acquired.

00:07:47.655 --> 00:07:52.065
Don't dream of becoming
the new VP of the company

00:07:52.065 --> 00:07:55.086
because you had this
idea, you were acquired,

00:07:55.086 --> 00:07:57.743
and you will become
super important at Apple.

00:07:57.743 --> 00:07:59.192
That doesn't happen.

00:07:59.192 --> 00:08:02.510
SPEAKER 1: So I was going
to ask you about timing.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:06.490
I think a lot of startups fail
or succeed based on timing,

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.680
like a lot of
companies in general.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.750
You talked about the PalmPilot
going away, coming back.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.630
If you had somehow foreseen
smartphones and created

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.520
that-- but it still worked out
in a lot of the situations.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.900
So for yourself, what
do you think right now,

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.400
if you're speaking
to this audience,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.850
would be apt timing for them?

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.790
What trends would you suggest
that they look towards

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.097
to create great applications?

00:08:30.097 --> 00:08:32.180
ANSELM BAIRD-SMITH: That's
a very stupid question.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:36.605
If I knew, I might be on
the other side of the stage.

00:08:36.605 --> 00:08:39.344
The one thing I'd say is
timing is of the essence.

00:08:39.344 --> 00:08:41.296
I mentioned this failed company.

00:08:41.296 --> 00:08:43.248
It was just too early.

00:08:43.248 --> 00:08:48.128
It was a little bit--
really, I'm biased.

00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:49.592
But the supper was great.

00:08:49.592 --> 00:08:52.890
The concept of having the
database that could fail

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:57.178
wasn't-- 2,000
people [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:57.178 --> 00:08:59.130
They had those
transactions, and they

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.360
didn't want
[INAUDIBLE] too soon.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.082
By the same token,
at Lala, we started

00:09:04.082 --> 00:09:07.530
with CD trading, a CD--
that is, a plastic thing.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.590
And basically, what we did
is we let people exchange

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.922
CDs over postal mail.

00:09:14.922 --> 00:09:18.492
And the one thing I
will say about timing

00:09:18.492 --> 00:09:19.700
is it's of the essence.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.585
And if you don't hit it
right, you will fail.

00:09:22.585 --> 00:09:25.580
And the best way to figure
out if you had it right

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.830
is to check if you have users.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.664
So CD trading was
an awesome idea.

00:09:29.664 --> 00:09:31.580
And it took a year for
us to realize it actual

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.028
was not anymore the right
time to deal with CDs.

00:09:35.028 --> 00:09:37.493
And we moved into digital
music very quickly.

00:09:37.493 --> 00:09:40.451
So the one thing I
will say about timing

00:09:40.451 --> 00:09:42.176
is get ready to adjust.

00:09:42.176 --> 00:09:45.874
Change-- if you have a
sense that the time is not

00:09:45.874 --> 00:09:48.332
right for your product--
too late, too soon-- adjust,

00:09:48.332 --> 00:09:48.832
change.

00:09:48.832 --> 00:09:50.804
There's a time for everything.

00:09:50.804 --> 00:09:53.207
And it really,
really helps if you

00:09:53.207 --> 00:09:54.748
[INAUDIBLE] right
timing [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:54.748 --> 00:09:56.720
SPEAKER 1: So you talk
about your advisor,

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.206
so having an advisor.

00:09:58.206 --> 00:09:59.622
And he kind of
convinced you to go

00:09:59.622 --> 00:10:01.858
to the direction of a startup.

00:10:01.858 --> 00:10:04.020
My question was, would you
have gone that direction

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.090
after your PhD without him?

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.034
And how do you
suggest these guys

00:10:09.034 --> 00:10:11.840
find that person, that
advisor, that mentor,

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.840
that kind of experienced,
seasoned entrepreneur?

00:10:17.298 --> 00:10:19.280
MICHEL MUNIE: Yeah,
good question.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.300
I think the most
important thing for people

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:26.570
you work with-- if you've done
a PhD, it takes a long time.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:30.070
So I had a long time to
work with my advisor,

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:31.320
and also my office mate.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.450
We started on the
exact same day.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.731
We went to all the college
visits for graduate school

00:10:36.731 --> 00:10:37.439
at the same time.

00:10:37.439 --> 00:10:40.170
So I'd known these people
for about seven years.

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.400
And I think that more
than anything else, having

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.346
reliable people that you can
count on is really important.

00:10:46.346 --> 00:10:51.910
Because there's lots of times
where you will be in conflict.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.330
Essentially, it's a
changing landscape.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.065
People come in with
different opinions.

00:10:56.065 --> 00:10:58.610
If you don't have
successful ways of resolving

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.630
these different opinions
to this conflict,

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.650
then I think a startup
will just fall apart.

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.850
So being able to do
business with people

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.452
that you know very well, and
you've worked with in the past,

00:11:08.452 --> 00:11:09.430
is fantastic.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:12.202
Also related to that is that
my advisor had done startups

00:11:12.202 --> 00:11:15.590
before, which I would
highly recommend.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.890
If this is your first
startup, then hopefully you're

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:20.820
working with someone who
it's not their first startup.

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.670
I think that there's
certainly a trend.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.648
Investors notice this-- is that
they invest in companies that

00:11:27.648 --> 00:11:32.130
have one of their founders who's
had a successful exit before.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.126
[INAUDIBLE].

00:11:33.126 --> 00:11:35.630
MARTIN GORNER: Or unsuccessful.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.164
MICHEL MUNIE: Or
unsuccessful, [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:38.164 --> 00:11:39.580
SPEAKER 1: Yeah,
it's interesting.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.080
There's always this
talk of failure.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.889
And I think failure is
obviously not a bad thing.

00:11:43.889 --> 00:11:45.430
But there's a really
interesting blog

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:49.609
by Joe Kraus, who's a
partner in Google Ventures.

00:11:49.609 --> 00:11:52.540
And the blog post talks about
how failure is a good thing

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.780
to get under your belt.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.860
But a trend is
success over and over,

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.841
and that they often
follow those founders.

00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:00.340
So even for yourself,
finding people

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:02.486
who have been
successful in the past

00:12:02.486 --> 00:12:05.788
is a great way to at least
learn what that feels like.

00:12:05.788 --> 00:12:09.391
Martin, my question is, since
these two guys over here

00:12:09.391 --> 00:12:11.145
are talking about
Silicon Valley,

00:12:11.145 --> 00:12:13.930
and they started their
big startups over there,

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.650
what do you think
about for these guys?

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:19.244
Do they need to go
to Silicon Valley?

00:12:19.244 --> 00:12:20.244
Can they stay in France?

00:12:20.244 --> 00:12:21.868
What's your recommendation
for startups

00:12:21.868 --> 00:12:24.260
trying to make it here?

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.635
MARTIN GORNER: So first, I
will quote my former boss

00:12:27.635 --> 00:12:34.077
at Mobipocket who famously said
that he was stupid and idiotic

00:12:34.077 --> 00:12:36.060
for having founded
his company in Paris.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:41.900
He said that of himself,
so I can say it.

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.150
And that was in 2000.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:48.400
And I think a lot of
things have changed.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.450
And he was talking specifically
about the bureaucrats.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:55.800
And I've seen a study
last month where

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.430
someone did a study of
the bureaucracy you need

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:00.970
to go through in each of
the European countries

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.570
started a startup.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:05.558
And surprisingly,
that study said--

00:13:05.558 --> 00:13:12.032
it's not me-- that France was
number one, bureaucracy wise.

00:13:12.032 --> 00:13:16.016
Personally, I prefer Paris
to the Silicon Valley.

00:13:16.016 --> 00:13:18.008
But that's just a
personal opinion.

00:13:18.008 --> 00:13:21.000
And I guess many of
you here do as well.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.369
I like [INAUDIBLE]
as well, I can

00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:26.330
spend a couple of
months in Berlin.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.210
There is a lot going on there.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.920
London is fantastic
for startups.

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.350
So I definitely think there's
a lot to do here in Europe.

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.102
Where we are still
lacking a little bit

00:13:39.102 --> 00:13:46.280
is that it's said to be
easier to get financing,

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.621
and especially
serious financing,

00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:54.491
like a second round of
financing, in Silicon Valley.

00:13:54.491 --> 00:13:56.560
Because private
investment is more

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.796
developed there than it is here.

00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:02.310
On the other side, since
I've heard that information,

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:04.400
I also heard that
it wasn't true.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.940
Because competition
was fierce with those

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:12.280
available VCs in the Valley.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:18.822
So community and the
quality of engineers I think

00:14:18.822 --> 00:14:21.700
are good here.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.980
And there is something
to be said also

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:30.655
about going to the Valley
for the experience, the PC

00:14:30.655 --> 00:14:33.505
environment, and the innovation
with the other startups.

00:14:33.505 --> 00:14:35.922
But in the end,
it's your choice.

00:14:35.922 --> 00:14:38.529
But I don't think
there is a bad choice.

00:14:38.529 --> 00:14:39.529
AUDIENCE: Yes, I'm Greg.

00:14:39.529 --> 00:14:42.635
I'm working on the [INAUDIBLE]
device around bicycles.

00:14:42.635 --> 00:14:43.635
It's just the beginning.

00:14:43.635 --> 00:14:45.714
And I have a question.

00:14:45.714 --> 00:14:53.530
You said that failure is-- you
wouldn't probably face failure.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:15:00.058
Do we have to fail on purpose
to get on the second startup

00:15:00.058 --> 00:15:03.016
the attention of VCs,
and say, nice story

00:15:03.016 --> 00:15:06.664
about, I failed, and I stood
up again, and everything?

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:16.003
MICHEL MUNIE: I think succeeding
is better than failing.

00:15:18.892 --> 00:15:25.360
Yeah, the thing that
I was surprised--

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.670
and maybe I shouldn't be
surprised by this at all--

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.300
is that they were
all really smart.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.860
All the VCs I talked to,
I was impressed by them.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.870
They are more on the
people side of things.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.935
And they don't always
understand the intricacies

00:15:36.935 --> 00:15:38.290
of the technology.

00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.010
But they really are
experts at their field.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:43.310
And they've had a
long track record

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:44.650
of being good at what they do.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.500
And I think what they've noticed
is that people who succeed

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.810
continue to succeed.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.461
And maybe this is not
a brilliant insight.

00:15:51.461 --> 00:15:52.960
But they're not
going to be won over

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.650
by some story or
some background.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.039
They really want
typical things that you

00:15:58.039 --> 00:15:59.830
need to see before
investing in a business.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:01.672
What are the backgrounds
of the people?

00:16:01.672 --> 00:16:02.755
What's their track record?

00:16:02.755 --> 00:16:05.670
Do they have the skills
to execute on this?

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:06.730
Do they have a vision?

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:08.460
Will their vision make money?

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.280
How will they exit?

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.710
They're looking at basic things.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.400
And I would focus
on these basics

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:18.820
before you think about any
way to, I guess I would say,

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:19.690
game the system.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:22.230
MARTIN GORNER: And what
I said about failure

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.610
is know that failure is good.

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:28.580
But here, failure is
regarded as a stigma-- you

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:31.360
failed, you're a
failure, you know?

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.580
That is not the case.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:37.610
You can talk with people who
are serial entrepreneurs.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.585
They tell you, I've
done this, and this,

00:16:39.585 --> 00:16:41.360
and I've done this as well.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.120
And you ask them, how did it go?

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:43.930
Oh, it all failed.

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:46.370
But now, I'm doing this.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.010
And it's great.

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:48.530
It's great.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:51.370
And the fourth
thing might succeed.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:53.980
You look at someone like--
well, the famous example

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.975
is Richard Branson.

00:16:55.975 --> 00:17:00.190
He did so many shaky
businesses before he actually

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.080
started his recording business.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.151
And he had success
there because he

00:17:05.151 --> 00:17:08.099
found one artist that
actually became successful.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:11.560
And from there, he went
on to do the whole rest

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.760
of the Virgin empire.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.030
So the message was just,
failing is not a stigma.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:19.290
Failing is experience.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:22.745
AUDIENCE: Hi,
[INAUDIBLE], a new way

00:17:22.745 --> 00:17:25.390
to take notes in a
more smarter way.

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:31.056
So each one of you, could you
give me your number one advice

00:17:31.056 --> 00:17:33.350
with your greatest
startup experience.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:35.070
MARTIN GORNER:
OK, so I'll start.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:37.110
And it's going to
be very different.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:41.080
In my experience, it was
believing in what we did

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.960
and sticking to it against
all odds, which usually, you

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.140
are told not to do.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.810
You are told to
[INAUDIBLE] and so on.

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:52.240
We had all these people
telling us how bad we were

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.510
and how useless our
product was and how

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:58.030
it was going to destroy
the Earth and whatever.

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:02.280
And we still kept going.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:06.070
So we kind of knew
that e-books were

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:09.890
going to be electronic at
one point in time, anyway.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:12.140
That was our inside knowledge.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:13.770
And we stuck to it.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:16.210
MICHEL MUNIE: Yeah, what
you said resonates a lot.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:20.250
Just to add-- extreme
optimism in the face

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.980
of a high probability of
failure is very important.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.545
But I think for--
it's OK, though.

00:18:27.545 --> 00:18:30.190
I think you actually
need these two mindsets.

00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:32.337
My personal advice for you
would be, launch sooner.

00:18:32.337 --> 00:18:33.920
Whatever you're
planning on launching,

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.560
you need to get it
out there sooner.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.840
And this is really
easy advice to ignore.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.690
Because there's always
good reasons not to launch.

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:42.700
There's plenty of good
reasons not to launch.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.908
But you should launch sooner.

00:18:43.908 --> 00:18:46.639
Whatever you're planning,
if you haven't launched yet,

00:18:46.639 --> 00:18:47.930
this is a really bad situation.

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:50.360
Because you don't have any
feedback on how you're doing.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.015
So launch.

00:18:51.015 --> 00:18:52.515
ANSELM BAIRD-SMITH:
What Michel said

00:18:52.515 --> 00:18:54.670
before is [INAUDIBLE]
people who he's worked with.

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.930
Amazingly enough, the
distributed [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.454
I mentioned earlier,
it was my best friend.

00:18:59.454 --> 00:19:02.280
We ended up in
pretty rough shape.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.635
We've since then mended
the relationship.

00:19:04.635 --> 00:19:06.820
And by [INAUDIBLE],
we sold Lala,

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.860
which was the successful
one, I [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:14.780
had literally learned at lunch.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:18.224
And I was extremely
lucky that we

00:19:18.224 --> 00:19:20.676
were a particular mix of people,
and that the relationship

00:19:20.676 --> 00:19:21.176
will grow.

00:19:21.176 --> 00:19:23.390
That helps you go through
all the other problems

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:24.604
that I just mentioned.

00:19:24.604 --> 00:19:25.604
You'll be getting press.

00:19:25.604 --> 00:19:27.591
You're going to want
to launch sooner.

00:19:27.591 --> 00:19:29.591
You are you going to want
to [INAUDIBLE] and all

00:19:29.591 --> 00:19:32.831
of those things if you have
good friends that you can work

00:19:32.831 --> 00:19:35.023
with through all these
issues, et cetera.

00:19:35.023 --> 00:19:39.893
AUDIENCE: Hello, [INAUDIBLE]--
I work in an organization that

00:19:39.893 --> 00:19:45.270
finances startups and
entrepreneurs in Paris.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:49.050
I do have a question
about timing.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:52.226
Your two examples are
quite interesting.

00:19:52.226 --> 00:19:54.610
In your case, you
say that you have

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:58.330
to believe in what you did,
and that actually, you waited.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:02.300
But eventually, it worked.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:04.955
About the question pertaining
is that, yeah, it works.

00:20:04.955 --> 00:20:06.595
Sometimes, it's not good timing.

00:20:06.595 --> 00:20:08.350
So when you see it
doesn't work, you

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:11.350
should just get out
as soon as possible.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:14.856
So I think it's often a
question for startups,

00:20:14.856 --> 00:20:19.796
how long, or until when, do
I believe in my business,

00:20:19.796 --> 00:20:22.735
and how can I understand
that actually it's

00:20:22.735 --> 00:20:25.266
not working, because
there's no market?

00:20:25.266 --> 00:20:27.266
ANSELM BAIRD-SMITH: That's
such a good question.

00:20:27.266 --> 00:20:30.248
My answer is very simple--
half of your funding,

00:20:30.248 --> 00:20:31.770
half of your funding.

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:34.725
So if you do your first run,
when you have half that amount

00:20:34.725 --> 00:20:38.390
in the bank account, that's the
time to have a reality check.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:40.390
So I'll keep it at that.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:43.190
But you have to have very
objective [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.190
It's really, really hard
to give up on something

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:46.700
you've spent so
much patience into.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.180
It's just really hard to
decide that it's not working

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:53.430
and it's time to adjust--
half of your funding.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:56.720
MARTIN GORNER: So in
my case, the funding--

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.966
I'm not going to say
it wasn't a problem.

00:20:58.966 --> 00:21:00.070
The funding was a problem.

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.270
But we were operating
at such a small scale.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.005
We were a microscopic company.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.475
Actually, we were at
a maximum of 17 people

00:21:09.475 --> 00:21:11.850
at the height of the web bubble.

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:18.910
And in late 2000, so like
fall, 2000, the VCs said,

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.495
shut it down, we're
walking out, and so on.

00:21:21.495 --> 00:21:24.830
We fired everyone with
remaining only five engineers.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:29.150
And from there on, we
sailed, but on a slow pace.

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:31.780
So the founders would
find some money.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.498
And we started making some
money, a little revenue,

00:21:34.498 --> 00:21:37.817
which was kind of
enough to get us

00:21:37.817 --> 00:21:42.530
through the five years
of slow-pace sailing.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:46.690
So we didn't have that
reality check time--

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:49.604
we are out of money, what
do we do now, you know?

00:21:49.604 --> 00:21:52.810
In our case, the
real reality check

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:56.930
was that we had
customers-- not many.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:01.480
But those customers seemed to
be practically engaged with us.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.530
They were paying customers.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:09.920
They were paying an average
$10 per book, so not pennies,

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.966
but $10 for every book.

00:22:11.966 --> 00:22:13.720
And they were coming
for more books.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.180
We didn't have enough of them.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.790
We didn't have the
numbers we wanted.

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:20.800
But those who were in, those
who we managed to convince,

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.270
they were convinced.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.683
They wanted more.

00:22:23.683 --> 00:22:26.510
So that's kind of
what got us going.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:29.630
We had this small but very,
very believing and active

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:30.523
customer base.

00:22:30.523 --> 00:22:33.301
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:33.301 --> 00:22:35.310
My company does [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.585
And it does a lot
of different things

00:22:37.585 --> 00:22:41.255
mainly with streaming
video on the internet.

00:22:41.255 --> 00:22:45.290
And my question is
one for one of you.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:47.540
I normally believe
that you got acquired

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.740
because a dinner went nice.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.840
And my question
would be, why exactly

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.000
was your company acquired?

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.350
Is it because you had
great clients, just

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:00.250
great technology, a
mix of everything?

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.490
What was exactly your
precise reasoning

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.860
you got acquired by giants?

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:10.862
ANSELM BAIRD-SMITH: So in our
case, we had a very good exit,

00:23:10.862 --> 00:23:15.594
I should say-- let's be
clear, a very financial exit.

00:23:15.594 --> 00:23:18.260
And we were lucky enough to have
several people fighting for us.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.502
I think the reason they
were quite impressed

00:23:20.502 --> 00:23:23.680
is because they were
afraid of others having us.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.862
And so that was the case.

00:23:25.862 --> 00:23:28.634
Because we were clearly
on the ramp up with users.

00:23:28.634 --> 00:23:30.490
All the [INAUDIBLE]
were going up.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:34.680
And so Apple was worried that
somebody else would get us,

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.370
and it was a good place to be.

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:40.859
But I want to point
out that we never, ever

00:23:40.859 --> 00:23:41.900
worked to being acquired.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.970
We always worked toward building
the best products-- always,

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:48.182
consistently, always on
building the best products.

00:23:48.182 --> 00:23:50.130
MICHEL MUNIE: It's
a good question.

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:53.870
I think one of the
most important things

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:57.410
is that you need to think
about why you're doing this.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:59.250
So some of the
advice I got early on

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:02.740
is it's better to be a
missionary than a mercenary.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.300
And it's kind of
like a funny thing.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.940
But if you're in it
just for the exit--

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:08.635
not saying that you shouldn't
think about that ever.

00:24:08.635 --> 00:24:12.060
But if you're in it, you'll
be kind of an unhappy person.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.920
I personally think
this is true, is

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.540
that you need to
consider things not

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.620
just in the context of business,
but in the context of life.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.120
And the reason
that I worked on it

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:25.410
is because I believe
in the mission.

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:29.600
And I think acquisitions have a
lot of different factors going

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.350
into it.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:32.660
But companies do
recognize people

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.000
who are in it with true passion.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.583
And I think a lot
of the times, that's

00:24:35.583 --> 00:24:39.210
what they look for in addition
to passion from the users.

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:43.230
And so my advice about
acquisition in general

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.070
is keep your eyes
on the true target.

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:48.556
Don't even really think
about acquisition.

00:24:48.556 --> 00:24:54.157
MARTIN GORNER: Well, in our
case, it was, I would say,

00:24:54.157 --> 00:24:54.990
lower key than that.

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:57.884
So Amazon had this
[INAUDIBLE] business,

00:24:57.884 --> 00:25:01.480
had this idea that he
wanted his book business

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.230
to become an e-book business.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:07.870
And that's something that he
promised his shareholders.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:11.075
Because Amazon at that
time was a book seller.

00:25:11.075 --> 00:25:13.200
And everybody kind
of had this idea

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.240
that physical goods one day or
the other, especially cultural

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.706
goods, are going digital.

00:25:19.706 --> 00:25:22.036
AUDIENCE: Hi, Mathieu
from [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:25.401 --> 00:25:27.269
Martin, just before
you said it was

00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:32.140
difficult to accept that we
were acquired by the giant.

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:36.667
And don't you want to
create a new startup?

00:25:36.667 --> 00:25:37.500
MARTIN GORNER: Sure.

00:25:39.137 --> 00:25:40.970
ANSELM BAIRD-SMITH:
It's actually, I'll say,

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:41.560
interesting.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.050
The majority of founders
that Google acquires,

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:47.807
and a lot of the founders that
come to Google after starting

00:25:47.807 --> 00:25:51.712
a startup, a majority of them,
so above 50%, stay at Google.

00:25:51.712 --> 00:25:55.696
And probably because they
let us have a lot of freedom

00:25:55.696 --> 00:25:59.182
to have our own
internal startup.

00:25:59.182 --> 00:26:02.450
MARTIN GORNER: So actually, my
startup was acquired by Amazon.

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:08.300
And what happened is I
was one of the-- well,

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.930
the first engineer
at that startup.

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:11.155
I wasn't the founder.

00:26:11.155 --> 00:26:12.380
I was the first engineer.

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:16.370
What happened is that after
the acquisition, of course,

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:21.530
the founders left as soon as the
contract allowed them to leave.

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:22.885
It's always like that.

00:26:22.885 --> 00:26:25.670
And you get this clause
in the acquisition saying,

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:27.570
you have to stay for
a year and a half.

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:30.380
And they negotiate the close
so that it's only half a year.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.330
And then, you leave
as soon as you can.

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:35.030
I don't know why, but
that's always what happens.

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:41.950
And then, Amazon asked me to be
the CEO of that startup, which

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:43.980
now was a subsidiary.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.142
So that's kind of the reason
I stayed a couple of years

00:26:47.142 --> 00:26:47.950
at Amazon.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:50.216
Because at that time, it
was a challenge for me.

00:26:50.216 --> 00:26:52.830
And I liked that challenge.

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.010
Then, I came over to Google.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:57.090
I did something completely
different-- developer

00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:59.460
relations.

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.258
So I see a lot of startups.

00:27:02.258 --> 00:27:05.318
And I love the
innovation that I see

00:27:05.318 --> 00:27:07.460
and all the energy
that is out there.

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.270
Of course, it's tempting.

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:13.770
But I can't say here on a video
that my boss will actually

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:18.430
watch that I'm
thinking about leaving.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:21.800
MICHEL MUNIE: I've got
to answer this one too?

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:26.622
OK, so do I want to
do something else?

00:27:26.622 --> 00:27:29.210
I think the answer is,
eventually, I will.

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:31.410
But you know, life
is pretty long.

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.250
And I'm very happy
where I am right now.

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.670
So the biggest difference
is-- or two big differences--

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:38.850
one is surprising,
one probably isn't.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.648
So the surprising one is that
I learned way more at Google

00:27:42.648 --> 00:27:44.170
than I did at the startup.

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:46.010
So at the startup, I
learned very little

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.030
about very many things.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.193
But overall, it wasn't a lot.

00:27:50.193 --> 00:27:52.026
If you added all my
learnings into a bucket,

00:27:52.026 --> 00:27:54.540
it was just a whole bunch of
random crap-- a little bit

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.500
about PR, a little
bit about marketing,

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.110
a little bit about programming,
a little bit about databases,

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:00.360
a little bit about algorithms.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.950
I feel like at Google now,
I'm working on something

00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:03.950
that i care a lot about.

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:05.510
So I did my PhD.

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:06.760
I'm working on algorithms now.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.480
I do recommendation systems.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:12.520
The amount of data we
have here is amazing.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.850
I really enjoy this.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.760
So I'm going to stay probably
for quite a long time.

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.435
The second thing, which
is the obvious one,

00:28:19.435 --> 00:28:25.350
is that I don't have existential
stress in my life anymore.

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:29.657
I used to wake up and
worry about the company

00:28:29.657 --> 00:28:31.490
and about the people
who were working there.

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:35.768
Because I knew if I screwed
up, the company would be over,

00:28:35.768 --> 00:28:39.380
like you have to go in
someday and tell these people,

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.240
we're out of money, I'm laying
you guys off, that's it.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:47.107
And this is, I think, a very
stressful situation to be in,.

00:28:47.107 --> 00:28:48.315
And maybe it's exciting, too.

00:28:48.315 --> 00:28:50.560
But right now, I
feel like I focus

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:54.906
on what I do not like
some abstract-- not

00:28:54.906 --> 00:28:58.120
some bad result that will
come from my actions.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.800
This is because I believe
in the mission of Google,

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.300
to organize the
world's information,

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.800
make it universally
accessible and useful.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.270
I really do believe in this.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:08.130
I think this is a good
thing for the world.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:09.921
I think it's made the
world a better place.

00:29:09.921 --> 00:29:13.390
And I don't worry about Google's
financial health, either.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:14.426
So I can come in.

00:29:14.426 --> 00:29:16.820
I can work towards that
mission and do the kind of work

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:19.677
I enjoy doing every day.

00:29:19.677 --> 00:29:20.968
