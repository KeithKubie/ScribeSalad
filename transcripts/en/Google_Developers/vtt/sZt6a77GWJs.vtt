00:00:04.385 --> 00:00:06.720
PAIGE BAILEY: I'm Paige
Bailey, a TensorFlow developer

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.480
advocate, and I'm here today
with Doug Stevenson, who's

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.100
going to tell us
all about the latest

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.955
and greatest in Firebase.

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:14.580
So show us what you
have planned, Doug.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.372
DOUG STEVENSON: OK.

00:00:15.372 --> 00:00:17.190
So turns out
Firebase has a bunch

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.410
of products that help
you ensure a high quality

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.618
of your app, which is very
important for a lot of app

00:00:21.618 --> 00:00:22.200
developers.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.500
Every app developer always has
to be able to diagnose crashes

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.140
in their app--

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.520
PAIGE BAILEY: Yes.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.770
DOUG STEVENSON: --as you know.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.450
So Firebase has a tool
called Crashlytics.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.240
With Crashlytics, the
integration is fairly simple.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.090
Add a plug-in, add a build
dependency to your build

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.740
and it just starts
monitoring crashes.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.670
You don't have to write
any lines of code.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.220
So the app is
crashing, you can see

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.020
that it's rather
problematic for our users.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.227
But it turns out the
engineers made a good decision

00:00:46.227 --> 00:00:48.060
and they put this new
home screen experiment

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.227
behind a Remote Config flag.

00:00:49.227 --> 00:00:50.977
PAIGE BAILEY: So tell
me a little bit more

00:00:50.977 --> 00:00:52.144
about what Remote Config is.

00:00:52.144 --> 00:00:53.060
DOUG STEVENSON: Right.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.937
So Remote Config lets you define
key value pairs in the Firebase

00:00:55.937 --> 00:00:58.020
console and then you can
publish those to your app

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.590
without having to actually write
any lines of code in your app.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.445
So it gets them all almost
immediately as you change them

00:01:05.445 --> 00:01:06.070
in the console.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.558
So the idea here is we
have a new parameter.

00:01:08.558 --> 00:01:10.350
It's called home screen
experiment enabled,

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.600
and the default value is true.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.980
So this is what's enabling
the new home screen

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.765
experiment that's also
causing devices to crash.

00:01:16.765 --> 00:01:19.140
Now, what we want to do here
is ask our engineer and say,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.880
our engineer thinks that
it's a translation issue.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.690
So we've narrowed it down
to Spanish speakers who

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.950
are using the app on Android.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.680
So we can define a new
condition here for this flag

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.360
and say for Spanish
speakers who are

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.045
using Android what
we can do is disable

00:01:33.045 --> 00:01:34.170
the home screen experiment.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.060
So we'll set it to
false for all of them

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.112
and all the other users
can retain the value true.

00:01:39.112 --> 00:01:41.070
So, now, once this is
configured, what we'll do

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.370
is publish the store app,
and the app internally

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.378
will use Firebase Remote Config
to fetch parameters, pull out

00:01:47.378 --> 00:01:49.420
that home screen flag,
and enable the home screen

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.190
experiment if it's been
enabled for this device.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.940
PAIGE BAILEY: And it's
amazing that you're

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.610
able to narrow in with
such laser focus what

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.700
the problem could be, and then
to change it without altering

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.630
a single line of code.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.838
DOUG STEVENSON: Right, right.

00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:03.850
So it's remotely fixing
your app in some cases.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.570
And we do recommend that
people publish their apps

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.800
with new features hidden
behind Remote Config flags,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.130
so you can toggle them on
and off for cases like this.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.370
PAIGE BAILEY: Right.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.370
DOUG STEVENSON: So we'll
publish our new changes

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.250
to Remote Config.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.367
We can see that the app
is no longer crashy.

00:02:16.367 --> 00:02:17.950
PAIGE BAILEY: I see
no more sad faces.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.367
DOUG STEVENSON:
No more sad faces,

00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:21.540
and the number of crash
for users has gone up,

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.905
so we've reduced the crash
rate down to below 1%,

00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:25.780
which is really good.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.330
So a successful experiment.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.470
PAIGE BAILEY: That's amazing.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.895
So launch into the next demo.

00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:31.770
What do we have next?

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:32.050
DOUG STEVENSON: Yeah.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.300
So another thing that
developers need to be able to do

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.387
is compare what
their users prefer.

00:02:36.387 --> 00:02:37.470
PAIGE BAILEY: A/B testing.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.178
DOUG STEVENSON: Perform
an A/B test, yes.

00:02:39.178 --> 00:02:40.860
So what we can do
is use Firebase A/B

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.738
testing to create and
run an experiment.

00:02:42.738 --> 00:02:44.280
So what we can do
in the console here

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.220
is create an experiment
with a name targeting

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.090
half of our users with some
metrics that we want to track,

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.280
and we're going to use
Firebase Remote Config again

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.560
to configure this experiment.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.270
So, for the control group,
dark mode will not be enabled.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.887
And for the variant group, we
will enable this experiment.

00:02:59.887 --> 00:03:01.470
So Remote Config as
it's going to tell

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.980
half the devices to run this
experiment and half the devices

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:04.480
not.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.600
And we'll compare the metrics
on that and see how it performs.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.360
PAIGE BAILEY: And all of this
is done through the console.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.320
DOUG STEVENSON: Yes, all of this
is done through the console.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.403
So we can see here our
experiment is ready to run.

00:03:13.403 --> 00:03:16.210
We're especially interested
in 15 day retention,

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.480
so we're going to use that
as the way to determine

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.160
whether or not this
experiment is successful.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.153
So what we can do is
start this experiment.

00:03:23.153 --> 00:03:24.570
Bear in mind that
Remote Config is

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.360
being used to pull
out that Boolean flag

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.370
and enable dark mode
only for those half

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.760
of all devices that are
configured to use it.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.783
And what we're going to
do is run this A/B test,

00:03:34.783 --> 00:03:36.450
and that's going to
push to our devices.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.717
And, as you can see, some of our
devices are running dark mode

00:03:39.717 --> 00:03:41.550
and some are running
light mode, and they're

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.720
switching between the two.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.990
PAIGE BAILEY: I think I
like the light mode best.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.460
DOUG STEVENSON:
You like the light?

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.960
OK.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.278
I'm partial to dark mode but--

00:03:46.278 --> 00:03:48.320
PAIGE BAILEY: Well, let's
see what the users say.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.640
DOUG STEVENSON: Yeah.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.860
The users get to decide
based on our goal metrics.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.960
PAIGE BAILEY: Oh, man.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.260
DOUG STEVENSON: Yeah.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.280
It looks like dark mode
is the leader in this,

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.820
and we can see the exact
mark on the retention

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.960
that this experiment had.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.210
PAIGE BAILEY: This is amazing.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.020
I was a data scientist
in a previous life,

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.880
and, historically,
we would have to use

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.180
weeks of training and custom
code and configurations

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.610
and track all of the metrics
and visualizations ourselves.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.078
But this looks like
you could do it

00:04:10.078 --> 00:04:11.620
just by clicking a
couple of buttons.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.578
DOUG STEVENSON: That
entire engine is basically

00:04:13.578 --> 00:04:15.480
hidden by Firebase A/B testing.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.640
So we can use Remote
Config and then push it out

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.510
to all of our users.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.399
All right.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:22.200
The last thing that a
lot of app developers

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.770
are concerned about--

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.230
PAIGE BAILEY: And it's probably
the most the most important

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.560
one.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.477
DOUG STEVENSON: And
everyone wants their pages

00:04:27.477 --> 00:04:30.300
to load fast and their
screens to be snappy.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.120
So what we can do is measure
that with Firebase Performance

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.662
Monitoring.

00:04:33.662 --> 00:04:35.370
Now with Firebase
Performance Monitoring,

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.638
you put basically
one SDK in your app

00:04:37.638 --> 00:04:39.180
and it automatically
collects things.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.740
And it goes out to
your users and it

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.880
measures the behavior of your
app on your user's devices.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.130
But if you do need to measure
something in particular,

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.100
like say, the load screen
time, what you can do

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.573
is create a trace.

00:04:51.573 --> 00:04:53.490
PAIGE BAILEY: And so,
tell me what a trace is.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.900
DOUG STEVENSON: So
a trace is something

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.900
in Firebase Performance
Monitoring that measures

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.030
the duration of something.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.600
So here we're creating a new
trace, we're starting a timer.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.453
Then after we load
and all of our image

00:05:02.453 --> 00:05:04.370
and text for this screen
we'll stop the timer.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.150
That becomes our metric.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.865
So that's going to get sent
to the Firebase Performance

00:05:08.865 --> 00:05:09.740
Monitoring dashboard.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.310
So we're going to run this code
on all of our users devices,

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.110
collect this metric,
and now you can

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.310
see here is the trend
over time is that 555

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.752
milliseconds of load time.

00:05:20.752 --> 00:05:22.210
PAIGE BAILEY: That
is way too long.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.100
DOUG STEVENSON:
It's half a second,

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.420
but it still feels
like an eternity

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.670
and when you click the button.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.425
So what we need to do
is bring this down.

00:05:27.425 --> 00:05:29.300
Now it turns out this
app has been configured

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.380
with Firebase Remote Config
to have a configurable image

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.880
quality.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.060
So the idea is, to speed up
the performance for our app,

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.400
we'll ratchet down the quality.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.320
Maybe that will make the images
smaller and faster to load.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.320
So what we can do is
create a condition for this

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.680
and say that half of our
users get a reduced quality.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.227
So, when we finalize
this, half of our users

00:05:48.227 --> 00:05:50.060
are going to get the
default, the other half

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.290
are going to get this
reduced image quality.

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.890
And then we can compare
this in the dashboard.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.110
Now, again, we do need
a few lines of code

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.480
to enable this in Remote Config.

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.550
When that's done, we can
collect this information

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.390
on our user's devices,
exactly as they're using it

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.460
and come up with results.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.957
So we were able to reduce
the time to 111 milliseconds,

00:06:08.957 --> 00:06:10.790
and our engineer thinks
this is a good idea.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:11.800
PAIGE BAILEY: Much faster.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.650
And I agree with them.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.942
And it also looks like you
can drill down into the data

00:06:14.942 --> 00:06:15.770
by device?

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:16.370
DOUG STEVENSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.440
So right now we're slicing
this by app version,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.110
but you can also use
other characteristics

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.450
of the device and
the user to determine

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.732
what the performance is for
very specific conditions.

00:06:25.732 --> 00:06:26.940
PAIGE BAILEY: That's amazing.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.960
And I love being able to see
the visualizations just out

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.050
of the box.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.830
So thank you so much for sharing
all of this great functionality

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.490
with Firebase.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.627
I can't wait to try
out an A/B test.

00:06:36.627 --> 00:06:38.210
