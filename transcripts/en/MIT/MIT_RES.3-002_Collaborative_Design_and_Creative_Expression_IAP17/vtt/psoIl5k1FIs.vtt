00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.510
PRESENTER 1: It randomly
chooses a number

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.510
and flashes five times.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.870
And if it chooses a
number between 1 to 5,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.630
you have a chance
to win a lottery.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.940
We have lotteries here.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.190
By the way, there's
[? 50 ?] percent

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.010
of chances that you
get punched in the face

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.389
or like a punishment, right?

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:36.180
PRESENTER 2: Yeah, some
sort of punishment.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.580
PRESENTER 1: Yeah, some
sort of punishment.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.230
And we welcome all
of you to try it.

00:00:42.704 --> 00:00:43.620
PRESENTER 2: Mine is--

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.690
I named it an Imprecise
Ardruino Ruler.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.530
So this is like an
ultrasonic sensor

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.850
in that it can tell distance.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.720
So I set it up with
a series of lights.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.900
So we'll just have this
piece of cardboard.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.900
If you have just a piece
of cardboard over here,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.706
it shows that it's
five centimeters away.

00:01:03.706 --> 00:01:08.739
If you move it farther
away, more like [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:11.280
PRESENTER 1: So eventually, we
want to combine them together,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.884
like how many lights
show on there,

00:01:13.884 --> 00:01:15.550
they would display
the number over here.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.591
And then win the lottery.

00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:20.310
But since they're on two
different ardruino boards

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.090
we just make it separate and
play with the LEDs right now.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.760
So what I would
suggest right now,

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.030
if somebody is going to receive
either punishment or reward,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.350
they get close to the
sensor and get the reward

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.490
from Franklin over there.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.051
So we have to be careful.

00:01:38.051 --> 00:01:38.550
OK,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.287
AUDIENCE: So I say, like, two.

00:01:40.287 --> 00:01:41.870
So right, I just
guess the number two.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:42.705
PRESENTER 1: Yeah, you
don't have to guess it,

00:01:42.705 --> 00:01:43.980
it will randomly choose it.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.192
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:01:45.192 --> 00:01:47.735
PRESENTER 1: So you're
completely relying on God.

00:01:51.615 --> 00:01:54.075
PRESENTER 2: It
slowly lights up.

00:01:54.075 --> 00:01:56.260
AUDIENCE: What's the
percentage on it?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.270
PRESENTER 2: It's
very imprecise.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.690
This lights up from distance
from five to 10 centimeters.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.860
This lights up when
the object is 10 to 15,

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.610
this is 15 to 20 and so on.
