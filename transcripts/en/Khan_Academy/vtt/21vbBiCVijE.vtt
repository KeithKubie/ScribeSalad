00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.246
I have triangle ABC here.

00:00:02.246 --> 00:00:03.620
And in the last
video, we started

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.890
to explore some of the
properties of points

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.600
that are on angle bisectors.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.266
And now, what I want
to do in this video

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:11.730
is just see what happens when
we apply some of those ideas

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.680
to triangles or the
angles in triangles.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.990
So let's bisect this angle
right over here-- angle BAC.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.710
And let me draw
an angle bisector.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.460
So the angle bisector
might look something--

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.620
I want to make sure I get
that angle right in two.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.680
Pretty close.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.780
So that looks pretty close.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.080
So that's the angle bisector.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.920
Let me call this point
right over here--

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.910
I don't know-- I could
call this point D.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.380
And then, let me draw
another angle bisector,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.790
the one that bisects angle ABC.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.360
So let me just draw this one.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.450
It might look something
like that right over there.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.510
And I could maybe
call this point E.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:58.290
So AD bisects angle BAC,
and BE bisects angle ABC.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.370
So the fact that
this green line-- AD

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.390
bisects this angle
right over here--

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.450
that tells us that
this angle must

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.570
be equal to that angle
right over there.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.380
They must have
the same measures.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.830
And the fact that this bisects
this angle-- angle ABC-- tells

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.180
us that the measure of
this angle-- angle ABE--

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.670
must be equal to the
measure of angle EBC.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.220
Now, we see clearly that
they have intersected

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.250
at a point inside of the
triangle right over there.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.350
So let's call that
point I just for fun.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.640
I'm skipping a few
letters, but it's

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.410
a useful letter
based on what we are

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.430
going to call this
in very short order.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.888
And there's some
interesting things

00:01:39.888 --> 00:01:43.430
that we know about I. I sits on
both of these angle bisectors.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.470
And we saw in the previous
video that any point that

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.430
sits on an angle bisector
is equidistant from the two

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.430
sides of that angle.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.920
So for example, I sits on AD.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.360
So it's going to be
equidistant from the two

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.510
sides of angle BAC.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.140
So this is one side
right over here.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.000
This is one side
right over there.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.100
And then this is the other
side right over there.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.949
So because I sits on AD, we
know that these two distances

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.040
are going to be the
same, assuming that this

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.699
is the shortest distance
between I and the sides.

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:17.740
And then, we've also shown
in that previous video

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.341
that, when we talk about
the distance between a point

00:02:20.341 --> 00:02:22.840
and a line, we're talking about
the shortest distance, which

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.185
is the distance you get if
you drop a perpendicular.

00:02:25.185 --> 00:02:27.060
So that's why I drew
the perpendiculars right

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.930
over there.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.440
And let's label these.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.180
This could be
point F. This could

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.410
be point G right over here.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.910
So because I sits on AD,
sits on this angle bisector,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:45.340
we know that IF is
going to be equal to IG.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.510
Fair enough.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.355
Now, I also sits on
this angle bisector.

00:02:49.355 --> 00:02:54.985
It also sits on BE, which says
that it must be equidistant.

00:02:54.985 --> 00:02:59.180
The distance to AB must be the
same as I's distance to BC.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.830
I's distance to
AB we already just

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.380
said is this right over here.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.710
It's IG.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.750
But we also know
that that distance

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.550
must be the same as the
distance between I and BC.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.657
So if I drop another
perpendicular right over here.

00:03:13.657 --> 00:03:15.490
And let's say I call
this point-- let's see,

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.520
I haven't used H
right over here--

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.860
this distance must be
the same as this distance

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.760
because I sits on this bisector.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.210
So IG must be equal to IH.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.540
But IF is also equal to IG.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.600
So we can also say that IF--
I mean, if IF is equal to IG

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.610
is equal to IH, we also
know that IF is equal to IH.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.911
Pretty much common sense.

00:03:41.911 --> 00:03:43.910
If this is equal to that,
that is equal to that,

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.820
then these two have to
be equal to each other.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.644
But if I is equidistant
from two sides of an angle--

00:03:49.644 --> 00:03:51.060
this is the second
part of what we

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.890
proved in the previous video--
if you have a point that

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.230
is equidistant from
two sides of an angle,

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.300
then that point must sit on the
angle bisector for that angle.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.150
So this right here
tells us that I

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:20.250
must be on angle
bisector of angle ACB.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.680
Because it's equidistant to
those two sides of angle ACB.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.290
And what we have just
shown is that there's

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.030
a unique point inside
the triangle that

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.055
sits on all three
angle bisectors.

00:04:33.055 --> 00:04:35.680
It's not always obvious that if
you took three lines-- in fact,

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.910
normally, if you
took three lines,

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.743
they're not going to
intersect in one point.

00:04:38.743 --> 00:04:40.480
Two lines, a very
reasonable thing to do.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.850
But three lines, not always
going to intersect in one

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:43.350
point.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.820
But once again-- like we
saw with the circumcenter

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.725
where we took the perpendicular
bisectors of the side-- that

00:04:48.725 --> 00:04:50.850
was pretty neat that they
intersected in one point.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.500
Now, it's also cool
that we're showing

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.340
that the angle bisectors all
intersect in one unique point.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.250
I is on the angle bisector of
ACB, so the bisector of ACB

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.250
will look something like this.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.130
And this angle
right over here is

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.930
going to be congruent to
this angle right over there.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.500
So we've just shown that
if you take the three angle

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.430
bisectors of a triangle, it
will intersect in a unique point

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.990
right over there that
sits on all three of them.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.470
So it seems worthwhile that
we should call this something

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.030
special.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.900
And we do.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.740
And that's why I
called it I. We call

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.700
I the incenter of triangle ABC.

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:37.710
And you're going
to see in a second

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.290
why it's called the incenter.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.020
When we talked about
the circumcenter,

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.940
that was the center
of a circle that

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.790
could be circumscribed
about the triangle.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.950
I-- we'll see in
about five seconds--

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.760
is the center of
a circle that can

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.570
be put inside the
triangle that's

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.320
tangent to the three sides.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.930
And how do we construct that?

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.000
Well, we've just
established that I

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.780
is equidistant to
each of the sides--

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.650
that this length is
equal to that length

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.130
is equal to that length.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.050
So what happens if you
set up a circle with I

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.560
as a center that has a radius
equal to the distance between I

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.920
and any one of the
sides, which is equal,

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.434
that has a radius
equal to IF, IG, or IH?

00:06:17.434 --> 00:06:19.350
Well, then, you're going
to have a circle that

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:26.510
looks something like this.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.690
Let me draw it a little
bit better than that.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:31.760
Well, you can imagine.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.290
This is my best attempt
to draw a circle.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.270
This circle right here
that has the radius

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.880
equal to the distance between
I and any of the sides--

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.910
which we've already
established as being equal--

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.330
we see that it's sitting
inside of the circle.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.100
So why don't we call
this an incircle?

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.440
So circle I. Remember,
you label circles usually

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.960
with the point at the center.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:07:01.090
Circle I is the incircle
of triangle ABC.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.030
And of course, the
radius of circle I--

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.844
so we could call this length r.

00:07:06.844 --> 00:07:10.390
We say r is equal
to IF, which is

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:15.170
equal to IH, which
is equal to IG.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.920
We can call that
length the inradius.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.510
And it makes sense
because it's inside.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.520
When we were talking
about the intersection

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.267
of the perpendicular bisectors,
we had our circumcenter

00:07:27.267 --> 00:07:29.100
because that was the
center of a circle that

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.960
is circumscribed
about the triangle.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.480
Now, we're taking
the intersection

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.810
of the angle bisectors.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.600
And then, using that, we're
able to define a circle that

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.120
is kind of within the
triangle and whose

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.150
sides are tangent to the circle.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.660
And since it's inside it,
we call this an incircle.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:52.460
We call the intersection of the
angle bisectors the incenter.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.340
And we call this distance
right over here the inradius.
