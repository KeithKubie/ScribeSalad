[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.096 --> 00:00:09.470
DERK DE KORVER:
All right, folks.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.680
Welcome, and thank you
for joining today's Google

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.260
talk with Matt Dixon.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.760
Before we get
started, I would like

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.580
to ask everybody in the
room to mute their phones

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.730
and turn off any notifications,
as this is being recorded live.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.820
So we don't want
any interruptions.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.700
As well, I just
want to announce we

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.350
are expecting a lot of people
to join through live stream.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.950
So if you do have
questions for Matt,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.969
we have a 10-minute section
at the end where you'll

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.260
be able to ask those questions.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.690
And I've set up a Dory
for people remotely.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.870
And it's at go/coachdixon where
you can submit your questions.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.660
So yeah, without further
ado, let's get started.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.230
For those of you
who don't know Matt,

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.560
Matt is a world-class
triathlon coach.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.100
He's also a former
triathlon pro.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.470
And today, he's most well
known for creating Purple Patch

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.040
Fitness, which is a global
community headquartered here

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.500
in San Francisco.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.320
As part of Purple
Patch, he manages--

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.750
I say manage, but
coaches a handful

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.150
of elite pro triathletes.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.210
Just to name a few
which you might know,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.220
Jesse Thomas, Sarah Piampiano,
Sam Appleton, Laura Siddall.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.140
Laura Siddall actually went
on to win Ironman New Zealand

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.930
this past weekend.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.410
So congrats, Matt.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.580
As well as that, he coaches
a wide variety of age-group

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.300
athletes, so amateurs
like you and me,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.190
ranging from the very elite--

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.850
he's helped over 250
age-group athletes qualify

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.580
for the Ironman World
Championships in Kona--

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.550
to the more average
athletes, who

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.690
are just seeking to
stay fit or conquer

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.660
one of their life goals.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.550
And it's here where Matt has
really specialized his focus

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.820
on these athletes who are
time-starved, like you and me,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.190
trying to fit in training in our
busy lives of work, family, et

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.927
cetera.

00:02:13.927 --> 00:02:15.260
Now, Matt's a busy man, as well.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.140
He does all that, and he's
also written two books.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.730
He wrote "The
Well-Built Triathlete"

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.120
and most recently launched
the "Fast-Track Triathlete,"

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.194
of which you have a copy
here on your chairs.

00:02:27.194 --> 00:02:29.610
Now, you might be
asking who am I?

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.480
My name is Derk de Korver.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.710
I'm a I'm a fellow Googler
and also a triathlete.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.860
And I'm part of Purple Patch
Fitness, and I train with Matt.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.150
So yeah, so let's get started.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.151
I'll give the
floor to Matt here.

00:02:44.151 --> 00:02:45.650
Maybe you could
give us a little bit

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.400
of background about yourself
and how you created Purple Patch

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.180
Fitness.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.425
MATT DIXON: Sure.

00:02:52.425 --> 00:02:54.920
I am the epitome of
an example of how

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.922
to do a professional triathlon
career very, very poorly.

00:02:57.922 --> 00:02:59.630
As you can tell, I'm
not from the States.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.510
I actually came
across here in 1992.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.037
And I was one of the sort of
lucky early, relatively early,

00:03:06.037 --> 00:03:08.370
sort of guys that came across
on a swimming scholarship.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.480
So my backbone or my
background was swimming.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.220
And swimming is a sport
that, at least at that time,

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.150
was all about high
volume, higher endurance.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.380
And I remember when we swam,
we weren't even allowed

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.838
water bottles on the pool deck
even though we were swimming

00:03:23.838 --> 00:03:26.790
27 hours of swimming a week.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.690
So it gives you some idea of
sort of the mindset back then

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.120
in the early '90s.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.392
In parallel to swimming, I was
studying exercise physiology.

00:03:36.392 --> 00:03:38.600
So right from the start, I
had this interesting blend

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.030
between sort of science and, of
course, being an elite athlete.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.490
And when I finished my
swimming career, which

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.839
ended up not making the
Olympic team, the quest of most

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:50.630
internationals that
were coming over here--

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.442
we were trying to make
our national teams.

00:03:52.442 --> 00:03:53.150
I didn't make it.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.692
I was fifth or sixth.

00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:56.150
That shows you how
long ago it was.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.316
I can't even remember whether
it was fifth or sixth.

00:03:58.316 --> 00:04:00.960
But that's where I
got into coaching.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.870
And I started as
a swimming coach.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.620
And I was very lucky to
actually start with a very, very

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.694
good age group program.

00:04:07.694 --> 00:04:09.110
But I realized I
didn't want to be

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.220
a swimming coach, or at least
just in the regular setting.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.410
So I went on to do my master's
degree in clinical physiology.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.510
And so now I had this advanced
degree in clinical physiology.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.922
I went on to coach at
the division one level

00:04:22.922 --> 00:04:23.880
while I was doing that.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.430
And that's where
I found triathlon.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.140
And I found out I was
pretty good at triathlon.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.010
And so out of that, despite my
background of having a backbone

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.120
or background in elite swimming,
having a coaching background

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.980
already with several
years of coaching,

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.310
and a master's degree
in clinical physiology,

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.100
I went on to be the great
example of how to do

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.400
a professional career poorly.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.120
And I took the work ethic
of swimming and thought,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.825
well, if I was training
27 hours a week for a two-

00:04:53.825 --> 00:04:55.700
to four-minute event,
what am I going to have

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.560
to train for an Ironman?

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.590
And so I multiplied it
as much as you possibly

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.790
could, with continued nothing
but lip service to subjects

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.270
such as recovery,
nutrition, fueling,

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.950
hydration, and had this
sort of small rise,

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.100
maybe a little bit of glory,
and then a staggering defeat

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.690
into chronic fatigue.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.830
And interestingly, that
was a wonderful thing

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.980
that I think happened
for me, was the fact

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.750
that everything came to a shut.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.350
And about 15 years ago now, my
professional triathlon career

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.490
was over.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.230
And I was starting
to coach triathletes,

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.460
and that was really the
start of Purple Patch.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.960
It was, bizarrely,
a positive thing.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.160
DERK DE KORVER: Wow.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.440
So you did a professional
career poorly.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.619
How can that be
a positive thing?

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:52.160
MATT DIXON: I think it was one
of those situations in my life

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.300
that it forced me
to take a step back.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.870
And I think so often,
we charge ahead

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.630
and we forge ahead with
our quest, especially

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.410
when, as an athlete, it's
a very specific quest,

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.130
world-class performance.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.520
And so you can
filter out so much

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.780
of the things that are
right in front of you.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.220
And when it's stripped away, as
with any sort of adversity that

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.760
can happen in life, it forced
me to take a step back and look

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.630
at the landscape of my sport at
the time, which was triathlon.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.110
And what I saw was
at the elite level,

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.960
and particularly at
the amateur level,

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.710
I just saw so much
underperformance or low return

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.630
on investment
relative to the effort

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.970
that people were putting in.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.760
And the barometer of
success at the time

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.160
was simply about the
accumulation of hours.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.020
More miles, more hours,
the better it is.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.280
And subjects which now are
quite trendy, but recovery,

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.020
nutrition, fueling--

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.820
everything was an afterthought.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.760
And I just thought,
there must be

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.770
a better way of approaching
the sport globally.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.710
And I looked at this
symptom of underperformance.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.290
And what I saw at all
levels from people

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.250
that were beginning to get
into the sport with big lives,

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.620
as well as at the top
world-class level,

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.720
most athletes were showing up.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.700
Motivation wasn't the challenge.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.830
But they were showing up to
their races fit and fatigued.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:22.520
And I thought, that can't be
good for ultimate performance.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.700
And so with my
education background

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.860
and my own personal experience
and what I saw in my coaching,

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.010
I think it was really the
birth of the Purple Patch

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:33.650
methodology.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.280
Because I decided at
that time to be a bit

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.020
counterculture against
the overall sort

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.560
of general theme of how people
would go about endurance sports

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.519
globally.

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:45.560
And I decided to make a
pretty bold move and say,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.230
I'm going to go about it
from a very different lens.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:50.240
And that was really,
I think for me,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.390
the start of the Purple
Patch methodology, which

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.710
15 years later is still the
heartbeat of what we do.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.964
And so I must have been
on to something, at least.

00:07:58.964 --> 00:08:01.130
DERK DE KORVER: So that
must have been quite a shock

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.970
to the triathlon community,
a new way of thinking.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:09.560
How would you define the
Purple Patch methodology?

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:12.170
MATT DIXON: It was a shock.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.030
In fact, I got labeled
the recovery coach

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:18.470
because I bubbled that right up
to the top of the conversation.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.470
A lot of my writing
was around recovery.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.080
And it wasn't always
a positive name

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.900
that I was given, although
now it's sort of become

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.860
a badge of honor, in many ways.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.520
And so I think the
methodology can really be

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.980
defined in very simple terms.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.054
And as it lives now today,
there is a common thread.

00:08:38.054 --> 00:08:39.470
So it doesn't
matter whether we're

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.559
talking about a world-class
athlete or someone that's

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.840
purely a fitness enthusiast.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.340
Everyone wants to improve.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.810
Everyone wants to thrive.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.230
That's the common thread that I
see amongst fitness enthusiasts

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.480
to my professional athletes.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:59.000
And what we have found is
that by integrating four key

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.890
components, what we
call the four pillars--

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.290
and there are more, but these
are the central four that I

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:07.730
think are omnipresent, and
that's endurance activity,

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.530
or training for your
world-class athlete,

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.860
but endurance activity
supported with some strength

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.440
and conditioning-- so
you have to have both--

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.390
and with adequate recovery.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.190
And that encompasses
sleep, which

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.230
is a big, trendy
topic at the moment,

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:25.370
with a backbone of really
basic but important nutritional

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.270
habits.

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:30.140
When we get those four things
present, people thrive.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.790
People accelerate.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.052
And it's completely
regardless of level.

00:09:35.052 --> 00:09:36.260
It doesn't matter what level.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.470
Those four key components
are the basics.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:42.410
Now, what we see a
lot is people that

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:45.230
are pretty good at being
singularly focused.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.210
I really want to exercise.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.730
But it all falls to
pieces if we don't

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.760
have all four elements
actually present

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.300
in people's sort of emotional
approach to life, in many ways.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:10:01.910
And so I think that's the real
backbone and the very central

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:07.241
sort of thesis on everyone
that we serve, in many ways.

00:10:07.241 --> 00:10:09.660
DERK DE KORVER: And by
everyone, you mean--

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:13.260
you've mentioned the
pros, as well as elites.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.990
And I've experienced that
with training with you.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.910
During our swim sets,
the pros are to the left,

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.570
and then we have all the
time-starved athletes sort

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.580
of in the rest of the lanes.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.590
How is it different working with
these two types of athletes?

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.320
MATT DIXON: It is different.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.510
It's a little bit Jekyll
and Hyde in some ways.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.540
But at the same
time, it really comes

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.960
down to how you apply
those principles.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:39.000
So if you can buy
in for a moment

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.920
that there are four
basic tenets that we're

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.920
going to be talking about--
endurance, strength,

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.870
and nutrition as a big
bucket, and recovery,

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.830
it's really how you
apply those principles.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.370
So let's first
establish the mindset

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.140
of the professional athlete.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.860
Their quest is unapologetically
world-class performance.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.810
So what that means
for the athlete--

00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:59.576
and that's who you
read about in magazines

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:01.450
if you're a triathlete,
whatever it might be.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:05.490
But their quest is everything
around physical performance

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.480
is the centerpiece
of their life.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.080
So my job as a coach
is to actually take

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.727
the other components of
life and suppress them.

00:11:13.727 --> 00:11:15.060
It's kind of like a monk's life.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.090
Because they are, for a
short period in their life--

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.040
four, eight, 10 years--

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.410
they are seeking
world-class performance.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.170
And so components, like
obviously the training,

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:28.680
but nutrition, bodywork,
massage, et cetera,

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.010
the fueling, their
sleep, that is their job.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:36.882
And everything else around life
has to be built around that.

00:11:36.882 --> 00:11:37.590
That makes sense.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:39.000
So that's what the quest is.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.060
Unfortunately, many amateurs
apply that to their lives.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.130
And that's when
failing comes in.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.880
For the time-starved amateur,
most time-starved amateurs

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.860
that we work with,
fitness enthusiasts,

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.780
but all the way up
to Derk's level,

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.220
who's an athlete amateur,
the mission, I believe,

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.320
should be about integration.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.750
So it's not about seeking
world-class performance.

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:02.744
You're actually
seeking more than that.

00:12:02.744 --> 00:12:04.160
I believe that
what you're seeking

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.710
is integrating very basic habits
and an appropriate training

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:12.960
program so that yes, you
can improve and get fitter,

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.850
stronger, more
powerful, or, for him,

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:16.800
get ready for the
Hawaiian Ironman,

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.800
but not at the expense
of the other institutions

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.910
of your life.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.700
And in fact, when we think
about working with an amateur,

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.130
we're trying to do two things--

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.950
help you thrive
in sport, but also

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.900
help you improve
your health, help

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.270
you improve how you can
perform at the workplace,

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.370
and be the best
version of yourself

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:38.710
that you can for your family,
friends, and everything else.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:42.210
And by successfully doing
that, that defines the mindset,

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:43.950
I would say, of what
we're looking for.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:46.050
So it's really about
the application

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:49.950
of how we're sort of applying
the foundational methodology

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:50.640
in many ways.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.040
DERK DE KORVER: Yeah.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.890
And so a question here--
when I'm looking at the group

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.160
and just knowing the culture at
Google, a lot of the employees

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.280
here are performance-driven
and, to say the least, very

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.380
time-starved, I think, as well.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.290
What do you see people like us--

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.720
what are the biggest
mistakes you see us making?

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.260
MATT DIXON: I think it's two.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.500
I think it's two things.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.650
The first is for the
training athlete,

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.590
so someone that would
identify themselves as saying,

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:22.290
you know, I love
to run marathons,

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:24.420
or I like to do triathlons.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:28.110
And for that type of person,
where they identify themselves

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.020
as an amateur athlete,
the biggest mistake

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.420
is, as I mentioned
at the top, thinking

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.180
that success in your
training program

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.210
is actually being able
to achieve a fixed number

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.110
of training hours per week.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.740
So your barometer at
success is the accumulation

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.150
of time or miles.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.970
That's the first thing
because that ends up leading.

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:48.880
That doesn't mesh.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.870
We always talk about life
not being a spreadsheet.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.980
And so life is dynamic.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.430
It's dirty.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:57.372
It's vibrant.

00:13:57.372 --> 00:13:59.580
And so when you've got this
living, breathing, thing,

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:03.390
and you're trying to apply a
fixed number of training hours

00:14:03.390 --> 00:14:06.080
every single week,
bad decisions start

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.200
to come into play, where
you're compromising components

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.600
like health, recovery, and
overall hormonal success.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.230
So the thirst for the
athletic-minded is that.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.290
For the fitness
enthusiast, so the person

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.770
that understands that exercise
is important and wants

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.870
to be healthy and wants
to thrive and have it

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:27.225
as a part of their
life, the challenge,

00:14:27.225 --> 00:14:29.340
or I think the
biggest mistake, is

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.100
to be too singularly
focused on one element

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.286
that we're talking about.

00:14:33.286 --> 00:14:35.160
So you might have someone
that says, I really

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.090
want to improve
body composition,

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:38.610
so I'm going to
eat really clean.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:40.110
And I'm going to
eat really healthy.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:41.080
And that's great.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.620
But if it's not supported
with some strength

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.617
and with some endurance, or
if your sleep is terrible,

00:14:47.617 --> 00:14:49.700
you're not going to improve
your body composition.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.700
Or you have someone--

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.740
so the classic, that
loves to exercise.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.802
But everything else is terrible.

00:14:54.802 --> 00:14:56.760
Well, you're not going
to yield any performance

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.364
gains when you go from that.

00:14:58.364 --> 00:14:59.280
DERK DE KORVER: Right.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.721
Do you have any, like, live
examples you could give?

00:15:02.721 --> 00:15:03.720
MATT DIXON: On the spot?

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.290
Thank you, Derk.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.200
Sure.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:13.020
I mean, I'll give you a great
example, someone that I started

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:16.990
working with a few months
ago, the classic person

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:20.040
that I tend to work with--
time-starved executive that

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:23.250
wants to integrate
exercise into his life.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:26.040
And he understands,
emotionally understands,

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.250
that performance
in the workplace

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.700
is going to be helped if he
can exercise consistently.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.360
So he made that commitment--

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.450
I'm going to work out
five days a week, period.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:39.570
But when we actually
looked at what

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:41.370
he was doing with
his habits, he was

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.710
making sure he was getting
up every morning, typically

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:47.610
at 5:00 AM, working out
for 60 to 75 minutes.

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:49.770
But then it was
straight to work.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:51.780
And the habits that
he'd created is

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.360
as soon as he
finished his session,

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.790
whether it was strength or
whether it was endurance,

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:00.090
he would shower, straight
to work, not have breakfast.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:01.934
As he said, I buy a
breakfast sandwich

00:16:01.934 --> 00:16:03.600
on the way to the
work, and it's sitting

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.970
on the desk at the
end of the day.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.400
And then he would go
through his workday.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:12.720
And so he was implementing
a single-focused positive

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.920
exercise.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.070
But by underfueling
following, he

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:19.770
was setting off
catastrophic events

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:22.020
that were going to
disrupt carrying

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.730
stress hormones into the day.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.100
So when you exercise
appropriately,

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.190
you have cortisol to help
you perform in the exercise.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:31.470
But if you don't fuel
following, you're

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:34.110
not going to suppress,
naturally suppress, cortisol.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:36.390
So you're carrying those
elevated cortisol levels

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:37.500
into your work day.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.570
So that disrupts energy balance.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.420
You're also going to set
off something-- what I like

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.590
to call athletic starvation.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.990
So what that is, is
your body's in deficit.

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.990
You don't replace the
deficit because you're not

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:50.460
fueling following.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.990
And so therefore,
later in the day,

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:56.370
you have really big challenges
around portion control

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.640
and the types of food that
you're getting cravings for.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.040
So my executive--
I'll call him Johnny

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.369
because his name
is Johnny, but who

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:07.339
shall remain nameless, I think.

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:10.980
But as he got to the later day,
of course, he got to lunch.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.490
And what did he crave?

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.660
Pasta, pizza, cookies,
ice cream because his body

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.359
was calling out for its
protective mechanism.

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:21.144
And then he can't
control his cravings.

00:17:21.144 --> 00:17:21.810
He's in a slump.

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:22.380
He eats them.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.630
What happens in the afternoon?

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:24.990
He's really sleepy.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.270
So there's this massive
stress symptom going on.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.930
There's an inability
to eat properly.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:33.215
There's energy
fluctuations in the day.

00:17:33.215 --> 00:17:33.840
And guess what?

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.670
He was retaining
body fat because when

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.340
he eats that pasta in the
middle of the day, that's

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.940
being stored as fat.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:43.660
So it's one singular example
of not joining the dots.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:47.790
He did something positive, but
without a very basic habit,

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:49.656
everything was falling apart.

00:17:49.656 --> 00:17:50.530
DERK DE KORVER: Yeah.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:53.702
No, I can definitely
relate to that example.

00:17:53.702 --> 00:17:54.660
I'm not Johnny, though.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:01.440
So OK, I think we all understand
that and probably have

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.590
experienced it, as well.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:06.990
So what are the biggest
challenges to manage that,

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:08.430
in your opinion?

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.450
MATT DIXON: I think that for
busy people like you guys,

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:16.630
it's an understanding
of what to focus on.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:18.510
And so how do I
take first steps?

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:22.230
And what I mean by that is
in the world we live in now,

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:24.180
we're not short of information.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:28.352
We have so much information
coming at us from all angles,

00:18:28.352 --> 00:18:30.060
even if you think
about the four subjects

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.850
that we talked about--
endurance, strength, nutrition,

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:33.970
and recovery.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.110
How much information is
there about all of these?

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:39.720
And yet all of those
individual subjects--

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.970
and we make it up
to one recipe--

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:46.560
is really prone to
life-hacking and quick fixes

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:50.820
and quackery and stuff that
is really, really confusing.

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:55.380
So most people don't lack
motivation if they sort of

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.510
have a performance mindset.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:02.670
But the challenge is that they
don't know what to focus on.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.490
That's the first real challenge
that most people face.

00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:08.670
So how do we overcome the
challenge of where to focus?

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:11.970
And the interesting thing is the
actual result is really basic.

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:15.090
So conceptually, it's
relatively appealing.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.100
But the actual habits
that you want to integrate

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.810
are actually really basic.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:20.970
But then you have to
acknowledge, as well,

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:26.700
that the second challenge
is, great, I have a plan.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.710
I understand.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:29.640
And now life happens.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.850
And the management
of decision-making

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:34.680
of when to push through
when you're tired,

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.310
when to scale back, when to
backdrop, how do we do it when

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.970
life gets in the way and we
have to manage with travel

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.259
or components of that?

00:19:42.259 --> 00:19:44.050
That's where it becomes
really challenging.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.800
So I'd say the two
main challenges

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.320
that we face are
what to focus on--

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.080
so filtering
information-- and then

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.480
how to actually manage
it in real life.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.720
And I find as a
coach, education is

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.210
important to
empower the athlete.

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:03.930
But a part of my role, a
critical part of my role,

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.810
from pros all the way down
to people that would never

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:09.430
compete in any sort
of structured event,

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.760
is becoming a filter
of that information.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.070
Because there's so
much crap out there.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.970
Let's face it.

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:18.280
And so if you can
create a filter,

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.910
then it becomes
actually quite simple.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:22.870
That that's the good
news out of all of this,

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:27.280
is that you can actually get
to pretty simple solutions that

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.347
are long-term, I
would say, overall.

00:20:29.347 --> 00:20:30.430
DERK DE KORVER: All right.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:35.110
So basically what you're saying
there is in these scenarios,

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.610
when battling with
these challenges,

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:40.630
you're pushing athletes-- or
even if we're not athletes--

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:42.145
to adopt an athletic mindset.

00:20:42.145 --> 00:20:42.460
MATT DIXON: Yeah.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.626
DERK DE KORVER: I've heard
you say that quite often.

00:20:44.626 --> 00:20:46.480
MATT DIXON: Yeah.

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.682
DERK DE KORVER:
So how would you--

00:20:49.682 --> 00:20:51.390
MATT DIXON: What is
the athletic mindset?

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:52.264
DERK DE KORVER: Yeah.

00:20:52.264 --> 00:20:55.240
MATT DIXON: Yeah,
I think that we

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.670
talk a lot about the
athletic mindset.

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:02.950
And what it is not about
is trying to turn everyone

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.480
into an athlete.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.970
That's not we're
actually trying to do.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:12.550
An athletic mindset is actually
drawing off of the lessons

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:14.680
that we have from our
living laboratory, which

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:17.710
are professional athletes, where
we can look at how training

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.920
methodology affects them,
how great supporting habits

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.260
actually helps them
thrive, and then

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.380
applying it to everyday
people, everyday people

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.180
that high performance.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.850
But adopting an
athletic mindset doesn't

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:33.220
mean that you're trying
to become an athlete.

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.420
Because most of you guys in
here, if not all of you guys,

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.460
are not elite athletes and
probably don't have aspirations

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.320
to be an elite athlete.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.962
But you are an elite performer.

00:21:43.962 --> 00:21:45.670
At least you should
be an elite performer

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:50.470
because I believe that
your quest, hopefully,

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:55.120
is that you want to integrate
a healthy lifestyle so that you

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.820
can feel good and be the best
version of yourself for as many

00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.930
years as we have on this place.

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:03.430
But in addition to that, you
are an elite performer in here,

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:04.450
in Google.

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:06.370
And you have a
responsibility to be

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:08.990
able to perform at your
best in the workplace,

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:12.040
and then leave this workplace,
and perform the best that you

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.870
can for your family,
friends, and everything else.

00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:19.420
And so we are not trying to
turn people into athletes.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.950
What we're trying
to have them do

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:24.160
is adopt an athletic mindset
so that they can thrive

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.650
across their institutions.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:31.070
And those major institutions
is yes, improving sport,

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:32.260
whatever your endeavor is.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.420
And it might just be
going to the bike club

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:39.520
and doing exercise, but also
in your health, in your ability

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.730
to perform in the workplace,
and, of course, outside of life

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.410
with family and friends.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.810
And we know-- it comes back.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:51.790
We know that it has to
be a holistic lens where

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:53.770
we draw on the
lessons of the pros

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:55.810
to actually facilitate success.

00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.870
And that's really the basic
tenet of everything that we do,

00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.880
in many ways.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.560
DERK DE KORVER: And
building on that,

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:06.490
what are some of the results
that you aim for people

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:07.900
adopting an athletic mindset?

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.180
MATT DIXON: I'm going
to come to a word that's

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.388
going to sound quite bizarre.

00:23:14.388 --> 00:23:15.890
I'm going to talk about control.

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:19.510
And before I talk
about control, I

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:21.510
think it's important to
understand-- earlier,

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:23.830
I mentioned life hacks.

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.420
There is no sugarcoating this.

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:29.560
When we sort of talk about,
without being obsessive,

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:33.640
if you do want to thrive, there
is no shortcut to success.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.670
There is an ongoing journey
that you have to embrace.

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:41.050
And so that's why I never
talk about quick results.

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:43.780
I don't talk about going on
diets and all those things

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.360
because all of that
reeks of short term.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.660
So it's mostly based
in habit driven.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:54.430
And when we see people
integrate positive habits,

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:55.750
a few things occur.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.960
And those habits, again,
are around endurance,

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.760
strength, recovery,
and nutrition.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:05.410
But when they integrate over the
long term, they always improve.

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:09.210
But what ends up happening about
just what is improvement is,

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:11.260
I think, that you
start to establish

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.430
an element of control.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.170
And what I mean by control
is you start to establish,

00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:18.450
yes, you've got
performance improvements

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:20.470
in your sport, whatever
your sport might be.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.630
So you get fitter,
stronger, faster.

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:25.060
And that's almost
a great byproduct.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:29.110
But the really positive things
is control over your energy

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.620
management in the day.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.130
So if you can start to
have predictable energy

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.320
throughout the course
of the workday,

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.640
that's a great element.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.770
You start to have control
over your body composition,

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:43.460
so actually coming to a better
place of homeostasis or health

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.070
around body composition.

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:47.990
And then some of the I
would say almost secondary,

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:50.710
but in a work-performance
environment that's

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:55.060
really critical, is this word
resilience or robustness.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.300
People become more
physically robust

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.640
or resilient to stresses.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.760
And so when they do go
through a lack of sleep

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.456
with time zone
travel, or they have

00:25:06.456 --> 00:25:07.830
to be up late for
a presentation,

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.710
and they're getting compromised
sleep, whatever it might be,

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:13.710
there is a physical resilience
that still enables them

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:15.520
to perform in the short term.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.900
And then added to that
is emotional resilience.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.690
So people become better
equipped at being

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:24.270
able to manage stressful
situations because

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.500
of these habits.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:28.830
And there is a direct link,
proven by much research,

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:32.670
to show that this state of
well-being equips you for that.

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:34.690
So it's pretty easy
to think about, OK,

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:37.620
if I've got management
over my energy,

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.470
and I'm more robust
and able to deal

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:42.480
with adversity and
different physical

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:45.750
and emotional stresses,
that's going to equip you

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:47.740
to ultimately-- yeah,
I'm getting faster

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.730
or whatever my endeavor
is in a sporting sense.

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:53.010
But I'm just a better
performer in life.

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:56.100
And the final
effect is happiness.

00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:00.120
And when someone actually
really adopts this mindset,

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.360
whether it's guided by
myself, Purple Patch, or not,

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.900
I've yet to see someone
that hasn't actually

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.090
reported improved happiness.

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:14.050
Because we are all happier if we
are under control of our life.

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.680
And that's really the ultimate
sense that we're looking for

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.640
and the outcome that
we're looking for.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:24.600
So as a triathlon coach,
the leap that people make

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.050
is that when I'm helping the
majority of our Purple Patch

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:31.260
athletes, which are
time-starved amateurs,

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.060
it's just about how
fast you can go,

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:34.740
or can you qualify to Hawaii?

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.700
And those goals are great.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.480
But the real results
that you're looking for

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:43.710
is to set people
free and empowered

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:47.250
to actually have management over
the other institutions in life.

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:49.620
If you can do that,
the recipe is right,

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.680
and the sporting side's easy.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.350
So don't be overly impressed
that you got fourth in Hawaii

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.170
last year, Derk.

00:26:56.170 --> 00:26:57.240
That was the easy part.

00:26:59.232 --> 00:27:00.690
DERK DE KORVER:
Thank you for that.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.830
No, I definitely hear you
on all those points there.

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:10.830
I also really notice
how the reward

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.680
of working for
something really hard,

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.200
how that carries over
into life and work.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.090
And I've learned the
hard way, as well,

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:21.270
and maybe the most costly
way, that there's no shortcuts

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:23.010
to speed in triathlon.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:27.360
It's just really expensive
if you want to get faster.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.847
Got to buy all the [INAUDIBLE]
components and whatnot.

00:27:30.847 --> 00:27:32.430
But let's get a
little practical here.

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.530
I know that we don't
have time to outline

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:38.410
a full plan for everybody here.

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:40.800
But what are some of
the key need-to-knows

00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.599
when creating a
plan for yourself

00:27:43.599 --> 00:27:44.640
and approaching training?

00:27:46.769 --> 00:27:48.810
MATT DIXON: Luckily, there
is a plan in the book.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:51.493
So you guys can enjoy that.

00:27:51.493 --> 00:27:54.954
So it's a tough question, Derk.

00:27:54.954 --> 00:27:56.370
I knew you'd ask
me this question.

00:27:56.370 --> 00:28:01.560
And in many ways, it depends
on what our goals are.

00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.860
So do we have Derk, who's trying
to go to the Hawaii Ironman

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.980
again and qualify and get
on the podium, et cetera,

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.870
or someone just trying
to integrate exercise

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:10.570
into their life?

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:14.160
But there are some common
themes that I can touch on.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.660
The first, the most
important thing,

00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:18.450
is whatever your recipe
is, your training

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:23.130
plan is, it has to have this
magic word, sustainability.

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.020
It has to be sustainable.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:28.260
And another way of saying that
from an exercise standpoint

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:29.490
is habitual.

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:31.950
It has to become
something that you do.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:34.470
So if your endurance
activity or your training

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:37.270
is like a monkey on the
back, it's not sustainable.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:40.920
And you will fall into that
trap of being fit and fatigued.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.590
When we think about performance
in an athletic sense,

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:46.980
the first word that we come
up with is consistency.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.850
And so that's the
first element we do.

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:54.810
So as I talked about
earlier, what most people do,

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.730
athletes that are
building their own plans

00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:00.880
or receiving plans from coaches,
unfortunately, is to say,

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.680
great.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.530
I want to exercise, or I
want to go and do a marathon,

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.710
or I want to go and
do a half Ironman.

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:09.870
How many hours a week
do I have to train?

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:13.500
And the coach loyally writes
them a training program.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.000
And they say, this is it.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.760
It's 15 hours a week of
training to get ready

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.170
for a half Ironman.

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:21.690
And then what they do
is they say, great.

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:23.487
How am I going to fit
this into my life?

00:29:23.487 --> 00:29:25.320
And they look at their
life, and they think,

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:26.528
I don't have that many hours.

00:29:26.528 --> 00:29:29.880
But they do their darndest to
cram it in by hook or crook.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:30.890
So what happens there?

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:32.090
They compromise sleep.

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.530
They comprise basic habits.

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.020
And the sport becomes
a monkey on their back.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.610
Their partner starts
to detest the sport,

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:41.250
and there's lots of tension.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:45.276
And they become rightly labeled
as the obsessive triathlete.

00:29:45.276 --> 00:29:47.400
Well, that's the antithesis
of what you want to do.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.941
So instead, I think
you want to start

00:29:48.941 --> 00:29:51.360
at the other side
of the equation.

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:54.575
And we have athletes
always go through this--

00:29:54.575 --> 00:29:56.200
and I should have a
better name for it.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.830
But it's always sometimes
rarely projects,

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.890
where we're looking to actually
get a true understanding

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:03.850
of the landscape of your life.

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:06.740
How many hours a week
do you genuinely have?

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:08.840
So when can you always exercise?

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.000
When can you sometimes exercise?

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.170
And when can you rarely?

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:13.850
If life ebbs a
little bit, you might

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:17.030
have places to add in there.

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:19.040
That's the first thing
that you go through.

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.811
And then you start to get an
understanding of how many hours

00:30:21.811 --> 00:30:22.310
you have.

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:25.340
But we have to also plug
in time for yourself,

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:28.400
time for your family, if you've
got a husband, wife, kids,

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.760
et cetera, time for
sleep, because that's

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.020
a non-negotiable.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.460
So you have to
plug in your sleep.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.430
And some social life, because
we would like you to be social.

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:40.070
Now you have X number
of hours a week.

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:44.660
And it's typically less hours,
but they're realistic hours,

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:47.270
than you may have
thought that you had.

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:51.560
But then the game becomes,
how do I maximize those hours?

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:54.950
And just by starting with
that very basic approach,

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:58.400
you can then calendar those
hours into your work schedule,

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.580
no different than a meeting,
and you're set up for success.

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.200
Part two to it,
then, is you have

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.810
to deploy a dynamic mindset.

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:08.060
What I mean by a
dynamic mindset is

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:11.690
if that is your best-laid plans,
as I mentioned before, life

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:12.920
doesn't act like that.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.432
It's not a spreadsheet.

00:31:14.432 --> 00:31:15.890
So the next thing
you have to do is

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:19.250
you have to create a
tier of specificity.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.170
And we always have,
no matter whether it's

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:24.980
fitness enthusiasts or Derk,
the amateur triathlete, or one

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:28.520
of my pros, we have key
sessions, which are typically

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.040
the more intense,
the more challenging,

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.010
and the ones that are
delivering the specificity.

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:35.690
And then we have
supporting sessions.

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:38.870
And those are the ones that
are nice to add in, great

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:42.500
if you have time, but are the
first to be scaled or removed

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.430
if life gets in the way.

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.270
And what that creates,
then, is a starting

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:49.310
of a management system.

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:51.260
Because if you're
traveling to New York

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.300
if you're based
in San Francisco,

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.120
and you can move
sessions around and hang

00:31:56.120 --> 00:32:00.260
onto your key sessions, but
you might lose or reduce

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:02.420
some of the supporting
sessions without guilt

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.800
because it's appropriate.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.260
On the flip side,
family goes away.

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:07.790
I have Friday off work.

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:10.040
You can now add on
some extra sessions

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.680
because life has ebbed, and
you've got more capacity.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.990
And now you've got
this very basic sort

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:21.110
of synchronized mindset of
training with a prioritization.

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:24.830
And that becomes incredibly
powerful for athletes

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:27.320
and fitness enthusiasts
to ultimately create

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:29.852
what I would call a recipe
for success, in many ways.

00:32:29.852 --> 00:32:31.310
DERK DE KORVER:
For a moment there,

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:33.018
I thought you were
telling my life story.

00:32:33.018 --> 00:32:35.000
I've definitely gone
through that phase where

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.220
triathlon took over my life.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.130
And friends and
family definitely

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.850
let me know that
that was happening.

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:46.080
And yeah, you do need to
sort of try and fit it in.

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.330
So I'm happy to say I have
a good balance now, I think.

00:32:49.330 --> 00:32:51.080
And so to get the most
bang for your buck,

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.690
are you saying
interval trainings?

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:53.690
Ram them?

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:55.370
MATT DIXON: Yeah, certainly key.

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:58.280
Look, if you're
time-starved, don't worry

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.410
about accumulation of hours.

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:01.760
Hit high intensity.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.640
But we can't, from a
musculoskeletal standpoint

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.950
and a hormonal level, we can't
do high intensity every day.

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:10.070
And so I think you have
a couple of times a week

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:11.720
that you're going to go--
even if you're just a fitness

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.740
enthusiast-- very
high-intensity training.

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:14.670
It's good for you.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:16.640
You also want to have
strength training.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.580
And strength training doesn't
need to dominate your life.

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.670
But 20 to 30 minutes, if
you're more endurance-focused,

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.280
is incredibly powerful
and a great what I

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:27.770
would call critical supplement.

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:29.146
If you're more
strength-inclined,

00:33:29.146 --> 00:33:31.061
then it could become a
bit more institutional.

00:33:31.061 --> 00:33:32.000
But strength training.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.280
And then supporting
sessions are lower stress.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.250
But they still have
variance in them.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:40.400
Another magic word of
performance is variance.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.500
So we always want to have--

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.010
whenever you're doing a thing
that's just steady state--

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:48.180
so in England, we
call it milquetoast--

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:52.581
just always looking at some kind
of variance would be the key.

00:33:52.581 --> 00:33:54.830
DERK DE KORVER: Thanks for
those insights on training.

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:57.830
But you also have other
pillars that you highlight--

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:00.020
hydration, fueling, rest.

00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.500
Anything that you could
share regarding that?

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:03.980
MATT DIXON: Yeah.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:09.409
If we now allow recipe
of strength and endurance

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:12.469
as an athlete, my mindset--
or a fitness enthusiast--

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:16.909
you are less than 50% of the
way there to your solution.

00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:19.820
And so you have two
other big pillars

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:23.929
you have to think about without
becoming a monk or obsessive

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:26.360
and without falling
for fad diets.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.429
So under the pillar
of nutrition,

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:30.690
you can break it down
into three key elements.

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:32.300
The first is your fueling.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.090
The second is your nutrition,
your daily eating habits.

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:36.739
And the third is your hydration.

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:38.870
So I'll do a
quick-and-dirty on them.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:43.179
Fueling-- exercising
60 minutes or less,

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:44.670
you don't need to
take in calories.

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:46.139
No matter what
Gatorade will tell you,

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:47.350
you don't need to
take in calories.

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:47.900
OK?

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:49.040
Under 60 minutes or less.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.010
What you do have to
do is if exercise

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:55.969
is really long or really
intense and a little bit longer,

00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:58.430
than sugar is your
friend on that component

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:00.250
because it helps
performance during.

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:03.050
But the nonnegotiable,
whether you're taking calories

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:05.420
during the workout or
not, the nonnegotiable,

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:08.080
every single time
you exercise, you

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:11.170
have to consume calories
following a workout.

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:13.970
And as much as possible,
it should be real food.

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:16.535
So you want to have
protein because that's

00:35:16.535 --> 00:35:18.910
going to bring down cortisol
and it's going to kick-start

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:20.620
your recovery process.

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.810
You want to have
some carbohydrate

00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:25.280
because that's going to
restore your energy packets.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.207
And especially if you
exercise in the morning,

00:35:27.207 --> 00:35:29.290
that's going to actually
facilitate your recovery,

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:30.310
as well.

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:32.320
And you want to do it as
quickly as we possibly

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.390
can after the workout.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:36.160
Because if we do
that, it's going

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.930
to avoid that
athletic starvation

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:39.230
that we talked about.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:41.440
It's going to set
up better eating

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.660
habits in the rest of your day.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:46.540
And it's going to elicit
your best chance to yield

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:51.190
adaptations and consistency over
your training or your exercise,

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:53.430
as well as your recovery
from that exercise.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:57.010
So it becomes, I would say, the
number-one performance habit,

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:58.810
even for just
fitness enthusiasts--

00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:01.240
consuming calories
immediately following.

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:05.380
If you do that well, and
only if you do that well--

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:08.320
so if you don't do, it
you are failing, period.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.010
If you take one
thing from today,

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:12.070
consume calories
following exercise.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:15.850
If you do that well, and then
in the rest of your daily eating

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:19.910
habits, sugar is
not your friend.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:23.410
Sugar, we know, has a
precursor to diabetes,

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:26.710
one of the big causes
for increasing obesity

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.780
rates in Western countries.

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:31.930
And unfortunately, to
put it in another way,

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:33.820
if you eat sugar when
your metabolic rate is

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.403
low in the rest of
the day, it's going

00:36:35.403 --> 00:36:36.710
to go straight to your hips.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:37.300
OK?

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:40.880
So reduce or eliminate sugar.

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.820
You don't need, if
we're fueled well,

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:44.650
too many starchy carbohydrates.

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:47.350
And instead, we lean into
a platform of health.

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:48.460
So it's very simple--

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:52.930
nutrient-dense foods, lots of
proteins, lots of good fats,

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:56.230
and too many vegetables that are
very colorful that you've never

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:58.870
imagined that even existed
as vegetables, eat as many

00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:00.490
of as you can.

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:01.720
So that's the nutrition.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.450
And then finally, hydration.

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:05.530
That your energy juice.

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:09.310
That is your energy juice, high
hydration throughout the day.

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:11.320
Ignore hydration
during exercise.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.540
That's valuable and good.

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.700
But when you're
sitting here at Google,

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:20.350
daily hydration will have a huge
impact on your energy levels

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:22.355
and sustainable energy
levels in the day.

00:37:22.355 --> 00:37:23.980
And when you're
sitting here and you're

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:26.950
working, if you start to
feel sleepy or hungry,

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:29.200
it's either because you're
athletically starved,

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.840
or, more typically,
because you're dehydrated.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.880
And, of course, the kickback
that I get when I say this is,

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:39.040
yes, but I have to always go for
a pee, and it disrupts my work.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:42.640
OK, yeah, you need to shift
the lens on what that is.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.130
Because that's a
performance break.

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:47.320
Sitting is the
new smoking, yeah?

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.910
There is lots of
research to show

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:51.940
that we perform our best
work when we actually

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:55.510
work in 45 to 75
minutes of great focus.

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:57.370
So if you're peeing
every hour, that's

00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:59.290
a chance to move
your body, which

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:01.570
is better for your
longevity and your health.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:03.820
You're going to have
better decision-making

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:07.270
and focus because
you're not in a slump.

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.360
You move your body,
and you get to pee.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.360
So you get to be social.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.484
You get to actually talk
to people in the bathroom.

00:38:12.484 --> 00:38:13.940
What more can you dream off?

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:17.300
But I think shifting the lens
is really, really important.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.505
And then there was
one more pillar, yeah?

00:38:19.505 --> 00:38:20.380
DERK DE KORVER: Rest?

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:21.080
MATT DIXON: Recovery, yeah.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:21.520
DERK DE KORVER: OK.

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.380
MATT DIXON: Should
I talk about that?

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.682
DERK DE KORVER: Yes, please.

00:38:25.682 --> 00:38:27.640
MATT DIXON: Let me give
you the quick and dirty

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:35.590
because recovery is now a trendy
sort of subject for athletes.

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:37.420
And all of you guys
here have sort of

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.060
probably read about
or participated

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.300
in meditation and components
like that, which are

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.010
part of the recovery process.

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:48.790
So when I think about recovery,
if you are an athlete,

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:51.640
there are basically three
main buckets of recovery

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:53.380
that we have to consider.

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.180
That's sport-specific--
so if you're

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.780
an athlete, that's how you're
structuring blocks of rest

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:01.750
into your season, breaks
from the sport, how you're

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:03.730
integrating easier
days of training

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:06.280
into any block of work,
and maybe sometimes

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.800
actually having a
complete day off of rest.

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.470
So they're sport-specific,
which most athletes say,

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:12.880
that's my recovery.

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:15.910
But there are two other key
subjects we have to consider--

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:19.100
what we call lifestyle
and modalities.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:24.820
So your lifestyle is your sleep,
your number-one recovery tool.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:27.100
You are only going to hear
more and more about sleep

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:28.180
over the coming years.

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.172
It is incredibly powerful.

00:39:30.172 --> 00:39:31.880
And there are lots of
research-- in fact,

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:33.755
just this week, the
"Harvard Business Review"

00:39:33.755 --> 00:39:39.580
came out with a interesting
research-based article on very

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:42.130
high-end executives
prioritizing sleep

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:45.910
relative to mid-managerial
type executives.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:48.280
But sleep is a huge
component, both in terms

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.950
of not just your quantity,
but your quality of sleep.

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:55.450
So that is a powerful recovery
tool that cannot be compromised

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:58.450
for longevity of
high performance,

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:00.040
sporting or otherwise.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.020
Then there is
actually nutrition.

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:05.200
And a platform of daily
eating facilitates recovery

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.830
and, as we talked about
earlier, your fueling.

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:11.160
And then the final two
I think you can cojoin,

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:14.430
which is your naps
and meditation.

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:18.900
And if you haven't heard about
it yet, you should or you will.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:21.240
But there is no
doubt that while it

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.400
used to be viewed
as hippy-dippy,

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.280
meditation is an important
component of recovery

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.050
and global performance.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:29.970
And that doesn't mean
that you have to sit

00:40:29.970 --> 00:40:32.400
in Lotus Position and meditate.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.830
For many people, that's
just finding a quiet space

00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:39.420
for seven to 15 minutes a day,
often in the middle of the day,

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:40.940
and being quiet.

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:42.960
And you might fall
asleep, hence the nap.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.140
And you stimulate growth hormone
and other positive effects.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:49.800
And it has a huge impact on your
productivity in the afternoon,

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.450
and research shows it.

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:55.920
So you are allowed to be a sloth
in the middle of the day for 10

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.610
minutes.

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:59.610
And that might be listening to
Headspace or one of those apps.

00:40:59.610 --> 00:41:01.800
Or it might just be
getting into a quiet place,

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:05.130
or even going for a walk
without your screens

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:06.330
and grounding yourself.

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:07.599
And it's really powerful.

00:41:07.599 --> 00:41:09.390
So that's the second
component of recovery.

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:12.010
And then the final
is modalities.

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:15.480
So modalities is everything
that they sell you--

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:19.050
massage, compression
socks, cryotherapy

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:22.950
and other trendy things that,
heat treatments, foam roller,

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:23.520
everything.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.870
And that's another
part of recovery.

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:28.550
So those are the big sort
of families we think about.

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:29.425
DERK DE KORVER: Yeah.

00:41:29.425 --> 00:41:32.590
I think my favorite is
definitely the napping.

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:33.990
I try to get that in.

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:36.450
And luckily at Google, we have
some really nice nap pods.

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:39.390
So if you're not using those,
I recommend that you do.

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:43.301
But which would you say is the
most important among those?

00:41:43.301 --> 00:41:45.300
MATT DIXON: The ones that
we're pushed the most,

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:48.900
and all the marketing
drives us to,

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:51.660
is framed in the
mindset of shortcuts.

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:53.220
So wear compression socks.

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.584
Go to the local place
and get cryotherapy.

00:41:55.584 --> 00:41:57.000
Make sure you have
body work done.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.610
And all of that stuff
is good, the modalities.

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:03.690
But it is down there, absolutely
down there in importance.

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:06.375
If you don't get an appropriate
training program with enough

00:42:06.375 --> 00:42:08.670
of recovery integrated into it--

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:12.430
again, training, even if
you're a fitness enthusiast,

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:13.590
not exercise.

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:14.790
Exercise is random.

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:16.800
Training is targeted.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.650
So your training, even if
you're a fitness enthusiast,

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:23.250
appropriate program for
you, that's number one.

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:27.360
And supported with enough
sleep and, I would say,

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.480
proper fueling and nutrition.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.260
That is the most
important thing.

00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:34.120
If we can get that, we
call it nailing the basics.

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:36.330
And our mantra
for our pro squad,

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:39.120
you would imagine that it's
all about equipment and wind

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.860
tunnels and aerodynamics.

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:43.260
Our mantra is
nailing the basics.

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:44.730
Get those things right.

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:46.250
If you get those things right--

00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:49.320
so an appropriate
training program

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:53.280
applied consistently,
supported with proper nutrition

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.390
and enough sleep--

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:57.060
you are-- and this is
thoughtful when I say this--

00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:59.340
95% of the way there.

00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:01.826
Everything else is
fluff, incremental.

00:43:01.826 --> 00:43:03.450
So when you think
about it, it's always

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:06.220
based in those
very basic habits.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:09.210
And it's not about being a monk.

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:11.280
It's not about
falling for fad diets.

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:14.190
It's really about trying to
institute very basic habits.

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:16.710
And that's the nice thing,
is a shift in mindset

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:20.910
to say a bit of, I'm going
old-school in a positive way.

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:22.800
Because I'm just going
to build myself up

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:26.000
with very foundational
habits globally.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.210
DERK DE KORVER: Thanks, Matt.

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:29.520
I do realize that we're
sort of running out of time.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.416
And I want to keep plenty
of time for the Q&amp;A.

00:43:32.416 --> 00:43:33.540
You did just launch a book.

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.940
So maybe we can switch
gears there and just

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:38.040
talk about that
for a little bit.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.400
Would you say that
that's geared towards

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.735
the obsessed triathlete?

00:43:44.735 --> 00:43:46.110
MATT DIXON: Yeah,
trying to break

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:48.090
the obsession of triathletes.

00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:51.960
Yes, so it is a book
about triathlon.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.140
And it's specifically designed--

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:58.350
this is not for my
very elite amateur

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:01.080
with lots of time in the world
or my professional athletes

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.510
that are looking to achieve
world-class performance.

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:07.770
This is about high performance
in my sport, triathlon,

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:10.450
but extending it to really
what we talked about today.

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:11.970
So how can you draw from this?

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:13.305
So I actually think--

00:44:13.305 --> 00:44:16.860
in fact, I've had a couple
of very elite running coaches

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.140
and a cycling coach
ask for this book

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:22.680
and read it, not to understand
how we train for triathlons,

00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:26.580
but how to actually integrate
the supporting habits to help

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.270
them help their athletes.

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:31.680
And so I think it's really
designed specifically

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:35.940
for endurance-focused people
that are time starved,

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:39.900
that are looking for the very
utopian outcome of thriving.

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.480
And yes, in my sport--

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:44.670
and in our case in
this book, triathlon.

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:46.560
But also in those
other institutions

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.430
that we talked about, which
is work, life, and health.

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:53.220
And so I don't want
to say I'm going

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:55.082
to be writing another
book because I

00:44:55.082 --> 00:44:56.040
haven't been asked yet.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.680
But the next book would probably
be taking this and making

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:02.236
it more global and saying, hey,
it's about performance in life

00:45:02.236 --> 00:45:03.360
and whatever your sport is.

00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.310
But this one's certainly
for triathletes.

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:06.310
DERK DE KORVER: Yeah.

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:08.110
I've read it, and
I really love it.

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:10.360
I think you give some
great case studies

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.910
and inspirational
examples of people

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:16.180
that you've worked with
and seen them succeed.

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:19.270
And your writing style is
just like you-- very serious,

00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:19.960
but with a wink.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.850
So yeah, thank you.

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:25.900
Maybe one last question.

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:30.880
You've worked with a
wide variety of athletes.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:33.910
What would you say
you're most proud of?

00:45:38.122 --> 00:45:41.980
MATT DIXON: I think as a
coach that gets to coach elite

00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:44.920
athletes, it's very
hard to sort of look

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.260
beyond when one of our athletes
was second at the Hawaii

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:49.940
Ironman as a professional.

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:52.990
And that was a real breakout
moment for us back in 2009.

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:56.320
And then in 2016, when
Tim Reed in Australia,

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.760
one of our athletes, won
the world championships,

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:01.210
the half Ironman world
championships, that's

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:06.459
obviously great and a part of
what I live for, in many ways.

00:46:06.459 --> 00:46:07.750
You know, that's a great thing.

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:09.634
And having Laura win
this last weekend,

00:46:09.634 --> 00:46:11.050
and in such a
historic race, she's

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:14.060
the first British athlete,
male or female, to ever win

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:15.340
Ironman New Zealand.

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:16.630
That's great.

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:23.500
But in all honesty, a couple
of athletes spring to mind.

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.110
One athlete that came to
me who couldn't walk up

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:30.720
a flight of stairs and had
chronic fatigue so badly.

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:33.880
She'd actually lost her
daughter in a car crash

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:37.240
and went through a terrible
place, put on 100 pounds,

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:40.049
and three years later has
now finished a half Ironman.

00:46:40.049 --> 00:46:41.590
And her whole life
has turned around.

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:43.310
She's 100 pounds lighter.

00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:47.500
And that for me
is the application

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:50.320
of a methodology in
a very different way.

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:53.920
And then some of the
inspirational people

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.590
that I've got to work with, the
sort of captains of industry

00:46:56.590 --> 00:47:00.400
that are ultimately
thriving in the workplace,

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:03.160
but I would say certainly
not thriving in the rest

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:03.910
of their life.

00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:05.326
I mean, not very
healthy, and been

00:47:05.326 --> 00:47:09.420
able to turn it around and
enable them to not only improve

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:12.190
as an extremely
time-starved individual,

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:15.290
but also have it bring
and spawn into their life.

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:20.350
So for me, the pride
component comes

00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:24.810
with seeing people thrive
more than actually saying,

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:27.140
I coached a world
champion, which is nice.

00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:29.850
But it's not why
we live, you know?

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:31.230
So it's only triathlon.

00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:33.310
It's only that big.

00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:34.837
The world is this big.

00:47:34.837 --> 00:47:35.920
DERK DE KORVER: Wonderful.

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:36.419
Thanks.

00:47:36.419 --> 00:47:37.510
Thanks, Matt.

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:41.360
I'd like to open up to the
floor now for some Q&amp;A.

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:44.320
MATT DIXON: Oh, we
don't have a microphone.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.820
DERK DE KORVER: And
again, for those

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:47.800
joining through
live stream, I'll

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:53.124
be looking at the Dory for you
to submit some questions there.

00:47:53.124 --> 00:47:54.790
AUDIENCE: Well, I
just want to thank you

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:56.950
because you're a
tri-coach, obviously

00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:58.754
a very accomplished tri-coach.

00:47:58.754 --> 00:48:00.670
And we've talked about
triathlons for an hour,

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:04.280
and you haven't mentioned VO2
max or lactate testing, which

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.280
I feel like are usually
the first two things out

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.330
of tri-coaches mouths.

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:08.015
So I love--

00:48:08.015 --> 00:48:09.640
I haven't read the
book, but I want to.

00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.460
And I love your approach to it.

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:16.480
I'd just love to know the
legacy ways of training

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.780
for Ironman races, which include
lactate testing and V02 max

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.060
and periodization,
stuff like that--

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:25.150
does your method still
call for a lot of that?

00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:27.890
Is it putting that
in perspective?

00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:31.414
Or is it really more just about
personalized plans and finding

00:48:31.414 --> 00:48:33.830
what's right for folks like
us, the time-starved athletes.

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:34.538
MATT DIXON: Yeah.

00:48:34.538 --> 00:48:37.480
The-- I call it
paralysis of analysis

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:39.340
and the metrics obsessed.

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:42.790
And it's all about focusing
on the wrong thing.

00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:45.490
So I'll give you a
couple of examples.

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:48.610
Bear in mind that I'm an
exercise physiologist.

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:53.080
So I've probably done 1,000
blood lactate tests and too

00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:55.650
many V02 tests and
everything along those lines.

00:48:55.650 --> 00:49:01.000
But there is a lot of that
magic word, periodization,

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:01.970
that we hear.

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:04.210
So let's think about
applying periodization.

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:07.042
So in the winter months,
you want to build your base.

00:49:07.042 --> 00:49:08.500
You want to get
really fit, and you

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:10.377
want to become a
better butter burner.

00:49:10.377 --> 00:49:12.460
So you want to do a lot
of low-intensity training.

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:15.820
And yet nearly everyone in
the winter months, the days

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:18.640
are short, and it's freezing
cold, and you're stuck inside.

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.440
It doesn't fit life, firstly.

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.340
So it's upside down.

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:24.400
And on top of that, if
you are a triathlete,

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.740
you're going to accumulate
naturally all of your riding

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.240
and running miles,
the longer stuff,

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.400
outside when the weather's nice.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.320
And it's an endurance sport.

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:35.850
So the puzzle when
applied to everyday people

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:38.300
is completely upside-down.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:43.540
But with things like VO2 max and
those assessments and metrics,

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:45.520
data is a great thing.

00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.710
It's good to capture data.

00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:50.530
It's good to utilize it,
sometimes on the fly,

00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:52.460
and certainly as an
objective review.

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:54.520
But you cannot be
shackled by data.

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:58.630
Because what has happened
with the advent of monitoring

00:49:58.630 --> 00:50:01.530
is people lose the inner
animal and sense of self.

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:04.060
And so even when
we're prescribing,

00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:07.370
we prescribe intensity
by the intention,

00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:10.370
what it should feel like, what
the perceived effort should be.

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:13.190
And as a byproduct or
an alignment of that,

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:15.560
this is about your power
our pace of heart right.

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:17.570
So it's at the other end
of the equation again.

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:19.340
So none of it is bad.

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:20.920
It's an understanding
of physiology.

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:24.480
But I much prefer
[? boiling ?] complex to simple

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:28.090
rather than run it--

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:30.890
I can impress everyone
with long terms.

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:32.930
But that doesn't actually--
it doesn't resonate.

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:33.980
It's not real-world.

00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:37.040
And so let's bring it down to
really approachable and basic

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.110
habits to make
people successful.

00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:41.880
In fact, my race
plan for Tim Reed,

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:46.460
who won the world championship,
was go and have fun.

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:48.920
Because he was an athlete
that was so-- you would think

00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.240
it was so granular.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.300
But he gets very
nervous before races.

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:56.030
And it was a bit more
than go and have fun.

00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:59.120
But he was so prepared, and
he knew so much what to do

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:02.450
and how to feel, that I wanted
to release him to just make

00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:04.340
smart decisions on the day.

00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:07.070
And the world championships
was in Australia.

00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:08.690
And it was in his hometown.

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:10.760
So I just said, that
will never happen again,

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.890
to have a world championship
in your hometown.

00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:15.260
So don't let the
moment bypass you.

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:16.370
Go and have fun.

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:17.660
There's that phrase.

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:20.120
And what that did was
that gave him permission

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:23.510
to just relax and go and
race at the purest sense.

00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:26.390
I never talked to him about
what power to hold or pace.

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:29.000
His body was trained to do that.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.820
He did run pretty fast.

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:33.007
He didn't need me to
tell him to run faster.

00:51:33.007 --> 00:51:34.090
DERK DE KORVER: Wonderful.

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:36.380
I have one question
here on the Dory

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:40.190
from Johan in Mountain
View, who's actually

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:41.530
a really good triathlete.

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:42.410
I know him.

00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:44.030
What kind of impact
have you seen

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:47.540
from people integrating
nutrition, sleep, et cetera

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:49.950
correctly in their
training programs?

00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:52.460
Is it a decrease in
time from, let's say,

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:56.450
a 9 hour 10 Iron Man to 9 hours?

00:51:56.450 --> 00:51:58.495
Or have you seen
even bigger changes?

00:51:58.495 --> 00:51:59.120
MATT DIXON: No.

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.900
Well, I'll give you a
professional athlete that was--

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:04.850
I coached a woman that
when she came to me

00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:06.740
had already done
20 Ironman races.

00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:10.620
And her fastest time
was 11 and 1/2 hours.

00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:13.960
And by creating more
specificity in her training--

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:15.360
this is an extreme example--

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:19.250
but most importantly shifting
nutrition and making her sleep,

00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:21.440
she went to going under 9 hours.

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:23.892
So that's when you start to
get pretty fast, by the way.

00:52:23.892 --> 00:52:25.850
If you're a female athlete
going under 9 hours,

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:26.990
you're pretty good.

00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:29.690
And went on to win, I
think, eight or nine

00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:31.370
professional Ironman wins.

00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:32.840
It is seismic.

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:35.550
And it's everything.

00:52:35.550 --> 00:52:39.320
And so the results vary.

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.870
Because it's not just about
how fast you're going.

00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:44.210
It's the bigger
picture, as well.

00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:48.020
Injuries and interruptions to
training and sustainability

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:52.190
and enjoyment of the sport
and people exiting the sport

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:54.294
are also equally, I
think, really important.

00:52:54.294 --> 00:52:54.794
Yeah.

00:52:54.794 --> 00:52:56.450
DERK DE KORVER: Yeah.

00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:59.120
Just a live example
myself-- since adopting

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.700
this methodology, I
knocked off 30 minutes

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:02.920
from my Ironman time.

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:06.074
So really, nailing the basics,
I think, is really important.

00:53:06.074 --> 00:53:07.990
MATT DIXON: Without,
certainly, training more.

00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:08.650
DERK DE KORVER: No, no.

00:53:08.650 --> 00:53:10.640
MATT DIXON: That's with
training probably less hours.

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:11.210
DERK DE KORVER:
No, I've probably

00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:13.640
been asking for more hours
than you've been giving me.

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.075
MATT DIXON: Yeah.

00:53:15.075 --> 00:53:15.950
DERK DE KORVER: Cool.

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:18.090
Any more questions
from the room?

00:53:21.042 --> 00:53:21.940
Could we get the mic?

00:53:25.569 --> 00:53:28.110
MATT DIXON: I will give you one
tip before I finish, as well.

00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:28.380
OK.

00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:29.754
I'll give everyone
one tip that I

00:53:29.754 --> 00:53:32.275
think is important on energy
management that will help.

00:53:32.275 --> 00:53:33.462
But go ahead.

00:53:33.462 --> 00:53:35.670
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
longevity and sustainability.

00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:37.530
I moved up in age
bracket this year.

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:42.190
So have you noticed anything
in the people you coach, maybe,

00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:43.340
that shift the pillars?

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:44.730
Like, I understand the pillars.

00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:46.050
I love the pillars.

00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:48.540
But any shifting in
terms of sustainability

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:50.886
for people who are just
moving up in age bracket?

00:53:50.886 --> 00:53:53.010
MATT DIXON: Just because
you've burst into your 30s

00:53:53.010 --> 00:53:55.830
doesn't mean that things change.

00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:57.270
Yeah.

00:53:57.270 --> 00:54:01.080
As you do get older,
the way that you train

00:54:01.080 --> 00:54:02.100
shifts a little bit.

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:04.830
And so there has to be an
ever-increasing emphasis

00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:06.180
on recovery.

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:09.000
And one of the
things that starts

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.780
to drop or become suppressed
is strength and mobility.

00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:14.790
So we just make that--

00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:16.350
it's almost turning
up the emphasis

00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:18.420
on those two components
a little bit,

00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:21.390
and then just being a little
careful with how frequently

00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:23.040
you're hitting intensity.

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:27.564
But in the sport of
triathlon, specifically,

00:54:27.564 --> 00:54:29.730
when you're hitting-- in
fact, the fastest age group

00:54:29.730 --> 00:54:33.840
as an amateur is typically 40 to
45, which is bad news for you,

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:34.670
in some ways.

00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:36.350
It's only going to get faster.

00:54:36.350 --> 00:54:38.000
But-- yeah, that's your group.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.580
But yeah, we have athletes
consistently getting

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:43.860
faster and faster and
faster into their 50s.

00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:47.180
It's not till about
53, 54 that you start--

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:49.620
and it's so obviously not
just chronological age.

00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:52.140
It's biological
expression of it.

00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:56.590
But that's where things just
start to drop off a little bit.

00:54:56.590 --> 00:54:59.490
But it also depends on how
long you've been in the sport.

00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:01.590
So if you've been doing
the sport for 15 years,

00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:03.510
you have to make
a radical shift.

00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:06.570
If you're two years in, you can
probably just treat yourself

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:08.640
like a 30-year-old
in many ways, apart

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:10.980
from not compromising sleep.

00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:13.185
That's a really key component.

00:55:13.185 --> 00:55:14.060
DERK DE KORVER: Cool.

00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:15.090
Thanks, Matt.

00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:16.468
We are at time, actually.

00:55:16.468 --> 00:55:17.176
MATT DIXON: Yeah.

00:55:17.176 --> 00:55:19.580
DERK DE KORVER: I know you had
one last little tip, if you

00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:20.720
want to throw that out there.

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:23.011
MATT DIXON: I'll give you
that one very quick and dirty

00:55:23.011 --> 00:55:26.300
because it's something that
I often have with people that

00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:28.220
are time-starved
and working, which

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:29.960
is the afternoon energy slumps.

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:32.960
So this has nothing
to do with triathlon.

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:36.290
But for you guys still in
the room or watching live,

00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:39.650
this is something that I think
is worthy of understanding.

00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:43.890
So who has afternoon energy
slumps sometimes at 3 o'clock?

00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:45.470
So the thing that
people reach for

00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:49.090
is either, many people,
Monster or Red Bull or Coke

00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:50.600
or coffee, yeah?

00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:52.937
So that's not the
thing that's actually

00:55:52.937 --> 00:55:54.770
going to create the
result. What is actually

00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:58.020
happening there-- so as soon as
you understand the physiology,

00:55:58.020 --> 00:55:59.820
it's a breakthrough for you.

00:55:59.820 --> 00:56:01.367
You have your circadian rhythm.

00:56:01.367 --> 00:56:02.450
Everyone understands that.

00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:04.940
When you go to bed at night,
your body actually slows down,

00:56:04.940 --> 00:56:06.050
and it cools.

00:56:06.050 --> 00:56:07.880
And that's really restorative.

00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:10.160
Well, the Spanish had it
right with their siestas

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.680
because in the afternoon,
we have a natural circadian

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:16.190
rhythm where your body
starts to cool a little bit.

00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:18.260
And it starts to go into
a restorative phase.

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:20.240
So your core
temperature is dropping.

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.840
And the byproduct of
that is sleepiness.

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:24.330
So you start to get tired.

00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:28.550
So what you want is you don't
want to ingest caffeine there

00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:32.120
that might disrupt sleep and
hence start the vicious cycle.

00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:34.170
All you need is hot liquid.

00:56:34.170 --> 00:56:38.710
So if you just have hot water
with lemon or mint tea or even

00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:41.990
chamomile tea that you identify
with relaxation, something

00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:45.680
that's hot, it's going to
raise your core temperature,

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:47.240
and it will improve
your alertness

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:50.540
for the next multiple hours
without interrupting sleep.

00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:53.540
So that's my last tip
because if you go and do

00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:56.394
that when you feel tired
tomorrow, go and have mint tea.

00:56:56.394 --> 00:56:57.560
And you'll be like, hang on.

00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:59.750
That actually works,
and I didn't have sugar

00:56:59.750 --> 00:57:01.015
that's a short-term spike.

00:57:01.015 --> 00:57:02.390
And I didn't have
caffeine that's

00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:03.900
going to interrupt sleep later.

00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:04.830
It's just hot liquid.

00:57:04.830 --> 00:57:07.940
So for you guys that have
to perform in the workplace,

00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:09.827
that's often maybe a
nice way to finish.

00:57:09.827 --> 00:57:10.910
DERK DE KORVER: Wonderful.

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:11.930
Thank you so much, Matt.

00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:13.096
MATT DIXON: Thank you, guys.

00:57:13.096 --> 00:57:15.280
[APPLAUSE]
