hello and welcome back now in our
previous lesson we unlocked two

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110
previous lesson we unlocked two
 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.900
previous lesson we unlocked two
achievements that are fairly easy to get

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910
achievements that are fairly easy to get
 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.910
achievements that are fairly easy to get
the first timer achievement you get for

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920
the first timer achievement you get for
 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.700
the first timer achievement you get for
playing the game and they Otton a UTI

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710
playing the game and they Otton a UTI
 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.830
playing the game and they Otton a UTI
prey achievement that you get for making

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840
prey achievement that you get for making
 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.070
prey achievement that you get for making
a not particularly good guess and while

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080
a not particularly good guess and while
 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.840
a not particularly good guess and while
it's easy to earn these achievements if

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850
it's easy to earn these achievements if
 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.599
it's easy to earn these achievements if
you actually want to test earning these

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609
you actually want to test earning these
 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.880
you actually want to test earning these
achievements multiple times it's kind of

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890
achievements multiple times it's kind of
 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.320
achievements multiple times it's kind of
difficult to do because you know you

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330
difficult to do because you know you
 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.659
difficult to do because you know you
can't earn them again you already have

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669
can't earn them again you already have
 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.150
can't earn them again you already have
them and that brings us to the topic of

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160
them and that brings us to the topic of
 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.940
them and that brings us to the topic of

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.600
from appearing in the public leaderboard
or in this particular case we give you

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610
or in this particular case we give you
 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.570
or in this particular case we give you
the ability to reset an achievement to

its original state
 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.920
its original state
now these management api's are very

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930
now these management api's are very
 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.840
now these management api's are very
powerful and you know you don't want

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850
powerful and you know you don't want
 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.760
powerful and you know you don't want
them falling into the wrong hands and so

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770
them falling into the wrong hands and so
 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.830
them falling into the wrong hands and so
the one restriction around them is that

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840
the one restriction around them is that
 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.840
the one restriction around them is that
they can only be called in your

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850
they can only be called in your
 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.420
they can only be called in your
application by people you have listed as

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430
application by people you have listed as
 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.850
application by people you have listed as
testers so remember if we go back here

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860
testers so remember if we go back here
 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.100
testers so remember if we go back here
to the developer console and we click on

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110
to the developer console and we click on
 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.649
to the developer console and we click on
this little testing link only the people

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659
this little testing link only the people
 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.960
this little testing link only the people
who are added here will be able to make

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970
who are added here will be able to make
 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.969
who are added here will be able to make
these calls which you know if you think

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979
these calls which you know if you think
 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.800
these calls which you know if you think
about it kind of makes sense you don't

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
about it kind of makes sense you don't
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.539
about it kind of makes sense you don't
want your average player to be able to

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
want your average player to be able to
 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.609
want your average player to be able to
you know reset their achievements they

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619
you know reset their achievements they
 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.800
you know reset their achievements they
would probably be very mad if you know

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810
would probably be very mad if you know
 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.330
would probably be very mad if you know
somehow they accidentally did that and

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340
somehow they accidentally did that and
 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.800
somehow they accidentally did that and
so in my case because I am testing with

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810
so in my case because I am testing with
 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.289
so in my case because I am testing with
my development account I will be able to

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299
my development account I will be able to
 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.170
my development account I will be able to
make these calls pretty easily now how

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180
make these calls pretty easily now how
 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.109
make these calls pretty easily now how
do we make these calls if you've been

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119
do we make these calls if you've been
 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.240
do we make these calls if you've been
investigating the library at all or you

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250
investigating the library at all or you
 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.859
investigating the library at all or you
know viewing the documentation or

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869
know viewing the documentation or
 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.899
know viewing the documentation or
playing around with the autocomplete you

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909
playing around with the autocomplete you
 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.880
playing around with the autocomplete you
might notice that we have a couple of

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
might notice that we have a couple of
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.059
might notice that we have a couple of
pretty nifty functions let me go into my

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069
pretty nifty functions let me go into my
 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.580
pretty nifty functions let me go into my
achievement manager here for instance

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
achievement manager here for instance
 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.340
achievement manager here for instance
once you have a GPG achievement you

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350
once you have a GPG achievement you
 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.310
once you have a GPG achievement you
actually call will call unlock me reset

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320
actually call will call unlock me reset
 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.030
actually call will call unlock me reset
achievement with completion Handler and

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040
achievement with completion Handler and
 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.490
achievement with completion Handler and
and this would make a call to our

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500
and this would make a call to our
 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.470
and this would make a call to our
management api's and say you know hi

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480
management api's and say you know hi
 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.570
management api's and say you know hi
please reset the this particular

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580
please reset the this particular
 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.610
please reset the this particular
achievement for this player and the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620
achievement for this player and the
 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.990
achievement for this player and the
results will you pass back in this

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000
results will you pass back in this
 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.300
results will you pass back in this
completion handler similarly we also

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310
completion handler similarly we also
 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.890
completion handler similarly we also
have we have a class method GPG

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900
have we have a class method GPG
 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.430
have we have a class method GPG
achievement reset all achievements with

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440
achievement reset all achievements with
 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.370
achievement reset all achievements with
completion Handler and this does the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380
completion Handler and this does the
 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.770
completion Handler and this does the
same thing except that it basically

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780
same thing except that it basically
 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.380
same thing except that it basically
resets all achievements for the player

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390
resets all achievements for the player
 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.040
resets all achievements for the player
and you know this seems like this is

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050
and you know this seems like this is
 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.230
and you know this seems like this is
pretty useful right you can kind of I

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240
pretty useful right you can kind of I
 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.120
pretty useful right you can kind of I

another view controller that has few
 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.630
another view controller that has few
buttons that you know would would link

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640
buttons that you know would would link
 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.610
buttons that you know would would link
to a reset all achievements method and

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620
to a reset all achievements method and
 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.050
to a reset all achievements method and
reset my scores

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060

you know leaderboards method and so on

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860
you know leaderboards method and so on
 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.040
you know leaderboards method and so on
and so forth there's just one tiny

and so forth there's just one tiny
 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.250
and so forth there's just one tiny
little problem which is that these calls

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260
little problem which is that these calls
 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.340
little problem which is that these calls
don't work right now the team knows

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350
don't work right now the team knows
 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.080
don't work right now the team knows
about it they have promised me that

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090
about it they have promised me that
 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.790
about it they have promised me that
there will be a fix in an upcoming

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800
there will be a fix in an upcoming
 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.910
there will be a fix in an upcoming
version of the library however that's

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920
version of the library however that's
 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.250
version of the library however that's
not available here for my screencast and

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260
not available here for my screencast and
 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.680
not available here for my screencast and
that makes me sad but only a little sad

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690
that makes me sad but only a little sad
 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.420
that makes me sad but only a little sad
because you know what we can still make

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430
because you know what we can still make
 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.370

these calls the old-fashioned way by

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380
these calls the old-fashioned way by
 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.410
these calls the old-fashioned way by
directly accessing the rest endpoints so

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420
directly accessing the rest endpoints so
 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.060
directly accessing the rest endpoints so
let's do that this will be kind of a fun

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070
let's do that this will be kind of a fun
 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.400
let's do that this will be kind of a fun
little you know refresher course on how

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410
little you know refresher course on how
 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.210
little you know refresher course on how
to make these rest calls so first thing

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220
to make these rest calls so first thing
 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.030
to make these rest calls so first thing
let's delete this keep our code nice and

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040
let's delete this keep our code nice and
 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.350
let's delete this keep our code nice and
tidy now the first thing we're gonna

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:37.310
hidden and again if we were to list our
 

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:39.430
hidden and again if we were to list our
achievements directly we can see that we

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440
achievements directly we can see that we
 

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.790
achievements directly we can see that we
now have our reveals not earned revealed

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800
now have our reveals not earned revealed
 

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:48.150
now have our reveals not earned revealed
incremental and unlocked and him and

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:48.160
 

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:53.500
let's look at our reset all and this one

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:53.510
let's look at our reset all and this one
 

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.000
let's look at our reset all and this one
looks even easier we're just making a

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.010
looks even easier we're just making a
 

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.930
looks even easier we're just making a
call to achievement / reset so I'm going

00:08:58.930 --> 00:08:58.940
call to achievement / reset so I'm going
 

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.510
call to achievement / reset so I'm going
to you know what can just copy and paste

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:01.520
to you know what can just copy and paste
 

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:07.690
to you know what can just copy and paste
this oops it's giving me a not found

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:07.700
this oops it's giving me a not found
 

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.810
this oops it's giving me a not found
error probably because I did not put in

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:10.820

00:09:19.069 --> 00:09:19.079
and again we can paste in this access
 

00:09:19.079 --> 00:09:21.889
and again we can paste in this access
token that we got from a console oh I

00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:21.899

guess we're still getting an error and

00:09:23.899 --> 00:09:23.909
guess we're still getting an error and
 

00:09:23.909 --> 00:09:26.779
guess we're still getting an error and
okay this is because Carl is by default

00:09:26.779 --> 00:09:26.789
okay this is because Carl is by default
 

00:09:26.789 --> 00:09:28.969
okay this is because Carl is by default
sending this as a get and if you'll

00:09:28.969 --> 00:09:28.979
sending this as a get and if you'll
 

00:09:28.979 --> 00:09:30.589
sending this as a get and if you'll
notice this call is actually a post

00:09:30.589 --> 00:09:30.599
notice this call is actually a post
 

00:09:30.599 --> 00:09:32.749
notice this call is actually a post
request so I think I can force this to

00:09:32.749 --> 00:09:32.759
request so I think I can force this to
 

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:34.909
request so I think I can force this to
be a post just by adding some like data

00:09:34.909 --> 00:09:34.919
be a post just by adding some like data
 

00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:39.289
be a post just by adding some like data
here yeah there we go and it sends back

00:09:39.289 --> 00:09:39.299
here yeah there we go and it sends back
 

00:09:39.299 --> 00:09:41.749
here yeah there we go and it sends back
by the way which achievements have now

00:09:41.749 --> 00:09:41.759
by the way which achievements have now
 

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:43.909
by the way which achievements have now
been reset so it looks like we had two

00:09:43.909 --> 00:09:43.919
been reset so it looks like we had two
 

00:09:43.919 --> 00:09:45.319
been reset so it looks like we had two
other achievements our incremental

00:09:45.319 --> 00:09:45.329
other achievements our incremental
 

00:09:45.329 --> 00:09:47.359
other achievements our incremental
achievement and our first-timer

00:09:47.359 --> 00:09:47.369
achievement and our first-timer
 

00:09:47.369 --> 00:09:51.759
achievement and our first-timer
achievement that have been reset now and

00:09:51.759 --> 00:09:51.769
achievement that have been reset now and
 

00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:54.589
achievement that have been reset now and
again if I were to do a quick look at

00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:54.599
again if I were to do a quick look at
 

00:09:54.599 --> 00:09:57.229
again if I were to do a quick look at
our achievements we can see they are all

00:09:57.229 --> 00:09:57.239
our achievements we can see they are all
 

00:09:57.239 --> 00:10:00.319
our achievements we can see they are all
now back in their initial state so let's

00:10:00.319 --> 00:10:00.329
now back in their initial state so let's
 

00:10:00.329 --> 00:10:02.449
now back in their initial state so let's
go back to our app by the way if I were

00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:02.459
go back to our app by the way if I were
 

00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:04.969
go back to our app by the way if I were
to click achievements right now my guess

00:10:04.969 --> 00:10:04.979
to click achievements right now my guess
 

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:07.609
to click achievements right now my guess
is yeah it's cached in this data it

00:10:07.609 --> 00:10:07.619
is yeah it's cached in this data it
 

00:10:07.619 --> 00:10:09.409
is yeah it's cached in this data it
doesn't know that anything's changed yet

00:10:09.409 --> 00:10:09.419
doesn't know that anything's changed yet
 

00:10:09.419 --> 00:10:11.299
doesn't know that anything's changed yet
so it'll still give us this not

00:10:11.299 --> 00:10:11.309
so it'll still give us this not
 

00:10:11.309 --> 00:10:13.849
so it'll still give us this not
unexpected so the best thing to do is

00:10:13.849 --> 00:10:13.859
unexpected so the best thing to do is
 

00:10:13.859 --> 00:10:16.669
unexpected so the best thing to do is
just you know we'll quit this run it

00:10:16.669 --> 00:10:16.679
just you know we'll quit this run it
 

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:22.849
just you know we'll quit this run it
again get the force to the library to

00:10:22.849 --> 00:10:22.859
again get the force to the library to
 

00:10:22.859 --> 00:10:25.249
again get the force to the library to
fetch new data and now we can look at

00:10:25.249 --> 00:10:25.259
fetch new data and now we can look at
 

00:10:25.259 --> 00:10:27.259
fetch new data and now we can look at
our achievements and I can once again

00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:27.269
our achievements and I can once again
 

00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:30.710
our achievements and I can once again
see that they're empty and alright you

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720
see that they're empty and alright you
 

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.909
see that they're empty and alright you
know now we can go about making sure

00:10:31.909 --> 00:10:31.919
know now we can go about making sure
 

00:10:31.919 --> 00:10:37.399
know now we can go about making sure
that we've earned them correctly so we

00:10:37.399 --> 00:10:37.409
that we've earned them correctly so we
 

00:10:37.409 --> 00:10:39.739
that we've earned them correctly so we
can now go ahead and I'm gonna guess 50

00:10:39.739 --> 00:10:39.749
can now go ahead and I'm gonna guess 50
 

00:10:39.749 --> 00:10:42.469
can now go ahead and I'm gonna guess 50
again and we still get the Ahtna okay I

00:10:42.469 --> 00:10:42.479
again and we still get the Ahtna okay I
 

00:10:42.479 --> 00:10:44.539
again and we still get the Ahtna okay I
pray achievement that is now freshly

00:10:44.539 --> 00:10:44.549
pray achievement that is now freshly
 

00:10:44.549 --> 00:10:46.909
pray achievement that is now freshly
unlocked and you know we could do this

00:10:46.909 --> 00:10:46.919
unlocked and you know we could do this
 

00:10:46.919 --> 00:10:50.269
unlocked and you know we could do this
again any time our tester needs to go

00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279
again any time our tester needs to go
 

00:10:50.279 --> 00:10:53.659
again any time our tester needs to go
through the QA plan and so digging up

00:10:53.659 --> 00:10:53.669
through the QA plan and so digging up
 

00:10:53.669 --> 00:10:55.399
through the QA plan and so digging up
your access token making this curl call

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:55.409
your access token making this curl call
 

00:10:55.409 --> 00:10:57.949
your access token making this curl call
not hugely convenient but still you know

00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959
not hugely convenient but still you know
 

00:10:57.959 --> 00:10:59.509
not hugely convenient but still you know
pretty easy to do particularly if you're

00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519
pretty easy to do particularly if you're
 

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:01.460
pretty easy to do particularly if you're
a developer and I'm guessing most of you

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:01.470
a developer and I'm guessing most of you
 

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.249
a developer and I'm guessing most of you
are there are a few other ways we could

00:11:04.249 --> 00:11:04.259
are there are a few other ways we could
 

00:11:04.259 --> 00:11:07.279
are there are a few other ways we could
do this the other will be to wait for

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:07.289
do this the other will be to wait for
 

00:11:07.289 --> 00:11:09.379
do this the other will be to wait for
this library to be fixed and build your

00:11:09.379 --> 00:11:09.389
this library to be fixed and build your
 

00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:12.709
this library to be fixed and build your
own in-game interface again once there's

00:11:12.709 --> 00:11:12.719
own in-game interface again once there's
 

00:11:12.719 --> 00:11:14.629
own in-game interface again once there's
an update to the library I will post a

00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:14.639
an update to the library I will post a
 

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:16.399
an update to the library I will post a
screencast that shows you exactly how to

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:16.409
screencast that shows you exactly how to
 

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:19.519
screencast that shows you exactly how to
do that it should also be noted that if

00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:19.529
do that it should also be noted that if
 

00:11:19.529 --> 00:11:22.059
do that it should also be noted that if
you were to look at our downloads page

00:11:22.059 --> 00:11:22.069
you were to look at our downloads page
 

00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:25.219
you were to look at our downloads page
there's a link to a utility called

00:11:25.219 --> 00:11:25.229
there's a link to a utility called
 

00:11:25.229 --> 00:11:28.009
there's a link to a utility called
management tools and this is an

00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:28.019
management tools and this is an
 

00:11:28.019 --> 00:11:30.379
management tools and this is an
application that can make all of these

00:11:30.379 --> 00:11:30.389
application that can make all of these
 

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.860
application that can make all of these
manage

API calls for you this is something that

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:33.660
API calls for you this is something that
 

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.720
API calls for you this is something that
you would set up and run say on

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:35.730
you would set up and run say on
 

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.460

00:11:40.579 --> 00:11:40.589
and basically it just automates grabbing
 

00:11:40.589 --> 00:11:43.880
and basically it just automates grabbing
your access token and making these rest

out this would be particularly useful

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:52.860
out this would be particularly useful
 

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.010
out this would be particularly useful
for development it also contains some

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:55.020
for development it also contains some
 

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.360
for development it also contains some

maybe if there's enough interest I'll
 

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.120
maybe if there's enough interest I'll
create a series of screencasts on this

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:02.130
create a series of screencasts on this
 

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.740
create a series of screencasts on this
as well but hey let's not get too

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:03.750
as well but hey let's not get too
 

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.630
as well but hey let's not get too
distracted we have other iOS stuff to

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:05.640
distracted we have other iOS stuff to
 

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.980
distracted we have other iOS stuff to
finish first we've gotten our

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:06.990
finish first we've gotten our
 

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.480
finish first we've gotten our
achievements and we've gotten them

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:08.490
achievements and we've gotten them
 

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.340
achievements and we've gotten them
working and we've shown you how to earn

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:10.350
working and we've shown you how to earn
 

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.380
working and we've shown you how to earn
them how to increment them how to reset

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:12.390
them how to increment them how to reset
 

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.269
them how to increment them how to reset
them so you can test them again but we

00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279
them so you can test them again but we
 

00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:15.140
them so you can test them again but we
haven't done anything with our

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:15.150
haven't done anything with our
 

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.120
haven't done anything with our
leaderboards now luckily most of the

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:17.130
leaderboards now luckily most of the
 

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.280
leaderboards now luckily most of the
process for leaderboards is fairly

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:19.290
process for leaderboards is fairly
 

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.960
process for leaderboards is fairly
similar to what we did with achievements

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:20.970
similar to what we did with achievements
 

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.700
similar to what we did with achievements
so this next section should be pretty

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:22.710
so this next section should be pretty
