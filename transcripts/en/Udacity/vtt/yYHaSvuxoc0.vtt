00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.380
We need to know current cost, so we'll read

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.040
that in. We're also keeping track of the total

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.230
sales. That will require a variable. We need to

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.455
store both the current store and the previous store

00:00:12.455 --> 00:00:15.230
we've seen, so that we can tell when we're

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.210
changing keys. In other words, when we go from

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.660
the Miami Line to the New York City Line.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.960
However, the cost of the previous line is not useful.
