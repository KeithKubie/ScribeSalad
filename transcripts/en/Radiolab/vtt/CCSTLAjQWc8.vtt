00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.290
I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.820
This is Radiolab and I have the host of note to self with me.

3
00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:10.200
That's another w n y c podcast that comes out of here. A brilliant one.

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.520
And the brilliant tests person who does it all. My news I'm Rodeos is with me.

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.040
Hello Robert. And uh,

6
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.740
I asked you to come in just because I wanted you to sort of set this up if you

7
00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:20.270
could.

8
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.130
<v 1>Oh, happy to.</v>

9
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.140
So we did radio lab and note to self did a joint episode last year called eye in

10
00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.870
the sky is a disturbing story,

11
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.070
but I'm like a spy thriller actually. Definitely a spy thriller.

12
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.940
And it turns out a lot has happened since that episode was first put out.

13
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.700
<v 0>Right? There have been developments which surprise truly surprised me. And uh,</v>

14
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.740
I don't want to give any details,

15
00:00:44.741 --> 00:00:47.710
so just listen to what's about to happen and then don't go away at the end.

16
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.260
Stay. Okay, we'll begin.

17
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.730
<v 1>So how did you guys find out about this? How'd you get into it?</v>

18
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.220
I think it was somebody was reading about it. Was it,

19
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:58.730
this is minutia Semarodi or we use you reading about it. Right?

20
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.380
And that's your producer Alex Goldmark and I just said his name is Mick nut and

21
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.150
I just wanted to do a show where I get to say that name at least 10 times

22
00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:08.984
please.

23
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.740
But then like we actually read it and it was weird and interesting and brought

24
00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:14.600
up lots of issues.

25
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.170
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

26
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.170
<v 3>technology is remaking what is possible for individuals and for institutions and</v>

27
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:22.830
for the international order

28
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.880
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

29
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.910
<v 0>I'm Jad Abumrad I'm a Krulwich Radiolab.</v>

30
00:01:27.911 --> 00:01:31.660
So here we are at this moment in time where we were faced with these decisions

31
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.040
<v 3>about what we want our future to look like,</v>

32
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.320
be like there are fewer and fewer technical constraints on what we can do.

33
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.870
That place is a special obligation on us to ask tough questions about what

34
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.690
<v 2>we should have</v>

35
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.391
<v 0>today.</v>

36
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:51.120
We're going to look at the can and the should with our friends down the hall.

37
00:01:51.121 --> 00:01:52.790
My new summer roadie and Alex Goldmark,

38
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.810
they run a great podcast called note to self.

39
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:59.340
They will be our guides into the world of McNutt. Yes.

40
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:03.000
My name is Ross McNutt. So the McKnight as I refer to him,

41
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.110
he's the next military guy, did 20 years in the air force. I enjoyed it.

42
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.860
I did a lot of good like combat military as an engineer in the middle. Yeah,

43
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.890
I mean I think he's actually special military. My background,

44
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:18.891
I've got a phd in rapid product development out of MIT and what I do is I teach

45
00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:20.700
young people how to build new systems

46
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.410
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

47
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.900
<v 1>and the new system. That's the system that we want to talk about.</v>

48
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.640
That kind of began in 2007

49
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.720
<v 0>Ross was teaching a course at a military college,</v>

50
00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.110
was that the Air Force Institute of Technology here at Wright Patterson and

51
00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:40.111
Dayton says one day in 2004 the whole school gathered together for a rally and

52
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.910
our commander got up in front of the whole school and said,

53
00:02:42.911 --> 00:02:45.790
we need to do something to help the war effort.

54
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.870
<v 4>Terrible violence today and the Iraqi city of Basra.</v>

55
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.130
So at that time in the Iraq war for the surge, things were not going well.

56
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.640
Suicide bombs rip through police buildings and city streets [inaudible] going

57
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.140
off

58
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.970
<v 5>all over the place.</v>

59
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.900
<v 6>She comes to news about IUD is going off everywhere. Soldiers being blown up.</v>

60
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.320
They, one week I got blown up three times

61
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.110
<v 5>and to be honest with you, in 2004, it looked like we were going to lose.</v>

62
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.160
<v 6>So Ross, he gets together some of his students, some of his colleagues,</v>

63
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.300
and they decide, you know, let's sit down and see if we can find a solution.

64
00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:25.920
Quickly find a solution to figuring out who is planting all these roadside

65
00:03:25.921 --> 00:03:26.480
bombs.

66
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.930
<v 5>Yeah, bombs going off. We're pretty easy to detect in images.</v>

67
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.090
The problem is how do you go from a bomb going off backwards in time to be able

68
00:03:35.091 --> 00:03:39.740
to figure out who planted it. So somehow, uh,

69
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.000
you know, it just came out and it wasn't like you guys sitting around.

70
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.523
It was at a bar.

71
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.820
We were working on the back of the Napkin and we're drawing out different ideas

72
00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:52.610
and throwing them around and seeing what happens. They were just like, hey,

73
00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:56.080
let's use planes. Let's try this. Let's try that. And then they hit on it.

74
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.110
This one stuck. And we sort of drew this out on the back of an envelope making.

75
00:04:00.111 --> 00:04:04.070
It took a little while. I had 38 students working for me for two years,

76
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.090
<v 6>but eventually they developed what became known as project angel fire.</v>

77
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.710
<v 5>Here's how it works. Let me take a small plane</v>

78
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.910
and on the belly of the plane, they hook up this array of cameras,

79
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.890
sort of swivel around the camera system. We design and build

80
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.600
<v 6>super high end and then you're ready to go. The pilot</v>

81
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.263
takes off,

82
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.770
flies the plane high over Fallujah

83
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:37.890
<v 5>in the military.</v>

84
00:04:37.891 --> 00:04:41.790
We were up at about 15 to 16,000 feet to stay out of the missile range.

85
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.530
<v 6>Let's say I'm an Iraqi on the ground in Fallujah and I look up,</v>

86
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.430
what would I see?

87
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.440
<v 5>You wouldn't see us, you wouldn't hear us or you wouldn't see.</v>

88
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.850
So you've got this plane flying just below the clouds doing an orbit over

89
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.020
Fallujah circle circle,

90
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.280
circle for six hours at a time and every second click,

91
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.180
click, click, click every second.

92
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.950
It takes a still image of the entire city of Felicia 25 square miles and then

93
00:05:09.951 --> 00:05:14.180
beams it down to an operator. We take a picture, process it down, Lincoln,

94
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.720
process it down Lincoln, every single second,

95
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.750
<v 6>plaintiff's snapping picture after picture after picture.</v>

96
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.460
But here's what makes the system so powerful. The operator on the ground has,

97
00:05:25.461 --> 00:05:30.020
let's say an entire day's worth of these high res pictures of the entire city of

98
00:05:30.021 --> 00:05:32.420
Fallujah. And then let's say there's an explosion.

99
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.420
I'll say at least 20 people were killed in explosions and wounds. 11 others.

100
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.510
First, the operator would pull up the most current image of the city,

101
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.460
zoom into the place within Volusia where it happened, and then click, click,

102
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.410
click in one second increments, go back in time and see who was there,

103
00:05:51.411 --> 00:05:55.920
what happened when was the last time somebody fiddled around in that spot? Yeah.

104
00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.060
And you're like, okay, might gone back two hours and ah,

105
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.980
it's that car. Fast forward, click, click, click.

106
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:07.970
They can now follow that car forward in time to see where it goes.

107
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.840
And you see that it went to a house in another neighborhood two miles away.

108
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.090
Well, that's where you dispatch your troops do, right. Then

109
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.910
<v 7>basically we'd be able to send either the special forces then or the marines in</v>

110
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.430
and sort of take appropriate action.

111
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.943
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

112
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:25.481
<v 8>Now look,</v>

113
00:06:25.481 --> 00:06:28.990
the military doesn't release statistics on how well some of it's military

114
00:06:28.991 --> 00:06:33.820
technology works, but there are officers who will be quoted saying that, yes,

115
00:06:33.821 --> 00:06:36.220
project angel fire saved lives.

116
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:41.560
But the reason why we decided to do this story is because it's not just a

117
00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:44.740
military thing, right? Like with a lot of these technologies,

118
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.510
they may be start in the military,

119
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.920
but then they trickle down all the way down to all of us.

120
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.200
And actually in this case trickled down

121
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.820
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

122
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.840
<v 7>to Dayton, Ohio Ross group incorporated. Do you think that's it?</v>

123
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.100
You a nice first name? Yeah, it'd be weird. Oh,

124
00:07:03.101 --> 00:07:06.550
you gotta go with the producer Andy Mills and I actually went to Dayton,

125
00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:09.760
Ohio to visit Ross at his business.

126
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.980
Persistent surveillance system.

127
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.130
Persistent surveillance systems, right? That feels, or William. Yep.

128
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.090
These are the lenses and the motors here basically control it.

129
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.010
And so first we went over to his workshop where he actually works and makes the

130
00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:31.030
cameras. These are more powerful than some of the best military systems.

131
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:34.060
Like we could see him actually making them and how they get attached to the

132
00:07:34.061 --> 00:07:38.210
bottoms of the airplane. Oh, so many

133
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:42.020
<v 6>airplanes. Then we went over to the hangar where he has all the airplanes.</v>

134
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.260
<v 7>Beautiful. Overall we've got 27 airplanes. We operate.</v>

135
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:50.100
<v 6>He owns his own airport. Yeah. Yeah. After you guys. Oh my God.</v>

136
00:07:50.101 --> 00:07:50.640
It's big.

137
00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.570
And then he showed us their command center and this is where you have a bunch of

138
00:07:54.571 --> 00:07:57.300
people sitting in front of these enormous screens.

139
00:07:57.301 --> 00:07:59.640
This is like your viewing room. Yeah,

140
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.940
and this is where all the plane pictures end up

141
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:09.260
<v 8>because Ross's basic idea in taking this technology from Fallujah to a city like</v>

142
00:08:09.421 --> 00:08:12.270
Dayton, Ohio is basically this

143
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.320
<v 5>u us cities has just as large a problem as we do in Afghanistan and Iraq only</v>

144
00:08:18.321 --> 00:08:20.210
it's not IED is it's crying.

145
00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.320
<v 7>We've had a lot of major events this year.</v>

146
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.290
We've had four officer involved shootings so far this year.

147
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.090
Our homicides are up this year. So this is Dayton police chief, Richard BLB, I.

148
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:30.410
E. H. L.

149
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.720
<v 8>I talked to him last summer a couple of years ago.</v>

150
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.670
Ross called him up and was like, look,

151
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.760
<v 5>a city like Dayton, Ohio, we've got 28,000 crimes a year,</v>

152
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.750
about 10,000 part one crimes, murder, rape, assault,

153
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:47.870
10,000 part one crimes comes out to be $480 million a year.

154
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.730
<v 8>But McKnight is like for the bout the price of a police helicopter,</v>

155
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.580
<v 5>we believe that we would be able to decrease crime by 30 to 40%. 30%</v>

156
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.850
<v 7>decrease in that is $155 million a year.</v>

157
00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.450
<v 9>The Dayton police were like, Alrighty, let's give it a shot.</v>

158
00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:09.540
We basically set up a test in June of 2012 for a five day flight.

159
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.020
Here we go. Let's see for ourselves what it was capable of doing

160
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.210
<v 7>isn't sent the plane up in the air,</v>

161
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.710
started doing its thing just like in Fallujah. And within just a few hours,

162
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.170
<v 9>oh, there was a call of this, uh, breaking,</v>

163
00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:30.690
entering and progress with a description of a van.

164
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:35.170
<v 10>Um, it was an older white box truck, just a regular random moving truck.</v>

165
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.380
<v 7>This is Angie Horn. She's the one who called nine one one.</v>

166
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:42.490
She was just home on her lunch break and she sees a moving van pull up in front

167
00:09:42.491 --> 00:09:45.040
of her neighbor's house. The guy gets out, breaks in,

168
00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.330
starts moving furniture out.

169
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.600
<v 10>No, we, you know, we immediately called the police.</v>

170
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.300
They got there relatively quickly from what I remember,

171
00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:54.220
that he had already taken off.

172
00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.590
<v 6>Yeah. Normally in a case like this, the police would be like, well,</v>

173
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:03.000
how do we follow them? We don't know where he went, but in this case,

174
00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.800
<v 8>the police contact persistent surveillance systems and ultimately they get</v>

175
00:10:07.801 --> 00:10:10.540
connected to this guy. My name is Alex [inaudible].

176
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.660
I'm the senior analyst for the company.

177
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:16.220
Alex pulls up the image of gene zooms in cliques backwards.

178
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.580
Did about five minutes until he sees this little grainy white dot appear in

179
00:10:20.581 --> 00:10:24.070
front of her neighbor's house. This is the vehicle here that we're wanting to,

180
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.000
<v 7>I'm sorry, what vehicle? I don't, I barely see anything. Right.</v>

181
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:30.900
So the image looks real blurry, but the human brain and the human eyes are very,

182
00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:32.520
very evolved to pick out movement.

183
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.720
You got to understand that from two miles up a car looks just like a random

184
00:10:36.721 --> 00:10:38.580
shape and people, they look like pixels.

185
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.150
Alex has trained himself to pick out movement.

186
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:43.290
I'm going to put a tag down on where he's at,

187
00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:46.560
places in orange circle over that random little shape and then click

188
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.130
[inaudible].

189
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:51.060
<v 8>He moves forward, forward, forward to follow him to his real time location.</v>

190
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.780
Alex follows it up. Some roads finds out that it is parked in a parking lot.

191
00:10:54.781 --> 00:10:57.510
Six blocks away. He calls up, the people in the field goes,

192
00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:01.270
<v 6>go over there. They get there. They see the guy, they see a truck full of stuff.</v>

193
00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:05.380
They send one different cop over to pick up. The witness. Witness goes. Yep,

194
00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.800
that's the guy. Oh, so this lady who called, yeah, this is minutes later.

195
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:10.990
No kidding.

196
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.400
That could have been a murderer. Right? That could've been an armed robber.

197
00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:18.570
It could have been a lot of things.

198
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.450
<v 7>This is so weird because like having a superpower,</v>

199
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.490
it is actually better than Batman.

200
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.580
You can't go back forth in time if you're a superhero.

201
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.160
I just feel sad.

202
00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:34.530
<v 1>All right. It's like we're all just these little dots.</v>

203
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.840
It just seems like the antithesis of what a lot of police departments seem to be

204
00:11:39.841 --> 00:11:44.730
trying to do in the aftermath of Ferguson and Staten Island and other, um,

205
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.590
horrific things that have happened,

206
00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:49.980
which is getting the police on the streets,

207
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:54.160
making personal connections, creating relationship. There's

208
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:58.070
<v 5>nothing in this system that prevents you from having effective community</v>

209
00:11:58.071 --> 00:12:01.040
policing at the same time. And Oh, by the way,

210
00:12:01.041 --> 00:12:04.610
this may dramatically help that community relations,

211
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:08.660
the reason they're putting body cams on police officers is try to get the police

212
00:12:08.661 --> 00:12:13.661
officers to be more respectful because they can be seen while this lets us watch

213
00:12:13.851 --> 00:12:17.720
all the officers in a 25 square mile area all at once,

214
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.990
but then you can watch so many other people all at once.

215
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:25.650
<v 0>Here's the other things that people in Dayton do, like Romeo and Juliet,</v>

216
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:30.450
they sometimes meet without their parents' permission in the playground and

217
00:12:30.451 --> 00:12:31.284
smooch.

218
00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.770
There are going to be divorced lawyers who are going to be tracking Aaron

219
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.950
spouses. There are going to be traffic police who are watching,

220
00:12:37.951 --> 00:12:39.330
who goes through the red light.

221
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:41.790
They're going to be realtors who are wondering who are,

222
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.670
how many tenants do you really have in that building?

223
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:50.030
And I guess the thought might be that if the information exists that will show

224
00:12:51.721 --> 00:12:56.610
what my pixel was actually doing then then I'm a little less

225
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:02.470
<v 5>free. There is a clear trade off between security and privacy.</v>

226
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.700
And you know, in our major cities where we have, you know,

227
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:08.710
tens of thousands of major crimes,

228
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.950
you are a lot less free when you can't leave your house at night.

229
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:16.880
<v 0>There's obviously a and a huge advantage to knowing what you know.</v>

230
00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:21.290
But then there's a huge thing to knowing what you know,

231
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.060
like knowledge all by itself is sort of uh, is pregnant with, with

232
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.460
<v 12>funny do you know, here's my problem with, with the, with this,</v>

233
00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:31.290
with all of these privacy stories,

234
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.240
it's like when you're talking about these technologies,

235
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:38.330
the advantages are always so concrete and the tradeoffs always feel so abstract.

236
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.100
I feel like there is this, there's something being lost here,

237
00:13:44.101 --> 00:13:47.550
but I can never quite put my finger on it. It's weird. Oh,

238
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:52.500
Jab that weirdness that you're feeling. Yes, it's going to get a lot weirder.

239
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.273
<v 6>We'll be right back.</v>

250
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.550
That means they answer to policy owners,

262
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:31.670
<v 12>Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I remember Krill, which is radio lab and uh,</v>

263
00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.280
we'll continue our collaboration with the Minutia Moroni and Alex Goldmark from

264
00:15:35.281 --> 00:15:40.281
note to self and our subject is and remains eyes in the sky in the situation

265
00:15:40.651 --> 00:15:42.990
when we left it as it minutia, one of our producers, Andy Mills,

266
00:15:42.991 --> 00:15:45.810
had gone down to Dayton, Ohio to talk with Ross McNutt,

267
00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:50.130
check out his technology and a after the date and demo. What were you,

268
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.970
how were you feeling about things? Well, I was feeling like, ah,

269
00:15:53.971 --> 00:15:57.630
you have not convinced me. I do. I am not going for this.

270
00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:02.280
And then I saw war as Mexico and that, well,

271
00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.890
I mean that's what made me start to think otherwise.

272
00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.400
<v 8>Whereas a, especially at the time we did this,</v>

273
00:16:08.401 --> 00:16:12.510
they averaged 300 murders a month and 52 kidnappings a week.

274
00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.230
300 murders a month. Yeah. McNaughton the gang,

275
00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:20.700
they got a contract we'd been asked not to say for whom and they went down

276
00:16:20.701 --> 00:16:22.530
south, set themselves up in a hotel room,

277
00:16:22.531 --> 00:16:26.580
got the plane up in the sky and then whoever the client was started bringing

278
00:16:26.581 --> 00:16:30.630
them prime reports. So this is kind of what you never want to see happen.

279
00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:35.640
But uh, this is kind of why the system was up. Alex pulls up on the screen,

280
00:16:35.641 --> 00:16:39.720
this very grainy aerial shot of war as this is, whereas Mexico,

281
00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.700
it looks like any city, right?

282
00:16:41.701 --> 00:16:46.050
You've got like grids of streets and cars and houses and then like over on the

283
00:16:46.051 --> 00:16:49.470
left of the screen, he points to this dark little square.

284
00:16:49.471 --> 00:16:54.150
It's a vehicle that's going down the street. This is a female police officer.

285
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.020
She was actually headed to work, uh, on this morning.

286
00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.460
Uh, so we'll kind of go through it here.

287
00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:07.380
He starts at the beginning and you see there's her house and her car is parked

288
00:17:07.381 --> 00:17:08.214
outside.

289
00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:12.450
You see that like teeny little pixel gets in her car and she pulls out of her

290
00:17:12.451 --> 00:17:16.470
driveway. That was her home starts to drive to work. Um,

291
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.210
and then right when she leaves, uh,

292
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.730
if you look up here, he points to the upper left of the screen. Um,

293
00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:28.770
several cars were parked up on the corner. As soon as she left her driveway,

294
00:17:28.771 --> 00:17:30.420
those cars become active.

295
00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:35.910
So this is a stakeout. Yeah, they were waiting for her to leave.

296
00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.250
He's so zoomed in that you can see,

297
00:17:38.251 --> 00:17:41.130
it's like a ticktack moving down the street.

298
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:45.480
And then two more tictacs come alongside until they get right about here.

299
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:49.920
He's clicking forward on the photo and you see there is a speed bump.

300
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.540
These cars just inch closer social kind of hesitate there, which is unfortunate.

301
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:56.340
Um,

302
00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:00.960
so she's driving down the street and there's these cars following behind her and

303
00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:02.910
then there's this car up ahead of her.

304
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:07.110
A vehicle that had been parked here for 15, 20, 30 minutes,

305
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:12.000
all of a sudden backs out into traffic and seemingly slows them down,

306
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.900
almost gets in an accident right here. Um,

307
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.840
which gives these guys enough time, uh, to catch up.

308
00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:21.870
This is where they're gonna pull up beside her

309
00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:23.710
<v 7>and then suddenly,</v>

310
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.193
<v 14>oh,</v>

311
00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.130
<v 8>um, Alex says right there. This is the point.</v>

312
00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.580
<v 14>[inaudible]</v>

313
00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.760
<v 8>where here the first car pulls up and shoots her multiple times.</v>

314
00:18:35.761 --> 00:18:39.210
She was shot in the head multiple times in the head right here.

315
00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:42.260
<v 14>[inaudible]</v>

316
00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:46.730
<v 8>she's actually gonna roll through the intersection. Her car continues to go,</v>

317
00:18:46.731 --> 00:18:48.230
even though she's been shot in the head.

318
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.730
There is a parked car behind this tree and you'll actually see this parked car

319
00:18:52.731 --> 00:18:54.620
move when she runs into it.

320
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.770
And then these guys take off.

321
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:01.223
<v 14>[inaudible]</v>

322
00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:06.920
<v 7>yeah, it was not fun to watch.</v>

323
00:19:06.921 --> 00:19:08.060
It was upsetting.

324
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:13.450
But what happens next made me really start to understand what this technology is

325
00:19:15.081 --> 00:19:19.190
capable of real quickly. Just show you some of the other bras walks in.

326
00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.950
He takes that moment, horrible moment.

327
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:26.840
And then he starts to like shoot back and forth in time. Suspect car, one years,

328
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.720
his bath before the murder. Here's his path. After the murder,

329
00:19:29.721 --> 00:19:32.370
he actually takes the too cars from that murder.

330
00:19:32.371 --> 00:19:34.950
And you see he draws on the map.

331
00:19:34.951 --> 00:19:39.300
You see that they meet up with two other cars that were involved in a different

332
00:19:39.301 --> 00:19:43.830
murder. Now one murder becomes two, two cars become four car stops.

333
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.290
And if you follow all four of these cars,

334
00:19:46.291 --> 00:19:48.510
drawing lines as they move through the city,

335
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.930
you find out who they meet up with them. Four becomes eight,

336
00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.530
eight becomes 16 so on and so on. And you have all these lines,

337
00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:56.730
criss crossing the city.

338
00:19:56.731 --> 00:20:01.731
And then you see that all whole bunch of those cars are headed to one place.

339
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:05.970
This house, this house appears to be their cartel headquarters.

340
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:10.610
And that's when you start to think, okay,

341
00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.020
well that's how you have to take something like this down.

342
00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.190
It's not a one shot thing like solving the crime.

343
00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.920
It's about cracking an entire system.

344
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.930
<v 15>In fact, um, this is Andy here,</v>

345
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.120
but when I was doing some research into this,

346
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:34.340
I made a bunch of calls and I spoke with this one governmental source who told

347
00:20:34.341 --> 00:20:36.800
me that this information, that Rasa just showed us,

348
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:42.320
like it was one of the primary tools used to dismantle an entire cartel in wars,

349
00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.980
and that apparently the leader, that cartel

350
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.260
<v 12>was responsible for something like 1500 murders.</v>

351
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:58.740
Whoa. So I got asked again. So how are you feeling at this point?

352
00:20:58.741 --> 00:21:03.741
Are you happy or scared or of the same of myself because I thought,

353
00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:05.851
oh,

354
00:21:05.851 --> 00:21:09.810
the reason why I'm so excited about it is it because it's in a country where I

355
00:21:09.811 --> 00:21:13.890
don't live and I'm an outsider and I think of it as being messed up.

356
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:17.850
So it's okay for them, but it's still not okay for us.

357
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:20.340
What did you think Andy? I mean

358
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.520
like this is where I stopped being a good journalist because I picked aside,

359
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:32.360
it feels wrong to not solve these crimes that we can solve it.

360
00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:36.840
What if this plan is on top of New York? Good God, really?

361
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:39.630
For me it became low.

362
00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.170
But do you remember like after nine 11 when you'd walk down the street and you'd

363
00:21:43.171 --> 00:21:45.510
hear the [inaudible] circling over the city?

364
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:49.890
And I just remember the feeling in my stomach was like nausea.

365
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.460
Like I felt sick. It felt gross.

366
00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:56.580
It felt like we had no autonomy over ourselves.

367
00:21:56.581 --> 00:21:58.650
And at that point I was scared enough that I could live with it.

368
00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:02.460
But right now I don't feel that way. And look,

369
00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:05.880
it's a very privileged position to be able to say that we shouldn't have it.

370
00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:07.080
I get that. And that's what I'm saying,

371
00:22:07.081 --> 00:22:12.081
like I became a convert because somebody got kidnapped today and if we had an

372
00:22:14.521 --> 00:22:15.300
eye in the sky,

373
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:19.890
we might be able to get the kid back in a few minutes hours compared to like,

374
00:22:19.891 --> 00:22:23.040
you see the stats on on amber alerts, they're not good yet.

375
00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:24.780
But what we're talking about is like,

376
00:22:24.781 --> 00:22:27.900
and I'm not saying that I'm like anti McNutt at all,

377
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.280
but what I'm saying is like,

378
00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:33.540
it's very easy to paint it as we're going to get bad guys.

379
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.840
And I just don't think it's that simple. The McNaughton Co,

380
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:40.530
they seem like decent people. They have set limitations for themselves.

381
00:22:40.531 --> 00:22:43.410
They have said they will not use photography that could get any closer.

382
00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.360
They've made a moral choice with that.

383
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:50.100
How do we know other people will make the same moral choice and that even though

384
00:22:50.101 --> 00:22:54.600
this thing might solve a ton of crimes, might save lives.

385
00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:59.780
It's still not worth the risk because it just asks a level of trust in

386
00:23:00.901 --> 00:23:04.200
government that we shouldn't, we shouldn't give. Is that what you're saying

387
00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:11.280
for now? Yes. So back to Dayton. What happened in Dayton? Well,

388
00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.420
I was pretty impressed. I was pretty impressed. After that five day demo,

389
00:23:15.421 --> 00:23:17.070
the police chief, Richard Beale,

390
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:22.160
I recommended that we enter into a contract with persistence surveillance

391
00:23:22.951 --> 00:23:27.510
systems and so they took it to the city commission.

392
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.570
Carrie Gregg. Oh Hey Carrie. It's minutia New York.

393
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.890
And according to Carrie Gray,

394
00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.950
director of the city commission office for the city of Dayton,

395
00:23:34.951 --> 00:23:37.350
Ohio committee saw the presentation and they liked it.

396
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.350
The city commission was interested in, in the presentation,

397
00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.800
but they decided that before they go forward, they should have a public forum.

398
00:23:43.801 --> 00:23:46.190
So they could just, you know, sort of hear from the people.

399
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:50.720
There was about 75 or so people there and he says that the people of Dayton,

400
00:23:50.721 --> 00:23:55.460
like much like the people of Radiolab and note to self, we're very divided.

401
00:23:55.490 --> 00:24:00.490
A quarter of the people were supportive of this technology and they were

402
00:24:00.501 --> 00:24:03.410
frustrated with the amount of crime. Their belief was,

403
00:24:03.411 --> 00:24:06.830
I'm not doing anything wrong so I don't care what people see me doing.

404
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.280
We want this implemented and we want to implement it very broadly.

405
00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.650
So a quarter of them were like, you know, bring it on.

406
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:17.270
They were basically in the Indy camp woo. But then there was another group,

407
00:24:17.271 --> 00:24:18.890
slightly smaller, but now my much,

408
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.920
maybe 15% that was the Robert Minutia camp who believed that this was a

409
00:24:24.981 --> 00:24:27.500
grotesque invasion of privacy.

410
00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:32.000
And some of the people spoke in very impassioned terms.

411
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.440
So yay.

412
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.910
I think calling it grotesque invasion of privacy would pretty much reflect the

413
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.970
weight that way. This group was feeling this group too,

414
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:45.380
and that there was no way that you could trust government with this volume of

415
00:24:45.381 --> 00:24:49.460
information and this breadth of information. So you had your pros and cons.

416
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.230
The rest of the people liked the majority,

417
00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.630
maybe had some feelings one way or another,

418
00:24:53.631 --> 00:24:55.700
but just didn't have enough information.

419
00:24:55.701 --> 00:25:00.701
And so they came and kind of asked questions like how long will persist in

420
00:25:01.431 --> 00:25:05.780
surveillance systems keep the images 90 days, how far can they zoom in?

421
00:25:05.781 --> 00:25:09.170
Can they see my face? No. So they had a lot of questions,

422
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:11.720
which Carrie seems to think that they could've answered.

423
00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.840
They could've gotten everybody on board, but in the end,

424
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:17.900
even though the room was basically divided into three parts,

425
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:23.200
the naysayers were so loud and so impassioned that they sort of defined the

426
00:25:23.781 --> 00:25:25.670
conversation as we do.

427
00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:30.700
So we took that lesson to understand that there was going to be some significant

428
00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:36.170
education that was gonna be needed and some significant hurdles that we're going

429
00:25:36.171 --> 00:25:37.160
to have to be crossed.

430
00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:42.460
Before that we were able to do a broad based implementation and based on the

431
00:25:42.861 --> 00:25:45.470
amount of time that was going to have to be spent,

432
00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:49.790
we decided there were other more immediate techniques it could be used that

433
00:25:49.791 --> 00:25:54.260
could be invested in and we took the money that could've been spent on this and

434
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:55.880
spend it on some other activities.

435
00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:59.030
Because it seems like what you're saying is that like it was just going to be

436
00:25:59.031 --> 00:26:02.150
too hard to get people over the hurdle, so like, Eh, it's not worth it. Yeah,

437
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.300
I think that's probably pro probably accurate. Um,

438
00:26:05.301 --> 00:26:09.590
so the plane is off the table so to speak. It's off the table for right now.

439
00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:12.230
<v 16>[inaudible]</v>

440
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:14.960
<v 12>but that doesn't mean that it's never coming back on the table.</v>

441
00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:16.460
<v 16>[inaudible]</v>

442
00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:20.710
<v 12>which I think is fair to say is a frustrating to him.</v>

443
00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:25.050
<v 5>Right now we've got about $150 million with a proposal sitting out there for a</v>

444
00:26:25.051 --> 00:26:28.170
large number of cities, Baltimore, Philadelphia, the Moscow,

445
00:26:28.171 --> 00:26:30.570
we've been the Lunder. We're waiting for them to make decisions.

446
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.130
We've done Compton and roles.

447
00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.570
<v 12>Compton's like maybe or as is like maybe Dayton is like maybe</v>

448
00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:38.210
<v 5>it's a whole lot of babies out there.</v>

449
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:40.820
<v 12>And what McKnight and his team were doing now,</v>

450
00:26:40.821 --> 00:26:44.210
and this is actually what they were doing when we went to visit them, they're

451
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.600
<v 1>analyzing</v>

452
00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:49.280
<v 0>what we're doing here in Dayton is we are looking at a</v>

453
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:55.820
turn pike or something traffic in New Jersey. They're studying traffic problems.

454
00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.460
We look at congested areas, which are typically,

455
00:26:58.461 --> 00:27:00.200
especially in that part of the country,

456
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:04.640
exits a in onramps any kind of junction in a highway.

457
00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.140
Sometimes you just want to scream

458
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:14.090
<v 17>[inaudible]</v>

459
00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:18.980
<v 0>since we did that story, things have happened. Minutia did they have.</v>

460
00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:23.360
And so I've invited you back here to fill us in on further developments of which

461
00:27:23.361 --> 00:27:25.820
there have been gigantic ones very recently.

462
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.310
<v 1>Yes. And McNutt says not just since we heard that episode,</v>

463
00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.340
but because we aired that episode. Uh,

464
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.810
well after this episode first went out,

465
00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:41.280
it turns out that there were a couple very wealthy philanthropists listening to

466
00:27:41.281 --> 00:27:45.780
radio lab and they picked up the phone. They called him and they said,

467
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:51.230
we would like to be the people that bank roll you giving us a try in a,

468
00:27:51.361 --> 00:27:52.950
in an American city somewhere.

469
00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:56.840
<v 0>So they, he, they just said, we'll write you a check if you can land the city,</v>

470
00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:57.883
we'll give you the money.

471
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.120
<v 1>Pretty much we just look at who are these people?</v>

472
00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:04.380
They are Laura and John Arnold. They're young, they're in their early forties.

473
00:28:04.381 --> 00:28:08.340
They're in Texas. And by the time that they contacted McNutt,

474
00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:10.800
he had already done as, as we said,

475
00:28:10.801 --> 00:28:15.060
he'd already done a very extensive look at cities across the nation looking for

476
00:28:15.061 --> 00:28:18.030
the one that had the biggest crime issue. And as he puts it,

477
00:28:18.031 --> 00:28:20.310
the strongest political leadership,

478
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:25.340
somebody who would be willing to put up with the firestorm that would inevitably

479
00:28:25.351 --> 00:28:28.200
ensue. Um, Baltimore fit the bill.

480
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.820
It had a mayor who said she was very tough on crime shootings were actually up

481
00:28:32.821 --> 00:28:35.640
in Baltimore by 72% last year.

482
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:40.350
So he went back to Baltimore and said, if I can get the money for this,

483
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.930
are you game? And they were like, sure.

484
00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:48.300
<v 0>So the rich folks were willing to give money to the mayor of Baltimore to put a</v>

485
00:28:48.881 --> 00:28:51.970
plane in the sky to take pictures of Baltimore for a discrete period.

486
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:52.850
<v 1>No, not quite.</v>

487
00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:57.500
So it didn't go to the government or any elected officials.

488
00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.940
Nobody needed to sign off on this in the city of Baltimore other than the police

489
00:29:01.941 --> 00:29:02.480
commissioner,

490
00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.320
which is why he was able to do it without telling any of the city council

491
00:29:06.321 --> 00:29:09.050
members or, uh, the mayor.

492
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:13.780
<v 0>The second way is Baltimore's police department without telling the mayor or the</v>

493
00:29:13.781 --> 00:29:18.781
city council or anybody decides to contract with this fellow supported by two

494
00:29:19.211 --> 00:29:23.440
people in Texas to put a plane in the sky to gaze down at Baltimore and

495
00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:26.950
everybody in Baltimore and they just don't mention this to the mayor.

496
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.100
Did McNaughton move to Baltimore and

497
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:33.160
<v 1>Oh yeah, he moved to Baltimore. Um, and they set up a,</v>

498
00:29:33.161 --> 00:29:36.840
across the street from the police station and had the,

499
00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:41.110
bout a dozen analysts sitting there for two months looking at everything that

500
00:29:41.111 --> 00:29:42.880
was going on in Baltimore.

501
00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:47.630
<v 0>So they did see some stuff during this period. Like, give me a, an,</v>

502
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:51.480
an example like of something bad that happened that they did.

503
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.880
<v 1>Here's one that we know about, which is that there was an elderly, um,</v>

504
00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:59.100
brother and sister. The woman is 90 years old. Uh,

505
00:29:59.101 --> 00:30:01.810
the brother is 82 and they were cross,

506
00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.360
they were near this bus stop and they actually got in the line of fire.

507
00:30:04.361 --> 00:30:06.740
They got gunned down by a shooter. Um,

508
00:30:06.741 --> 00:30:09.250
and so they ended up tracking a couple cars,

509
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:13.000
but then later they think the police say, actually we think he got away on foot.

510
00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:17.010
I think it was a witness on the ground who said that they thought that he had

511
00:30:17.011 --> 00:30:20.550
left on foot. Oh and so rewind.

512
00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.910
And they see a dot scrambling to get away from the scene.

513
00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:28.530
It goes down the street, it passes the subway sandwich shop.

514
00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.450
It goes between these two houses.

515
00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:34.260
I'm stops at a car that's parked and then it ends up at,

516
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:39.470
they later discovered the home of a woman and turns out her boyfriend is

517
00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.130
somebody who has a long criminal record. Um,

518
00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:49.160
and so there are over 700 CCTV cameras on the streets in Baltimore.

519
00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.860
And so the idea is that it's sort of a support mechanism, right?

520
00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:55.650
Like they get the high level, then it goes to the street.

521
00:30:55.651 --> 00:30:56.910
Then you've got the officers on the [inaudible],

522
00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.621
<v 0>right? Yeah.</v>

523
00:30:57.621 --> 00:31:01.820
So if the shooter shoots and then gets into a car and goes down elm street,

524
00:31:01.821 --> 00:31:06.821
you have cameras down on Elm Street and you can see maybe the car and then the

525
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:10.110
driver's license and maybe even capture the face. Exactly.

526
00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:13.910
And did they eventually arrest this person?

527
00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:18.080
So he crossed state lines and the feds picked him up. Okay.

528
00:31:18.081 --> 00:31:19.700
So they've made the arrest,

529
00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:23.120
they go into court and they say to the judge or Kay,

530
00:31:23.121 --> 00:31:27.410
we obtain information about this suspect in part through a spire plan.

531
00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:30.650
Does the stuff that they gathered during this few months,

532
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:34.930
is that now going before judges and becoming evidenced and arrests and

533
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:35.803
prosecutions?

534
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.640
<v 1>Well, not yet. We talked to the state's attorney's office.</v>

535
00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:42.090
They got a briefing about a month ago from the police about what [inaudible] had

536
00:31:42.091 --> 00:31:42.924
been up to.

537
00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:48.140
And they also told us that there are five open and pending cases where this

538
00:31:48.421 --> 00:31:52.140
surveillance technology was used. Police are using it.

539
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.530
And they say this is the state's attorney's office,

540
00:31:55.531 --> 00:31:59.850
that they're looking forward to learning more about what McNutt actually does

541
00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:05.240
and that they are trying to determine whether in fact all those pictures could

542
00:32:05.371 --> 00:32:09.150
be used in some way at trial, but they're not ready to say yes,

543
00:32:09.151 --> 00:32:13.200
this absolutely will pass legal muster in a trial. It God,

544
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.400
<v 0>this is a the other objection that I guess I was thinking about,</v>

545
00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:18.510
was it the defense,

546
00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:22.680
the people as a matter of justice as a matter of the fourth amendment? Well,

547
00:32:22.681 --> 00:32:24.380
you know, this is going to come up at some point. Yeah.

548
00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:28.410
Then the defense lawyers would say, wait a second. Um,

549
00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:33.650
this evidence against my client was obtained without not only his or her

550
00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:35.221
permission,

551
00:32:35.221 --> 00:32:40.221
but without anybody's permission and the entire town is now in effect,

552
00:32:41.481 --> 00:32:44.540
searchable during, yes. On sunny days.

553
00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.300
And did the founding fathers want that to happen?

554
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:48.160
<v 1>To be honest, the,</v>

555
00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:52.710
the supreme court hasn't seen a ton of these master valence cases, but actually,

556
00:32:52.711 --> 00:32:53.544
Robert, I mean,

557
00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:56.310
I happened to have the fourth amendment here and I want to read it to you.

558
00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.340
<v 0>It's got, it says you can't do the searches and seizures are prohibit.</v>

559
00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:03.020
<v 1>Yeah. The right of the people to be secure in their persons houses,</v>

560
00:33:03.021 --> 00:33:07.430
papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be

561
00:33:07.431 --> 00:33:12.431
violated and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause supported by oath

562
00:33:12.441 --> 00:33:16.250
or affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the

563
00:33:16.251 --> 00:33:18.170
persons or things to be seized.

564
00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:23.470
<v 0>So by that token you could say people to be searched, everyone in Baltimore,</v>

565
00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:27.060
places to be looked at every place in Baltimore,

566
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:31.890
oath to be a obtained ahead of time blanket.

567
00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:34.770
That's a pretty radical thing.

568
00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:39.710
<v 1>Yeah, and when you put it like that, no wonder there is very likely to be a,</v>

569
00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:44.980
an inevitable big legal public debate over whether this is the answer to

570
00:33:45.421 --> 00:33:50.070
Baltimore's crime problem. McNutt says he thinks very,

571
00:33:50.071 --> 00:33:54.870
very soon the police are going to release an evaluation report looking at the

572
00:33:54.871 --> 00:33:57.510
effectiveness of his planes.

573
00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:02.620
<v 8>He thinks that whatever Baltimore decides,</v>

574
00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.720
that's going to set a precedent for midsize cities that are struggling across

575
00:34:07.721 --> 00:34:08.710
the United States.

576
00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:17.510
<v 0>I'm Robert Krulwich and I'm a new summer OT. From note to self,</v>

577
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:22.570
you can go to radio lab.org for more information about the making.

578
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:24.470
Right? And also, please,

579
00:34:24.471 --> 00:34:29.450
I hope you'll check out note to self radio.org special thanks to Alex Goldmark

580
00:34:29.451 --> 00:34:32.690
also to Dan Tucker and George Scholz. By the way,

581
00:34:32.691 --> 00:34:36.340
the piece that we just listened to was produced by Andy Mills. Uh,

582
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:40.550
he has produced a any number of Radiolab stories over the years,

583
00:34:40.551 --> 00:34:44.240
and he has decided to move to the New York Times.

584
00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:48.230
He's been a tremendous boon to us over and over again.

585
00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:53.320
He's brought a worldview and a sensibility that we didn't have before.

586
00:34:54.441 --> 00:34:57.920
He came, not really, and now he's going to work for that obscure newspaper,

587
00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:01.430
but nevertheless, we wish him all the best.

588
00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:06.050
And thank you Andy so much. And thanks. Of course.
