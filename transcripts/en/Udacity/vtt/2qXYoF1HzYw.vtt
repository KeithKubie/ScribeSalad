00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.450
So now you have a few more tools
to approach problems in your code.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.390
But this is just the beginning.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.930
When you really get into it,
debugging isn't just correcting errors,

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.400
or even just figuring out
how you made a mistake.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.630
It's a scientific process
of examining code

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.750
to discover things you
didn't expect in it.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.600
Debugging is a really important
skill to learn if you want to do

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.110
software engineering.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.070
In real-world computing systems,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.790
bugs cause problems that
are a lot bigger than just

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.120
getting a weird error on your screen.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.180
Correctly locating errors is a big
part of writing reliable software.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.650
In fact, we have a whole course on
a scientific approach to debugging.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.260
After you've finished
your current projects,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.850
you might want to take
a look at that next.
