00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.830
Hello.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.071
Hello.

00:00:09.071 --> 00:00:10.320
My name is Rich Schwartzstein.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.694
I'm from the medical school.

00:00:11.694 --> 00:00:12.610
I'm a professor there.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.720
And I'm a pulmonary
critical care

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.020
doctor who'd spend a great
deal of time doing teaching.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.305
Part of the new curriculum
we've had there just

00:00:20.305 --> 00:00:22.280
started three years ago.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.080
And then something
called the Academy,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.105
which is kind of like a Bok
Center for the med school.

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:28.589
About nine years.

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.880
In this session-- hopefully
you're in the right place--

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.980
about advancing and
promoting teaching.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.780
And there's really two
pieces to this session--

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.530
to provide some insights
on how we support faculty

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.279
to be better teachers--
and that will be done,

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:47.820
I'm going to give you a quick
overview of that in the next 10

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.560
minutes; and then Julia Lee
from the school of engineering

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.790
is going to talk briefly
about how we provide faculty

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.520
incentives to improve teaching.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.400
If you were in one
of the last sessions,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.230
this notion of
misalignment of incentives

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.450
is a potential problem for
innovations in general.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.570
And schools, perhaps
in particular, there's

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.810
the needs of the students,
the needs of the faculty,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.420
the needs of the
organization, and how

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.190
you get those aligned
is an ongoing challenge.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.690
So--

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.870
Rich, before you get
going, just to kind

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.020
of how we're going
to run this session.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.120
10 minutes of presentation
for Rich and Julia

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.400
and a few minutes
of just clarifying

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.610
questions before we get to
a group activity at the end.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.110
Thank you.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.750
You're going to have a chance
to weigh in on the things you've

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.540
heard and other things
that you are thinking

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.580
about in your own schools,
and we'll go from there

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.260
in terms of discussion.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.090
So improving teaching.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.390
There's sort of two
approaches sometimes.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.526
The fortune cookie approach.

00:01:52.526 --> 00:01:55.090
Teachers work with the
curriculum much better.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.310
It's sort of all about the
interpersonal aspects of it.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.550
And that's important, but it's
probably not the whole thing.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.350
And then there's the other side.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.940
I will adopt best
practices, which

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.420
we've been trying to do
for however many years HILT

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.039
has been in existence now.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.500
And talked about that on and
on and over and over again.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.160
And I think it's a blending of
these two things in some way.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.450
The art and science, focusing
on the science today.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.970
So I want to talk
about how we can

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.330
get better and the role
of peer observation

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.320
as part of that process.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.990
So this is from some
work of Anders Ericsson.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.730
Some of you may know.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.900
A psychologist
originally from Sweden

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.020
and had most of his
career in the US.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.060
And he talked about
looking at something he

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.450
calls "deliberative practice."

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.700
Some people call
it guided mastery.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.370
And this notion that
just because you

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.540
do something for a long time
doesn't mean we get better

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.480
at it, that you
need to reflect, you

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.530
need to have other people
helping you to do better.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.570
And he's done this
work with everything

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.600
from chess players
to radiologists,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.130
looking at the same thing.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.500
And he talks about this
notion that as we get better,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.760
we can plateau at a
number of different levels

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.150
depending on whether we
continue to do that reflection

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.670
and get feedback and act on
the feedback and so forth.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.750
And even though these everyday
skills become very automatic

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.380
and we sort of like
that sometimes--

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.060
we don't have to think
about what we do,

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.970
it's just kind of built in,
it's habit, and so forth--

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.620
that doesn't allow
us to continue

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.330
to get better and improve.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.580
It goes to this arrested
development stage, and then

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.970
ultimately, ideally, up
to expert performance

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.980
if you, in fact, continue
to reflect and get

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.580
feedback and work on it.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.600
So there's a lot
of stuff going on,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.610
I think, in education
generally right now--

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.590
very much certainly at
the medical school--

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.270
about the role of coaching.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.030
And we probably know coaching
brings to mind many images.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.030
There are a lot of personal
coaches that help individuals

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.640
in terms of work-life
balance and figuring out

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.994
how to navigate their careers
and those kinds of things.

00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:05.660
And of course, most
of us had experience

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.020
with athletic coaches at
some point in our lives.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.160
And what is a coach?

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.140
It's usually a close,
personal relationship

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.300
with an individual,
and that person

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.700
has the freedom to really
observe you, make comments

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.860
about things that
you could do better.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.110
And then you work on that,
and you get observed again,

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.930
and that's, again, leading
up to that expert performance

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.990
kind of with that
guided mastery notion.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.410
And so what we've tried to do
is blend this idea of coaching

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.880
with a peer observation program.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.710
So this notion is
that teachers like

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.360
you will come and work with
you, watch you, and give you

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.880
feedback on things that
you're doing quite well

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.790
and things that maybe you
could do a little bit better.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.400
And so this is a
list of the sorts

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.640
of things that are built
into this notion of peer

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.410
observation.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.130
Now it sometimes
feels like you're

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.650
under the magnifying glass.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.230
And when we first talk about
that with people there's

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.940
a little bit of, I'm
not so sure I really

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.320
want somebody in my
classroom watching what I do.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.020
What is that going to feel like?

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.600
But the reality is people
can get used to this

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.440
and wind up finding that it's
very helpful, whether it's

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.920
about looking at specific
pedagogical approaches.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.960
In fact, practice giving
feedback to each other

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.360
is good because it helps
you to give feedback

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.130
to your learners,
which is a challenge

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.230
for a lot of our faculty.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.470
Allows us to document
our teaching activities

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.770
better and so forth.

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.330
All these things
that you see here.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.970
And the reality is
we think everyone

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.830
can learn to become an
effective peer observer.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.620
Now, doing this often depends
on developing these skills

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.169
in a formal way,
and I'll tell you

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:45.460
how long we've been doing this.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.500
This is from a symposium
we ran at our Academy

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.980
at the med school in 2011.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.039
So we've been talking
about this for a while.

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:54.580
We've had an interest
group, in fact.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.704
We've been working on this.

00:05:55.704 --> 00:05:57.950
We've done research
on some of the ways

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.120
of thinking about and doing
peer observation as well.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.150
And it has taken us seven-- we
implemented it a year ago, so

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.671
six, seven years to really
get the program formally up

00:06:08.671 --> 00:06:09.170
and running.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.600
So it does take time
to get into this,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.570
but I think it can
be very helpful.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.370
Our new curriculum
is based on something

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.630
called case-based
collaborative learning.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.360
And so this new format, which is
a blend of team-based learning,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.170
case-based learning, a little
bit of problem-based learning

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.610
kind of all rolled into one
fusion for the medical school,

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.070
has specific elements
about how you do it well.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.360
So we had a group that
got together and said,

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.790
what are the key parts of
teaching in this new format?

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.520
And we've actually published
as well the same kind of thing

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.160
for lecturing a few
years ago that we've also

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.840
used for peer observations.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.960
So starting out
with an instrument--

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.110
and I think we've handed out
one of the papers that has

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.540
an instrument embedded in it.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.640
Starting out with an
instrument is really helpful

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.300
because that instrument
helps you to think about

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.460
your teaching, just
looking at the instrument,

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.450
and it helps you make more
objective observations

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.230
of what you're looking at.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.510
So it's very helpful.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.700
When we started talking
about peer observation,

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.400
doing this with our
faculty, it was actually

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.160
quite well received.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.110
In terms of using this
worksheet, most people, 73%,

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.320
thought it was extremely
helpful or helpful

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.050
in identifying and discussing
new teaching techniques.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.080
So again, even after we had
done faculty development

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.270
for this process,
the peer observation

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.670
enhanced the faculty
development that we

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.890
did for teaching
in this new format.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.440
And 90% found-- you can
see-- that the observation

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.950
debriefing was either
helpful or extremely helpful.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.470
So this notion,
again, that I'm now

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.320
getting feedback that's
actionable, that's

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.720
tied to these specific
elements that we think

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.540
are important for the
teaching, turned out

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.830
to be very productive.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:03.350
In terms of setting this up
there are different models.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.040
This peer review
model, which is kind

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.110
of what the observation I've
been describing is about.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:11.500
It's a discussion about
teaching mutual reflection.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.340
And frankly, having been the
observed and the observer,

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.050
you learn a lot often
by being the observer.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:18.130
Wow.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.680
That was a great thing
that that person just did.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.050
I'll incorporate that
into my teaching as well.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:24.940
So it isn't just
the person who's

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.990
providing the initial feedback
who benefits from them.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.460
And at this point, it's
viewed as purely formative.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.830
This is just about helping
you to become better.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:37.059
And this developmental model,
in terms of competencies,

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:39.130
again, if you have a
more formal instrument

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.267
and talk about the
elements of competence

00:08:41.267 --> 00:08:42.850
that you want your
teacher to develop,

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:44.480
you can do that as well.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.960
And then the last one is
the revaluation model.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.670
This is one we haven't
really implemented yet

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.190
but we are talking about it.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.070
So as we think about
aligning those incentives,

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.010
how do we potentially
even promote, reward,

00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:00.100
otherwise incentivize
people who make

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:05.650
education a focal point of
their career in the university?

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:06.929
This may be a way to do that.

00:09:06.929 --> 00:09:08.470
People say, well,
I'm a good teacher.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:09.340
Well, how do I know?

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.756
Maybe you're on a
promotion board,

00:09:10.756 --> 00:09:12.640
or you're a
departmental committee.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.275
How do I know you're
a good teacher?

00:09:14.275 --> 00:09:16.190
Well, you say, well,
my students like me.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.180
And that's always been brought
up as a suspicious thing.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.640
The students, what are they
really evaluating when they

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.260
say that you're a good teacher?

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.270
So this is a more objective way.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.700
We train our
observers sufficiently

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:30.590
that we feel like there is
inter-rater reliability,

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.560
they're using a
valid instrument,

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.620
that we could potentially
use this down the road

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.680
to help people get rewarded
for their teaching.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.350
And we're not at that
level yet, but we're

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:46.510
building, potentially, up to
that implementation for them.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.340
So quickly, I'll just summarize.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.000
We all can be
better as teachers.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.620
I think whatever level you're
at, we all can have better.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.420
But without this
deliberative practice

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.870
we're likely, in fact, not just
a plateau, but to get worse.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.930
One of the famous
sayings in K12 education

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:03.890
is, have you taught
for 30 years or did

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.310
you teach one year 30 times?

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:08.860
Have you made any
changes to the way

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:12.610
that you practice, if you will,
in terms of your teaching.

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:16.480
And peer observation not only is
a way to improve your teaching,

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.930
but frankly the interactions
with your colleagues

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.950
is a very rewarding thing
to engage in as well.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.270
And again, can be used for
either formative or summative

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.360
assessment.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:26.860
All right.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.220
So again, just a brief
overview of part of what

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.020
we hope to deal with today.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:35.360
Let me bring up
Julia's presentation.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.150
We'll have her go through
this quickly as well.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.390
And then-- sorry.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:41.891
Go back to--

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:44.098
Rich, do you want to answer
any clarifying questions?

00:10:44.098 --> 00:10:46.110
I didn't know if you
wanted to do it after both,

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.370
or we can do it now?

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.130
Just if they're
clarifying questions now,

00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:52.090
and then we can have--

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:58.030
Questions about anything that
I've done in this overview.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:04.090
How many faculty have been
observed or observers?

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:04.870
How many faculty?

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.619
And Barbara, what's
the number that you're

00:11:06.619 --> 00:11:08.020
up to at this point?

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.420
This is Barbara Cockrill
who's the director of faculty

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.270
development at the med school.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:16.550
We've done this in the
preclerkship curriculum.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:18.170
So it's a classroom teaching.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.720
And I think we're up
to about 45 people.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.500
And the peer coaches--

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.720
we're sticking with the
coaching model to start with--

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.906
we have 12.

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.690
And we do this informally
in the clinical arena

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:35.830
in different departments.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.790
But our organized focus has
been on this preclerkship

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.524
curriculum.

00:11:41.524 --> 00:11:42.190
Other questions?

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:43.619
Other clarifying questions?

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:50.510
Just since you've trotted
the numbers out now,

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:53.720
can you give us some sense of
the proportions or percentages?

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:55.411
Denominator.

00:11:55.411 --> 00:11:55.910
Yes.

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.200
Sounds small to me.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:57.970
It is small.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:02.390
But we have-- it's not as
small as you might think.

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:05.030
For our first year--

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.194
We have six classroom
courses in the first year.

00:12:07.194 --> 00:12:09.110
And so every student has
to take every course.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:10.850
So the entire class is being--

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:11.530
Core faculty.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.650
--in each of the courses.

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:16.950
So it's probably about 40% of--

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:18.060
Of that first year--

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.271
Of the first year faculty.

00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:21.020
Because you have that
ability to focus in.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:21.740
Yeah.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:21.920
Yeah.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.420
Right.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.170
OK.

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.720
And it's all been
completely voluntary.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.980
I mean, people are
signing up for it.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:32.640
And it's-- well, no, no,
it is totally voluntary.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.320
And that's been one
of the challenges,

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.210
is to get people to
understand that it really just

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:40.027
is coaching and not evaluative.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:43.280
OK.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:46.410
So Julia, will you
take it from here?

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:47.095
Hello.

00:12:47.095 --> 00:12:49.400
Can you hear me?

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.310
So I'm going to pan out
a bit and talk about--

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:57.650
give you a brief overview on
the motivation, design process,

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:00.350
its usage cases in
the recent publication

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:04.250
of Career Framework for
Advancing University Teaching.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.010
I was actually part
of this working group.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:12.290
The publication is a culmination
of a 3 and 1/2 year global

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:17.840
effort to develop a open
access tool for people

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.520
to assess, evaluate, reward
teaching achievement.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.590
And really, I want
to use this platform

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.800
as well to hopefully spark
some conversation about

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.650
whether or not this is
actually relevant for Harvard

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:33.660
or different cohorts at Harvard
who we're actually depending on

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.640
for teaching.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:38.780
So this slide is
meant to hopefully

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:42.410
impress upon you the rigor with
which this study was actually

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:42.910
done.

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.910
So it's led by Dr.
Ruth Graham, who

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.000
is actually a
professor at Imperial

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.540
College in mechanical
engineering and has

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.170
since becoming a consultant.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:54.960
But the initial draft
of the framework

00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:00.260
was informed by pedagogy
literature and education

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:00.770
literature.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:02.353
And then it was sent
out with feedback

00:14:02.353 --> 00:14:05.896
from experts to
university leadership

00:14:05.896 --> 00:14:07.770
across multiple institutions
and disciplines.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:09.950
And I wrote
"including medicine,"

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:13.160
because even though it's a
Royal Academy of Engineering

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.900
publication, it's really meant
to be broadly applicable.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.880
And what I think
is more powerful

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.190
is the fact that it was
piloted across about

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.470
five different continents,
and all the schools

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:25.812
are actually listed here.

00:14:25.812 --> 00:14:27.520
So the schools that
are actually listed--

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.360
institutions are
listed in parentheses

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:33.170
are the ones that gave feedback
as opposed to direct piloting.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.140
But nevertheless,
these were who were

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:42.140
involved in providing the final
product that was published.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.050
I was involved in two ways.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.800
Since I was already
on the committee,

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:51.180
I had gotten the blessing, as
it were, from our then FAS dean

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:54.380
Mike Smith, and then also
the SEAS Dean Robert Doyle

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.260
to actually really think
about this framework

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:00.660
and give feedback in the context
of how I was thinking about it.

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.780
And in particular, in
the context of how do

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:07.190
we support non-ladder
faculty careers

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:11.270
who we're actually depending on
more and more for the teaching.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:15.240
And then also directly for a
university in South America,

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.000
whereas part of the
senior leadership

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.160
and as part of that
effort we were really

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.420
redefining the structure
of the university.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:26.600
And we used this
framework, in fact,

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:32.450
to inform on a dual promotion
track for the faculty

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.490
there for teaching
and research-based

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:36.300
or some combination of both.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.660
So that's the context.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.850
And certainly there was
a lot of emerging trends

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:42.680
for the motivation
for developing

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:49.550
this framework, certainly in
Europe and Asia and elsewhere.

00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.540
As fees were actually
increasing for universities

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.550
whereas they used to be free,
there was more and more demands

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.870
now because they have to
pay for better teaching.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.270
And then I think there was
some discussion about this

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:06.740
this morning that there's also
competition of online learning

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.460
resources as well.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:13.740
Interestingly, also in
Europe and also Asia,

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.480
the governments are actually
linking studentships and fee

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.640
structures to
quality of teaching.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.920
So there is actually
some linkage

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.130
to that that is actually
encouraging people

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.430
to make the change.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:28.460
Encouraging strongly.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.730
And certainly, I think,
last but not least,

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:34.310
is that there was recognition
amongst the working

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:38.090
group and external to it,
that even though there

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.030
is this increased rhetoric,
for lack of a better word,

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:43.430
for better teaching
amongst the faculty,

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.180
there is really little incentive
for really improving it

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.950
because as long as
you actually pass

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:52.680
some kind of baseline
teaching quality,

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.480
then beyond that your
promotion chances are really

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.170
tied to research output.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.220
And what this framework
was trying to do

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:05.660
was to try to provide a useful
metric for evaluating teaching

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.520
achievement that overcomes
traditional barriers in terms

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.480
of not having necessarily
well-defined things

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.650
for these different levels.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.800
And what is
particularly interesting

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.460
is that it ties the
successive levels of promotion

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.480
if you will to your
sphere of impact.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:30.250
And then what the framework also
provides examples of evidence

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.750
for what those might look like.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.840
So just briefly to show those.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.850
One can imagine that at the
most basic baseline level

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:43.094
you're an effective teacher
and your sphere of impact

00:17:43.094 --> 00:17:44.260
is going to be the students.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.926
You're actually
thinking conscientiously

00:17:45.926 --> 00:17:49.540
about how do students learn
and how to effectively teach.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.360
If you wanted to go
up to the next level,

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.260
then that sphere
of impact actually

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:58.090
has to extend to maybe
relevance to the broader

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:00.520
institutional context or
that you're actually giving

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:03.470
mentorship to your colleagues.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.880
With a third track,
as we're moving up,

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.630
we decided that we're
going to split those

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:08.990
into two different ways.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.580
One is if you
continue to improve

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:15.610
the practice of teaching
and the sphere of impact

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:19.690
to extend to a larger cohort
and beyond the university,

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.310
but it also allows
for people who

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:24.580
want to do scholarly research
to also advance in this way

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.470
if they're doing
research on pedagogy

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:30.520
and other similar things.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.340
And then, of course--

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.630
and then, of course,
the highest level.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.550
And so obviously you're
not meant to read all this.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.210
For anybody interested, I've
got the actual publication

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.280
that goes into the details.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.350
But really, it's broadly--

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:46.450
one of the key things
was giving examples

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:48.700
based on all these piloted
schools of what that might

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.170
mean for the different levels.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:54.490
And these levels can be
broadly separated into two

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:56.660
major categories.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:00.430
One is the approach, which is
really due to the instructor

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:01.000
himself.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.440
Some self-introspection about
your teaching as well as

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.350
your professional activities.

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:11.620
The impact part,
which is assessed

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.890
through both direct and indirect
measures of student learning,

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:19.520
as well as kind of what your
peers think about your teaching

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.960
to, for example, Rich's point.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.142
And so just an example.

00:19:24.142 --> 00:19:26.350
There was a number of
universities that have actually

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.210
used this framework
in different ways

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:31.030
to kind of put it into the
context of how it might work

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.070
in a particular
university, whether it's

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.640
to slice through this
in different ways,

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:40.090
or whether as a
metric for where you

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:44.260
want to be in terms of
assessing the different people.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.260
So here, for example,
this is University

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.410
of Twente in the Netherlands.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:51.410
This one shows that--

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.170
so for somebody
who chooses to have

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:56.170
most of their career
in an education track

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:59.390
there is a baseline
requirement for research.

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:01.630
But at the same time,
most of the promotion

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:04.750
is really going to be
tracked to their teaching.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.670
And what's very
useful and interesting

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:11.970
about this framework is that, in
fact, this institution is also

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.500
tied to support structure
for helping these people

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:18.290
move up to the different
levels as well.

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.470
And certainly, I list
this as the Netherlands,

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:23.020
but in fact, the University
College London one looked also

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:23.860
very much like this.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:25.776
So there's a lot of
universities that actually

00:20:25.776 --> 00:20:28.000
use this framework to
kind of make changes

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.802
to their institutions.

00:20:30.802 --> 00:20:33.260
And as I said, the governments
have really gotten involved.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.280
So for example,
in Malaysia, there

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.290
was a national government
call that universities

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:42.160
had to develop some kind of
unified academic pathway.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.320
And so a number of
universities have

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:49.000
been using this framework to try
to work that out collectively.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.160
What's really amazing
is that, as a whole,

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.366
the Dutch government
and most of the Dutch--

00:20:54.366 --> 00:20:55.990
some large factions
at the universities

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:59.410
have really kind of
embraced this to the extent

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:04.120
that the minister of
education, who actually was

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.300
on this committee before he
became minister of education,

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:12.430
has decided to actually put
money towards this grant

00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:14.480
to say, we want better
teaching so I'm going

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.230
to invest in better teaching.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:20.560
And so they've actually
mapped these different levels

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.470
that people can
apply for and get

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.720
recognized for to
these different tracks

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.550
of this framework.

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:33.220
And in the initial
run of this in 2017

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.130
I noticed that they actually
invested 6 million euros

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:36.670
into this.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.830
And these were the number of
fellows at the different levels

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.830
that are being supported
now to actually improve

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.320
their teaching.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:50.982
And so this was published
formally in April 2018.

00:21:50.982 --> 00:21:54.080
Some 30-plus universities
that we know of actually

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.470
use this to inform or
enact changes in some way

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:57.290
in universities.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:00.390
So there is this global trend
towards really recognizing

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:02.150
teaching more.

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:05.400
And then I want to kind of
bring us back to Harvard

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:10.110
with that particular context,
is can we use this framework

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:13.440
to incentivize
our ladder faculty

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.440
to be better teachers in
some ways and to support?

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.800
But more importantly, something
that I've been thinking about

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:24.150
is, can we actually better
support the non-ladder faculty

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.790
who we're actually
depending more and more

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.704
on for our teaching purposes.

00:22:28.704 --> 00:22:30.370
So if we actually
look at these numbers,

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:33.000
they make up a pretty large
fraction of the faculty

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.250
that we're depending on.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:38.790
And so if I were just--

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.310
this is obviously not
correct, but if I were just

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:46.860
to attempt to map that to
this particular framework,

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:49.800
this might be the level of where
we would actually place them.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.680
But as I was interviewing
different people

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.180
in different
departments, I realized

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:59.070
that the expectations of
these different people

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:02.210
are very different based on
what departments they are at.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:04.930
So I just wanted to
put that out there.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:08.610
So really my question to you
is, is a modified framework

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:09.690
relevant for Harvard?

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:15.240
Is it useful to support
non-ladder careers,

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:20.910
or as a means to reward
teaching for ladder faculty?

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:25.720
And then how do we actually
support and incentivize?

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.747
And then, of course, the
goals today is really--

00:23:27.747 --> 00:23:29.580
I think we want to ask
the question of this,

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.820
how do we support all faculty
to be better teachers here?

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.070
We're going to break out
into groups and discuss this.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:37.530
And then, also, how
do we incentivize

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:39.120
this improvement in teaching?

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:45.500
And I'll just leave that up
about next steps in this study.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.170
But I'll just leave it up
during the question session.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:56.956
Clarifying questions for
Julia about the framework?

00:23:56.956 --> 00:23:59.820
I just have one question.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.320
Did you put any--

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:06.780
did the committee try to
look at dollars at all?

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.960
And you hear all the time,
well, research faculty

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.600
bring in overhead from grants.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.790
Teaching faculty, if you
have these teaching faculty,

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:17.430
they don't bring in dollars.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:20.970
Of course, they might
bring in tuition.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:23.540
So I wonder if you
looked at money at all?

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:28.170
Not as a direct consequence
of what we wrote.

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:31.770
But I think money was
talked about indirectly

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:33.660
in that a lot of
universities actually

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:36.520
do depend on student fees.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.250
So in that case,
this is where I was

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:40.290
saying that as student
fees are going up,

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:44.530
there was a demand
for better teaching.

00:24:44.530 --> 00:24:47.670
And so I think really in
that particular sense.

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:49.905
But I think it was
more than we recognized

00:24:49.905 --> 00:24:52.230
that better teaching
was a need and there

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:53.640
was no support for it.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.860
What a lot of the
universities have done

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:59.450
is actually invested their own
dollars in supporting this.

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:02.370
So the university said,
this is an important thing,

00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:04.070
we're going to invest in it.

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:05.540
The problem is that
oftentimes it's

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:06.960
where this is an
important thing,

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.650
just do it along with
everything else and whatever.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:12.390
So I think that was
something that we

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:14.130
were really conscientious of.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:17.910
And a lot of universities who
did this really did invest.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.430
So I just have a
question, and this is only

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:23.500
based on having taught
in Europe for a while

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:26.230
as well as having worked here.

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:29.010
I'm wondering if you've seen
any differentials in terms

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:33.455
of national culture with regards
to how quickly universities

00:25:33.455 --> 00:25:35.630
and teachers are
picking this up?

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:37.970
For example, the
Netherlands for a long time

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.810
was way ahead of
the rest of Europe

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:42.240
in terms of emphasis
on teaching,

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:45.670
emphasis on experiential
learning, active learning.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.320
And because they're
national systems as well--

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.720
they're primarily public system
versus the US' privatized

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.560
system--

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.210
have you seen any
differences in terms

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:58.130
of how large institutions,
like governments in Netherlands

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:02.220
or the EU versus other systems
like the US, are supporting it,

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.380
and how is that
affecting adoption rate?

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.320
So I think with the Netherlands,
I mean, it's really amazing,

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.900
because they decided
to take this--

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:12.264
I mean, to begin
with, all faculty

00:26:12.264 --> 00:26:13.680
at universities
in the Netherlands

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.960
actually have to have some
kind of teaching certification.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.001
So they already have to
go through that training.

00:26:18.001 --> 00:26:22.500
So it wasn't that much
of a jump to enact.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.580
But in terms of other
institutions-- so for example,

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:29.002
Cambridge, Oxford,
I was just there,

00:26:29.002 --> 00:26:30.210
they were kind of resistance.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:33.420
They're kind of like us.

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:37.710
But in that sense, the fact that
the UK government are saying,

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:41.070
OK, you're going to get a gold
star, silver star, bronze star,

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:44.340
and what star is going to
affect what students come.

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.297
And you could argue, OK,
well, Cambridge, Oxford,

00:26:47.297 --> 00:26:49.380
it doesn't really matter
because people want that.

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.240
But the thing is that
what they've also done

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.520
is tied it to how much
you can raise fees

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.430
or whether you can raise fees
or whether the government

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:59.340
will give you any
studentships as well.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.770
So that's how they're
actually really

00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:03.927
kind of forcing the change.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.930
Sounds like one more
clarifying questions?

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:15.120
So-- and you know, it's
not a clarifying question.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.020
I'll defer it.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:17.580
We'll come back to--

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.140
Mines sort of clarifying.

00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.930
Was there a standard way
that effective teaching

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.570
was measured, or is
there a recommendation?

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:29.460
I think effective-- so we gave
lots of different examples

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.630
as part of that thought.

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:36.130
But I think that is something
kind of to be continued,

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:40.210
as kind of how do we--

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:43.050
how do you say, OK, we're
measuring effective teaching

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:48.180
when we don't necessarily know
how to assess student learning

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.440
outcomes, for example?

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.840
So it's meant to be a start.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.760
So I think different
institutions

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.790
have their own definition of
what effective teaching is

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:57.790
at the different levels.

00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:01.260
So it's left for those
institutions to decide.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:05.130
But we kind of set very broad
guiding principles on this

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.160
is where you might be
thinking at at this level.

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:19.160
So we're moving on
to the workshop.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.660
Well, what we
want, I was saying,

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.810
in terms of these
particular questions,

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:28.910
is to get a better
understanding of the interest

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:32.780
in supporting or incentivizing
faculty here at Harvard.

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:35.510
We're going to split the
room basically in half

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:39.350
and have you work in
groups to really answer

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:41.390
some of these questions.

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:43.610
One group, one part
of the room is really

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:46.550
going to really look at how
do we actually help faculty,

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:49.820
whereas the other part of the
group is going to look more at

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:55.890
how we can incentivize
faculty to be better teachers.

00:28:55.890 --> 00:29:05.000
So we're going to talk in
our tables until 12:55.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.210
And then we're going to
ask for one or two insights

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.080
from each of the tables.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.740
But only one or two, so
you have to figure out

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:16.230
which are the most important
one or two things that will get

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.730
reported.

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.140
And we'll then
discuss as a group.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:21.710
And we're going to be
floating around, eavesdropping

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.836
on discussions so we can see if
we can pick up some themes that

00:29:24.836 --> 00:29:28.580
are being generalized.

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:31.220
So we'll start with--

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:35.750
which side should we start with,
the helping or incentivizing?

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.320
You guys had a
great conversation.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.250
Can I start with you?

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:38.750
Sure.

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:39.380
OK.

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:46.310
So what top two points that
you thought were relevant.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:50.690
So we were very interested in
the issue of both non-ladder

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:53.000
and ladder communities.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.660
They're both very,
very important.

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.500
So in terms of
incentivizing, we think

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:01.730
for non-ladder, the potential
for retention and job security.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:04.010
We're losing too many
people who are very, very

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:08.430
good at teaching because
there is a ceiling

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:11.930
to the opportunities here.

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:14.870
In terms of ladder
faculty, a couple

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:18.500
of big issues and also
places to incentivize

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.080
are around the issue of time.

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.860
Mismatched objectives--
the emphasis on research

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:27.450
rather than on teaching.

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:29.885
So course releases,
creating communities

00:30:29.885 --> 00:30:34.250
of practice, that these
might be some ways in which

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:37.370
to incentivize the
ladder faculty.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:43.580
And then we also thought in
terms of the faculty activity

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:48.440
reports that if you worked in
more questions about teaching--

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.050
and not just in terms
of individual practice

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:55.770
but also working in community,
so peer observation,

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.250
community as a practice--
that these might begin

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:00.900
to become things that would
be evaluated in terms of pay

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:01.400
raises.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:06.300
Thank you.

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:11.210
So I think what we'll do
then is if these were some

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:13.430
of your ideas, try
to go down your list

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:16.670
and come up with ideas
that aren't on this list.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.029
OK.

00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:24.570
We had a kind of a
raging discussion,

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:27.780
but it's not as well
organized as that.

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.470
A couple of specific things
that we talked about that

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:34.076
seemed both like
helps and incentives.

00:31:34.076 --> 00:31:35.450
Mainly the first
is an incentive.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:38.980
It's the concept of a service
score for ladder faculty

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:42.035
that better incorporates
their non-research activities

00:31:42.035 --> 00:31:48.197
and is part of the
promotion package.

00:31:48.197 --> 00:31:50.030
And then something else
that we talked about

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:53.180
was something that is similar
to the curriculum fellow

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:57.770
model at the medical
school-- the idea of having

00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:02.150
subject experts who are
also expert in teaching

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:05.870
to work with faculty to relieve
some of the burden of teaching

00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:10.670
well and to make
teaching well easier

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:15.100
and to provide a good
opportunity for people

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.670
who want to teach to
do that professionally.

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:19.920
And we also talked about how
there's a ceiling on that

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.795
and that's a problem.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:24.590
Great ideas from both tables.

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:28.593
We're still on
incentives over here.

00:32:28.593 --> 00:32:29.426
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:32:29.426 --> 00:32:29.926
OK.

00:32:29.926 --> 00:32:32.156
I am apparently
the spokespeople.

00:32:32.156 --> 00:32:34.120
So a lot of the same
things that other folks

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.300
have already talked about.

00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:37.270
And we also had a wide
ranging discussion

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:41.020
and talked a lot about the
tenure and promotion issues

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.580
at large that drive this.

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:47.980
But I think to add another idea
that, again, really requires

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:52.300
institutional level commitment
is to rethink teaching

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.940
as being the sole responsibility
of an individual faculty member

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:58.420
and think about teaching as
the mission of the university,

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:01.900
of the school, the department,
and think about restructuring

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:05.500
teaching so that the default
is teaching teams that include

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:08.440
specialists with a variety of
areas, that include the faculty

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.260
member as a subject matter
expert but other people

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:16.450
to take the time pressure
and just to redistribute what

00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:21.576
teaching is

00:33:21.576 --> 00:33:22.330
This group.

00:33:22.330 --> 00:33:24.920
Thank you.

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:30.430
So I just want to say, sort
of expanding on the ceiling

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:33.490
conversation, in terms
of number one, what

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:35.050
would be useful in
providing faculty

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:36.970
with incentives, we
thought expanding

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:40.600
the definition of success and
just taking it to that level

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.960
and saying, how faculty
perceives success,

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.030
how can we expand that
as an institution to make

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.870
them see the value of learning
how to be a better teacher?

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:52.810
And then we also started
from number three,

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:55.960
what promising
practices do we see,

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.570
we talked about how the schools
are all sort of bubbling up--

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.460
the Academy being one of them--

00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:03.040
where the schools
are really create

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:06.040
some promising
opportunities and centers

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.283
for where you can actually
learn to teach better.

00:34:08.283 --> 00:34:09.699
And that's a
promising practice we

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:12.151
think that other schools
can learn from and continue

00:34:12.151 --> 00:34:12.650
to go along.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.270
Thank you.

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:17.273
Were you incentive?

00:34:17.273 --> 00:34:17.773
Yes.

00:34:17.773 --> 00:34:19.192
We were also incentive.

00:34:21.861 --> 00:34:22.360
Sure.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:27.340
So one idea that that
came up that we endorsed

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:34.130
was trying to make faculty
course websites and course

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:37.199
videos available to
colleagues as the norm.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:40.540
And so if you wanted to take a
look at what someone else was

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:42.969
doing, it would be easy
to see their syllabus, all

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:46.050
of their course materials,
all of their lecture videos.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:49.210
And just create a
culture of transparency

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:54.190
around teaching, where all
of our scholarly activities

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:57.490
are done very much in the public
and our teaching activities

00:34:57.490 --> 00:34:59.560
electronically
can be made public

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:02.620
in a way that could
change the culture.

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:08.620
So widely sharing.

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:11.080
Are there any other thoughts
that we didn't come up

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:14.910
with here from these
other groups on incentives

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:17.740
before we move on to helping?

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.890
All right.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:23.640
Let's move on to--

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.290
Can I say one other incentives
that I chatted about

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:27.670
with a few tables?

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:30.442
It's fun to teach well.

00:35:30.442 --> 00:35:32.650
I mean, Barbara will tell
you that one of the biggest

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:35.500
things that we found
in recruiting faculty

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.710
to do this stuff in our new
curriculum was everybody said,

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:41.380
I've lectured, I've taught
this, this is the most fun

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:44.410
I've ever had as a teacher.

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:46.760
Doesn't always have
to be about money.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.830
And so just wanted to
throw that out there.

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:51.760
And I think that the
community that we

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.940
have in our new curriculum
is an incentive.

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:56.590
It's not a monetary incentive.

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:59.475
But pointing that out to
other faculty, which brings it

00:35:59.475 --> 00:36:02.890
to your point of sharing
and working together

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:04.660
with other faculty.

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:05.260
OK.

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.860
Let's move on to helping.

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:07.960
Are we staying on time?

00:36:10.792 --> 00:36:13.152
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:18.020
So we also had a very
wide ranging conversation

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:21.330
that moved between
incentivizing and helping.

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:25.550
But where we landed
was really on supports.

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:28.530
And this almost goes
to transparency.

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:31.410
Making supports
for teaching truly

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:35.550
visible across all the different
levels of the institution

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:37.720
and making modeling--

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:42.460
the use of those supports,
making that visible from day

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:42.960
one.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:45.990
And the example we used
was at the Kennedy School,

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:47.850
we have a new faculty institute.

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:53.460
Before faculty even
start, day zero,

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.870
they watch established faculty--

00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:58.050
their peers, their
soon-to-be peers--

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:01.730
modeling innovative and
interesting teaching.

00:37:01.730 --> 00:37:05.730
And that begins a cohort effect,
and it begins a conversation

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:10.050
that is helpful because
it demystifies some

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:14.370
of the practice of teaching,
some of the experimentation,

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:17.820
and it also creates more of--

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.490
I think it was to
Chris' group's point--

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:26.400
it creates a bit of
teaching as a communal idea.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.708
It shows that teaching is
of value to the community.

00:37:33.124 --> 00:37:34.587
Great.

00:37:34.587 --> 00:37:35.170
How about you?

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.140
How did you decide to
help your teachers?

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:40.177
Was this the group that couldn't
answer all the questions?

00:37:40.177 --> 00:37:42.622
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.110
So we agree with a lot
of what people have said.

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:54.590
Also focusing on a centralized
or collecting the community

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:55.730
of knowledge that's here.

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:57.617
There's a lot of
individual programs

00:37:57.617 --> 00:37:58.700
and different departments.

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:00.050
There's Bok Center.

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:03.410
All the schools have
separate programs

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:05.480
to help their teachers.

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.032
But pooling those resources--

00:38:07.032 --> 00:38:09.240
I admittedly have not looked
at the new HILT website.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:13.730
You should look because they are
awesome It literally took years

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:16.273
and it's imperfect but
it is all there, I think.

00:38:16.273 --> 00:38:18.920
I mean, hundreds-- hundreds
and hundreds of hundreds

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:22.540
of entries that are the
organizations and the tools.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:26.720
And maybe to that point,
making HILT more broadly known

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:29.240
at Harvard.

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:32.900
Claudia was saying, what
percentage of the attendees

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:35.480
here are students versus
how many of the attendees

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.800
here are faculty?

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.900
And I know that
none of the faculty

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:42.270
that I work with of the 100
or so faculty that I know

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:45.230
and get along with,
none of them are here.

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:49.490
And so making these
researches more widely known,

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:52.970
including HILT.

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:56.060
So creating that
communication, it's not easy.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:59.450
And it seems like
electronically we

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:01.640
have to all become
more facile, because I

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:05.000
know for us at the med school,
at the clinical part of the med

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.130
school, that feels like the
only way we can reach the 12,000

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:13.820
faculty that are at all
the different hospitals.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:15.096
Was there another one?

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:20.192
Well, agreed.

00:39:20.192 --> 00:39:22.400
I think a lot of people
mentioned a lot of the things

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:22.580
here.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:24.410
But I just did want
to say that I think

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:27.470
we were thinking that
sometimes having champions

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:29.540
within the staff or
faculty to disseminate

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:32.705
this kind of information
is also important.

00:39:32.705 --> 00:39:37.010
And another thing is creating
some school-based databases

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:39.330
of all the available
resources within the school,

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:43.080
whether that be different room
locations, or technologies,

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.775
or even people, so that it's
easy for separate faculty

00:39:45.775 --> 00:39:49.110
to just access that and know
who to contact and who to reach.

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:52.000
And I think having those teams,
as that group had brought up,

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.810
with instruction designers and
all that dedicated towards you

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:55.655
is a great resource.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.850
How about this group?

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:02.710
Thank you.

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:05.890
So I think we started off
by just kind of comparing

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:10.630
and sharing how our different
institutions approach

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:14.020
supporting faculty and
teaching assistants and really

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.190
folks at all levels.

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:16.960
And I think much of
what's been said here

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:17.959
is what we've discussed.

00:40:17.959 --> 00:40:20.500
But really thinking about
support in a very systematic

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:24.850
way, starting with onboarding,
with mentoring, with the peer

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:27.310
observation, with evaluation.

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:30.940
I think for me a big piece
of that is also the culture--

00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:34.810
the culture and the emphasis
on the importance of teaching,

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:37.090
and how do we make
it more visible?

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:39.962
So I think really a lot
of what everybody has said

00:40:39.962 --> 00:40:40.920
has been captured here.

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.740
And then the alignment of that
with the incentives and really

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.930
making sure that they are
aligned, that there aren't

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:49.600
perverse incentives
kind of throwing off

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.040
the purpose of making teaching
a focus of the institution

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:53.540
as well.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.490
And I think we have
one more table.

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:02.240
I saved you for last.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.460
Thank you.

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:04.960
OK.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.360
So we may prove to
be the rebel table.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:11.470
But I'm going to
start with item five

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:13.930
because what we talked
about is that the assumption

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.580
that there's a need
to improve teaching

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.200
may be problematic for some.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.970
Some may not see it.

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:22.990
And so in some ways mobilizing
at the grassroots level,

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:29.032
just start to engage everyone
in even why that may be a goal.

00:41:29.032 --> 00:41:31.240
Otherwise, we're walking in
with a lot of assumptions

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.520
that create problems.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:34.600
And it's troublesome.

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.230
It's difficult.

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:39.840
When we looked at number one,
what's useful for faculty

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.340
to improve teaching
practices, there

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:43.510
was a very good
suggestion in terms

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:49.120
of leadership being engaged in
real time effort and interest--

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.350
maybe coming to classes, being
visible in the many teaching

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:56.950
fora that exist in
some ways to start

00:41:56.950 --> 00:42:00.280
to shake it up a little
bit and help everyone

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.040
shift their attention.

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.160
In terms of challenges,
obstacles, among many,

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.700
we came to the broader piece
of making the case for change--

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.800
engaging stakeholders.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.500
Certainly incentives comes
up right away, but also

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:16.716
thinking about the many
metrics that we lean on

00:42:16.716 --> 00:42:17.590
and their weaknesses.

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:20.560
I know it was mentioned
in terms of ratings,

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:25.720
and you had scores and things in
terms of for classes or courses

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:28.270
that we know are weak
metrics, yet somehow they

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:29.950
still live with us.

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:31.810
And so how we address
that, I think,

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:35.470
is a big issue that came
up for us many times.

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:37.480
Item three, promising practices.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.610
We each came up with
examples and ideas

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:42.320
in terms of engaging
faculty and developing

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.820
the solutions, the programs, the
practices that then are going

00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:47.980
to affect them as end users
so that, again, they're

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:50.420
part of the process.

00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:53.310
And then number four,
in terms of supporting

00:42:53.310 --> 00:42:56.200
at the department versus
school versus university level,

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.150
certainly it can
happen on many levels,

00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:01.100
but the feeling of this
group was generally

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:02.800
that the department
level is part

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.920
of the core of where it needs
to start because there are so

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:06.730
many differences.

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:09.130
And it's not to have them
live in separate silos,

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:11.512
but then deciding how
they link may be yet

00:43:11.512 --> 00:43:13.720
another piece of the process
we've just yet to learn.

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.635
Did I leave anything out there?

00:43:14.635 --> 00:43:15.170
Nope.

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:15.670
OK.

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:16.236
Thank you.

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:22.688
Thank you, everyone.

00:43:22.688 --> 00:43:24.330
Final to Rich.

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:25.870
Did you have anything to add?

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:30.660
So I had a couple of question.

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:35.190
How many people here
are on ladder track?

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:36.110
Oh, wow.

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:36.865
Interesting.

00:43:36.865 --> 00:43:37.615
So relatively few.

00:43:37.615 --> 00:43:38.115
OK.

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:45.550
And I guess we've talked
about the metrics.

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:47.870
That was obviously
one of the themes

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:52.040
that I heard listening in
in some of the report out.

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.440
At one level,
attendance, I think,

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:58.670
is a universal problem
in a lot of courses.

00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:59.930
Faculty get upset.

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:01.500
People aren't coming.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.390
There's something wrong
with the students.

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.390
But in terms of demonstrating
there's a problem,

00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:10.310
I'd say, if they felt there was
value added they would show up.

00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:12.860
I'm a big value added
person, that people

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.570
make decisions on whether--

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:16.970
between this and this
I can do two things.

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:20.140
Which one's adding value
to what my goals are?

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:22.820
If it's not adding
value they don't show up

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:25.200
unless it's mandatory and
there's a penalty for it.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.010
So that, to me, is almost our
biggest metric that there's

00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:30.410
a problem at some level.

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:34.840
And then I guess the
other question I have--

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:35.690
two other things.

00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:38.840
One is the culture is
huge, and everybody

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.380
talked about the culture.

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:43.160
And all I would argue is,
don't be afraid to start.

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:45.790
I put that slide up
seven years ago when

00:44:45.790 --> 00:44:48.020
we had a major symposium
at the med school

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:50.122
to start talking about
peer observation.

00:44:50.122 --> 00:44:51.830
Seven years later,
we're implementing it.

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:54.850
We've got 40 faculty
in the preclerkship.

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:55.790
It takes time.

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:58.660
But if we had more
people with tenure

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:00.380
it'd probably be
easier to say that.

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:04.449
But anyway, it takes time to get
some of these changes in place.

00:45:04.449 --> 00:45:06.740
And the one thing that we
play with a little bit in med

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:09.770
school, and some medical schools
across the country have it--

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:13.070
I don't know when it ever
would fly in university level--

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:16.280
is a Department of Education.

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.980
So you have your basic
department that you're in,

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:21.530
content sort of department.

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:23.540
But then for people
who are really

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.280
making a career as
educators, there's

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.220
a dual appointment in a
Department of Education

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.830
within the university setting.

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:33.440
And so it's another way
of recognizing people,

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.035
incentivizing them.

00:45:35.035 --> 00:45:37.020
And there may be
some ways of getting

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:40.070
promotions and other things
through the Department

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:40.760
of Education.

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.220
But I just saw that as
a big picture solution

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:46.780
that, of course, would be
many years in the making.

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:49.890
But there are some models
for that sort of notion.

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:51.531
You already have a score.

00:45:51.531 --> 00:45:52.030
Yeah.

00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:53.150
I know.

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:55.400
We're just different than
a Department of Education.

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.280
All right.

00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:57.100
It's different.

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:58.010
Little bit different.

00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:59.843
I wanted to add something
about the culture.

00:45:59.843 --> 00:46:02.180
I mean, actually, the next
phase of the study among some

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:05.180
of the subgroups or
universities is really

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:09.950
to try to do a longitudinal
survey study about really

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:12.350
evaluating what the
culture is for teaching

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:15.170
at a particular
institution, and then

00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:20.720
cross-correlating that with
what the emerging trend is.

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.810
And so actually, if
anybody's interested in any

00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:29.990
of this next phases, do
get in contact with me.

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:35.200
Thank you Julia, Rich, Barbara.

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:39.865
If you could just go ahead and
make yourself take one minute

00:46:39.865 --> 00:46:43.800
and write on a card one thing--
it doesn't have to be based

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.360
just on this session
but from today--

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.550
that you would like to do
to change your practice.

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:52.090
Could be a long term
thing, could be right now,

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:53.590
could be from any point of view.

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:55.540
But one thing that
you think you would

00:46:55.540 --> 00:47:00.500
like to do to improve teaching
and learning practice.

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:05.140
And I say this, like, we're
all ready to go have lunch.

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:08.980
But consolidating and forcing
yourself to commit to something

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:10.930
that you think you
might want to do

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:13.450
will actually make it
more likely that people

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:16.840
will go out and do things
and improve things.

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:22.630
And one final observation.

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:27.560
Peter, who's sitting here, we
had a conversation last week.

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:29.950
A faculty member deeply
involved with the School

00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:33.690
of Public Health and a number
of educational initiatives.

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:36.000
But he's leaving
Harvard to go be

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.570
a dean at another institution.

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:41.490
So here he is, taking careful
notes, because now he's

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:42.490
going to be a dean.

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:46.370
He's got the responsibility
to think about.

00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:49.330
So you just you never know
where these ideas that

00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:51.550
might get reported
out could actually

00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:56.020
go-- how many students could
be affected on the west coast

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.161
instead of on the east coast.

00:47:58.161 --> 00:48:00.550
So one minute to just
write something down.

00:48:00.550 --> 00:48:02.460
Thank you all.
