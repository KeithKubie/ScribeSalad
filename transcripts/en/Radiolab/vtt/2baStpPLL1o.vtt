00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.260
You are listening to radio lab radio from

2
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.020
W. N. Y. S. E. N. N. P. R. N. I assume we're live on the air now.

3
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.340
We don't do live either. If you guys ever talked to each other.

4
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.660
I don't think so. No. Oh this. So this is Caribou, right? Well Hi,

5
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.910
this is Jim Glick. Hey, how are you? Fine. How are you? Pretty good.

6
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.150
Good rainbows,

7
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.320
rainbows, rainbows. Okay, so we're going to start today with author James Glick.

8
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.410
As I recall you wanting to talk about Isaac Newton. That's right.

9
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.190
We did call him and talk about Isaac Newton, but more specifically colors.

10
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.380
Alright. Isaac Newton. He's 23 years old, 1665 and he's,

11
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.650
he's home for the holidays. No, there's no holiday. He's home for the play.

12
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.760
There was actually a plague. They sent everybody home from school. In any case,

13
00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:57.210
he's in his room famously solving all these mysteries of the world.

14
00:00:57.211 --> 00:01:00.900
And one of the questions that he thinks about during this break is what are

15
00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:03.360
colors? Where do they come from?

16
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.080
Like when I see the color red, is that red?

17
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.610
Is it inside my head or is it something that exists sort of out there in the

18
00:01:11.611 --> 00:01:15.800
world? Yes. The light without or is the light within? Hm.

19
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.630
So he pokes a knife into his eye. He w what do you mean?

20
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.910
Here's what Newton wrote in his notebook. I took a Botkin,

21
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.190
put it betwixt my eye on the bone,

22
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.370
this near to the backside of my eye as I could and pressing my eye with the end

23
00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:32.814
of it.

24
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.600
<v 1>Whoa. Whoa.</v>

25
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.660
<v 0>It appeared several white dark colored circle.</v>

26
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.030
Did that lead him to some conclusion about where the spots live,

27
00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:45.920
whether they're outside or inside? No,

28
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.090
just didn't get them very far cause seeing spots when you poke your eye doesn't

29
00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:54.200
tell you much about what color is. But um, what he did next did,

30
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.900
and this one needs a little more famous for, he got himself a prison,

31
00:01:56.901 --> 00:01:59.450
which is just a bit of glass shaped like a pyramid.

32
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.480
It wasn't so easy for him to get his hands on a prism, but he did.

33
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.260
Then he shot his blind. So the room was totally dark,

34
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.000
but he poked a little hole in one of the blinds and then he waited and the son

35
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:12.500
had to be at just the right angle

36
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.553
<v 1>and he waited.</v>

37
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.630
<v 0>And when the sun got to just the right spot,</v>

38
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.990
a ray of light shot through the room.

39
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.040
Newton immediately stuck his prison into the light and the light shattered

40
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.063
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

41
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.160
<v 0>and became a rainbow on the wall</v>

42
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.500
<v 3>or in Newton zone. Words colored image of the Sun.</v>

43
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.660
<v 0>Oh, that's gorgeous. Isn't it? A colored image of the sun.</v>

44
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.870
That's Victoria Findlay's. She wrote a book about color and she says,

45
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.160
the thing to understand about this experiment is it at the time people believed

46
00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:53.990
that white light was given by gold or given given by this amazing thing called

47
00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:57.170
nature. The light from the sun was sort of holy. Yeah.

48
00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.740
If there was anything that was pure, it was white.

49
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.490
So when the prism did the rainbow thing, which people knew prisons did,

50
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.880
they just figured the colors are in there and the glass. In other words,

51
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:10.720
that rainbow had nothing to do with the light itself. That was just the prison.

52
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.740
Adding some kind of impurities to the light. Oh Wow.

53
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:17.770
I haven't thought of the possibility that the prison is muddying.

54
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:19.390
The light is polluting the light.

55
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.960
How do you know that the prism isn't generating these colors? Yeah,

56
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.290
so he got a second prism, and this was the trick.

57
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.230
While the first prison was still making that rainbow on the wall,

58
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.680
he moved a few feet away and he held up a second prison in the blue area to see

59
00:03:34.991 --> 00:03:37.990
what would happen to the blue light with the prison,

60
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.640
add more colors to the blue light or would it be transformed in some other way?

61
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.230
And what he found was nothing happens.

62
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:48.490
It remains blue.

63
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.710
So he thought if the blue light isn't getting muddied by the prison and maybe

64
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:56.350
the prison wasn't muddying the white light to begin with,

65
00:03:56.351 --> 00:04:01.000
maybe that rainbow of colors was actually coming from inside the white light.

66
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:05.920
He inferred that the first prison is dividing light into its constituent parts,

67
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.420
which means that the white light we see around us is actually constituted all of

68
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:14.080
these colors. The colors were in the light. They are the light.

69
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.100
He had his answer. Light is a physical thing in the physical world.

70
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:20.410
You can tweak it, tested, study it.

71
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.130
This was the beginning of everything we know about light today.

72
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.490
Newton put us on the road toward finding that ultraviolet rays, x-rays,

73
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:28.121
radio waves,

74
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:32.530
they're all different energies of light and colors are just energies within that

75
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:34.450
little sliver that we can see.

76
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.170
And that has led to our understanding of the greenhouse effect,

77
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.350
knowing what stars are made of, even the age of our own universe.

78
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.493
<v 2>Uh,</v>

79
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.150
<v 0>not everybody was pleased by this. A little bit later. John Keats,</v>

80
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.600
the romantic poet, was really crossed with him and in a,

81
00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.880
in a poem because they said he reduced,

82
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.470
removed all the poetry of the rainbow and the real challenge to Newton's view of

83
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:08.010
color. One that would really stick oddly enough, it did come from a poet,

84
00:05:08.011 --> 00:05:10.810
not Keith's, but at the poet named Gerta. Yeah.

85
00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:13.150
Here's this German romantic poet, um,

86
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.050
that is authored Joanel air regularly with us who writes about this kind of

87
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:18.490
thing and always wonderfully.

88
00:05:18.491 --> 00:05:23.230
One day he is walking in the park and he spots these yellow crocuses and he

89
00:05:23.231 --> 00:05:26.700
looks at the Yellow Crocus, isn't it Myers? Their pedals, it's, you know,

90
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.300
it's early spring and they're blooming.

91
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.660
And then it quickly turns away and in an instant he suddenly sees his dash a

92
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:37.710
violet crosses eyes. He still sees the shape of the flower,

93
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.740
but now it's violent. It's the opposite of yellow.

94
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.880
He hadn't rubbed his eye and stuck the needle in it. And yet there it was,

95
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:50.440
seemed just as real, as real as the yellow coat. But he knew it wasn't real.

96
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:54.190
It came from inside his mind and it was, you know something, you know,

97
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:55.510
we've all hallucinated colors.

98
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:58.580
You can press on your eyeballs or close your eyes and you see this riot of

99
00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:00.680
fireworks. But for Gerta,

100
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.390
that simple observation leads him to think that may be color isn't simply about

101
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:09.740
the external universe. And maybe our perception of colors began in the world,

102
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.110
but maybe it was finished inside the mind.

103
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.310
And today [inaudible] [inaudible] a few years later,

104
00:06:14.311 --> 00:06:16.110
this is still an open question.

105
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.130
A scientist can say color has an objective reality,

106
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.570
but the colors we see are tricks of the imagination.

107
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:26.220
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

108
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.420
<v 0>and there is no perfectly objective pew of color. I personally,</v>

109
00:06:30.421 --> 00:06:34.860
I like to keep both of those opinions in mind at the same time.

110
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.860
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

111
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.450
<v 0>me too. Me Three</v>

112
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.930
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

113
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:40.800
<v 0>well lucky for us.</v>

114
00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.240
We're going to do a whole show of this. You don't say I'm Jed. I've been run.

115
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.440
I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab and today it's all about color. Yes,

116
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.430
we're is color. Is it in, is it out? That's the question. Yeah.

117
00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.250
We're going to explore that question through the eyes of a butterfly in the

118
00:06:59.251 --> 00:07:02.790
killing fields of Cambodia with a woman who may seek colors.

119
00:07:02.791 --> 00:07:06.270
The rest of us can only dream of and will go back to a time when the sea

120
00:07:06.271 --> 00:07:09.690
apparently looked like dark red wine.

121
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.530
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

122
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.160
<v 0>stick us in your ear holes cause we're about to get colorful.</v>

123
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:19.950
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

124
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.690
<v 0>And by the way, just before we get rolling,</v>

125
00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.370
just want to say we did something kind of different for us while making this

126
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.070
hour, we put out this call to a bunch of musicians,

127
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.160
solo artist bands to send us their favorite color songs,

128
00:07:32.161 --> 00:07:34.230
their own interpretations of their favorite colors.

129
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.770
<v 2>[inaudible] you got it.</v>

130
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.000
<v 0>An amazing response.</v>

131
00:07:43.001 --> 00:07:47.530
So throughout this hour you're going to hear color songs of various kinds, uh,

132
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.640
woven into some of the pieces between the pieces, those songs. By the way,

133
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.510
we have plans for, yeah, big plans. You can go to our website,

134
00:07:55.511 --> 00:07:58.420
radiolab.org to get a full list of the songs. I hadn't. Thank you. By the way.

135
00:07:58.421 --> 00:07:59.930
Everybody who sent us the Sunday.

136
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.513
<v 2>Absolutely.</v>

137
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.870
<v 0>Okay. So, uh, should we go? Yes. Let's ask. So to, to get things going. Um,</v>

138
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.280
hey, he's here. You're here. He is.

139
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.040
Not long after we talked to Jim Glick about Sir Isaac Newton,

140
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.310
we cannot do a neuroscientist by the name of Mark Cengiz.

141
00:08:17.311 --> 00:08:19.050
I'm going to two grapes, if that's all right with, you know,

142
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.660
who had written a book about color. Would you like some grapes? I know thing.

143
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.070
And we threw the question at him.

144
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.280
So one of the sort of debates that became interesting to us is this,

145
00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.640
where is the color? Is it out there? I mean,

146
00:08:29.641 --> 00:08:31.020
is this great that I'm holding right now?

147
00:08:31.021 --> 00:08:34.890
Is it red for everything that'd be a whale? I mean, is this,

148
00:08:34.891 --> 00:08:39.660
does it exist in a way that you can pin down and say it's outside me or does it

149
00:08:39.661 --> 00:08:43.080
only get to be red when it gets in my head? Well,

150
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:46.710
you can another way, a more severe way to, to ask this,

151
00:08:46.711 --> 00:08:48.690
and I asked this whenever I'm giving talks,

152
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.650
is just would aliens see it as red or would would aliens seed as red? Right?

153
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.700
And, and the answer is almost surely truth is says mark,

154
00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.450
even your dog wouldn't see it as red. Oh, your dog has color. Vision has blue,

155
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:03.480
yellow and black. White. Really? Yes.

156
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.210
So what would the world look like to a dog? I mean,

157
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.600
if you've ever known a guy who's color blind to, and 10% of men are color blind,

158
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:12.360
that's roughly what it's like. Huh? Well, here's a question.

159
00:09:12.361 --> 00:09:15.060
If a dog and the human [inaudible]

160
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.270
<v 4>and a crow, which could be staring at a rainbow,</v>

161
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.870
would they be seeing very different things? Yes.

162
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.410
Now this question that Robert just kinda tossed out during an interview,

163
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:30.720
like about how different creatures would see the rainbow.

164
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:34.750
This ended up taking us down a little worm hole and we ended up actually getting

165
00:09:34.751 --> 00:09:38.250
a choir to help us illustrate, uh, what we learned.

166
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.000
But just to set a baseline, your normal rainbow goes like this,

167
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:44.180
starting bottom up. Three, two, one.

168
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:50.510
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

169
00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:54.440
<v 4>red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, Roy g bit. Where'd you bev? Yeah,</v>

170
00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.480
though I don't know why people put the I in there, but that's it.

171
00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.970
If you didn't have the indigo, you couldn't say it though. Be [inaudible].

172
00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.790
That's why you need the, I think just to say the ROYGBIV,

173
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.540
you know that by the way is Tom Cronin. Oh, I bought,

174
00:10:05.541 --> 00:10:08.360
it's called a visual ecologist. Mark suggested we give him a call.

175
00:10:08.361 --> 00:10:11.240
He told us that humans seat seven colors in the rainbow,

176
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:13.840
<v 0>in the, in the case of the dog, very different rainbow, uh,</v>

177
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:17.580
it's gonna start off blue. He'll be able to see blue just fine.

178
00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.260
<v 4>So what was he a rainbow starting with blue.</v>

179
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.720
Same blue we see and then grading off into [inaudible]

180
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:27.600
<v 5>green [inaudible] same green as us and then disappearing.</v>

181
00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:29.940
He would end there

182
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.990
<v 4>with a tiny bit of yellow thrown in. That's it. Yeah.</v>

183
00:10:32.991 --> 00:10:36.350
So the rainbow be only be about half as thick as ours. Wow.

184
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.660
It's a sucky rainbow dog. Yeah.

185
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:43.100
That's why when God promised that he would never deliver another day lose,

186
00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.500
he gave a paper. I made the promise in the rainbow.

187
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:47.720
The dogs just for totally unimpressed.

188
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.910
And what is it about the dog I that makes it see this way it doesn't have red

189
00:10:52.911 --> 00:10:56.150
sensitive photo receptors. No red sensitive cones.

190
00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:00.200
The weird thing is that the difference between dogs and us cone wise is just

191
00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:03.170
one. They have cones tuned to blue and green. So do we.

192
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:08.300
But we have this one extra red, which doesn't really seem like a big difference.

193
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.900
I mean it's just one cone, but I have three.

194
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.600
It's so much better than two. That's j knights vision scientist.

195
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.010
Because of this kind of multiplicative thing.

196
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.580
Red Can get mixed with blue chinks, purple

197
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:28.550
<v 6>or red can get mixed with yellow to make orange and green to match with Blue</v>

198
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:30.183
Teal or turquoise.

199
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.810
That's how we get about a hundred different shades of color that we can see.

200
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:40.400
<v 4>So by adding one photo pigment, instead of adding just one more color,</v>

201
00:11:40.401 --> 00:11:44.120
you actually add about 98 colors or so. All right, let's move on.

202
00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:47.120
So now we have a CHRO. Unless you'd like to change the bird.

203
00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.520
Well the cro is not so interesting cause it's pretty much like us.

204
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:54.550
So let's take a look. Psycho off something like a um, a sparrow, right?

205
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.190
Cause sparrows have ultraviolet vision. What do they see?

206
00:11:57.191 --> 00:12:01.780
So they see the rainbow starts before our rainbow starts where we used to see

207
00:12:01.781 --> 00:12:03.820
sky, it would see an ultraviolet color,

208
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:10.540
<v 6>then it would see the wild greens</v>

209
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.410
and the oranges.

210
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.620
And then the red and probably would see further into the red has because they

211
00:12:19.621 --> 00:12:24.330
have a more red sensitive red receptor than we have.

212
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.700
So we see a much broader rainbow. Let's start earlier and it would end later.

213
00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:32.763
<v 2>Woo.</v>

214
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.780
<v 4>So should we assume that we've now that this bow is the champion,</v>

215
00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:39.640
that that's the, that's, that's as high as it gets.

216
00:12:39.641 --> 00:12:42.060
If you're talking about Virta, Brits,

217
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.670
[inaudible] thing that has a heart and the mind and a,

218
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.070
once you leave the vertebrates, then all bets are off.

219
00:12:48.071 --> 00:12:51.850
You've got many animals have much better color vision than the vertebrates.

220
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:54.400
Like what butterflies are a great example.

221
00:12:54.401 --> 00:12:57.460
Butterflies have five or six kinds of rays of color receptors.

222
00:12:57.461 --> 00:13:01.930
We only have three. Remember butterflies see more colors than we do.

223
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.080
Yeah. So if a butterfly, we're looking at a rainbow

224
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.480
here. Well they do, I'm sure.

225
00:13:10.481 --> 00:13:13.510
I mean butterflies are out there and when the game was wrapped, but it was,

226
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:13.931
he colors,

227
00:13:13.931 --> 00:13:17.470
we have no names for between the blues and the Greens and the Greens and the

228
00:13:17.471 --> 00:13:21.040
yellows. Woo. So it would go from ultraviolet. It would,

229
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:22.170
<v 6>yep.</v>

230
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:27.160
And it would see violet and then blue and then blue,

231
00:13:27.161 --> 00:13:31.750
blue, green, Yup. And Green, green, blue, blue e or whatever.

232
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:34.030
Right. And then orange and red and all that.

233
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.513
<v 2>Yup.</v>

234
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:42.150
<v 4>Very complicated eyes, Huh. Okay. So just to recap, all right, here's the dog.</v>

235
00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:43.800
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

236
00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.670
<v 4>here's US human</v>

237
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.680
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

238
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:51.040
<v 4>Now the sparrow, more based, little bit more high end,</v>

239
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.530
so to speak. And finally the butterfly

240
00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.010
<v 2>[inaudible] which</v>

241
00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:59.220
<v 4>is, you know, not so far above the sparrow, but it's got more mids in there.</v>

242
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.560
So I'm now thinking butterfly butterflies get the crown. Yeah, but then you,

243
00:14:03.561 --> 00:14:04.890
if you go under coral reefs,

244
00:14:04.891 --> 00:14:08.250
you come across these animals called mantis shrimps. What are they called?

245
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:11.910
Metta. Like Mantis, like a praying mantis. Oh, mantis shrimp.

246
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.750
The trim catches pray using an arm, like a praying. Medis says, Oh, oh,

247
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.590
I've managed shrimps. Or are mostly pretty small about the size of a finger.

248
00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.860
Some get to be as big as your forearm break. Big Animals.

249
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.330
I'm actually looking this up right here. Oh. Oh my God.

250
00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.630
They're so colorful. No, they are colorful though. You're here. Look at this.

251
00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.420
Oh my God. They're just like a,

252
00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:36.270
it's like they're electric colored like turquoise or something.

253
00:14:36.271 --> 00:14:40.440
Iridescent in their eyes are like little cartoon eyes. They're gigantic. Yeah,

254
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:42.870
they have two really big eyes right on the front.

255
00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.690
And you said that dogs have two cones. We have three.

256
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.670
How much does the butterfly have? Again, butterfly has five,

257
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:52.190
depends on the butterfly. A managed have 16

258
00:14:55.670 --> 00:15:00.050
1616 kinds of receptors. What would the rainbow look like to them mean?

259
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:01.220
Could they even see it matter? Sure,

260
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:04.480
but see the rainbow fine cause they live in very shallow water and so the water

261
00:15:04.481 --> 00:15:07.850
is pretty clear. Almost like air. They would start the rainbow way, way,

262
00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:10.120
way inside. Where we see violet, they would see

263
00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.570
<v 6>then they would go on through several kinds of ultraviolet,</v>

264
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:22.220
probably five or six kinds of ultraviolet and then we get to violet which,

265
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:27.220
which is another reaching our colors and go through violet and violet blue and

266
00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.820
blue and blue green

267
00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.610
<v 4>where they have those green, green, blue, blue blues as well.</v>

268
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:38.000
<v 2>[inaudible] and then they would go out into the rent. So they would be about it.</v>

269
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:41.180
But that has red as us when they got to the red. But only in the red. Yeah.

270
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.790
<v 4>What a rainbow that must be. Yeah.</v>

271
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:54.900
They have the most complicated visual system of any animals by a factor of two

272
00:15:54.901 --> 00:15:56.970
or more. Wait, wait, maybe he said any,

273
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.510
do you mean you mean did you mean that unequivocally? Any, yeah.

274
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:04.550
No other animal that we know of has a visual system within 50% as complicated.

275
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.150
All right. Mantis

276
00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:11.953
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

277
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.440
<v 6>Okay. You know, on the other hand, their brains are tiny,</v>

278
00:16:16.441 --> 00:16:21.441
so who knows what and too they may not have the ability to perceive the beauty

279
00:16:21.601 --> 00:16:24.630
of the rainbow in the way. No, I don't. I don't know. They're there.

280
00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.930
Venice from surf into violence and how they will be interviewed.

281
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.790
<v 4>They go around and kill things. That's, I mean really that's what they do.</v>

282
00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:33.610
That's, that's one reason there is so fascinating is how,

283
00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:37.790
how would they have to go around and kill things? What are the shells? Crabs,

284
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.870
other managed shrimps. Shrimps. Octopuses. They'll kill octopuses. Yeah.

285
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.470
Small ones. A good size.

286
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:47.390
Managed shrimp will can break the wall of an aquarium where really? Yeah,

287
00:16:47.391 --> 00:16:47.781
there's a,

288
00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:51.380
there's ones in California that can break aquarium walls if they hit it hard.

289
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.050
Oh my gosh. So you have a pug dishes.

290
00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:58.790
Mohammed Elise seagoing animal with incredibly great visual sense.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.050
the Grease Church Curl Society and those folks from the collegiate corral them

296
00:17:30.051 --> 00:17:34.280
Odessa choirs who joined us and to Alex Ambrosio WQXR for getting everybody

297
00:17:34.281 --> 00:17:36.050
together. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

298
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.793
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

299
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:50.220
Okay. A very quick

300
00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:52.710
<v 7>update since we aired this broadcast,</v>

301
00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:55.830
the mystery of the Mantis shrimp,

302
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.920
I has just gotten deeper. As we mentioned,

303
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.160
they don't seem to gaze at sunsets or rainbows.

304
00:18:02.161 --> 00:18:06.000
We now think that maybe they use colors as kind of triggers for particular

305
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:10.980
actions. One color says fight and other color. They eat other colors as sex.

306
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.200
They'd still have the best eyes in the world,

307
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:18.240
but what they're doing with those eyes is a bigger mystery now than ever.
