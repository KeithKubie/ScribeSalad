MALE SPEAKER: I'm just
going to quickly introduce

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.090
Michael Taft to my right--
I guess to your left.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.300
Michael's been working
with us for a few years.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.996
He's been doing detachment days.

00:00:12.996 --> 00:00:15.120
And he's also done some
training for our volunteers

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.070
in the gPause program.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.850
And it's really great
to have him here

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.480
to talk about his new book.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.100
But before that,
he will be leading

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.690
a 20-minute guided meditation.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.470
And so with that, I'd like
to turn it over to Michael.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.830
MICHAEL TAFT: Good morning.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.299
Let's just start by meditating.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.430
We're going to dig right in.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.658
So if you're ready, let's go.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.940
Begin by finding
your meditation seat

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.830
and settling into a
comfortable posture.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.480
And as you do that,
already allow awareness

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.140
to contact the body sensations
associated with sitting.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.620
So feel, for example,
your butt and thighs

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.090
touching the chair, and really
tune into that sensation

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.630
as clearly as you can.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.525
Feel your feet on the floor.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.840
You might feel you're back
on the back of the chair,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.340
if you're sitting in a chair.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.180
And in whatever
other way, just tune

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.805
into these basic
sensations of sitting.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.721
And just sort of
yourself to arrive.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.710
Next, sit up straight,
allowing your spine

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.770
to extend upwards
towards the ceiling,

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.410
allowing awareness to contact
the body sensations up and down

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.960
the spinal column, feeling
yourself coming to attention,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.330
feeling your back and neck
coming into alignment,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.030
and noticing, perhaps,
a background sense

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.070
of brightness or
wakefulness that

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.025
comes into awareness
when you do that.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.970
Good.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.050
Now just invite your
entire body to relax.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.280
Allow yourself to
release tension,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.460
to let go of any tightness,
and to just open and soften,

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.050
generally.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.880
And as you're doing
that, allow awareness

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.590
to contact any sensations
of relaxation or opening

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.390
or softening that's happening
anywhere in your body

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.770
so that you're really
directly contacting

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.760
sensations of relaxation.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.610
So, for example, allow
the muscles of your face

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:25.980
to release and relax and let go,
releasing any frozen mask you

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.310
have on and allowing your
face to become supple and soft

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.130
and relaxed.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.310
And as that's occurring,
just tune into those feelings

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.820
of relaxation.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.070
Feel the muscles of your face
gentling and softening, maybe

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.150
becoming pleasantly neutral.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.941
And allow that pleasant, relaxed
sensation to impact awareness.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.490
And next, relax your
neck and shoulders.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.010
Allow your shoulders
to just kind

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.250
of float down and
your neck to release

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.410
and your throat to open.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.839
And again, while
that's happening,

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:23.920
point your awareness at the
muscles that are relaxing

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.980
and actually tune into
those feelings, those body

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.750
sensations of release and those
body sensations of opening.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.260
And if there's something
that's painful or tight

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.150
or doesn't want to relax,
don't fight with it.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.860
Just let that be the way it is
and find some other part that

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.090
is gentler or softer or
more open and focus on that.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.650
Good.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.330
Next, let go of any
sense that you're

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.200
going to use your arms
or hands for anything

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.810
and just allow them to come
to a complete, total repose.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.680
And then just open up and relax
your upper arms and your elbows

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.450
and your forearms and
your wrists and hands.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.510
And just feel those muscles
lengthening and loosening

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.830
and notice, if you can,
how that feels good.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.900
And allow that good feeling
to really impact awareness

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.436
so that you're feeling
it deeply in your body.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.860
Next, relax your
belly, letting go

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.820
of any tightness, any armoring,
any tension in the belly,

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:51.080
and just allowing it to
be fully, fully relaxed,

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.940
fully open.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.940
Just let the belly flop out.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.840
And notice as you do
that, that it allows you

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.960
to breathe much more deeply.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.090
There's much more room in
your abdomen for breath.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.790
And allow awareness to
contact the body sensations

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:15.440
of your abdomen
relaxing and opening,

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.000
your belly softening
and releasing

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.710
tightness an
armoredness and tension.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.295
And just feel how
good that feels.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.273
Allow that to really
enter awareness.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.140
And next, just like you did
with your arms and hands,

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.280
allow your legs and feet
to let go of any sense

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.290
that you're going to
do anything with them.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.960
Allow them to just
release and relax

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.886
and let go and come
to a complete stop.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.990
And then, as you notice
that relaxation beginning

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.330
in your legs and feet,
tune in and allow

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:05.110
that to be the focus
of your awareness.

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.830
And allow the releasing of
those muscles and the gentling

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.460
down of the legs and feet to
be something that really fills

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.160
your mind so that you're
actually down in the limbs

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.405
with awareness, feeling
them relax and let go.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.320
Good.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.500
Now just zoom out
and allow awareness

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.120
to cover your entire body.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.440
And just, once again, invite
your entire body to relax.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:41.960
And any place that feels relaxed
and open, just tune into that

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.460
and feel it as
clearly as you can.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.880
You may notice
that you're having

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:49.550
mental pictures of that
area or you're thinking

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.910
thoughts about that area.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.080
But what you want to do
is feel that relaxed area.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.980
Feel it in your
body with your body,

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.500
and allow that good
feeling of that relaxation

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.978
to fill your awareness.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.280
Good.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:18.730
Next, we're just going to scan
the body part by part and tune

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:24.740
into not only relaxed
sensations but any sensations.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.000
So begin with your feet.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.260
Just feel your feet.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.190
You can do them one at
a time or both together.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:40.525
But feel the bottoms
of your feet,

00:08:40.525 --> 00:08:44.760
and Feel how they're touching
your socks and your shoes.

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.885
And you can actually
feel the shoes.

00:08:49.735 --> 00:08:55.300
And feel the tops of your
feet and between your toes.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.470
Feel your ankles.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.800
And just keep tuning into these
sensations of the body part

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.210
from within the body part.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.710
Allow awareness to be down
inside that body part,

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.950
feeling the sensations.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.873
Next, feel your legs.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:23.830
Allow awareness to contact
the shins and the calves,

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:31.570
even the bones in the
legs, in the lower legs.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:37.090
And just see if you can really
allow that to fill awareness,

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:41.540
exploring, in detail, all
those little sensations

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.820
in the right leg
and the left leg.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:52.040
They may be very everyday
sensations, nothing special.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.200
But they're really sensitive.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.980
There's a lot of detail
in your leg sensation.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.190
So just keep exploring it
with openness and curiosity.

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.110
If there's anything
that you don't like,

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.980
if there's pain or tension,
just allow that to be there.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.680
Just feel it.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.210
Don't fight with it.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:14.088
Let it be.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.330
And then keep feeling the rest
of the legs and the thighs

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:29.380
and the long bones
of the thighs,

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.540
this time not
relaxing on purpose,

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.180
but just allowing the
sensations in the legs

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.240
to be exactly the way they are.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.380
And see if you can
begin exploring--

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:46.200
with a lot of curiosity,
a lot of openness--

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.160
is this sensation in this leg
different than that sensation

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.005
in that leg?

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:02.450
Is any part of any sensation
changing or moving?

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.460
And what's the textural
quality of the sensations?

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.300
Really dig in and explore.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:12.980
Don't just kind of touch
base or check the box.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:18.300
Really keep your
curiosity awake and alive

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:22.406
and explore the
sensations in detail.

00:11:26.707 --> 00:11:27.207
Good.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:35.140
Next, move to your
whole pelvic region,

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:41.820
front and back, side to
side, and inside the pelvis,

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:46.300
maybe including your
leg Joints, your hips,

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.970
if you didn't include
that previously.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.780
And feel all the sensations
in the viscera there

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.160
and the muscles and the bones.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.487
There's a lot going on.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.870
And again, if you're getting
a lot of mental images

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:04.210
of that region, just let
those go and come back

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.530
to simply feeling
the pelvic region

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:12.400
from within the pelvic region,
allowing the sensations to be

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.340
any way they are, not trying
to change them or control them,

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.095
but simply feeling them deeply.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:28.690
And then move to your
lower abdomen, your belly

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.650
and your lower back.

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.120
Feel the sensations
of your belly muscles

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.140
and your back muscles
and your lower spine,

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:46.840
feeling into your viscera,
feeling the expansion

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:50.410
and contraction of the
belly and the kidney regions

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:54.810
with each breath and
just really tuning

00:12:54.810 --> 00:13:03.930
into that whole region, so
alive with sensations, so vital.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:08.270
And just notice how
the front of the belly

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:13.700
feels different than the
back of the belly region.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.905
Feel the inside of your
spine in your belly.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:31.040
Just generally explore, noticing
the quality of the sensation

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:37.380
in your stomach
and on your sides,

00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.180
just allowing it to
be any way it is.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.630
Good.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:49.300
And next, move to your
upper torso, your chest

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.560
and upper back and underarms.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.760
You might feel your
whole chest and rib cage

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.107
expanding and contracting
with each breath.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.140
You might feel your
lungs filling up with air

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:08.380
and emptying of air.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.370
You can feel the inside
of your spine up there

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.335
and all your ribs.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:19.910
There's a lot going
on, a lot of sensation,

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:23.910
very interesting sensation.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.830
Just keep exploring that.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:32.746
Just keep giving it your full
awareness, your full attention,

00:14:32.746 --> 00:14:36.150
allowing whatever sensations
are arising to arise,

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:40.150
not trying to fight
them or control them,

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:45.458
simply feeling, noticing
that you're breathing.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.720
Good.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:02.342
Next, allow awareness to
contact your arms and hands.

00:15:02.342 --> 00:15:05.340
You can get as much
detail as you want here,

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:09.690
feeling each finger
individually,

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.460
the palms of your
hands, the backs

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:22.800
of your hands, down inside
the hands and wrists exploring

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.256
your forearms-- the
bones of your forearms

00:15:27.256 --> 00:15:37.880
and the muscles on both
sides-- allowing awareness

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.330
to contact the elbows.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.380
It's a lot of sensation
in your elbows.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.270
Now normally, you
go around all day

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:51.220
just ignoring your elbow
unless it's in terrible pain.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:54.640
But even right now, just
see, if it's not in pain,

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.370
just see if you
can really explore

00:15:58.370 --> 00:16:06.061
the feeling of the
elbow on both sides,

00:16:06.061 --> 00:16:10.670
just remaining curious
and open, exploring

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:15.580
with a kind of innocence,
a kind of openness,

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:21.250
ready to find whatever's
there and greet it.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:27.275
And then move on to your upper
arms, your biceps and triceps.

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.700
Just feel those
releasing and opening.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:39.380
And notice whatever
sensations are there,

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.876
allowing that to just be.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.510
Good.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:59.455
Now feel your shoulders
and neck and throat,

00:16:59.455 --> 00:17:03.030
not particularly trying to
loosen it or relax it or open

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.790
it, but just
feeling what's there

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.099
and cultivating a real
sense of allowing,

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:12.900
a real sense of
acceptance of whatever you

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:18.329
find in your shoulders and
your neck and your throat.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:20.780
Just noticing the difference
between, for example,

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:25.119
the bony part of your neck
and the sort of openness

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:31.110
of the throat and feeling
all the muscles in between

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:33.890
or feeling into the complexity
of a shoulder joint.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.420
There's so much going on there.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:40.810
It's a lot of different
types of sensation,

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.570
especially if you
get very detailed.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:43.796
It's quite interesting.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:53.250
And next, move up to
your face and head.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.990
There's a tremendous amount
of sensation in your face,

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:59.710
so you can explore your
lips and your nose, even

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:04.740
inside your nose or inside
your mouth, your eyes

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.728
and your forehead
and your cheeks.

00:18:07.728 --> 00:18:10.460
You can feel your ears
and the back of your head,

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:17.130
and then even your jaw
muscles and jaw joint and then

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:21.270
inside your sinuses
and inside your head.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:28.980
Just feel whatever sensations
are interesting in your head,

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.550
remaining as curious
and open and as clear

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:33.672
as you possibly can.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.390
Feel into whatever
is most interesting

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:50.300
in your face and head.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.070
And just keep allowing
awareness to contact it,

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:55.960
not trying to change
it in any way,

00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.570
not wishing it were
different, but just

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:04.530
allowing it to be whatever
it is, whatever way it is,

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.540
and then allowing the
feeling of the way

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:10.700
it is to really
saturate your awareness,

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:13.700
really fill your mind so
that all your attention is

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.918
on that feeling.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:24.120
Good.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.610
Now expand the scope
of your attention

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:30.000
to cover not only your
face and head but also

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.502
your neck and shoulders,
and just feel all that.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:41.340
Whatever's interesting in those
regions, just tune into it.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:52.120
And then expand awareness
again and to cover

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:55.030
your face and your head and
your neck and your shoulders

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.090
and also your arms and hands.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.170
And again, with
curiosity and openness,

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:07.360
just directly contact whatever
sensations in the body

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.710
are interesting there.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:14.030
And then add to that your
upper chest and upper back

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:19.174
and the inside, including your
heart and lungs and so on.

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:29.520
And then add to that your belly
and the back of your belly

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.070
and your kidney
region and the inside

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:36.840
there, where your stomach
is, so that it's everything

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:42.380
from your head all the
way down to the stomach.

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.300
And just feel all that it
wants and tune into anything

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:48.380
that's interesting.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:52.770
And then add to that
your pelvic region

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:56.300
and your legs and your
feet so that now, it's

00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:02.940
your entire body, all body
sensation, right to left,

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:11.550
top to bottom, front to back,
the entire body, one unified

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:14.330
field of sensation.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:18.650
And just tune in in whatever
way to whatever's interesting.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:20.330
And just stay open.

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:21.870
Just stay relaxed.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:26.137
Stay curious, accepting
whatever you find.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.640
Good.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.180
Now you can end the
meditation and just very

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.600
slowly and gently,
open your eyes

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:48.100
and allow yourself to
move around a little bit.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.930
Thank you.
