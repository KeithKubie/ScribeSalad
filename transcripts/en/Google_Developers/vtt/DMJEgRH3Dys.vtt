TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.860
for "The Developer Show".

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.901
This is your update on
the coolest developer news

00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:07.980
from Google in the last week.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.380
Firebase Dynamic
Links are deep links

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.210
that drive user
growth and engagement

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.600
by allowing you to send users
to specific places in your app,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.210
across iOS, Android,
and the web.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.780
And now you can customize your
dynamic links in three ways--

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.300
a brand-agnostic domain, custom
subdomains, and custom paths.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.970
Take a look at the
post to get started.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.300
You can now deploy your Node.js
8 applications to App Engine

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.440
standard environment.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.310
This support brings
a number of benefits,

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.880
including fast deployments
and automatic scaling,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.750
idiomatic developer experience,
and strong security.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.160
Get started with the links
and the video on the post.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.770
Cloud Dataflow Streaming Engine
moves pipeline execution out

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.630
of the worker VMs and into the
Cloud Dataflow service backend.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.830
And it is now available in beta.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.370
This leads to
several improvements,

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.940
which are detailed on the post.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.180
Partner Interconnect lets you
connect your on-prem resources

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.519
to Google Cloud Platform
from the partner

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.740
location of your
choice at a data

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.330
rate that meets your needs.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.080
And now, it's
generally available,

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.160
which means you can now receive
an SLA for Partner Interconnect

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.580
connections if you use one of
the recommended topologies.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.180

a partner, bandwidth options,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.960
and pricing, head

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.050
Our 16th Google Cloud Platform
region, located in Finland,

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.840
is now open for you to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.830

00:01:49.732 --> 00:01:51.754
