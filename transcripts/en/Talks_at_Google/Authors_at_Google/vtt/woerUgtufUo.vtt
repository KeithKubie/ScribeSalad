00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.480
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So it's my great pleasure
to introduce one of the deepest and most prolific

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.480
economists.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.950
Joe Stiglitz.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:14.100
Joe is a superb academic who has extensively
applied his expertise in the political sphere.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.280
As well as in the journals.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.080
Joe is famous for studies of the affects of
asymmetric information.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.660
For which he won the Nobel Prize in 2001.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.710
He's one of the earliest to apply game theoretic
reasoning for studying policy issues.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.350
His work revolutionized the study of credit
markets, insurance, development, and the theory

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.329
of the firm, where he is responsible for the
concept of efficiency wages.

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.210
You should all like efficiency wages.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.660
That's what gets us paid more than the competition.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.850
He served in the Clinton Administration as
the Chair of the President's Council on Economic

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:53.850
Advisers.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.780
He also served as Chief Economist of the World
Bank where he's noted for criticizing the

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.789
World Bank.

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:00.789
[laughter]

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:08.789
He's a co-author of the inter-governmental
panel on climate change.

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:14.119
More recently he's, Joe Stiglitz has been
advising Obama but has also been sharply critical

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:21.279
of the Obama Administration's financial industry
rescue plan.

00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:26.090
To give a quote, he said "Whoever designed
the bank rescue plan is either in the pocket

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.469
of the banks, or incompetent."

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:28.469
[laughter]

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.170
And I hope he will tell us which.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.170
[laughter]

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.849
Without further ado, let me introduce one
of the best economists, Joe Stiglitz.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.609
[extended applause]

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:50.780
&gt;&gt;Joe: Well, it's a real pleasure to be here
again.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:58.929
The subject of course, that I'm talking about
is not so, uh, attractive.

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.619
The topic is "The price of inequality.

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.919
How today's divided society endangers our
future."

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:10.950
The book grew out of an article that I wrote
in Vanity Fair.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.719
Vanity Fair is maybe not the usual media for
academics to publish in.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:24.480
But the Vanity Fair article did get more attention
than my 1969 Econometrica article on the same

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.480
subject.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.480
[laughter]

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.489
The title of the Vanity Fair article went
viral.

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.709
Was "Of the One Percent, By the One Percent,
For the One Percent."

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.420
And you can sort of get the tone of the article.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:52.660
And it got picked up by a part of the chant
of the Occupy Wall Street.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.680
The issues that I'm talking about are not
the politics of envy as one of the political

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.340
candidates has said.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.749
One of the political candidates has said "You
shouldn't be talking about inequality except

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.790
to quiet rooms in hushed tones."

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.540
But in fact, I believe that inequality is
one of the most important problems our society

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.980
faces today.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.370
And needs to be talked about actually quite
loudly.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:27.430
What most Americans do not realize is that
quietly without people noticing it, America

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.170
has become the advanced industrial country
with the highest level of inequality.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.969
And we were already at, had that distinction
a number of years ago.

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:44.569
But while other countries have worked hard
to contain the inequality, to slow the increase.

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:52.629
In recent years the level of inequality in
the United States has been increasing markedly.

00:03:52.629 --> 00:04:00.420
Just a couple examples, the share of income
that accrues to the upper one percent has

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:07.599
doubled from 10 percent in 1980 to 20 percent
today.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:15.620
The, there are a number of other statistics
that describe the degree of inequality.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:22.660
Perhaps one, two, I think that maybe I should
mention in the beginning here.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.760
One of them is that Americans like to think
of our country as a land of opportunity.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.590
It really defines part of the American identity.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:39.340
But in fact, that notion that America is a
land of opportunity is really a myth.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.680
Now we all know people who've made it from
the bottom to the top, middle to the top.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.090
Immigrants who come to the United States and
succeeded.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.820
But from the point of view of the economist,
what's relevant is the statistics.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.270
Not the examples, not the exceptions, but
what happens on average.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:07.139
And on average, America is less equal even
than old Europe, let alone any of the other

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.460
advanced industrial counties for which there's
data.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.460
What does that mean?

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:19.960
It means that the life prospects of a young
kid in the United States is more dependent

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.710
on the education and income of his parents
than in any other country.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.259
And you can see, it gets reflected in a number
of aspects.

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:35.340
Both in terms of movement, up, but also movement
down.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:43.449
People at the top who don't do very, whose
children don't do very well in school, wind

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:48.460
up with higher income than people from the
bottom and middle whose children do very well

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.580
in school.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:57.460
So it really shows the influence of parents
in determining opportunity in the United States.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:08.560
Some of you may have seen the article that
appeared yesterday reflecting the outcome

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:15.580
results of the Fed's survey of wealth and
income in the United States.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.790
The most recent one.

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.670
And it was very, very telling.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:26.580
You know, it would be one thing if all that
success at the top benefited everybody.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.280
And the idea that that was so is called 'trickle
down' economics.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.710
You know, you throw enough money at the top,
and everybody benefits.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.970
The evidence is to the contrary.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:46.181
That while the top has done very well, the
median, people 50 percent below, 50 percent

00:06:46.181 --> 00:06:47.539
above.

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:54.849
Median income in the United States today is
lower than it was a decade and a half ago.

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:59.940
And what's been happening to wealth is even
more troubling.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.919
The top one percent controls about 40 percent
of all the wealth.

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:11.389
But the recession was really, really bad for
most Americans in terms, not only in terms

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:16.270
of income, but even more so in terms of wealth.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.069
Not a surprise.

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:25.470
But with people at the bottom and middle putting
all their wealth into the homes, when the

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:31.870
home prices went down, on average over 30
percent, in some areas over 50 percent, they

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:38.020
lost a very large fraction of their wealth.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:44.949
So in fact, the wealth, particularly of the
middle, and the bottom, is now back to where

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:47.270
it was over two decades ago.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:52.169
No increase in wealth over two decades.

00:07:52.169 --> 00:08:02.400
The, in the recovery from the crisis in 2010,
we got another picture of the degree of inequality

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.919
in our society.

00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:11.110
93 percent of the growth that occurred in
2010 went to the upper one percent.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:22.420
So again, most Americans are not sharing in
what's going on.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:33.340
It would be one thing, as I said, if the success
of those at the top income benefited everybody.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.340
But it hasn't.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:41.020
And also it would be one thing if the successes
at the top reflected their contribution to

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.100
society.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.960
This is not about envy.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.690
The question is, have they really made contributions
that are commensurate with their incomes?

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:53.760
And those of you who study elementary economics
know this is a 19th century theory called

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.900
the 'marginal productivity theory.'

00:08:55.900 --> 00:09:01.500
Well, the crisis actually gave lie to that
theory.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:12.190
We all saw in the crisis the bankers walking
off with huge bonuses even though they brought

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.630
to the global economy to the brink of ruin.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.410
Even though they brought their own company
to the brink of ruin.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:23.820
In fact, some of the banks were so embarrassed
about calling these bonuses "performance bonuses"

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.480
that they changed the name to "retention bonuses".

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.940
There was no "performance" so they had to
have another name.

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:35.970
But then the question was "Why would you wanna
retain somebody who had messed up your company

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:42.070
so badly?" and all this actually speaks to
one of the key issues that I raise in the

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:43.070
book.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.280
What is the true source of wealth?

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.230
Of those say, at the top?

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:53.880
If you look at the list of people at the top,
it doesn't include the great innovators.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.150
You know the people who invented the computer,
Turing.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:03.040
It doesn't include the people who invented
the transistor.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.040
The laser.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.040
That discovered DNA.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.100
None of these people who really made important
contributions to our society are in that list

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:14.260
of the wealthiest in our society.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:20.260
It's basically with the argument I have is,
a very large proportion of these are people

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.230
that economists call "rent seekers."

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.530
Let me try to explain what the concept of
rent-seeking is.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:26.980
You can see it in a couple ways.

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.330
There are two ways to create wealth.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.650
To get wealth.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:34.140
One of them is to make the size of the national
pie larger.

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.450
And to get a share of that increase.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:42.080
The other one is to try to seize a larger
share of the existing pie.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.590
And that's what rent seekers do.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:49.710
And in that process they actually make the
pie smaller.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.500
So an example are monopolists.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.650
How do monopolists make their profits?

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.270
Partly by restricting output.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:11:00.180
They're making the output actually smaller
than it otherwise would be.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:07.730
And yet that can generate large, large incomes
for themselves.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:15.480
So if you look at the disproportionate people
at the top, they are in this group of what

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.190
economists will call rent seekers.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.910
Let me give you a couple other examples.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:27.520
When the bankers engage in predatory lending,
or abusive credit card practices, what they're

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.000
doing is moving money.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.250
They're not creating value.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:35.350
What they're doing is taking money from poor
Americans, financially unsophisticated Americans

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:38.300
and moving it from the bottom to the top.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.550
That doesn't create wealth.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.640
It actually in some sense destroys wealth.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.930
Why does it destroy wealth?

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:51.350
Well, one of the most important resources
of any society are their human talent.

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.270
The young people.

00:11:53.270 --> 00:12:00.410
And when you devote those people to this task
of moving money from the poor people.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.600
Through predatory lending.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:07.360
You misallocating your scarcest human resource.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:13.160
So it's not a surprise, and this is really
one of the most important points of the book.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:20.670
It's not a surprise that economies in which
the divide is larger, when the inequality

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.960
is larger, grow more slowly.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:29.220
You see that in the history of the United
States and the period in the decades after

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.180
World War II.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.170
We had just fought a war together.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:37.080
And there was a sense of national cohesiveness.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:42.780
We passed laws like the GI Bill, that provided
education for all.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:48.160
The result of that was our economy went through
the most rapid period of economic growth and

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.720
it was a period in which every part of our
economy grew.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.550
Those at the bottom grew most rapidly.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:58.480
So that the divide between the top and the
bottom got reduced.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:05.170
Since 1980 what has happened is growth has
slowed.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:07.820
And the divide has grown.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:09.110
And that's not an accident.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:13.880
And one of the things I try to do in the book
is to try to explain why there is this negative

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.550
correlation between inequality and growth.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:21.220
Why inequality is bad for economic growth.

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:25.240
And there are a couple factors that help explain
it.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.850
One of them is, this phenomena of rent-seeking
that I just described.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:36.820
That resources got misallocated to seeking
rents, rather than to producing increasing

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:37.820
value.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.120
And there are a whole list of the kinds of
rent-seeking activities.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:48.510
When the drug companies spend money to persuade
congress to give them a drug, to pass a law

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:53.870
that says "The us government, while it's the
largest purchaser of drugs, cannot bargain

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:59.720
with the drug companies, the result of which
gives the drug companies a gift over 10 years

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.370
of a half a trillion dollars.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:05.930
Money that could go into making our economy
more productive.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:12.220
That's rent-seeking activity that does not
lead to a stronger economy.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:19.080
When we have a tax law again, as a result
of lobbying, that says that speculators should

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:26.790
be taxed at less than half a rate, the rate
that those who work for a living.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:30.940
Because the special provisions capital gains,
we're destroying our economy.

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.810
More resources move into speculation.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.310
Less into creative activity.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:38.500
And again, our economy is weaker.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.280
It's also of course, not fair.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:46.680
And it's one of the reasons that the top one
percent pays an average tax rate of 15 percent.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:52.620
Which is much less than those whose income
is substantially lower.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:58.170
There are other reasons that inequality is
bad for our economy.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:05.490
For an economy to work well, there needs to
be a basic level of public spending on basic,

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.790
on what you might call the common good.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:14.010
You have to have investments in education,
public education.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:18.750
One of the reasons why we've become a less
equal society is that we are not investing

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:21.530
as much in public education.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:26.940
People in California know that access to the
university is becoming much less restricted.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.780
And it's not as open as it was 30 years ago.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:35.610
And these are things that mean that many young
people are not gonna live up to their potential.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:37.740
And again a waste of resources.

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.700
You need to invest in technology.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.860
Google.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:54.050
A lot of the most important innovations of
the recent decades are based on government

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:55.540
funded research.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.820
The internet was supported by government funded
research.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:05.720
We've been living off, draining the well,
of ideas that basic research helped support.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.110
But we haven't been refilling the well.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:10.550
And that requires government support.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:11.700
National Science Foundation.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.700
NIH.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.700
All kinds of things.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:14.700
We've underfunded those.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.360
And finally you need infrastructure.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:24.290
Any of you who've come into Kennedy Airport
know that America has been under investing

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.290
in our infrastructure.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:30.800
A comparison between US airports and those
in Asia is embarrassing.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.410
But you need ports and roads if you're gonna
export.

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:36.520
If you're gonna grow.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:37.520
So.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.830
We've not been investing in these things.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:43.860
And one of the reasons we haven't, is when
you have a divided society, those at the top

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:50.560
worry that if you have too strong of a government,
it might use its powers to redistribute.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:55.040
So they'd rather have a weak government that
can't do anything.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.190
That's tied up.

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.570
That's gridlocked.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:02.280
Than a government that might engage in redistribution.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.259
I'll come back to that in the end.

00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:13.490
But the point of all these are just, some
of the mechanisms by which inequality leads

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:16.069
to poorer economic performance.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:22.879
There's one more final one I want to mention
that's gotten a lot of attention more recently.

00:17:22.879 --> 00:17:28.769
It's not a surprise that the last time inequality
reached the kind of level that it's reached

00:17:28.769 --> 00:17:34.379
more recently in the United States was during
the "roaring '20s."

00:17:34.379 --> 00:17:36.500
Right before the Great Depression.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:42.559
And the IMF, the UN Commission, that investigated
the global financial crisis.

00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:49.809
Other scholars have come to the consensus
that inequality is systematically associated

00:17:49.809 --> 00:17:51.250
with instability.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.649
We have time later in the question period.

00:17:52.649 --> 00:17:55.549
I can try to go through the mechanism by which
that happens.

00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:59.350
But it is a regularity.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:10.070
And so one way of thinking about it is, when
you move money, people at the top save a larger

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.600
fraction of their income than people at the
bottom.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.980
So you move money from the bottom to the top,
there's a lack of demand.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:21.481
Or there would be a lack of demand unless
something is done about it.

00:18:21.481 --> 00:18:24.919
And what the Fed did about it was to create
a bubble.

00:18:24.919 --> 00:18:26.429
[chuckles] And it worked.

00:18:26.429 --> 00:18:27.950
For a while.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.169
But it put our economy in jeopardy.

00:18:30.169 --> 00:18:36.559
And this has happened not only this time,
but it's happened on other occasions.

00:18:36.559 --> 00:18:46.600
So all of these are reasons why greater inequality
is associated with weaker economic performance.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:52.700
And that's really one of the main themes of
the book, of "The Price of Inequality."

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.779
We're paying a high price for this inequality.

00:18:56.779 --> 00:19:03.769
This is a markedly different perspective than
that taken by those on the right.

00:19:03.769 --> 00:19:08.470
Those on the right say "We understand you
don't like inequality.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:11.960
We wish we could get rid of inequality.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:16.370
But we can't without paying a very high price."

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:19.100
Now old textbooks used to talk about a tradeoff.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:25.740
You can get lower inequality but at the cost
of, lower growth, less economic efficiency.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:27.179
There's a tradeoff.

00:19:27.179 --> 00:19:34.360
So that what they said in fact was that the
price that you, not only the top would pay,

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:40.240
but everybody would have to pay if we try
to reduce the degree of inequality is just

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.539
too high.

00:19:41.539 --> 00:19:46.390
What my book argues is quite the contrary.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:51.950
That in fact, we are paying a price for not
attacking inequality.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:20:01.039
That we could have, as I say, a stronger economy
and a more equal society.

00:20:01.039 --> 00:20:07.640
One of the concerns I have is that this inequality
then starts to affect not only our economy

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.640
but our democracy, our system of justice.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.640
Budget battles.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.249
The conduct of macroeconomic policy.

00:20:14.249 --> 00:20:22.529
I'll try to explain it in a few minutes how
inequality has this kind of pervasive affect

00:20:22.529 --> 00:20:24.820
on our society.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:32.380
Before that I wanna discuss a puzzle that
arises in political science.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.610
In political theory.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:36.750
We're supposed to have a democracy.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:42.419
And in a democracy with one person, one vote,
the outcome of the democracy is supposed to

00:20:42.419 --> 00:20:44.159
reflect the middle.

00:20:44.159 --> 00:20:47.899
There's a well-developed theory that some
of you may have studied, called "the medium

00:20:47.899 --> 00:20:48.899
voter."

00:20:48.899 --> 00:20:53.610
That the medium voter, half want more spending,
half want less spending.

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:58.060
And you can go through any issue in the medium
voter theory describes, it's the person in

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:05.610
the middle that's supposed to be determining
where our polity goes.

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:12.750
But if you look at the United States, you
look at the decisions we've made in our politics,

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:16.600
it's very clear that that doesn't describe
what's going on.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:22.770
If you look at what's going on, it's better
described by a theory of one dollar, one vote,

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:25.470
than one person, one vote.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.309
And the question is, why?

00:21:27.309 --> 00:21:29.049
'cause we have a democracy.

00:21:29.049 --> 00:21:33.370
Why is the outcome so different?

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:42.530
Well, in discussing the economics and how
the economy leads to the degree of inequality

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:50.320
that we have, what I point out is that it's
not just market forces.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.519
Market forces are universal.

00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:54.889
They affect countries all over the world.

00:21:54.889 --> 00:21:59.820
But the way we shape marked forces has resulted
in the US having more inequality than any

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.690
other country.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:05.750
So laws and regulation help to shape market
forces.

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:12.940
An example, for instance, is take a bankruptcy
law.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.730
Every country has a bankruptcy law but we
are distinct.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:21.830
We have two provisions in our bankruptcy law
that is distinctive.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:22.830
Are distinctive.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:27.770
One of them is at the top, we give priority
to derivatives.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:34.249
That says that if a company goes bankrupt,
the derivatives, the CDSs are paid off before

00:22:34.249 --> 00:22:37.380
anybody else, before workers, before anybody
else.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:40.850
And we have a law like that, that encourages
derivatives.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:41.890
These speculative products.

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:47.260
Remember that AIG had a 150 billion dollar
bailout?

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:52.059
That was a result of government encouraging
this through our bankruptcy law.

00:22:52.059 --> 00:22:57.380
At the other end, this may be a sensitive
subject, but in the United States we have

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:03.269
another distinctive provision of our bankruptcy
law that students cannot discharge their loans

00:23:03.269 --> 00:23:05.750
even in bankruptcy.

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:10.460
Even if the school does not provide the education
that they promised.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:16.389
You know, in other areas of our life, companies
say, "Satisfaction guaranteed or your money

00:23:16.389 --> 00:23:18.340
back."

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:24.669
These for-profit schools say, "Satisfaction
is almost guaranteed not to occur."

00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:27.190
Because they all, dropout rates are huge.

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:31.220
But you never get your money back, and in
fact, we're gonna be on your shoulders for

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.220
the rest of your life."

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:36.350
Well that's the result of politics.

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:39.429
Of the laws that we passed that shape our
economy.

00:23:39.429 --> 00:23:47.120
That encourage people to provide education
that doesn't really serve the needs.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.570
Because they can get their money back.

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:54.029
Well, the same thing is true about politics.

00:23:54.029 --> 00:24:00.270
That the way our political system works is
shaped by the rules and regulations.

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:06.340
If you have rules and regulations that say,
for instance, affecting lobbying, campaign

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:11.909
contributions, revolving doors, they determine
the influence of the one percent.

00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:13.750
The people at the top.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:18.639
So like, the citizens united, the supreme
court decisions that will allow corporations

00:24:18.639 --> 00:24:27.990
to give unbridled spending gave more influence
to those at the top.

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:34.100
The consequence of this is that we have a
vicious circle.

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:39.409
Where economic inequality feeds into inequality
of political power.

00:24:39.409 --> 00:24:44.840
And that inequality of political power leads
to rules and regulations that lead to more

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:46.399
economic inequality.

00:24:46.399 --> 00:24:54.299
In a what I would call a downward vicious
circle.

00:24:54.299 --> 00:24:59.730
In some ways it's even worse than I've just
described because as ordinary citizens see

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:03.600
this process in work, they become disillusioned.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:09.950
They say "What good is it to vote?"

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:15.559
And you see the consequence of that in the
last election, 2010.

00:25:15.559 --> 00:25:20.470
Where 80 percent of the young people said
it wasn't worth their while to exercise their

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:24.929
democratic right to vote.

00:25:24.929 --> 00:25:25.929
That's astounding.

00:25:25.929 --> 00:25:28.240
Other countries are marching to get the right
to vote.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.690
Countries fighting to get democracy.

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:35.860
We have democracy but 80 percent of the young
people said it wasn't worth the trouble of

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:36.889
going to the poll.

00:25:36.889 --> 00:25:40.369
Because no matter who wins, wall street wins.

00:25:40.369 --> 00:25:41.950
The one percent wins.

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:46.149
And it's not gonna affect what happened.

00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:51.409
But then that itself gives more power to money.

00:25:51.409 --> 00:25:54.889
Because money then has to be used to get out
the vote.

00:25:54.889 --> 00:25:59.419
And they targeted getting out the vote to
those who will support their views.

00:25:59.419 --> 00:26:05.940
So that's one of the reasons why we've wound
up with this kind of distorted democracy that

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.119
we have.

00:26:07.119 --> 00:26:17.160
The other reason that I talk about briefly
is based on some insights from recent research

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.759
and behavioral economics.

00:26:19.759 --> 00:26:22.299
College-age marketing.

00:26:22.299 --> 00:26:27.289
Corporations have discovered that they can
market goods.

00:26:27.289 --> 00:26:30.600
Good example is for instance, the cigarette
companies.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:36.629
Were able to persuade most Americans that
there was no credible evidence that cigarettes

00:26:36.629 --> 00:26:37.759
caused cancer.

00:26:37.759 --> 00:26:40.080
Or had other ill-health effects.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.140
Even though the cigarette companies had in
their files that evidence.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:49.679
But they were very effective in casting doubt
about the nature of the scientific evidence.

00:26:49.679 --> 00:26:54.619
And people continued to smoke for several
decades after the evidence was overwhelming.

00:26:54.619 --> 00:27:02.600
Well, if you can sell toxic products you can
also sell toxic ideas.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:10.860
And the one percent has both the resources,
the tools, the techniques and the incentive

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.429
to do that.

00:27:12.429 --> 00:27:17.039
And that's again, played a very important
role in shaping our politics.

00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:23.220
And helps explain why we wound up with these
outcomes that seem so out of line with what

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:28.450
you would expect to get in a democratic society.

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:35.909
Let me talk just very briefly about three
other, two or three other manifestations of

00:27:35.909 --> 00:27:37.450
this inequality.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:41.059
Not only has it put our democracy at peril.

00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:46.610
It's also put our system of justice at peril.

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:52.460
One of the basic values I think that most
Americans take seriously is justice for all.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:57.860
You know, in the Pledge of Allegiance, we
say "Justice for all."

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:09.779
But in the recent mortgage crisis the mortgage
debacle, what we saw was not justice for all.

00:28:09.779 --> 00:28:17.019
Many Americans were thrown out of their homes
when they didn't owe anything.

00:28:17.019 --> 00:28:24.059
The banks signed an affidavit, said that they'd
looked at the record, and said that this individual

00:28:24.059 --> 00:28:26.239
owed money.

00:28:26.239 --> 00:28:28.000
But they were lying.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.210
They hadn't looked at the record.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:33.919
This was the robo-signing where they just
had so many signed thousands of these a day.

00:28:33.919 --> 00:28:34.950
They hadn't looked at the record.

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:38.110
And obviously if you haven't looked at the
record you're gonna make a lot of mistakes.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:43.200
Now the banks response is that most of the
people that they threw out of their homes

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.999
did owe money.

00:28:45.999 --> 00:28:50.309
That's like a system of justice that says
"most of the people that get capital punishment

00:28:50.309 --> 00:28:51.519
were probably guilty.

00:28:51.519 --> 00:28:55.009
They must have done something wrong."

00:28:55.009 --> 00:28:56.549
But that's not our system of justice.

00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:58.039
"Innocent until proven guilty."

00:28:58.039 --> 00:29:02.309
The burden of proof.

00:29:02.309 --> 00:29:09.739
But the fact of the matter is, after all of
this has been brought to light, not one of

00:29:09.739 --> 00:29:13.600
the people who committed this kind of perjury
to the court, over and over again.

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:20.140
Not just once, over and over again, has gone
to prison.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:24.739
There is some attempt to get financial reparations
to make up for the people who have been thrown

00:29:24.739 --> 00:29:25.911
out of their homes.

00:29:25.911 --> 00:29:30.830
But the result of this if you look and this
is just one example, we've wound up with a

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:37.500
system that is better described, not "justice
for all" but "justice for those who can afford

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:38.500
it."

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:43.840
Now take another issue that's been very big
in the United States in recent years.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:47.440
The battle over the budget.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.929
How do we bring down the deficit?

00:29:49.929 --> 00:29:56.789
And if I begin to analyze that problem, I
begin with a very simple observation.

00:29:56.789 --> 00:30:02.730
Just a little over 10 years ago, 2001, the
US had a large surplus.

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:09.160
So large that Alan Greenspan said that he
was worried.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:13.899
He was worried we were gonna pay back the
entire national debt and that would be very

00:30:13.899 --> 00:30:18.519
hard for him to conduct monetary policy with
no national debt.

00:30:18.519 --> 00:30:22.559
You know the details of how monetary policy
is conducted, is buying and selling national

00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:23.929
debt.

00:30:23.929 --> 00:30:28.919
Now you should understand that this was a
totally specious argument.

00:30:28.919 --> 00:30:32.200
And incredible that anybody took Alan Greenspan
seriously.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.269
But then he was a hero.

00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:41.659
I cannot believe that if say, in 2015, those
surpluses had persisted and we almost paid

00:30:41.659 --> 00:30:47.840
down the national debt, Alan Greenspan or
a successor could have come to Congress and

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.570
the Administration and say "You know our country
faces a real emergency.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:54.519
You need to spend more to create a debt.

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:57.379
And I know you don't wanna spend.

00:30:57.379 --> 00:31:01.830
But sacrifice, but your country in front of
anybody else.

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:03.250
Cut taxes, spend more.

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.039
Please, please."

00:31:05.039 --> 00:31:09.749
I can't believe that congress would not have
responded and relatively quickly to this national

00:31:09.749 --> 00:31:10.840
emergency.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:11.940
[laughter]

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:16.559
But somehow Alan Greenspan said "No, we can't
wait until that dire moment, we have to act

00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:20.880
in 2001 to give a tax cut to the richest Americans.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.129
Let's not look at the details of whether we
can afford it.

00:31:23.129 --> 00:31:27.859
Let's get that tax cut right on the books
as soon as we can."

00:31:27.859 --> 00:31:33.669
What that shows you was that macro-economic
policy, monetary economic policy, these independent

00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:36.940
central bankers really often have a political
agenda.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:42.450
They're not these god-like figures who are
only worrying about the details of inflation

00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:45.080
and so forth.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:51.989
But more to the point, if you understand that
just over a decade ago we had a surplus and

00:31:51.989 --> 00:31:57.480
you see the large deficits, where would a
reasonable place of beginning to get rid of

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.480
the deficits?

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:03.590
Well, to ask, how did we go from that surplus
to the deficit and let's see if we should

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.889
reverse those?

00:32:04.889 --> 00:32:08.379
And there are actually only four things.

00:32:08.379 --> 00:32:12.889
This tax cut that we couldn't afford, especially
for the top.

00:32:12.889 --> 00:32:20.440
Two very expensive wars that didn't do anything
and a military buildup beyond that.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.150
Weapons that don't work against enemies that
don't exist.

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:24.150
That's the good news.

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:25.720
That the enemies aren't there.

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.869
The Cold War is over.

00:32:26.869 --> 00:32:30.159
The Defense Department doesn't seem to know
it yet.

00:32:30.159 --> 00:32:38.159
Thirdly, a drug benefit for, I mentioned before
that we don't bargain with the drug companies.

00:32:38.159 --> 00:32:40.970
And that's a half a trillion dollar giveaway
over 10 years.

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:46.790
And finally, probably one of the most important
is, the recession.

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:48.289
And this is very important.

00:32:48.289 --> 00:32:54.220
The deficit didn't cause the recession.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:56.359
The recession caused the deficit.

00:32:56.359 --> 00:33:02.039
The best way of getting the deficit down would
be put America back to work.

00:33:02.039 --> 00:33:03.039
To create jobs.

00:33:03.039 --> 00:33:06.120
To get America functioning again.

00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:13.269
Well, if you look at the deficit reduction
commissions, a whole set of them.

00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:16.029
What you see is they don't focus on the issues
that I've just described.

00:33:16.029 --> 00:33:17.620
There are all kinds of things.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:21.539
Like, can you imagine a deficit reduction
commission that says "Let's lower the corporate

00:33:21.539 --> 00:33:22.869
income tax."

00:33:22.869 --> 00:33:26.200
Now how does that help reduce the deficit?

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.610
Now I agree, you need to reform the tax structure
to get rid of all the loopholes.

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:32.159
That's important.

00:33:32.159 --> 00:33:34.440
But, lowering the rate?

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.831
What you should be doing is saying "Let's
lower the rate on firms that invest in America

00:33:38.831 --> 00:33:41.470
and raise the rate on firms that don't invest
in America."

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:47.669
That would provide the incentive for the creation
of more jobs.

00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:55.139
Well, I want to conclude by saying, by discussing
what is it that we can do about this problem?

00:33:55.139 --> 00:34:03.669
In the last chapter I provide an economic
agenda.

00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:07.480
There are many aspects of America's inequality.

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.429
Too much wealth at the top.

00:34:09.429 --> 00:34:10.860
Too many poor people.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.440
People in poverty have increased.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.720
A hollowing out of the middle class.

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:18.610
And each of these requires its own agenda.

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:19.740
There's no magic bullet.

00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.870
There's gonna be lots of things.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:25.870
Every law and regulation like the bankruptcy
law, competition law, corporate governance

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:31.060
laws that allow CEOs to take a larger share
of the pie, of the corporations.

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:36.900
All of these things help shape the inequality
that we have in our society today.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.160
And so you can't just do one thing.

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.440
There are many things.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.640
But it's all doable.

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:44.160
It's actually not that complicated.

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:52.690
And other countries have done one or more
of the things that I describe in that agenda.

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:56.290
The problem of course, is the politics.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:35:00.600
And our political system is distorted so the
question, and it works for the one percent,

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:04.470
the question is how are we gonna reform the
politics?

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:10.930
So I end, the question, is there hope?

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:16.010
And my publisher told me that people don't
buy books if there's no hope.

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:17.220
[laughter]

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:20.040
They don't want to finish a book and be depressed.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.920
It's just not, at least part of the American
personality.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:29.700
A few years ago I think I came here and gave
a talk about my book with Linda Bilmes called

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:31.780
"The Three-Trillion-Dollar War."

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:36.980
And the book was very influential in shaping
the debate about the war.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:41.900
When people started using the, the war, they
said "the three-trillion-dollar war."

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:47.100
And it helped people understand the huge cost
of the war.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.370
We were very explicit.

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:51.900
We had underestimated the cost of the war.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:58.520
In particular the numbers that have come in
since then have shown that we were accurate.

00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:03.950
And we were right that we had underestimated
close to one out of two Americans coming back

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:07.080
from Afghanistan and Iraq are disabled.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:12.330
And that's going to cost us a trillion dollars
in the coming years to pay for their health

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:13.830
and disability payments.

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:16.820
But anyway, the point is, not that many people
bought that book.

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.250
'cause it was so depressing.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:19.250
[laughter]

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:22.680
So let me end on a note of hope.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.700
[laughter]

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:28.900
The United States has had, well, we'll get
two notes of hope.

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:33.690
If you look around the world, there are some
other countries that have looked over the

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:37.690
precipice and said, "We don't wanna go there.

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:42.890
One in particular, Brazil, had very high levels
of inequalities.

00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:48.990
And then beginning with President Cardoso,
just about 20 years ago he said "This is not

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:51.110
the direction that we wanna go."

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:53.400
And there was a broad consensus in the society.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.840
Including the one percent.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:59.790
They understood it was in their enlightened
self interest to do something about this.

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:04.030
Otherwise their whole society was gonna fall
apart.

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:10.990
And the result of that was a successful program
of bringing up education.

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:17.210
And then President Lula had a program to make
sure there was , that the problems of hunger

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:25.040
or the problems of access to health care for
poor children was addressed.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:32.440
And remarkably, in 20 years, you can see that
Brazil is bringing down the level of inequality.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.730
It's been working.

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:39.370
So and today you go visit Brazil, and there
already is across the spectrum, from business

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:46.290
people to unions, a consensus about the direction
their economy, their society, should be going.

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:52.790
In the United States, we've reached high levels
of inequality a couple of other times.

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:54.400
The Gilded Age.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.410
The Roaring '20s.

00:37:55.410 --> 00:38:00.170
Each time we looked over the precipice and
we said "That's not the direction we wanna

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:01.170
go."

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:04.180
The Gilded Age was followed by the Progressive
era.

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:07.000
Legislation like anti-trust legislation.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.540
The Roaring '20s was followed by a whole set
of legislation.

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:12.210
The Wagner act.

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:14.010
Social security.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:17.220
Laws about hours and working conditions.

00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:21.940
That really served to re-balance our society.

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:24.580
Reduce the level of inequality.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:31.760
And the question today is, will Americans
wake up to the degree of inequality and the

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.650
lack of equality of opportunity that we have
today?

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:37.620
And will they pull back from the brink?

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:41.010
And the hope of this book is that they will.

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:42.880
Thank you.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.750
[applause]

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:51.490
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Let's talk about your vanity fair
article, 'cause that actually made sense to

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:52.740
me.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:39:01.990
So your story is that it's in the interest
of the one percent to preserve a stable economy.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:05.760
So I wanna question some of the statements
you made in this talk.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:13.590
I looked at the numbers for when inequality
went down and one time was between '29 and

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:14.790
'33.

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:15.810
Because the stock market collapsed.

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:18.240
And the real estate market collapsed.

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:23.660
And we poor homeless folk, we don't own any
real estate, so it didn't hurt us any.

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:31.220
And another time it, the inequality level
decreased was between fall 2008 and spring

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.220
2009.

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:33.560
And that was the same situation.

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:36.040
Poor people didn't have any money in the first
place.

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.230
Rich people lost all their money they had
in stocks and real estate.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:46.270
So what makes the equality gap go down, is
actually having an economic collapse.

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:51.370
If I was in the one percent, I don't happen
to be, but if I was, I would really wanna

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:52.370
avoid that.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:56.920
I would thank people like Roosevelt who restored
capitalism.

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:59.640
And Obama who restored capitalism again.

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:04.560
So how do we help the one percent avoid losing
all their money?

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:10.740
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Well, let me just make an important
reflection on the observation you made.

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:18.010
Which is, because there are all these fluctuations
because of cyclical disturbances that's why

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:22.960
we need to look at inequality over longer
periods of time.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.730
But 10, 20 years is a longer period of time.

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:34.190
And therefore the recent data that I began
my talk with where 20 years of wealth accumulation

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:35.430
had been wiped out.

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:36.430
That's significant.

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:37.490
It's not just three years.

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:41.540
It's 20 years of wealth accumulation.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:47.840
When I said that the median income adjusted
for inflation is lower than it was 15 years

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.810
ago, that's a long period of time.

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:56.760
If you ask the question, what's happened to
the median income of a full-time male worker?

00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:02.440
It's lower today than it was in 1968, almost,
more than four decades ago.

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.040
These are not just cyclical fluctuations.

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.600
And really speak to the--

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:09.350
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Sorry, but that's not true either.

00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:10.480
You're just looking at the United States.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.050
If you look at the world wide.

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:15.400
People in China are just a lot better off
than they are now.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:19.150
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Oh, I was talking about inequality
in the United States.

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:20.150
There are other countries.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:23.430
I mentioned Brazil where things are getting
better.

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:29.210
Poverty is, the interesting thing in China
is that poverty has gone down remarkably but

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:31.300
inequality is going up.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:36.940
And that shows you that there are many dimensions
to the distribution of income.

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:39.230
But I should get the next person.

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:40.230
Yeah.

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:43.200
&gt;&gt;Male #2: thanks for your book.

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.200
And for your talk.

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:49.660
I have a question about the marketing and
propaganda basically, and I mean that in a

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:52.340
positive way, about ideas.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:58.220
It seems that republicans do a much much better
job pedaling their version of the world to

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:01.350
all of us than people who are democrats.

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:03.610
And I'll cite two examples.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:08.790
One of them is this phrase "death tax" that
was created by Frank Lunz and all of his focus

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:10.490
group testing.

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:12.240
The Cope brothers, etcetera, etcetera.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:15.440
They wanted to eliminate the estate tax.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:19.260
Well that would cause other taxes to go up
and other bad effects.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:24.540
So they had to find a way to market that to
the 99 point nine percent people who aren't

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.620
really affected by the inheritance tax.

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.860
Or aren’t affected very much, I should say.

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:32.180
So they came up with this idea of "death tax"
and they made a big joke about it.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:34.400
"Even when we are dying, there are taxes."

00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:39.070
Another one, you were one KQED forum and you
had a gentleman yesterday who called in and

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:43.520
he talked about how half of Americans don't
pay any taxes.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:49.320
Which is this meme that's been repeated and
repeated and repeated on talk radio and on

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.430
TV.

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:55.630
So these are two examples where Republicans
have found a way to reduce the complexity

00:42:55.630 --> 00:43:00.710
of economics and all of this in a way that
really makes an impact on politics.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:06.430
And I wonder if there's some organizations
that are doing it in a way that's consistent

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:08.870
with what you write in your book.

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:11.580
And, which is consistent with my economic
values.

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:13.940
I agree, the way that we're headed is not
good.

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:15.570
Even for people at the top one percent.

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:17.480
We're all gonna suffer from this.

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.820
We're suffering now.

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:24.300
So do you agree with my idea that we're kind
of losing, we're winning the economics battle,

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.080
we've got the economics right, but we're losing
the propaganda battle.

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.080
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Yeah.

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.590
&gt;&gt;Male #2: And what can we do about it?

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:32.770
And if I had some money to donate to it, where
should I donate?

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:38.820
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Well, I agree that this is in some
ways the key issue.

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:45.670
I suppose, I mean, and it's one of the reasons
I wrote the book because I wanted to try to

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:51.830
crystallize some of the arguments that are
wrong in the you might say, the conservative

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:54.720
interpretation of inequality.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:44:00.880
So I suppose if you're willing to do something,
I would say buy a lot of copies of my book

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:01.880
and give them to all your

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:02.880
[laughter]

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:06.010
Friends and neighbors.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:16.990
But [chuckles] more seriously, there are,
there is one Washington think tank that is

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:19.090
very concerned about this issue.

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:20.830
It's the Center for American Progress.

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:24.460
To how do we get across this particular message.

00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:26.070
Set of messages.

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:30.390
And in the book, I look at this example of
the "death duty".

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:31.660
And it's astounding.

00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:40.200
You know, most Americans opposed the repeal,
opposed the death duty.

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:45.750
Even though in the United States, if a married
couple will only pay the death duty if their

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:50.510
income, their wealth, their bequests, exceeds
10 million dollars.

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:56.760
Now, there aren't many Americans, certainly
not the average American, is facing this dilemma

00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:59.100
of what to do with their 10 million dollars.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:00.470
I wish it were so.

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:02.130
But they simply don't know.

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:08.240
Moreover, they've been so, a lot of these
are several myths together.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:13.420
They believe, "Oh yes, I don't have 10 million
dollars now, but we are a land of opportunity

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:19.160
and I'll become one of these guys with 10
million dollars."

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:23.790
Anything is possible, but the probability
is point zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero,

00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:24.790
one.

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:25.790
So it could happen.

00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:28.260
But it's not likely to happen.

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:35.170
So the question is, how do we give more fact
based discussion.

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:41.020
You talk about the bottom 10 percent, 15 percent
not paying taxes.

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:46.580
That ignores the fact that they pay sales
taxes, property taxes, a whole set of other

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:47.650
kinds of taxes.

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:49.690
&gt;&gt;Male #2: [inaudible] taxes.

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:53.890
&gt;&gt;Joseph: So it is really distortion of the
stories.

00:45:53.890 --> 00:46:00.380
So what I've tried to do in the book is tried
to explain at least some of those distortions

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:02.440
and what the truth about those matters are.

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:07.100
&gt;&gt;Male #2: I think that's good, but I still
think we need like two bumper sticker phrases.

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:08.100
&gt;&gt;Joseph: I agree.

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.850
But I'm not good at bumper sticker phrases.

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:10.850
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Because the book

00:46:10.850 --> 00:46:18.140
&gt;&gt;Joseph: As you've just seen from my long
talk, I'm much better at long winded answers

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:19.140
than bumper stickers.

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:22.430
&gt;&gt;Male #2: So the Center for American Progress
is a good place to go?

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:23.430
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Right.

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:24.430
They're trying very hard.

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:32.220
They've come up with a little pamphlet actually.

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:35.250
The American Middle Class, Income Inequality,
and the Strength of our Economy.

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:40.260
Where they've tried to articulate this in
simple terms.

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:41.510
But it's where they're trying to go.

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:47.360
And they're trying to get, I and people like
them are trying to get President Obama who

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:52.340
does hopefully have a knack for articulating
these things in a way that will have resonance.

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:54.910
&gt;&gt;Male #2: thank you very much.

00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:58.640
&gt;&gt;Male #3: So you mentioned wanting to leave
people with hope.

00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.970
Well I'm from Wisconsin and was recently involved
in the Recall Movement.

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:04.400
So I'm desperately in need of some hope.

00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.540
[laughter]

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:10.720
So for those who don't know in Wisconsin we
had a fairly radical anti-union governor who

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:16.089
played with various budget manipulations and
then kinda drove the state into a ditch and

00:47:16.089 --> 00:47:19.760
then blamed it on public employees.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:30.520
And in this recent recall election, the incumbent
Scott Walker's side had seven times the spending

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:35.450
on campaign materials and on advertising that
his challenger Tom Barrett did.

00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:40.320
And the majority of that came from very wealthy
out of state donors, many of whom were able

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:44.021
to remain anonymous because they didn't give
directly to his campaign but because they

00:47:44.021 --> 00:47:45.040
gave to superpacs.

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:48.210
Which are allowed by the recent Citizens United
decision.

00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:52.840
And this kinda ties in with what the previous
person was talking about.

00:47:52.840 --> 00:48:02.840
But how do we change the political system
to promote better outcomes in the economy

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:10.560
and less inequality, if there is already such
a tremendous inequality in the money that

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:12.470
goes into the political system?

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:17.930
And you have a situation, I mean, is our only
hope to rely on relatively enlightened one

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:18.930
percenters?

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:19.960
Like say Warren Buffet?

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:24.400
Who have a distaste for superpac spending?

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.400
As well they should.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.410
I mean, what is the path out of that?

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:30.830
&gt;&gt;Joseph: I think there are two that I sorta
outline in my book.

00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:36.490
One of them is that eventually enough of the
one percent realize this is not in their interests.

00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:42.850
And there are people like Warren Buffet who've
been very articulate about the dangers of

00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:45.340
going the direction that we're going.

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:52.320
Not only dangers but the fundamental inequity
that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary.

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:55.330
The other one is reflects my other perspective.

00:48:55.330 --> 00:49:00.400
That I, that the 99 percent might finally
begin to realize that they've been sold a

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.060
bill of goods.

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:06.290
That what is in the one percent interests
may not be in their best interests.

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:09.680
Some of it is, but some of it is not.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:13.310
Low tax rates for speculators is not in their
interest.

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:23.680
There's a whole set of, a system of appropriately
designed estate taxes really does help, raise

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:27.670
needed revenue, enhances equality of opportunity.

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:35.560
So there are a whole set of reforms that it
should be possible to articulate that the

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:39.070
99 percent will realize is in their interests.

00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:44.510
And that there is this potential conflict
and that will change our democratic process.

00:49:44.510 --> 00:49:50.730
We're still are a democracy, and we still
have the potential of changing the legislation.

00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:56.970
&gt;&gt;Male #4: so I'm sympathetic to the argument
that wealth inequalities can be economic inefficient.

00:49:56.970 --> 00:50:00.570
But isn't it dangerous to talk about "the
one percent" because it sort of conflates

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:01.570
income and wealth.

00:50:01.570 --> 00:50:03.190
Which are very different things?

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:09.900
And also, it sort of presents "the one percent"
as a homogeneous group.

00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:13.980
Whereas people at the bottom end of that,
who aren't poor by any means, they still aren't

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:16.220
going to buy any influence in Washington.

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:20.570
Whereas the upper percentiles of the one percent
are qualitatively different.

00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:23.890
So why do you use the term "one percent" and
what

00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:28.040
&gt;&gt;Joseph: I use it because you have to simplify.

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:33.100
And in the book, I raise exactly the point,
when I use the words "one percent" I'm using

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:36.390
generically for something above the top.

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:40.620
And some of those at the, and I do make the
point that the one percent in wealth is not

00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:43.590
the same as the one percent in income.

00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:44.590
And that

00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:46.090
&gt;&gt;Male #4: But still they're kind of fundamentally
different remedies.

00:50:46.090 --> 00:50:54.780
Like the only way you're ever going to penalize
the Walton heirs is through an estate tax.

00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:59.530
There's no income tax that will ever change
that inequality.

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:05.290
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Let me just, one of the numbers
that I mention in the book that it's gotten

00:51:05.290 --> 00:51:11.110
a lot of resonance is the fact that the six
heirs to the Walton fortune have as much money,

00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:15.240
much wealth, as the bottom 30 percent of America.

00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:20.280
And that is a testimony both to the wealth
at the top and to the lack of wealth at the

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:21.280
bottom.

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.280
But you're absolutely right.

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.300
That's something that's going to need the
estate tax.

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:30.130
And what I said was, that we have many dimensions
of inequality in our society.

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:32.500
And each of them requires their own remedy.

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:35.230
We also have inequality in health outcomes.

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:40.720
And that, the remedy of that is, a better
healthcare system.

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:45.610
So there are many of these dimensions and
obviously in a short talk I couldn't go into

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:47.830
all of them.

00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:55.840
Also, you're all, absolutely right that it's
unfair to the one percent to lump them all

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:56.840
together.

00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:02.630
I mentioned that Warren Buffet has actually
been very articulate in saying that we oughta

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:06.260
do, a system of taxation is unfair.

00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:11.160
He even addressed the issue of class warfare
when he said, you know, cause one of the reactions

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:16.370
to some of the statements that I've made and
others like it is "You're fomenting class

00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:17.370
warfare."

00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:23.700
And his response was, and this is from somebody
at the very top, he said "We've been at class

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:27.220
warfare for a very long time, and our class
has been winning."

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:30.840
So he gave I think a perspective on what is
at stake.

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:32.930
This is not about class warfare.

00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:35.800
This is about how you make our society work
better.

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:37.880
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Thank you.

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:42.180
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Hi, I'm just going a little bit
off topic here.

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:46.870
But I'm wondering as an economist who's focused
on inequality from an economic standpoint,

00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:52.120
how do you feel about Obama's nomination for
World Bank President?

00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:56.730
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Well, this, it's an interesting
nomination.

00:52:56.730 --> 00:53:06.970
I don't know if you know, the first point
I'll make is that the G20, had agreed that

00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:12.840
the next president of the World Bank ought
to be chosen on the basis of merit.

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:19.920
That traditionally it's always based on, it's
always been an American.

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:26.110
And they said "Why does America have the monopoly
on talented people?

00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:28.690
There's actually a world out there.

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:31.720
And we oughta open it up."

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:34.430
And the US agreed to that, sort of.

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:42.920
But and everybody had expected this case would
be one where countries would put forward good

00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:46.350
candidates and there'd be an open and fair
competition.

00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:52.370
Well it turned out that it was more open than
there had previously been.

00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:56.020
There were two very good candidates from developing
countries.

00:53:56.020 --> 00:54:03.380
So, Antonio Compo from Columbia, and Ngoze
from Nigeria.

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:08.020
Both really outstanding people who would have
made good presidents of the World Bank.

00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:09.280
Both with a lot of experience.

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:14.620
Both who had served as senior ministers in
their government.

00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:15.690
Head of Foreign Policy.

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:16.690
Head of Economics.

00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:20.250
You know, so a lot of experience.

00:54:20.250 --> 00:54:25.710
In the end, the United States, said, "Oh,
we didn't really mean chosen on the basis

00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:26.710
of merit.

00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:28.770
We meant a good American.

00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:32.850
As opposed to somebody like Wolfowitz who
was not a good American."

00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:33.850
[laughter]

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:43.770
So the good news of the G20 was the Administration
had been considering appointing somebody who

00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:46.290
would have been a disaster.

00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:54.030
And the fact that there was a more open process
meant that everybody could pile in and tell

00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:56.130
Obama "Don't do that.

00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:57.380
That would be a mistake."

00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:59.910
And there was a lot of press discussion.

00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:02.300
And he decided not to appoint that person.

00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:08.750
Last minute he got the guy that, Tim, that
he chose.

00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:13.470
A person who's done fantastic work in the
area of health.

00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:16.380
At least a lot of people say.

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:23.270
You don't, but, but that's only one part of
the portfolio of the World Bank.

00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:32.180
And so the concern is that it's, it's not
sufficiently broad relative to the needs of

00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:33.810
what the World Bank.

00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:38.260
But we'll see how that evolves.

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:47.440
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Hi, so I've done some reading
and research on the relationship, if any,

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:52.661
between a country's ethnic fractualization
or the ethnic or racial relations of a country

00:55:52.661 --> 00:55:57.950
and its economic growth especially with variables
like corruption or like rent-seeking like

00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:59.780
you talked about earlier.

00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:04.700
So I'm just wondering what your perspective
is on that type of research.

00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:08.780
Ike what your perspective is on the theory
and how you think it's maybe relevant to the

00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:10.030
US and inequality.

00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:12.240
&gt;&gt;Joseph: Yeah, that's actually interesting.

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:23.680
There is this body of research that basically
is focused on different, how societies work

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:28.250
together and the extent to which there can
be ethnic divisions.

00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:33.620
A lot in Africa where you have tribal divisions.

00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:39.770
Some interesting aspects of it is, when you
have two or three groups, things work worse

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:45.050
than if there's either one group, or very
many groups.

00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:48.640
I think that it's relevant in the following
sense.

00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:53.290
That it is clear that some more homogeneous
societies like the Scandinavian countries

00:56:53.290 --> 00:57:01.230
have managed to have a higher degree of cohesiveness.

00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:08.880
Have much broader policies that support greater
equality.

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:12.930
And have grown together.

00:57:12.930 --> 00:57:17.110
But I think at the same time while America
is a very diverse society, there's absolutely

00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:22.500
nothing about any of the policies that I've
described here that couldn't be implemented

00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:24.310
in a very diverse society.

00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:26.440
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Thank you.

00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:28.040
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Hi.

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:32.520
You made a point about how rent-seeking can
shrink the economic pie.

00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:37.580
I'm wondering if you have any thoughts about
whether labor unions exhibit rent-seeking

00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:41.970
behavior and how that affects the economy.

00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:45.840
&gt;&gt;Joseph: That's a good question.

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:55.780
Labor unions have played both an important
and in some cases an ambiguous role.

00:57:55.780 --> 00:58:04.250
[pause] The reason that unions originally
grew to the importance that they have is that

00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:06.530
there was an imbalance in economic power.

00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:07.960
Particularly bargaining power.

00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:13.870
One, when the introduction was talked about
game theory.

00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:19.820
The standard economic models pretend that
there is perfect competition.

00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:24.740
And there's a, just a supply of labor and
a demand for labor and everything works out

00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:26.210
very smoothly.

00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:28.730
The reality is not, that doesn't describe
the reality.

00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:31.730
There is a difference in bargaining power.

00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:36.920
And again, one of the points I make in the
book is that the rules and regulations of

00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:40.140
how we run our economy affect that bargaining
power.

00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:46.530
For instance, when we run globalization in
a way that we say that capital and goods can

00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:52.220
move anywhere in the world, but labor can't,
that affects bargaining power.

00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:59.300
Because a firm bargaining with workers can
say to the workers "If you don’t take lower

00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:02.180
wages, we're gonna move somewhere else and
then we're gonna be able to bring the goods

00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:03.970
back home."

00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:07.950
So it totally distorts the bargaining power.

00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:11.730
I tell my students "Think of another world
with a different set of rules.

00:59:11.730 --> 00:59:20.310
Let's assume that we have a set of rules that
capital couldn't move, but skilled labor could.

00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:23.830
So an economy would have to compete for skilled
labor.

00:59:23.830 --> 00:59:27.540
And so they would compete by having old schools,
good environment.

00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:31.410
Totally different world than the world that
we live in."

00:59:31.410 --> 00:59:36.900
The important lesson of this is that rules
and regulations do affect the bargaining power.

00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:42.620
In that kind of a world, unions have played
an important role in trying to redress the

00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:52.140
imbalance that has emerged naturally and out
of the distortions in the rules and regulations.

00:59:52.140 --> 01:00:00.100
Now there are some cases where they themselves
have high bargaining power and have tried

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:05.120
to use that for obviously the benefit of their
members and particularly sometimes their older

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.290
members.

01:00:06.290 --> 01:00:10.050
And that's had an adverse affect.

01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:13.310
The point of that is, you don't say, let's
get rid of all unions.

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:17.920
You have to understand the role that unions
play and try to correct the problems that

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.220
have arisen in those unions.

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:24.350
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Not a question.

01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:25.420
But a thank you for coming to Google.

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:25.530
[applause]
