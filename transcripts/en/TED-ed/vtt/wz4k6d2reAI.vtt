00:00:07.886 --> 00:00:12.246
As dawn breaks over a moveable city 
of ten thousand yurts,

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:15.971
Queen Boraqchin is in 
for a rude awakening.

00:00:15.971 --> 00:00:19.151
A rogue sheep has slipped past her 
servants and guards

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:21.221
and bolted into her yurt,

00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:24.991
where he springs into bed 
and bleats in her ear.

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:28.261
Although she’s the formidable khatun 
of the Golden Horde,

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.861
a huge kingdom in the Mongolian Empire,

00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:34.211
Boraqchin has a hands-on 
approach to ruling.

00:00:34.211 --> 00:00:36.131
She’s been married to Batu Khan,

00:00:36.131 --> 00:00:38.771
the fearsome grandson 
of Genghis Khan himself,

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:40.531
since she was fifteen –

00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:42.781
and while her husband is out on his raids,

00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:48.211
she juggles the duties of flocks, 
family and empire at home.

00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:52.784
This makes her the manager – 
and the mover – of a city of thousands.

00:00:52.784 --> 00:00:57.474
Twice a year, Boraqchin moves the city 
between two seasonal camping grounds.

00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:01.267
This ensures constant water 
and lush grass in summer,

00:01:01.267 --> 00:01:04.617
and protection from harsh winds in winter.

00:01:04.617 --> 00:01:07.787
The whole operation requires 
weeks of strict planning,

00:01:07.787 --> 00:01:11.317
liaising with the other camps in her 
domain, strategic delegation –

00:01:11.317 --> 00:01:15.447
and the patience to move at the speed 
of dawdling animals.

00:01:15.447 --> 00:01:17.475
Today is moving day,

00:01:17.475 --> 00:01:22.445
and she’ll have to direct throngs of her
ladies, commanders, slaves and animals

00:01:22.445 --> 00:01:25.091
up the river Volga for the summer.

00:01:25.091 --> 00:01:27.131
As Boraqchin steps outside,

00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:29.461
she’s greeted by a commotion –

00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:33.491
her unwanted visitor is now running 
circles around her stewards.

00:01:33.491 --> 00:01:37.491
They’re attempting to stow her possessions
securely into wagons.

00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:40.321
Boraqchin orders them 
to get it under control –

00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:44.021
but she’s the only one quick 
enough to catch the stray.

00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:47.611
She next supervises her ladies who are
unpinning her yurt

00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:50.281
and lifting it onto its custom wagon.

00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:53.021
It requires a team of twenty oxen to pull,

00:01:53.021 --> 00:01:57.161
and Boraqchin wouldn’t trust anyone 
to steer it but herself.

00:01:57.161 --> 00:02:01.031
Next, Boraqchin and her woolly companion 
meet with the guards.

00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:04.971
She orders them to keep close watch
on her husband's special reception yurt

00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:08.101
and port-able throne during the journey.

00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:09.981
They’ll also act as outriders,

00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:13.291
and she tells them how to secure the 
route, surround her for safety –

00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:16.371
and keep the animals in check.

00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:19.731
But when the sheep finally breaks free 
and makes for the fields,

00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:21.341
the guards can barely keep up

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:24.801
as it scampers through crowds 
packing up their yurts.

00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:28.781
Exasperated, Boraqchin rides down 
to the pastures herself.

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:29.801
When she gets there,

00:02:29.801 --> 00:02:35.161
she catches sight of the troublesome sheep
wriggling into the middle of a flock.

00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:36.400
When she follows him in,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.390
he’s nestled next to a ewe, his mother.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.220
She’s pregnant,
and seems to be in pain.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.020
With a start, Boraqchin realizes 
that this ewe’s impending delivery

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.190
has been forgotten in 
the flurry of moving day.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.140
There’s no time to find a shepherd –

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.150
instead, Boraqchin rolls up her sleeves, 
greases her arm

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.180
and helps the ewe give birth to two new 
additions to the empire.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.052
Leaving the lambs and their mother,

00:03:02.052 --> 00:03:04.372
Boraqchin dashes back to the camp.

00:03:04.372 --> 00:03:06.902
Here the final touches have 
been put to packing,

00:03:06.902 --> 00:03:09.902
and vehicles are starting to line up.

00:03:09.902 --> 00:03:12.282
This vast procession starts with the queen

00:03:12.282 --> 00:03:15.762
and two hundred wagons 
filled with her treasures.

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:18.282
Next up are the junior wives and crew,

00:03:18.282 --> 00:03:19.722
then the concubines –

00:03:19.722 --> 00:03:22.602
and this is only Boraqchin's camp.

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:24.862
After this comes the second imperial camp

00:03:24.862 --> 00:03:26.852
led by another senior wife,

00:03:26.852 --> 00:03:30.002
then two more camps, also led by wives.

00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:32.862
Boraqchin has been checking in 
with them for weeks to ensure

00:03:32.862 --> 00:03:35.632
a smooth departure and orderly queue.

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:38.692
But they only make up the 
royal portion of the line –

00:03:38.692 --> 00:03:41.992
behind them winds 
the entire civilian city,

00:03:41.992 --> 00:03:45.332
which includes holy men 
with portable chapels and mosques,

00:03:45.332 --> 00:03:48.412
families, tradesmen, and shepherds.

00:03:48.412 --> 00:03:51.821
Finally, Boraqchin settles into her wagon.

00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:54.231
It’ll take weeks to reach 
their destination –

00:03:54.231 --> 00:03:55.941
but over the course of the journey,

00:03:55.941 --> 00:03:58.611
she’ll keep everyone expertly in check –

00:03:58.611 --> 00:04:01.311
from her proud children 
and attentive subjects,

00:04:01.311 --> 00:04:05.421
to the most meandering sheep 
at the back of line.
