Speaker 1:          00:00          You know what I should do? Listen to what do you think? I listened to you. Jealous of the classic jazz and classical of course. Of course. Yeah. We'll, you're so interesting. I was, I was a concert level violinist until I was until I was like 17 years old practice. Yeah. I mean, the only expensive object that I own other than my house is his violin. Oh really? Yeah. Is it a of area? It is not. It is. It is a up. It's not, that's all I know. That's a, yeah, they're the two that people may know or strat and, and like ordinary. Um, but those, those ones are like hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is in the tens of thousands of dollars to various is hundreds of thousands of [inaudible]. The Guy who we knew, my family knew hit $1 million Stradivarius. Oh yeah. Now it was so big about it was the big deal. Well, I mean, aside from the historic value of the thing, they're not making any more of them.

Speaker 1:          00:43          Um, it does play very differently, very differently. Like I had a crappy violin for most of my are like really until the last two years. I had a violin that was handed down from my grandfather that was worth maybe 1300 bucks and it was a piece of crap. I mean, it was not a good violin. If you're good enough, then you can tell the difference between a really great violin to play and one that is a piece of garbage. And I was good enough to do that. So that's, yeah, I mean I was, I was a classical guy. I played, I played violin for years and my dad was, uh, growing up, my dad was a pianist looking at what Jamie just pulled up

Speaker 2:          01:16          the most expensive violin. The world sold for an estimated $16 million. Yep. For Australia.

Speaker 1:          01:24          I never lose value. I mean, really they don't. And this is, this is a good investment. The person, I know this guy who was offered a, he's offered a strategy, I think it was $250,000 maybe 10 years ago. And he's like, no, that it's worth like $3 million today. God,

Speaker 2:          01:38          no. What is the deal? Like what if you had to explain what's the difference between the sound that this makes sense?

Speaker 1:          01:44          I mean, it has to do with the acoustics of the instrument. Any of the wood quality. There's, there's slight variations in the construction of the instrument is certain parts of that are thicker or thinner. Um, and it is also, it's easier to play a better violin, so it almost covers for your mistakes. When you play a, a bad violin, it tends to scratch and screech more. That's why when you get in the upper register with a violin, you hit very high notes. It can either be very screechy or it can be very beautiful. Some of that, a lot of, most of that's the player. Some of that's the violin, like Yasha Heifetz who is widely considered the greatest violinist to, to ever live. He had a Strad and

Speaker 2:          02:18          lady blunt Stradivarius caught 15 point $9 million these

Speaker 1:          02:22          and then they lend them out on, on loan to, you know, world's great violinist. So, but there's a, but in the end it really is the, uh, the quality of the player. There's a famous Yasha Heifetz story where he was playing at Carnegie Hall and some lady came up to him afterward and she said, you know your violin and just, it sounds so beautiful. And he picks up the violin, puts it to his ear, and he says, funny, I don't hear it right now.

Speaker 2:          02:45          So do you listen to any other kind of music? Yeah, I mean, I just, I like, I like some classic rock. I mean, see, rocking out. Yeah. I went to a Doobie brothers concert with my parents. No, you did. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's a band that was main named after a joint. That is true. That's how it went. Is accurate. I know. Did you feel like, uh, like a sinner? I was, I was a rebel that day. That was really gone to the Doobie brothers concert with the other boomers. So the.
