00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260
[Captions by Y Translator]
Hey guys. Today,
we are back with Joseph,

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.240
who you may recognize from when
he taught us how to do some

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.700
basic beginning
blacksmithing techniques.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.900
Today, you're going to be
showing us some techniques

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.000
for increasing our strength
and our coordination,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.772
and just how well we control the Hammers.

00:00:15.772 --> 00:00:22.740
[Music]

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.300
We're gonna play a game of horse,
except it's going to be a game of Smith,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.940
because we're going to spell S-M-I-T-H.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.500
The idea for this comes
from some advice I got from

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.980
a blacksmith whose name was Panslayer.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.600
He said that one time,
he was putting a nail up

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.100
for his wife in his house,
and he was hitting with a hammer,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.200
and it just so happens that he hit
with the wrong end of the hammer,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.700
and didn't realize it until after
he put the nail in perfectly.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.600
That's the kind of hammer control
that you really need to aspire to

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.320
if you're going to get
into blacksmithing.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.800
So that you can put the hammer
exactly where you want it,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.820
exactly how hard you want it,
at exactly the angle you want it.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.020
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.100
We've got some hammers,
we've got some nails,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.600
and we've got an anvil,
and we're going to play some games that

00:00:59.612 --> 00:01:01.800
teach us the basics of metal manipulation.

00:01:02.612 --> 00:01:04.902
So here's what we're going to play,
and we're going to sink in an nail.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.300
You have to call how many hits
you're going to get it in,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.200
what part of the hammer
you're going to get it in with,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.400
any other weird stuff,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.720
and you have to do it whilst
and at the same time holding the nail only

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.980
with a pair of tongs.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.300
And that's because almost everything
when you're blacksmithing,

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.800
you won't just hold it with your hand.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.200
Yes.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.740
You're holding it with tongs.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.600
So if you've ever wanted
to watch me lose at a game,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.360
now is a good time.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.400
I've never played this
before, we'll find out.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.102
I'm just going to start out
as basic as humanly possible,

00:01:34.192 --> 00:01:38.100
and I'm just going to go
for straight with a regular grip,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.200
and can I predict that it's going to go
in a little bit before bending

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.052
in a weird angle...

00:01:42.052 --> 00:01:42.202
Yes!

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:43.900
And then having to
flatten it down oddly?

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.700
Okay, let's do that.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.100
That's

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.902
I mean, that's
my realistic prediction.

00:01:48.012 --> 00:01:49.500
Oh, see, one shot.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.800
I'm already at an angle,
and there's a slight curve

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.500
in the nail.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.282
So this is going real good.

00:01:59.872 --> 00:02:02.200
Like nine shots,
and it's at an angle,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.100
but it did go into the wood.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.000
Oh, and in fact,
it went out the bottom.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.700
We might need a little
bit more wood here.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.100
We're going to end up
filling our table with...

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.960
Workbench, we ask for forgiveness.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.900
--Of holes.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.400
I humbly suggest
that we upgrade.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.600
Oh, smaller nails.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.960
Yes, let's do that.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.100
Okay, so you went straight
in normal grip.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.100
I'm gonna try that
with my tutor nail.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.900
Your turn.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.200
So I'm going to try
and drive a finishing nail,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.720
which has like no head to it,
using the back of my hammer.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.400
The part that's not supposed
to be used for nails.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.442
This is going to go great.

00:02:38.482 --> 00:02:38.982
Nope.

00:02:39.602 --> 00:02:40.102
Yes.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.680
Nope.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.180
Nope.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.900
Nope.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.560
I'm really good at this guys.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.340
Ow?

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.700
All right, we're keeping count.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.572
I think that was
about 30 strikes.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.060
I wanna see if I can do that.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.360
You look at this wood here.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.000
Look at that.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.900
Just mark after mark after mark,
where the back of this just completely

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.400
missed the nail,
smashed the wood.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.700
That's lovely.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.120
Let's just say after you attempt mine,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.100
you then get to go first,

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.500
and I have to try
and replicate yours.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.200
Yes, let's do that.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.800
So it's just better
than, not pass fail.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.500
Okay.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.100
I like this.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.600
I like this.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.500
We can work on a spectrum.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.152
I don't think I've done better
than you're, you're

00:03:26.192 --> 00:03:28.000
at about 45 strikes now.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.140
Who's counting?

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.120
Me, so I can win.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.260
Okay, fair enough.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.500
First letter, I get an S.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.000
So I'm going to try it
with this one.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.900
&gt;&gt; See if the ball peen [audible]
&gt;&gt; Ball peen hammer.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.400
Okay.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.320
There we go.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.100
Okay, beat that one.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.620
That was like 27 strikes.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.520
[Music]

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.540
27, and bent at the same angle.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.200
I think you made the shot.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.380
I think we'll just
call that one a tie.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.700
Okay, so no letters
aside for a tie.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.900
You get to choose
the next shot.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.800
All right, I'm going to go
for the regular head of the hammer.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.672
But I'm going to do it
at an angle.

00:04:05.712 --> 00:04:06.700
I kind of want to try it at an angle.

00:04:07.022 --> 00:04:09.692
So let's go in for about
a 45 degree angle here.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.400
[Music]

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.560
I don't know about 45,
it kinda...

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.400
At an angle?

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.880
[Music]

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.140
See, good practice should be harder
than the real thing,

00:04:25.892 --> 00:04:27.952
and I think it might achieve that goal.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:35.740
[Music]

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.900
I think you take that one.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:37.420
That is--

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.800
I think that's more
of the angle we were going for.

00:04:40.042 --> 00:04:41.600
So the letter goes to me.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.020
Okay, letter goes to you.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.140
So S and S.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.540
One thing that I find
I frequently have to do

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.120
is I will get my thing out of the forge,
bring it to the anvil,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.960
and it will be at an
awkward angle with my tongs.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.200
So this time the thing that you
need to do is go pick up your nail

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.820
with one grip of the tongs,
and then reposition your tongs

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.540
opposite the way it was.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.460
So I was like this,

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.460
you're going to switch like this,

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.380
and then just sink it straight down.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.800
[Music]

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.720
Better than that.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:17.460
All right.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.440
So we're starting
with standard grip.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.120
I need to reverse grip.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.820
Uh huh.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.920
And then you were pounding
it reverse grip.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.460
Yeah.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.040
I think?

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.820
Or did I get it backwards?

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.200
I think I might have done it backwards.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.040
[Music]

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.960
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
&gt;&gt; That's kind of in there.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.340
Okay, M for me.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.820
Here's what I'm going
to try this time.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.320
Sure.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.820
I'm going to see if without the nail
touching the board or falling,

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.180
I can actually rotate it 360 using
just the hammer and the pliers.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.180
This is actually
really good practice.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.600
That's a really good idea.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.420
Saved it.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:57.320
[Music]

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.020
Yes, okay, 360.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.520
We'll just let you pull it off.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.300
Pretty sick though.

00:06:01.312 --> 00:06:15.620
[Music]

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.060
I think you did that.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.940
I think you probably
even beat me on speed too.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:19.960
That looked--

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.220
To me, that looked like you
were a little bit faster.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.720
So I think I take
the letter on that.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.900
Okay, we both have S and M.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.580
This is a pretty
even game so far.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.680
So you're going to stand
to the end of the anvil,

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.020
like this, this is your anvil,

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.300
and we're going to pretend you're
like upsetting a bar just

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.880
where you're trying to make it fatter
instead of thinner by shoving some

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.700
more material into it.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.600
So this you can kind of
sort of get the shot in real life.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.160
Okay.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.860
[Music]

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.200
Yeah, that's
about where it went.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.700
Okay.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.160
I've got 12.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.780
[Music]

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:53.760
That's my 12.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.160
So I'm an SMI.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.700
Next challenge is going
to be straightening a nail,

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.320
and for this one, I'll show you
a little bit about how to do that.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:00.820
Nailed it.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.680
Whenever you bend a nail,
it's always going to be

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.880
kind of U shape.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.540
You can think of it as being shaped
either like a U or like an N.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.740
Whenever you hit it,
you want it to be shaped like an N.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.000
I'm going to put it like this,
because if I hit it like this,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.060
and I'm trying to straighten it,

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.040
I'm going to get this seesaw motion going,
were it just wants to move my tongs.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.220
[Music]

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.232
Okay, that's
relatively straight.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.960
Yeah straighter than that.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.340
Here's my similarly bent nail.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:35.060
[Music]

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.920
It's kinda straight.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.640
It looks pretty good.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.400
Let's compare
to the other ones.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.700
That's kind of straight.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.700
I would say neither
of them is perfectly straight.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.020
But both of them are
somewhat straight.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.780
I think yours is straighter,
it kind of rolls.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.380
Whereas mine like turns over,
and then just like nah, I don't...

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.320
That's a good test.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.160
That's smart.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:58.560
[Music]

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.540
This went well.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.520
This went well.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.920
All right, more time
straightening the nail needed.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.320
A little more hammer
control needed.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.500
You know, a good form
of practice is the one

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.620
that's going to challenge you.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.140
I feel challenged.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.240
I do too.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:18.260
[Music]

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:19.020
Oh boy.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.240
I, I got a letter on that one.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:23.720
It's so hard.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.840
Yeah!

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.260
So I just want to
point something out.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.300
If you look at the video
of me trying to drive this nail in,

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.320
I'm pretty sure I started
with my hand back here.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.500
I was like no, no,
I want more power on this one.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.960
That was a mistake.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.300
If you look at his,
he started with his hand

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:42.000
like up here, and the nail
went like pretty straight down

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.600
with a not perfectly straight nail.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.800
So like he said before,
you want to hold the Hammer

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.740
as far back as you can, as long
as you still have perfect control.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.100
I had not perfect control.

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.660
I'm going to do wide nail.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.020
This thing has a bigger head.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:10.420
[Music]

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.560
Yes.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.780
So that was, that
was about 60 strikes.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:14.660
It was.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.000
But I think, more importantly
for me it will just be

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.200
if I can pull it off at all.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.720
I don't have super
high hopes on that front.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.060
[Music]

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.000
It's not going well.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.360
Oh, no.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.660
I did make it.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:34.800
Yeah, kind of.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.220
But I think that still
does definitely goes to you.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.120
Okay.
I took more strikes.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.580
I definitely had it bend back
and forth more times,

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.280
and it is at more of an angle now.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.140
I'm impressed that you saved it,
but I'll take the point.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.020
So alright,

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.540
So I'm... I'm SMIT.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:48.300
SMIT.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:49.880
Okay, last point.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:50.460
Okay.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.460
So the shot is going
to be three nails,

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.820
not just one this time.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.240
We're going to go one,

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.940
place it in regular side
of the hammer.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:07.280
Two, do a reversed grip upside down,
hit it with the back side of the hammer.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.580
Okay, and then the last one,
you're going to do a regular grip

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.480
over the arm in.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.720
And then you have to do
each one in order.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.540
Split the wood.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:36.040
[Music]

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:36.620
Okay.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.600
So, first one is just regular?

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.180
Regular.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.640
Then the next one is
upside down ball-peen.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:49.020
[Music]

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:49.640
Oh boy.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.580
You're not a kind man.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.600
Oh, my arm is so tired.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:09.600
[Music]

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.460
Ah!

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:11.500
Disaster strikes.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.640
[Music]

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.080
So glad no one else
is home today.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.600
Look how much better
than mine and is yours.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.660
Yours is so crooked.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.540
Yeah.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.720
How did that happen?

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.640
Yours was really
a lot straighter than mine.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.480
I'm going to say that was
pretty close to even.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.100
Yeah, I think we both managed
to drive all three.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.300
I did have more trouble
getting mine in.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.940
You did, but you got it in.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.300
I mean, [inaudible] at an angle I guess.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.420
Wait. This is like those kids games,
you know the ones with all the pegs.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.180
I saw a spark.

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.560
I saw a spark too.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.680
I missed entirely.

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.100
So, what were your impressions
with hammer control?

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.200
I think that I need more of it.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:54.300
So very much more of it.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.200
But bending the nails
and all sorts of weird ways,

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.860
I think that is good training.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.880
I think it would really help
me build up muscles,

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.760
and like, there's probably
a lot more muscles,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.120
and variations of which muscles you're
using that people won't really think about.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.580
So being able to turn it
at just the right angle

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:12.760
while still striking and stuff like that,
it's not just the same single muscle

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.600
as if you'd like pick up,

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.600
and strike your hammer over,
so you really need to have

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.800
experience twisting
and turning your hands.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.800
So that when you want
the hammer to do something...

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.300
It does the thing that you want it to do.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.160
It does the thing, instead
of some other thing,

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.640
which I had a lot of it
doing the other thing.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.460
Guys, thanks for watching.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.780

But remember, there's
always more for you to see.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.800

and if you aren't a subscriber yet,
you should be.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.620
Just hit this bomb to get in the club,
