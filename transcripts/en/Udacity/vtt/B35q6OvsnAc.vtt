This might be a good time to explain
that 15,000 is written in standard

00:00:05.327 --> 00:00:10.821
notation which is probably how you're
used to seeing large numbers written,

00:00:10.821 --> 00:00:15.316
but when working with very large
numbers or very small numbers,

00:00:15.316 --> 00:00:19.945
it can sometimes be easier to
write them in scientific notation.

00:00:19.945 --> 00:00:22.910
1.5 x 10 to the 4th is
in scientific notation.
