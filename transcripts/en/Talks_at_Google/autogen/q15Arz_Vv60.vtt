00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.230
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.507
TIA KANSARA HON FRIBA: How might
we live in harmony with nature?

00:00:11.507 --> 00:00:13.090
And if you go one
step further-- and I

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.589
think I'll put this into context
of all the different things

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.100
I've been doing, whether it
is, for example, the advisory

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.550
on, like, making a physical
environment zero waste,

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.310
you know, like not having an
impact on the environment,

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.680
or looking at the data
that we can collect

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.510
from smart cities and
sensors and things

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.430
like that to
understand how best we

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.195
can make those decisions for
future designs, buildings, et

00:00:34.195 --> 00:00:35.200
cetera.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.900
One thing that I'm super
interested in at the moment

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.600
is the use of new technologies,
like Fourth Industrial

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.940
Revolution-type technologies
and understanding

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.990
how people like us are
actually using dialogue

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.540
to understand how
best we can understand

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.520
that technology in the
context of the lives

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.020
that we want to live with
the philosophy that we have.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.750
So it's as if that
philosophy was

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.240
the basis and the
foundation, and then you're

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.050
going to build
everything on top of it.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.530
Another thing that I'm looking
at in a much more practical

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.860
level is really looking
at how businesses procure

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.840
their products and
their services,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.300
and going into the,
say, supply chains

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.221
and understanding at
that supply chain,

00:01:12.221 --> 00:01:13.720
where do you get
your products from?

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.280
Where are the
resources coming from?

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.230
And is there an alternative
that we can have?

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.390
Say, shared economy,
or whether it

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.060
is that when you're going to
be designing your start-up,

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.130
the material that you're
using for your products

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.690
is actually having a beneficial
environmental impact?

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.380
And it's also
about understanding

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.300
where our construction
industry, which

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.440
is where 40% of our climate
carbon-related emissions

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.700
are coming from, can
actually be reduced.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.580
So a lot of the
physical environment

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.740
that we either live
in, work in is still

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.260
going to be here in
50 years' time, right?

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.800
I mean, can you imagine
Aleppo, a 1,000-year-old city,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.790
is still alive today.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.360
It's been bashed about, there
have been multiple wars,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.670
and this is just another
one to add to its history.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.496
But it's a 1,000-year-old
city like Damascus is, right?

00:01:58.496 --> 00:02:00.370
And so it's a really
interesting relationship

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.780
that we have with the
consequences that were almost

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.090
like Italo Calvino,
the urbanist,

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.880
would say that humans have
left a scar on the city, right?

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.220
Your relationship with
a city has remained.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.230
It's like whatever
you did in that city

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.670
creates the legacy of that city.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.676
And so that's sort of
some of the thoughts

00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:23.800
that I'm sharing with you
through the presentation,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.429
but also the things
that I get up to.

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:27.970
Research is really
interesting for me

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.500
because it's an
opportunity to put

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.720
a lot of the theoretical models
together with the practical,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.220
right?

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.860
There's no point in running
a business unless you

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.100
know the theory behind it.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.430
A lot of people go to
university to learn the theory,

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.430
but then don't know how
to put it into practice.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.870
And that is the big challenge.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.440
How do you put what you've
learnt, like economics,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.410
into practice when you actually
go and leave university?

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.260
And then finally, when it
comes to the relationship

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.890
that we have with information,
it's like you can--

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.950
I can talk to you until you're
blue in the face about certain

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.280
issues, but I haven't
really learnt your form

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.560
of communication.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.420
If you want to learn
something, there

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.500
are many ways that you learn.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.490
But the way that you learn it
is in the context that you know,

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:10.300
right?

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.640
If I give you an
immersive experience,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.460
that's going to teach you
way more than something

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.290
that you would have
to theorize before you

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.890
went into the practice of.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.890
So a big thing for
me is, how do you

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.860
engage people into
the longer mission

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.490
with giving them these sort
of immersive experiences?

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.980
So the big question
is, considering we now

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.630
live in ecosystems and systems
and cities and economic systems

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.840
that are so interconnected,
how do we develop,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.290
or how might we
develop an ecosystem

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.810
that replenishes planet Earth?

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.300
So what do I mean by
replenishing, right?

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.389
Replenishing is really
being carbon negative,

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.680
like the prime minister of
Bhutan talks about, Tshering

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.170
Tobgay, in his
incredible Ted talk.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.750
He talks about this idea
that he's having a posit--

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.690
his country's having a positive
impact on the environment.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.820
That means that you're
not zeroing out.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.290
It's not like a zero carbon.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.270
I've spent the carbon,
I've now sequestered it.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.370
It's going beyond
that so that you've

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.380
got some sort of
regenerative capacity

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.180
that you're providing
planet Earth.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.721
It means that you're
giving something

00:04:11.721 --> 00:04:14.720
back in the form that Earth can
actually compose, like compost

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.220
it.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.250
And that it has a
positive environment,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.029
environmental impact.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:25.630
So really, it's like
sustaining the status quo is

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.410
the way in which a lot of us,
for about a good 20 years,

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.400
have been exploring
markets and products.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.290
It's like we're
going to match that.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.150
We're going to sustain
the status quo.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.450
But how can we go beyond that?

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.970
From now on, we make a pledge.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.030
Everything that we buy
is 100% compostable.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.500
Everything is recyclable.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.240
Nothing goes to landfill sites.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.870
Right?

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.870
But what's then going to happen
about the Great Pacific giant?

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.220
Who's going to clean that up?

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.660
If every country and every
citizen in the world,

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.785
everyone in the world,
decides that we're not going

00:04:58.785 --> 00:04:59.920
to create any more waste--

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.503
but who's going to
take responsibility

00:05:01.503 --> 00:05:03.860
for our global commons,
our urban commons,

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.470
our communal impact that is a
legacy that we've inherited.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.730
And I think this is what
I'm trying to get to.

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.100
How can we get to a point where
we create systems naturally,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.860
whether it's through
tech platforms

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.610
or physical platforms,
that can actually

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.040
give more than we're taking?

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.920
So I started to explore,
as I mentioned in 2015,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.440
around about then, what
replenish actually meant.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.440
And since then I've been
on this huge exploration.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.740
And I realized, to bring
back that economics, right,

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.950
looking at GDP--

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.820
which is, you can spend money,
and it will look brilliant

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.520
on the accounts of a country.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.710
Like GDP looks brilliant.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.070
Oh, it's rising.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.380
We're spending a lot of money.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.296
But those expenditures--
where are they going?

00:05:48.296 --> 00:05:49.810
And what's the impact of them?

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.390
I could be spending
money on cigarettes

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.056
that have a negative impact on
my health, which then somebody

00:05:55.056 --> 00:05:56.930
else is going to be
paying for-- whether it's

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.500
through the National Health
Service or me, right?

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.750
It's about that I've
spent money on something--

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.760
and there's no judgment here--

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.850
but is the fact that I
spent money on something

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:10.660
then going to relate to a longer
term impact on expenditure,

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.119
whether it is a lung
replacement for all I care, that

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:15.910
is actually going to
have a negative impact

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:16.993
on the health of a person?

00:06:16.993 --> 00:06:18.790
But it looks great
on GDP, because I've

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.600
spent so much money on
cigarettes or whatever else.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.760
So there's no actual ethical
or moral or environmental

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.220
consciousness about
that expenditure.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.390
So how do we adjust GDP to also
include, in the expenditure,

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.600
that it has a positive
impact or a negative impact

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.700
or a neutral impact?

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.324
And so I wanted to explore that
through something that's called

00:06:40.324 --> 00:06:41.800
the World Replenish Index.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.370
Imagine if GDP,
globally, was adjusted

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.430
by every product and service
to the environmental impact

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.285
that it had.

00:06:49.285 --> 00:06:52.960
Would, instead of GDP, would you
have, like, a replenish count?

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.830
Just like, I'm going
to pick up your bottle,

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.371
assuming that it has a calorie
count at the back of it, which

00:06:57.371 --> 00:06:57.871
it does.

00:06:57.871 --> 00:07:00.412
And then all of a sudden, I'm
looking at this plastic bottle,

00:07:00.412 --> 00:07:02.080
and I can have a
replenish count, right?

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.840
This product is level
five, let's say.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.860
It's not there yet.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.540
But it's at level
5 for replenish,

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.260
meaning that your diet for
replenish, like your diet would

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.240
be for something
that you consume,

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.090
was related to the
association you have

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.160
with replenishing Planet Earth.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.741
And that's where
I want to get to.

00:07:19.741 --> 00:07:22.240
There's a lot of information
that I need before I get there.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.640
There's a lot of research that
I need to do before I get there.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:25.556
But that's my mission.

00:07:25.556 --> 00:07:29.890
To try and find a way that we
can develop some kind of metric

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.880
that we can measure how
people are positively

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.450
impacting Planet Earth.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.950
And I do this
through universities.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.770
At the moment, I've been
working with a number

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:39.880
of Indian universities.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.210
I feel as if, if there's one
place that I can go to that

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.570
I could have a big impact,
I feel that it's India.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.420
And the reason for that
is 450 million people

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.651
moving from villages,
migrating to cities, only

00:07:52.651 --> 00:07:54.400
to find there's no
where that they can go,

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.108
and they go and live
in slums, and mostly

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:57.340
work in a landfill site.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:59.048
And I want to stop
them from going there.

00:07:59.048 --> 00:08:01.210
So how do I give
them the resources

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.360
that they need in a way
that, at the beginning,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.490
they're living their
replenish lifestyle, which

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:10.540
is positive impact on
Planet Earth, from get go?

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.840
But how do I connect
them up in their rural,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.530
sort of super remote areas,
and give them the resources

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.510
that they need to
be able to live

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:23.260
a lifestyle that is appropriate
for the environment?

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.670
A while ago you might have
heard of the One Planet Living

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:26.680
lifestyle, right?

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.270
And that's very
similar to the way

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.920
that I'm trying to explore this.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.580
I took some students around
the world through a university

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.770
that I found in 2015.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:39.010
And I started to explore
India's 100 smart cities.

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.500
It's this huge project
that the Indian government

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.580
has undertaken.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:43.960
But with the 100
smart cities, it

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.030
doesn't mean that you've
got smart citizens.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:47.779
So when the university
asked me, would you

00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:50.000
explore what a smart city is?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.010
I said no!

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:52.312
I don't want to.

00:08:52.312 --> 00:08:53.770
I don't believe
that you can design

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.920
a smart city without
designing smart citizens.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.620
It's like the building
is smart, but we're not.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.320
It's like the city is
smart, but we're not.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.494
So the emphasis is on
the technology, not us.

00:09:05.494 --> 00:09:07.660
It's not the fact that my
consciousness has improved

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.690
and now I'm really aware of
what my building is doing.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.570
I have no intuitive
capacity with the building.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.430
I have no relationship
with the building.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.910
I am a node inside the
building or the city.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.620
I have nothing to
do with the city.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.210
The city corrects itself.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:23.950
The city manages itself.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:27.500
The city is designed so that it
makes its decisions without me.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.620
But I'm the one who's
a member of the city

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.530
and society and community
and this company, let's say.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:36.940
So what do I have to give
as an individual citizen?

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:40.540
And how is my data being used
to then make those decisions?

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.130
And do I have ownership of that?

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.421
I mean, these are big questions
I think we can't really

00:09:44.421 --> 00:09:45.410
answer in one session.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:46.730
But one of the questions.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:50.440
I really wanted to ask was
what is smart citizenship?

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.230
If you had an opportunity
to design a city,

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.790
how would you design it?

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.490
If you had an opportunity to
live in a particular place,

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:58.570
where would you live?

00:09:58.570 --> 00:09:59.560
Why?

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.240
Why would you live there?

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.886
If you had an opportunity
to go further into where

00:10:03.886 --> 00:10:06.010
your data was going to be
used, picked up, and then

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.760
analyzed and sold, shouldn't
you get a dividend on that?

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.010
And these are sort of broader
questions that I've been

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.218
asking through these courses?

00:10:13.218 --> 00:10:16.690
But I really wanted to get
students to take them out

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:18.820
of their university
experience and put them

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:22.780
into physical spaces, where the
physical space is teaching them

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.820
the lesson that I wanted
to teach them, right,

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.571
instead of giving them
a lecture at something.

00:10:27.571 --> 00:10:29.320
So one of the things
that I ended up doing

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.680
was taking my
students to Bhutan.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.229
And at first they
were, like, man,

00:10:33.229 --> 00:10:34.645
you're going to
take us to Bhutan?

00:10:34.645 --> 00:10:35.710
And I was, like, yeah!

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:37.374
I'm going to take you to Bhutan.

00:10:37.374 --> 00:10:39.290
They were, like, but
it's next to our country.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:40.030
Why do we have to go there?

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:41.600
Why couldn't you
take us to London?

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.690
And I said, let
me take you there,

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:46.365
and then we'll explore
what Bhutan really is.

00:10:46.365 --> 00:10:50.050
A And they were complaining
till we got to Bhutan.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.390
And in the end, even though
I took them to our cities

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:55.735
so they can explore Masal
city, I took them to Dubai,

00:10:55.735 --> 00:10:57.559
I brought them here.

00:10:57.559 --> 00:10:59.350
In the end, in that
one trip, I asked them,

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:00.430
what was your best experience?

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.513
And they said, Bhutan was.

00:11:01.513 --> 00:11:02.402
And I said why?

00:11:02.402 --> 00:11:04.610
You didn't want to go there,
and now, all of a sudden

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.276
that's like one of
your favorite places.

00:11:06.276 --> 00:11:06.970
How come?

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:08.386
They said, you
know, when we first

00:11:08.386 --> 00:11:10.540
arrived there, the one
thing that we explored

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.840
was the fact that they had
such beautiful clean water.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.780
Some of these students had never
seen such clean, natural water

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.800
in rivers.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.170
Because a lot of
them are polluted.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.730
Many of them had
never seen a place

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.914
that sequestered more
carbon than they made,

00:11:23.914 --> 00:11:25.330
because they live
next door to it.

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.941
But it's just,
like, unbelievable.

00:11:27.941 --> 00:11:29.440
They run out-- as
soon as I arrived,

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.300
we all arrived into Bhutan.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.620
We're at Paro airport.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.710
We're in a bus.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:35.560
We're going along
to, like, Thimphu.

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.540
The bus stops for some reason.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:38.650
I'm, like, snoozing off.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:42.194
All the kids run off, and
I'm like, what's happened?

00:11:42.194 --> 00:11:44.110
And I come outside, and
they're taking selfies

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:45.312
with the clear water.

00:11:45.312 --> 00:11:47.770
And I'm thinking, why are you
taking a selfie with a river?

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:48.910
And that's the point.

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.210
It was the fact that they
had lived such clean air,

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.960
that when they go back
to Ahmedabad, which

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.810
is one of the top two
polluted cities in India,

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:59.030
they realize that other
things were possible, right?

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.880
I took them equally to Japan.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:02.470
And in Japan, they
realize that what?

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:05.110
32 different types of recycling?

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.090
And you've got clear streets.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.330
I mean, who clears them up?

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.042
Well, the community does.

00:12:10.042 --> 00:12:11.750
The community clears
up the streets, man?

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:12.631
And I'm, like, yeah!

00:12:12.631 --> 00:12:13.630
It's called [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.370
Every month everyone comes
out with a broomstick

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:16.660
and they all clean it up.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.120
And you go to a Japanese
school, the kids come out once,

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.389
half an hour, an
hour during the day.

00:12:21.389 --> 00:12:23.430
And they will come and
clean up the whole school.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:24.471
Are they paid to do that?

00:12:24.471 --> 00:12:25.820
I said no.

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.970
You know, they don't have
maids and someone to clean up.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.270
I said no.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:31.533
That was a joke, [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:31.533 --> 00:12:36.985
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:36.985 --> 00:12:38.380
So then I really wanted--

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:42.010
I sort of explored the
research angle of it.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:43.640
But another thing I
really wanted to do

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.931
was to take some of these
students on a longer journey.

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:48.970
So I took about six different
research projects, all related

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.069
to recycling.

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:52.610
Because I strongly sense that
our relationship, not just with

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.750
the physical environment
affecting our brain

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.840
and changing our
chemistry, but also--

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.249
if we got them to
study the way that--

00:13:02.249 --> 00:13:03.790
I don't know if
you've been to India.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.739
If you have, you'll
understand and agree

00:13:06.739 --> 00:13:08.530
with me-- is that you
walk down the street,

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.530
and you've just got piles
of rubbish everywhere.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.397
And they're informal, and
no one cleans them up.

00:13:13.397 --> 00:13:14.980
And if they do get
cleaned up, they're

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.672
put in an informal
landfill site.

00:13:16.672 --> 00:13:18.130
And you look at
them and you think,

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:22.400
well, you know, what
kind of normal is this?

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.680
What kind of normal is this?

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.850
This is the norm.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.269
Meaning, every time I walk
out, that's a blind spot.

00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:28.060
That doesn't exist.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.184
What are you talking about?

00:13:29.184 --> 00:13:31.667
I can't see it anymore, because
that's become my normal.

00:13:31.667 --> 00:13:34.000
And it's interesting, because
if you were to clean it up

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.800
for about 30 days,
let's say, you'd

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.520
make an imprint of a clean spot.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.470
And now, if there
was any rubbish,

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:40.303
it's like, someone's
put some rubbish there.

00:13:40.303 --> 00:13:41.980
And it's really
interesting how habits

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.160
are formed through the
visual relationship

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.612
that we have with cities.

00:13:46.612 --> 00:13:48.820
So I wanted to explore that
with some of my students,

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.110
and I did that.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.820
And the informal sector of
waste and how, where it goes.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:54.880
There was a whole black
market of waste, which

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.940
we picked up on and documented.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.530
But then what I wanted to do
was give them an opportunity.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.030
And also a lot of the
people that lived in

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:05.470
Ahmedabad an
opportunity to explore

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.740
what it meant to be
inspired by a fellow Indian.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.790
No, not a foreigner.

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.248
No, not someone
that you could say,

00:14:11.248 --> 00:14:13.360
well, they went to
Harvard University.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.730
But somebody that
could have been

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:19.180
a neighbor down the street.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.910
And it was like, wow, how do I
find people that could inspire

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:23.590
them and that they
could explore what

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:27.239
it meant to be an Indian
living in today's India.

00:14:27.239 --> 00:14:29.530
But those who were actually
challenging the same things

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:30.930
that they were living
through, but ignoring,

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.410
and that was a blind spot.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:33.990
So I picked some
incredible people.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.460
I don't know if
you remember, there

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.974
was a documentary recently
where the edible spoons.

00:14:38.974 --> 00:14:40.390
You know, like
National Geographic

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:41.600
did like the edible spoons.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.590
And you know, how many single
use plastics do we use?

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.360
But this guy came
along and said,

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.890
forget throwing them away.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.750
Let's make them edible.

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.380
And so he created these
lentil-based spoons and things

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:54.920
that people could
actually eat with.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.430
And so we invited him over
to be one of the speakers.

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:59.710
And I kind of wanted
a Ted style, you know,

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:01.872
inspirational 20 minutes
that you can explore.

00:15:01.872 --> 00:15:03.580
What have I done with
some of the biggest

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.820
challenges of India?

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.360
And that was the
first talk series

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:11.720
that we created in January,
followed by Maker Fest.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.570
So you know, we really want
to go into the grassroots

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.730
innovation and bring that out.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:21.380
So really, one of my
inspirations from childhood

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.954
has been Sir David Attenborough.

00:15:22.954 --> 00:15:24.870
I don't know if you
remember him from England.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.510
You might remember his voice.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:29.270
And it was the-- he's
documenting the way that people

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.520
live, Planet Earth, you know.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.970
He'll talk about the story and
the narrative behind the way

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.319
that this animal is doing this.

00:15:36.319 --> 00:15:37.610
And look at the way that he is.

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:38.990
And the reason
why he's doing it.

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:43.030
And it was this beautiful
narrative, Planet Earth.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.770
But I completely get
what he's saying here.

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.870
And that is that
no one will protect

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:50.240
what they don't care
about, and no one

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.310
will care about what they
have never experienced.

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:55.700
So how do we create these
physical experiences?

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.190
Because I think an education
and experience is not just

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.780
in the head, right?

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.300
If it was, then
I'd just give you

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.200
some kind of augmented
reality or virtual reality.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.090
And you live there.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:09.180
And I'm sure you'll get
some physical repercussions

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.740
of that relationship, too.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.250
So one of the things that we
ended up doing in Goa this year

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:18.300
was to question-- where
can you hide waste?

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.520
Where is it on Earth
you can put it?

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.050
Can I put it under your desk?

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.027
And the lady says no.

00:16:24.027 --> 00:16:25.110
Can I put it in your room?

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:26.110
I mean, you're the
one who bought it.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:26.950
You keep it.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:29.399
Not my responsibility, why
are you giving it to me?

00:16:29.399 --> 00:16:30.940
No, I'm not going
to keep it my room.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:31.440
Why not?

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.620
It's yours!

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.280
See if you were to live with
your waste for one week,

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.280
in your room, in your
bedroom, like turn around,

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.375
[SPITTING NOISE],,
where would you go?

00:16:39.375 --> 00:16:42.867
For how long could you live
with your own waste, right?

00:16:42.867 --> 00:16:45.450
And it's interesting, because
if I were to put all of my waste

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:46.920
on a mountain,
right, I don't know

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.211
how big that mountain would be.

00:16:48.211 --> 00:16:50.500
And I've started to
realize, oh, my god.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:51.600
Where is that going?

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.520
So where are we
hiding our waste?

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.290
And so that is a question.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.199
We then put a whole
installation together.

00:16:57.199 --> 00:16:59.490
And the Indian government
was really impressed with it.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:01.698
They asked us, can we make
it permanent installation?

00:17:01.698 --> 00:17:04.770
So they gave us a
shipping container,

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.109
and then we painted
it all black.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:10.500
We put these
incredible UV sort of--

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.540
using blacklight sort
of paints in there,

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.339
and then we took
them on a minijourney

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:16.170
around this installation.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:20.040
And the point of it was
what is a seahorse doing

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.510
holding a straw?

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.569
It's, like, why are there
plastics in the ocean?

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:25.932
Who does the sea belong to?

00:17:25.932 --> 00:17:27.390
And then as you go
through, there's

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:31.969
like a very kiddie friendly and
adult friendly sort of dialogue

00:17:31.969 --> 00:17:33.510
that we create with
people as they're

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.100
going through the installation.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.641
Got to a point at
the back where they

00:17:36.641 --> 00:17:40.490
had all these
beautiful jellyfish,

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:42.030
and they're just
jellyfish, right?

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.380
And you're looking at the
back, and you're, like, wow,

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.119
the kids are like
they're jellyfish!

00:17:45.119 --> 00:17:46.410
Are you sure they're jellyfish?

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:46.909
Yes!

00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:48.210
They're jellyfish.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:50.070
And then I'm, like, wrong.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.372
And like you, this
turtle has no idea

00:17:52.372 --> 00:17:53.580
that that is not a jellyfish.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.111
It's a plastic bag.

00:17:55.111 --> 00:17:56.610
And so it is really
this opportunity

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.656
that I had to
question the plastics,

00:17:58.656 --> 00:18:00.530
but through the lifestyles
that we're living.

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.060
And I think just on
the right-hand side

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.970
of this picture, you'll
get to see the shrine

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.680
that I put together for all of
the different kinds of plastics

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.960
that anyone could have had.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.020
So then turned to them and said,
oh, is this your plastic bag?

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:13.710
I don't know!

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:14.880
Could it be?

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.180
Could it be mine?

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.802
You know, is that your straw?

00:18:17.802 --> 00:18:20.010
And then to sort of explore
this dialogue of plastics

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:22.867
and plastic diet, it's
like a plastic footprint.

00:18:22.867 --> 00:18:24.450
And then the other
thing that I really

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:27.420
want to explore through this
installation was microplastics.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:30.580
We talk about plastics
being in the ecosystem.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.710
But are we consuming
that plastic, too?

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.190
And there is research in
so many different countries

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:36.024
now, India as well--

00:18:36.024 --> 00:18:37.523
AUDIENCE: There's
a documentary that

00:18:37.523 --> 00:18:39.665
says that scientists
couldn't find a single water

00:18:39.665 --> 00:18:42.165
sample from the entire world
that doesn't have microplastics

00:18:42.165 --> 00:18:43.500
in it.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.930
TIA KANSARA HON FRIBA: That's
shocking and scares me.

00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:48.750
So what he said was that
scientists cannot find a single

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.540
sample of water around the
world that doesn't have plastic

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:52.620
inside it.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:55.260
Now what's really interesting,
and most of our water bodies

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.380
are completely connected,
in most of our water bodies,

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.470
a lot of that plastic
comes together.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:02.370
And that's why we
got these big, like,

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.740
Ellen MacArthur has
traveled around the world

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.050
and found out that there's
huge garbage patches which

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.000
are the size of countries.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.490
Like, there's one the size
of France floating about.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:12.990
And there's no sun
that goes through

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:16.140
to photosynthesize the algae.

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.640
But what's really
fascinating for me

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.520
is that microplastics
that break down are

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.380
found in the underwater.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.615
But they're also
found in the animals.

00:19:24.615 --> 00:19:26.580
And they're also found in us.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.790
And what's that stage where the
plastic that we're putting out

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.097
in the world comes back and
hits us into our stomachs?

00:19:33.097 --> 00:19:34.680
I wonder if there
is a way that now we

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.172
can actually start analyzing
how many plastics exist in us.

00:19:37.172 --> 00:19:38.880
There's a bit of a
grim story, I suppose,

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.080
and "The Times of
India" picked up on it

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:41.820
and said that there
are some things

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.040
that we should be
able to communicate

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.410
through an installation.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:48.450
The Hindostan waste plant
has put that installation

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:49.170
on their ground.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:51.480
So if any of you are
ever going to Goa,

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.310
you are welcome to
go and visit it.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.500
But the point of the
insulation wasn't-- oh, my god,

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.570
plastics are taking
over the world.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.850
It was what are the three
things that you can do, now

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:01.620
that you walk out of
here, that can have

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:03.510
a huge impact on Planet Earth?

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:05.640
One of them, say
no to plastic bags,

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.550
like single use plastic
bags or straws, right?

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:09.460
Get your own straw.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.040
And just like when you're
about to order your food--

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.456
and I've got preferences, I
don't like onions, let's say--

00:20:13.456 --> 00:20:14.950
then you tell people, don't you?

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.620
You say, order that pizza
without onions, please.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.999
In the same way, order my
drink without a plastic straw.

00:20:19.999 --> 00:20:21.540
And now that I've
started doing that,

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.331
I remember there was
a cafe down the street

00:20:23.331 --> 00:20:24.480
from the installation.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.210
People will at me and say,
you don't want a straw?

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.126
I said, you know what?

00:20:27.126 --> 00:20:28.020
Do me a favor.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:30.240
Don't give anyone
this week a straw.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.960
But keep them there.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.930
Keep the straws there,
but don't give it to them.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:36.916
If they ask for it, they
know where to find it.

00:20:36.916 --> 00:20:39.040
So that's one step that
you could take that reduces

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.240
the amount of plastic.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.060
But also, instead of having
multiple plastic bottles

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:47.920
for water, how about if you had
one refillable water bottle,

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.570
right, and one of
those big containers

00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:50.830
that you can actually
just refill instead

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.030
of having plastic bottles.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.777
And every single day, I don't
know how many of these plastic

00:20:54.777 --> 00:20:56.110
bottles we seem to be consuming.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.450
So the point of it
wasn't how awful

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.770
are we-- guilt tripping them.

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.978
But actually getting them
to a point of saying, well,

00:21:01.978 --> 00:21:07.130
what can I do, now that I
can tangibly take that away.

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:11.080
So now I'm moving into this
whole idea of dialogue.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:14.210
A lot of the communication
that we've been given

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:17.100
is, I find, traumatizing.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.510
Makes me feel awful.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:22.370
I just want to like climb
underneath a blanket and cry.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:25.550
But what to do to have
this conversation?

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.210
How did we get there?

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:31.430
This is, like, imagine if every
single person on Planet Earth

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:33.740
could have a
replenish lifestyle,

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.560
could actually benefit
Planet Earth in some way.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.080
It's a dual thing.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.190
Number one is how do
we have that dialogue.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:45.440
I don't know if any of
you have been recipients

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.370
of trolling on online.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:47.450
But I have.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:49.052
And it feels horrible, you know?

00:21:49.052 --> 00:21:50.510
It's, like, why
are you doing this?

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:52.490
And you've never met me.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.490
And you've got an opinion
on who I am as a person.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:58.340
But that kind of dialogue
and the relationship

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.100
that we have with one another,
I think, is really important.

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.183
Because imagine if, like,
we're sitting at dinner,

00:22:03.183 --> 00:22:05.150
and three of you have
got your phones out.

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:07.108
And your mom's sitting
there, and saying, well,

00:22:07.108 --> 00:22:08.024
put your phones away.

00:22:08.024 --> 00:22:09.440
Was there a
conversation we should

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.260
have had at the beginning
to then get to a point

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.930
where, at dinner, agreed--

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:16.010
negotiations over here.

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:17.640
We're compromising
on this table.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.850
We're not going to
have phones, fine.

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:20.912
Cool.

00:22:20.912 --> 00:22:24.350
Do it before, do it after,
but not at the dinner table.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:26.300
Now that you've had
this conversation, that

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.050
is the foundation, the
process that you're

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:30.230
going to use for
that dialogue that

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:32.690
is important for a lot
of the technology that

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:34.270
is coming into our lives.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.726
So in the same
way, a lot of 4.0,

00:22:37.726 --> 00:22:39.350
so many different
kinds of technologies

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:41.250
are actually on market.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.130
But is there a
point where we need

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:46.880
to learn how to best
dialogue with each other

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:52.700
to form some social parameters,
some kind of conversations,

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.160
nonviolent communication,
that can actually

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.920
get us on par with where
we need to go next?

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.380
And how do we have
that conversation?

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.630
So I'd like to say, at the
beginning of this year,

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.380
I came together with DX
Labs, based in San Francisco.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:08.430
They work with
Singularity as well.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:10.520
And one of the things
that I really wanted to do

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.250
was write an article, a
story, about what would happen

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:15.770
if you lived with a neuro link.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:21.900
If you, let's say, were
completely online with a brain.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.690
I mean a lot of
that technology has

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:25.870
come into some sort of
research laboratories.

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.920
And I kind of
imagine what it would

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.162
feel like to have a
brain machine interface.

00:23:31.162 --> 00:23:33.620
But instead of getting to the
point where having opinions--

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:37.430
for some reason, stories,
like, really cool stories,

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.430
like, sci-fi stories
and videos and movies,

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:44.160
can allow us to ask those
questions in a safe space.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:46.310
So I started to write.

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.770
And on Medium, I
wrote this post,

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:51.250
"Replenish, the Convergence
of AI and Ecology."

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:52.640
And there's two parts.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.598
And I'd love to know what
you thought about it.

00:23:54.598 --> 00:23:56.720
But what was, for
me, really intriguing

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.240
is that there
comes a point where

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.190
technology and nature merge.

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:02.750
Imagine-- you know,
you might know

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.900
Meow-Meow, who's got a
biometric scanner in his arm.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.840
And then he sort of
uploads the data.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.610
So we're coming to that
point of quantified self.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.740
I've got a Fitbit on me.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:16.100
We're getting to that point
where we're merging with tech.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:20.240
And at that point,
at what point, yeah--

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.250
where do we become
the technology

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:24.774
that we're also
introducing into our lives?

00:24:24.774 --> 00:24:26.690
And it's a really
interesting question for me.

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:28.940
Because imagine if
the whole of our brain

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:31.940
was uploaded onto the internet,
and that brain could then

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.550
be analyzed and your
thoughts analyzed

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:37.700
and whatever kind of
interesting behaviors we had

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.580
could, in some way, even be
controlled or manipulated?

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.154
But if we had an opportunity to
actually enhance that and put

00:24:43.154 --> 00:24:45.320
that forward, and we could
have a dialogue about it,

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.170
where would that dialogue go?

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:50.780
But also about this sort
of-- the automation,

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.050
I think, of life, the automation
of a lot of the challenges

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:55.250
that we've got.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.940
Where do we get to a point
where that automation becomes

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:03.170
with or without the direction
that we're giving it?

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:06.230
Here's some of the research
that we did on the whole brain.

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:08.180
But also, where would
we put that technology,

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.800
and having
conversations about it.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.010
And it's been really interesting
to explore this technology

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.350
through the lens of an
individual who would say,

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.270
I would never have
something like that done.

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.777
But to explore it through
a story is much easier.

00:25:19.777 --> 00:25:21.860
And so to have that
conversation, even though it's

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.080
not real, is almost
easier for people

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.910
to sort of interact with.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:30.030
So we talked about Industry
4.0 entering the market.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:33.170
But also, when it comes to the
sustainable development goals

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:35.150
that the United
Nations have launched,

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.980
was how much is
this industry worth?

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.120
Should we really
bother about it?

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:45.330
And the WEF has actually put
a sum, $2.5 trillion on it.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:48.770
I think the next step
is really to understand

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:51.110
where we can go with that.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:55.490
If you had $2.5 trillion
of a budget towards this,

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:57.344
where would we
direct our research?

00:25:57.344 --> 00:25:59.010
What kind of businesses
would we create?

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:01.040
What kind of cities
would we design?

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:06.350
So some of the work that I've
been doing here has been in--

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.620
I mentioned the Gulf
benchmark on energy.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.666
What that then led
to was an article,

00:26:12.666 --> 00:26:14.290
I think in "The Gulf"
or "The National"

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:16.150
that was too cold for comfort.

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:18.089
I feel physical buildings
being way too cold,

00:26:18.089 --> 00:26:19.630
and people are
getting ill from them.

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:21.160
And that was with the
National Bank of Abu Dhabi.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.050
Some of the work that
I've done, and trying

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:25.810
to explore whether it should
be a top down or a bottom up

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.010
approach.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.370
Where are these smart
cities taking us?

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:31.800
And where do we have an
opportunity to be part of that?

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.780
There was a project that I
did with the Premier of South

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.450
Australia, Jay
Weatherill, and it

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:41.020
was really about understanding
what does carbon negative mean,

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.760
or carbon neutral
mean, and where can we

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:44.420
push the boundaries of that?

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:49.030
So it's interesting,
because whoever we are,

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:51.700
are based on the
experiences that we've had.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.000
But when we start to combine
our knowledge and experiences,

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.480
we almost actualize a
community of knowledge,

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.950
like a collaboration.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:03.130
But it's going beyond that
that's really interesting

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:03.970
to understand.

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:06.190
How do we get to a point
where we can really

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:09.070
explore all of our learnings
together through this,

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:11.890
and with that, our fears?

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:14.530
And this really goes back to
a very interesting project

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.450
in the UK, which a
friend of mine has got.

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:18.820
His name is Simon Gosling.

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.930
And he's exploring
what smart means.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:23.410
So he brings people
into this future home

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:25.830
and explores the dialogues
that he's having with them.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:29.140
So if you're ever in London, I'd
love to introduce you to him.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.540
And this is a very
small project that I've

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.780
got with about 300
villages surrounding

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:37.570
Surat which is one of
the fastest growing

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:39.040
cities in India.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.230
But as you can see, one of
the big projects of India

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:45.220
is [INAUDIBLE],, which is about
that kind of ideal village,

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:47.554
and exploring what that means,
even though you walk down

00:27:47.554 --> 00:27:50.053
the street, and you've got these
piles and piles of rubbish.

00:27:50.053 --> 00:27:52.460
So how do we take this
whole replenish philosophy

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.060
and plug it into
the rural sector

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.700
and actually help
people to transition

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.626
to that kind of a lifestyle?

00:27:59.626 --> 00:28:01.000
Another thing that
I did recently

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.980
was in Brazil,
where we celebrated

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.140
a whole week of zero waste.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.180
And one of the most
exciting things that I saw

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:12.100
was an actual
supermarket that is 96%--

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.050
and it's a massive supermarket--

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:17.590
[INAUDIBLE] market
that is 96% zero waste.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:21.970
And you know, we developed and
designed some ideas for Lisbon

00:28:21.970 --> 00:28:23.970
being a zero waste city.

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:25.870
But I think we're
almost at that point

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:28.210
where a lot of cities
and a lot of companies

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:31.810
are actually taking on
much more practical levels

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:35.920
of appreciating and translating
this kind of philosophy.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.500
So you can find out more
about me on our newsletter.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:41.380
I normally kind of post
any new bits or new pieces

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.380
of information that I collect.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:48.550
The next steps for me really
are consolidating about 10

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:53.770
years' worth of travel and
understanding what is next.

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:56.366
Like, if we were to introduce
this whole economic paradigm,

00:28:56.366 --> 00:28:58.240
like, the World Replenish
Index, and you had,

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.823
at the back of your bottles, and
everything that you consumed,

00:29:00.823 --> 00:29:05.630
a Replenish indicator, would
you live a replenish diet?

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:07.930
And how much of that
would be your lifestyle?

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:11.110
You know how-- let's
say I'm vegan, right?

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:14.050
But I'm vegan in my
diet, not my lifestyle.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:17.860
How would I translate the
vegan to the lifestyle as well?

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.500
How do I translate
this lifestyle

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.930
into something that is
appropriate for Planet Earth?

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:24.250
So I'm exploring these things.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:25.810
I was really grateful
to have shared

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:29.069
some of my work with
you, but also some

00:29:29.069 --> 00:29:31.360
of the challenges and the
questions that are leading me

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.040
and the vision that
I've got for it.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:37.180
I really hope that in
maybe 10 to 20 years' time,

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:41.110
we can look back and say that
the planet that we live on

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:43.782
is an ecosystem
that we're part of.

00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:45.490
But it's an ecosystem
that we're together

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:51.160
with, that we can work together
on creating a replenish earth,

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.005
replenishing lifestyle from.

00:29:53.005 --> 00:29:56.680
And I think there's these
ideas almost of, like,

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.170
moving away from the
challenges of living

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:01.140
in a lifestyle like this.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.650
And maybe it's going backwards.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:04.600
You know, going to live
in a village in India

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.234
is not necessarily
the challenge.

00:30:06.234 --> 00:30:07.900
But exploring those
things in the cities

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.540
and the buildings and the
companies that we live

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:11.819
and work in.

00:30:11.819 --> 00:30:13.360
So thank you very
much for your time.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:21.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.610
- The floor is yours.

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:24.005
Any questions, please?

00:30:24.005 --> 00:30:25.130
TIA KANSARA HON FRIBA: Yes?

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:25.870
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:26.210
TIA KANSARA HON FRIBA: Hi.

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:26.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:27.790
Thank you for coming.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:30.925
Very inspiring story and
projects you're working on.

00:30:30.925 --> 00:30:32.300
TIA KANSARA HON
FRIBA: Thank you.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.820
AUDIENCE: My question
is around this.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:37.240
I find this is a
fascinating new challenge.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:40.850
Because from one side,
our actions as individuals

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:45.160
can individually impact
negatively Planet Earth.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:49.200
But we don't reap the benefit
unless we act collectively,

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.840
either at the local level or
at the country level, or even

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.440
at the Earth level.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.330
Which makes our action
remote, or the impact

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:00.384
remote from the action
that we do as individuals.

00:31:00.384 --> 00:31:06.170
And breaking this vicious
cycle of us doing good actions

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:09.332
and seeing the benefit
is very critical.

00:31:09.332 --> 00:31:11.444
Now there are a lot
of government actions,

00:31:11.444 --> 00:31:13.790
from a regulation point of
view which have been around,

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:18.540
effective or not, subject
to politics and economics,

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:24.140
and technology clearly has
some efficiency promise

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:25.211
for companies.

00:31:25.211 --> 00:31:27.416
But I love what you
mentioned about bringing it

00:31:27.416 --> 00:31:29.700
to an individual
level, and having

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:34.690
the index on every bottle
or on every product.

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.370
So my question for
you is that when

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:41.090
we see a calorie or
an organic label,

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:43.928
we link that to ourselves or
our individual [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:43.928 --> 00:31:46.790
But when we see a
replenish label,

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:51.130
we cannot relate it to
our individual well-being,

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:54.080
unless everyone
else sign up for it.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.835
How do you think are the most
interesting ideas and the most

00:31:57.835 --> 00:32:02.482
effective ones in relating more
of this index or similar labels

00:32:02.482 --> 00:32:06.350
to individual well-being,
being tangible or nontangible?

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:09.200
TIA KANSARA HON FRIBA: That's
such an interesting way

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:09.980
of seeing it.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.680
And I'm really grateful that you
brought this to our attention.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:14.840
Because I think that
individual, almost

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:18.380
like a per capita income-- who
cares about per capita income,

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:21.466
apart from the fact that I'm
part of this economy, right?

00:32:21.466 --> 00:32:23.840
Per capita income's got nothing
to do with me personally.

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.340
It's what the
government is actually

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.370
assigning to the
well-being, financially,

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:30.657
of this member who
lives in this country.

00:32:30.657 --> 00:32:32.240
So this is a very
interesting concept,

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:36.892
because now it identifies who
I am as an individual, right?

00:32:36.892 --> 00:32:38.600
The fact that I'm a
vegan has got nothing

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.730
to do with anybody else unless
if I'm going to go and tell

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.980
everybody that they should
stop eating meat because it

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.410
has a negative impact
on the environment.

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:48.179
But I could have a lifestyle
that is completely wrong.

00:32:48.179 --> 00:32:49.970
And that's really
interesting, because now,

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:53.610
with data, just like you would
do with your smartphone data

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:55.670
and what you're consuming
on an individual level,

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:58.760
imagine if that data backed
up who you were as a person.

00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.300
China's introducing already
this social indexing, right?

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:06.350
Imagine if each
person had some kind

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:10.460
of even account that
could bring them credit

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.290
for doing certain things.

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:14.270
And if maybe that
turned into money,

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:17.360
like a monetary taxation, right,
that you didn't have to pay.

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.750
Because hey, you don't
need to collect my rubbish.

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:22.730
I don't have any.

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:26.990
So now it turns this whole
idea of civic, right,

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:29.240
this whole community communal.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.860
If, let's say, in
China, for example,

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:36.500
that the hospital that is all
about preventative health,

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.070
right--

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:40.550
it's not about how many
chemicals and medicines can

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:42.260
I have now that I've got ill.

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:45.032
But it's how do I stop you from
getting ill in the first place?

00:33:45.032 --> 00:33:46.490
I think that's the
kind of approach

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:48.080
that we need to take
for Planet Earth,

00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:51.260
how do we stop her getting
ill in the first place?

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:53.270
And how in on an
individual scale,

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:56.150
can we incentivize
individuals that we are

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:57.530
part of that global ecosystem?

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.000
This is the biggest challenge.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.300
Because if you can crack
that, you've cracked it all.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.250
Because on that
individual level,

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:07.430
you need to know how
much you've done.

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:08.820
I'm selfish.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:09.320
You know?

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.989
If I spent more
money on creating,

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:14.120
maybe a LEED platinum
building, or whatever

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:19.000
rating system, Pearl 5, I want
to get some benefit from that.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.929
And that might be
an ego thing, right,

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:22.040
but it depends on
the consciousness

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:22.790
of the individual.

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:25.835
Perhaps I don't need you to
tell me that I've done well.

00:34:25.835 --> 00:34:27.710
So it depends on the
person and the community

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:30.889
at the time of how that
incentivization scheme could

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:31.639
work.

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:36.230
But I could totally see that
some kind of economic benefits,

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:38.870
tariffs, quotas that
you could meet that

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:42.409
could actually reduce, not just
the global sort of parameters,

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:43.909
but a local parameter.

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:46.909
Imagine that, in the UK,
we've got the Bristol pound.

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:50.190
We've got currency
in a certain locale.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:51.429
Now that I've got the--

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:54.270
the Bristol pound and the
British pound are equal.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:57.432
They are equally
used in Bristol.

00:34:57.432 --> 00:34:59.390
But the fact that I've
now got a local currency

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:01.765
means that my currency remains
within Bristol, because it

00:35:01.765 --> 00:35:03.290
can't be used in London.

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:08.606
So it's like a localization
of a global issue.

00:35:08.606 --> 00:35:10.730
I don't know if that really
answered your question.

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:12.650
I wasn't meaning to
answer the question,

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:14.244
but add a few more
thoughts to it.

00:35:14.244 --> 00:35:16.160
Because I don't think
anyone's got the answer.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.128
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:20.128 --> 00:35:22.112
TIA KANSARA HON FRIBA: Yes?

00:35:22.112 --> 00:35:31.536
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:31.536 --> 00:35:33.024
AUDIENCE: There's a question.

00:35:33.024 --> 00:35:34.414
Are you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:34.414 --> 00:35:36.330
TIA KANSARA HON FRIBA:
I am not at the moment.

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:37.380
I'm trying.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.210
So for example,
I don't eat meat.

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:40.020
I don't eat fish.

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.860
That's one thing that
I'm trying to do.

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.380
The second thing is, I
don't buy anything anymore.

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:45.666
I borrow things instead.

00:35:45.666 --> 00:35:47.040
So instead of
buying more things,

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.190
like, if you go into my home,
I've got all these books.

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:50.650
I don't know what
to do with them.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:52.980
And so what I'm doing is
giving those books away.

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.920
Trying to understand, like, OK,
if I want to acquire knowledge,

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.390
how best do I do that?

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:00.060
So I'm picking different
aspects of my lifestyle

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:01.650
and exploring what I can do.

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:03.540
So for example,
with replenishing,

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:05.670
I'm finding ways
that I can sequester.

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:07.910
Where can I, perhaps,
not have a straw?

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:10.020
So through my
behavior, I'm trying

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.410
to figure out how I can live
a much more negative, carbon

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:14.700
negative lifestyle?

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.050
But also, what are the metrics?

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:19.830
Like, if you look at some of the
carbon sequestration metrics,

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:22.329
it's like, oh, if we
plant another five trees,

00:36:22.329 --> 00:36:23.370
we're going to get there.

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:26.130
No, we're not, because five
trees that you've taken down

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.900
are full fledglings.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:31.020
They're completely grown and
their sequestering capacity

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.709
is not the same as a sapling.

00:36:32.709 --> 00:36:34.500
And these are some of
the kind of questions

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.840
that I'm asking not only
myself, but exploring

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.920
through new products
that are on the market.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.120
And exploring, hey, these
are the alternatives.

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:44.940
So through my own learnings,
I'm posting a lot of that

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:46.215
through a Facebook group.

00:36:46.215 --> 00:36:48.340
So that when I'm learning
something, I'm like, wow,

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.570
that's really cool.

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:53.310
I don't expect to be carbon
neutral or negative today.

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:56.010
I expect to be
there, transitioning

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:59.170
to it, with a mindful
step by step process.

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:01.720
It's, like, from now, from
one step to the other,

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.720
you're probably not going
to become a nonsmoker.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.470
But you're probably
going to take measures

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:08.347
to sort of reduce the amount
of impact of certain chemicals

00:37:08.347 --> 00:37:09.180
that you might have.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:12.540
Or you might go towards a
natural tobacco, let's say.

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.220
That there are
different measures

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.700
that you can take for it.

00:37:19.957 --> 00:37:21.312
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:21.312 --> 00:37:22.620
Question for [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.175
I think your cause is probably
one of the noblest answers

00:37:25.175 --> 00:37:28.390
to the why of [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:29.851
So thanks for sharing.

00:37:29.851 --> 00:37:31.226
TIA KANSARA HON
FRIBA: Thank you.

00:37:31.226 --> 00:37:33.590
AUDIENCE: Elon Musk and his
work-- he does two things,

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:35.470
and I think they're
complete things.

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:37.900
One is trying to make
life on the planet better,

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.076
with solar power and
solar powered cars.

00:37:41.076 --> 00:37:44.282
And on the other end, trying
to start a colony on Mars

00:37:44.282 --> 00:37:48.200
as sort of a safety net for
in case Plan A didn't work.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.044
What do you think
of that safety net?

00:37:50.044 --> 00:37:52.210
TIA KANSARA HON FRIBA: I
find it really interesting.

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:54.990
So he was in Adelaide at the
same time that I was there.

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:56.370
But he was promoting
this whole--

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:59.117
because we had a huge
blackout in South Australia.

00:37:59.117 --> 00:38:01.200
And because of that, through
a little Twitter sort

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.180
of understanding, there
was this huge project

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.471
that came about in [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:04.471 --> 00:38:05.970
And I think that these--

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:09.060
I'm going to call them hairy,
ambitious goals, right?

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:12.500
Going carbon negative or neutral
is a hairy, ambitious goal.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:15.810
And we've got to all plug in
different bits of knowledge

00:38:15.810 --> 00:38:17.610
and information
to understand what

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:18.900
the whole elephant looks like.

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:20.441
It's, like, I'm
blind, but I can feel

00:38:20.441 --> 00:38:22.020
the eyelashes of the elephant.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.120
So it's coming
together and knowing

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.490
that is what the
elephant is, that's one.

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:30.570
On his mission to Mars,
I think, you know--

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:31.350
I can take it.

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:32.960
Like, are you
trying to run away?

00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.836
You know, like--
you know that movie?

00:38:35.836 --> 00:38:37.710
What's the name of that
movie with that robot

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.780
that lives on Planet Earth,
and he's, like, packaging up

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:40.660
the waste and putting--

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:41.110
AUDIENCE: "WallE."

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:42.401
TIA KANSARA HON FRIBA: "WallE!"

00:38:42.401 --> 00:38:45.380
Imagine it's like "WallE"
where, in 50 years' time,

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:48.150
we're getting to a point
where we are living

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:51.390
the "WallE" lifestyle, getting
fat on some sort of hovering

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:51.990
device.

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:56.220
And just light pinging each
other on whatever Facebook

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.900
device we're going to be using.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.890
And I think we could
either take it that way,

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:04.040
or we could look at
it as a hairy goal.

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.350
Are we going to get
somewhere, if we

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:08.570
were to redirect our
attention to something that we

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:10.250
could actually do?

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:12.560
And if we could actually
do that, what then can

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.160
we actually do here?

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:20.570
And I think there is, maybe, a
small number of crazy people.

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:22.130
I think he's one of them.

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:23.820
But crazy in a good way.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:26.060
It's like saying that is
a challenge that I don't

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:28.520
think we can do, or can we?

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:31.110
And I think more than anything
I take that as a learning.

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:35.000
That my god-- if you can get
to Mars, what can't we do here?

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.780
And perhaps this
whole Mars mission

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.780
is, like, I'm going to
put some money towards it

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:40.154
because I can
afford it, he says.

00:39:40.154 --> 00:39:41.160
But it's not to do that.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.230
It's to bring our
attention to the fact

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:44.570
that if we were to spend
time and money on making

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:48.080
Earth better, we probably
wouldn't want to go there.

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.120
Or maybe we'd want
to go and explore it.

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.130
Just like going to
the moon was, like,

00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:54.380
we're going to go to the moon.

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:55.800
In 10 years' time, we
want to get to the moon.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.740
It was the fact that
we had 10 years' time.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:00.060
It was a confined time period.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:01.560
It was a huge task.

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.220
And that many people had to
come together to achieve that.

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:05.699
It's like Steve
Jobs, 10 years ago,

00:40:05.699 --> 00:40:07.490
brings out this platform
called the iPhone.

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:09.281
No one's ever heard of
a smartphone before.

00:40:09.281 --> 00:40:10.220
It's, like, what?

00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.730
But he didn't do it alone.

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:15.320
He created something that
came from an ecosystem of all

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.225
of his military and
academic research that

00:40:17.225 --> 00:40:19.920
had gone into making
the iPhone possible.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.467
I think this is where
someone like Elon Musk is.

00:40:22.467 --> 00:40:24.050
Who, like me, travels
around the world

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:27.260
and doesn't really have a home,
because Planet Earth is home.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.816
And it's, like, how do you
create some kind of association

00:40:30.816 --> 00:40:32.690
to these kinds of
challenges that we globally

00:40:32.690 --> 00:40:34.040
need to be aware of?

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.420
And I remember
this conversation.

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.045
I've kind of taking
a bit of a tangent,

00:40:37.045 --> 00:40:38.714
but I hope you'll appreciate it.

00:40:38.714 --> 00:40:40.130
I sat next to this
girl in London.

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:41.570
We're having a cup of tea.

00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:43.370
And she says, Tia,
I don't really

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:44.900
care what happens in China.

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.059
What sustainability?

00:40:46.059 --> 00:40:48.350
And I said, you don't care
about what happens in China.

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:51.700
I want you to go home,
turn everything around,

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:54.650
have a look at the "Made In",
and tell me what percentage

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:56.360
of your things come from where.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.930
She said, I did that--

00:40:57.930 --> 00:40:58.735
60%.

00:40:58.735 --> 00:41:01.022
I said, do you, or
do you not have,

00:41:01.022 --> 00:41:03.230
even if it's just economic,
do you or do you not have

00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:06.000
a relationship with China then?

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.484
Does your demand
for these things,

00:41:07.484 --> 00:41:09.900
whether you like it or not,
and there are no alternatives,

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:13.769
perhaps, have something to do
with what happens in China?

00:41:13.769 --> 00:41:15.060
And I think this is what it is.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.790
How can we make it
visible, but not

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:19.650
make people feel guilty from it.

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:20.770
And that's the challenge.

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:25.530
How do we positively reinforce,
with alternatives and fun

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:27.850
innovations and cool
ways of doing it?

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:30.361
And I think maybe
he's a bit bonkers.

00:41:30.361 --> 00:41:31.110
Who am I to judge?

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:37.537
AUDIENCE: So on
that note, I don't

00:41:37.537 --> 00:41:39.162
know if you agree
but humans are, like,

00:41:39.162 --> 00:41:41.484
a selfish species where--

00:41:41.484 --> 00:41:43.400
TIA KANSARA HON FRIBA:
Oh, "The Selfish Gene,"

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.600
by Richard Dawkins.

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.362
Here we go.

00:41:45.362 --> 00:41:46.206
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:46.206 --> 00:41:49.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] we're
prone to be addicted to things.

00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:51.493
And we're addicted
to feeling good.

00:41:51.493 --> 00:41:53.243
And if it makes me
feel good to throw away

00:41:53.243 --> 00:41:54.743
a piece of plastic
spoon and I don't

00:41:54.743 --> 00:41:59.730
have to wash it after every time
I eat, how are you going to--

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:03.269
once people have tasted that
feeling of goodness, right,

00:42:03.269 --> 00:42:05.061
how are you going to
get them away from it?

00:42:05.061 --> 00:42:06.144
TIA KANSARA HON FRIBA: OK.

00:42:06.144 --> 00:42:08.060
AUDIENCE: Especially
if they might

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:10.190
argue that I'm not
really, in my lifetime,

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:12.986
going to see the consequences
of what I'm doing?

00:42:12.986 --> 00:42:15.599
That's the greedy part.

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:17.890
TIA KANSARA HON FRIBA: I can
say one thing, definitely.

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:19.440
Who seeded that
idea in your head?

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:23.850
AUDIENCE: Personal experience.

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:24.950
TIA KANSARA HON FRIBA: Could
be personal experience,

00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:26.200
but it could be anyone, right?

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:27.960
At any stage,
somebody in society,

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:32.380
or through subconscious
messaging has got us,

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:35.950
me included, to believe
something that is the case.

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:37.650
There is no status quo.

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:41.010
Therefore, everything
can be questioned.

00:42:41.010 --> 00:42:42.090
The way that we live--

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:43.710
I learned this when
I was in Japan.

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:46.212
I remember coming from
England, 22 years old,

00:42:46.212 --> 00:42:47.670
just finished my
university degree.

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:50.250
Arrived in Japan, and
they say, this is wrong.

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:52.420
In England, OK, I'm
taking one example.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:54.420
In England, when you're
sitting next to somebody

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.590
that you don't know
at the bus stop,

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:57.089
you start talking
about the weather.

00:42:57.089 --> 00:42:59.355
But you'd normally
talk about how shit is.

00:42:59.355 --> 00:43:01.810
You're like, oh, the weather
is really bad, isn't it?

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:03.400
And somebody turns around
and is, like, yeah, god,

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.300
it's been raining all day.

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:05.426
That could be good as well.

00:43:05.426 --> 00:43:06.758
The weather's really good today.

00:43:06.758 --> 00:43:07.610
Oh, oh, it's lovely.

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:10.890
But it's an excuse to
have a chat with somebody.

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:12.870
Well, I went to
Japan, and I started

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:18.422
to use the negative to open up
dialogue, and it didn't work.

00:43:18.422 --> 00:43:19.380
I'm not being negative.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.870
It's just some--
and then I realized.

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:23.700
The way that I do
things isn't necessarily

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:26.334
right in another culture or
another place in the world,

00:43:26.334 --> 00:43:27.250
in other conversation.

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:28.249
It doesn't.

00:43:28.249 --> 00:43:30.540
Just because one way is right,
doesn't mean another way

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.800
is wrong, too.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:36.300
And I think that's a very
interesting psychological,

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:40.230
waiting or anchoring that
we've all been exposed to.

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:44.130
If you go back to, I think
it was the 1950s and '60s,

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:47.190
Edward Bernays was one of
the most incredible PR agents

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:48.600
at the time.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:52.131
What he did, Marlborough,
smoking company, went to him

00:43:52.131 --> 00:43:53.880
and said, we don't
have any women smokers.

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.230
What do we do about it?

00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:56.670
He went and did some research.

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:59.630
He found out that women felt
a certain way about smoking

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:01.320
and putting this
stick into the mouth

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.120
was something that
they didn't want to do.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:08.710
So then he explored how the
relationship and the sort

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:10.360
of branding behind it--

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.770
but explored what
does it mean for them.

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:16.060
Explored the meaning and how
he could shift that meaning

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:19.300
and made an
incredible difference.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:22.240
He hired 10 beautiful
women, the beginning

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:25.402
of the march for female freedom,
gave them all cigarettes,

00:44:25.402 --> 00:44:27.610
lit them up, called the
press, took some photographs,

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:28.380
and boom!

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:31.570
Did that one event have a
huge impact on the sales

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:34.360
that females were
smoking cigarettes for?

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:36.070
It's really interesting for me.

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:37.977
But the way that
we influence people

00:44:37.977 --> 00:44:40.060
and the psychological
messaging that we give them,

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:42.460
whether it's commercials,
whether it's data

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:45.220
that we analyze and show--

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.740
I think a lot of
that intention has

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:49.960
been set by someone
or something,

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.962
mostly for reasons of
their own causes, right?

00:44:52.962 --> 00:44:54.670
I'm going to try and
sell you a Coca-Cola

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:56.680
can no matter what
I can do, even

00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:01.252
if I'm stepping on a
Pepsi can in an advert.

00:45:01.252 --> 00:45:02.710
But I know, and
you know, that it's

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:04.793
got like huge amounts of
sugar and a chemical that

00:45:04.793 --> 00:45:08.260
stops my mouth exploring
that there is too much sugar

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:09.960
in my mouth.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.140
Is that fair or not fair?

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:12.840
Well, it's FDA approved.

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.300
OK, fine.

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.550
So it's really interesting how
a lot of that research now, all

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:19.980
of our experimentation
has allowed to us

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:22.680
may be becoming more conscious
about certain things, and not.

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.870
And I don't think
anything is written.

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:27.540
I think we have an opportunity
to explore everything.

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:29.989
Like a teacher that I used
to have in one of my classes

00:45:29.989 --> 00:45:30.780
when I was younger.

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:33.120
She used to say, well, that's
just the way that it is.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.130
And I'm saying, well,
I don't think so.

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:38.197
Well, something inside me
tells me it's not that way.

00:45:38.197 --> 00:45:40.780
But she would often say, well,
that's just the way that it is.

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.600
So it's interesting.

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:46.230
If you were to explore another
way of being, another language,

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:48.420
another narrative,
another identity,

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:52.360
and you had no holds
barred, who would you be?

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:58.268
You can be anyone.

00:45:58.268 --> 00:45:58.768
Sorry.

00:45:58.768 --> 00:46:00.684
AUDIENCE: Maybe
the last question.

00:46:00.684 --> 00:46:03.080
We are running out of time.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.976
TIA KANSARA HON FRIBA:
Where did the time go?

00:46:04.976 --> 00:46:07.530
AUDIENCE: I was very
interested in the index

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:09.470
you were talking about.

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:12.410
And I was wondering if, when
you took to, I don't know,

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:18.605
[INAUDIBLE] or
even annually could

00:46:18.605 --> 00:46:20.275
help implement this index.

00:46:20.275 --> 00:46:22.183
Is there a company
in the world that

00:46:22.183 --> 00:46:23.900
is interested in doing this?

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:26.840
Is it something that looks
completely idealistic

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.800
and is never going to happen?

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.740
And [INAUDIBLE] to happen.

00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:37.125
[INAUDIBLE] So what's
the state of this?

00:46:37.125 --> 00:46:39.250
TIA KANSARA HON FRIBA: It's
a really good question.

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:43.630
So Bhutan, this year,
launched the GNH business.

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:46.060
Bhutan introduced the
Gross National Happiness

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.860
index in the 1970s.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:51.100
And wanted to understand what if
the economy wasn't about money,

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:52.462
but it was about well-being?.

00:46:52.462 --> 00:46:54.670
And so they started to
explore this whole well-being.

00:46:54.670 --> 00:47:00.970
And I think it was 1970s onwards
is when, every three years, all

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:03.310
of this data was
collected to show

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:06.500
what was the state of
well-being in their country.

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.550
And then what they did was to
explore a happiness report.

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:12.160
And I think you may be aware
that many other countries

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.576
around the world
have been looking

00:47:13.576 --> 00:47:16.120
at well-being, British
government being one of them.

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.370
The UAE has been talking
about well-being as well,

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:20.830
happiness ministers,
very interesting sort

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:23.800
of understanding and
appreciation of well-being.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.941
Another thing that they've
recently launched last year,

00:47:26.941 --> 00:47:29.440
a couple of years ago they did
the Gross National Happiness,

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.610
seventh conference.

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:32.980
Or sixth conference-- this
year it was the seventh.

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:35.980
And they said, what if
businesses were also

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:37.534
aligned with this?

00:47:37.534 --> 00:47:39.075
And they said, OK,
well, you're going

00:47:39.075 --> 00:47:41.449
to be introducing this to
businesses already and probably

00:47:41.449 --> 00:47:42.940
taking a top down approach.

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:45.130
They took 40
different businesses

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:48.250
and asked them whether they were
approaching their businesses

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:51.220
with the kind of well-being
index within the context

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.890
of the products and services
and the employees that

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:58.580
work there, kind of, like,
the organizational structure.

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:02.390
And when this came
out, one of the things

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:04.850
that I suggested to the
Bhutanese [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:04.850 --> 00:48:07.417
but also their team at the
center of Bhutanese studies

00:48:07.417 --> 00:48:08.750
was you're doing the well-being.

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:11.750
Why don't you also do the
environmental side of it, too?

00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:15.470
So if you were to, like B corps,
analyze the whole business

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:17.690
and the impact that it had
on the environment as well

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:20.150
as the well-being, what kind
of a metric would you have?

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:22.160
You'd be the first in
the world to do it.

00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:24.200
So we're exploring
that together.

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.120
It's funny, actually.

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:27.010
You know, at the
beginning of the year

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:29.660
when I was writing
the convergence of AI

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:32.944
and ecology piece, I watched all
of the "Black Mirror" series.

00:48:32.944 --> 00:48:34.610
I don't know if you've
come across that.

00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:35.450
It was so much fun.

00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:36.724
I loved it.

00:48:36.724 --> 00:48:38.390
And one of the things
that I came across

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:42.470
was, if I could write
a piece for the future,

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:46.380
like 40 years, maybe even 30 or
10 years, of how this could be.

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:48.110
I went a bit crazy
and I wrote that.

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:52.100
It then became the preliminary
piece for the "Medium" article.

00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:55.820
But one of the things that I
wrote was, in two years' time--

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:57.680
and I wrote it as if
I was looking back.

00:48:57.680 --> 00:49:01.260
So two years ago, this
suggestion was made.

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:05.900
And then this was implemented at
the government level in Bhutan.

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.970
And it's interesting how
that is happening now.

00:49:07.970 --> 00:49:10.580
And I wonder if because
that intention was there,

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.905
that something like this
has actually manifested.

00:49:12.905 --> 00:49:15.380
I have a very interesting
relationship with intuition

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.700
and manifestation.

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:18.770
But many different
countries around the world

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:21.200
from a government level are
trying to introduce this.

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:25.160
Like in Goa, with the
installation they suggested--

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:29.970
2019-- what about if we had
a festival on zero waste?

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:33.360
Funny, because the festival that
we had this art installation

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:36.900
for a year ago, I suggested, how
about if we have our festival,

00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:38.400
a zero waste festival?

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:41.670
And they said, well, why
don't you do it first,

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:45.060
and then we'll see how, from
the evaluation, we could do it.

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:47.910
And it's funny that the
government is now suggesting--

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:49.410
completely unrelated,
the government

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:51.600
is suggesting we have
like zero waste festival.

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.820
But I think there
are pockets of people

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:56.020
coming together and doing
very interesting things.

00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.890
But for the World
Replenish Index

00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:01.312
at MIT last year in
December, I launched

00:50:01.312 --> 00:50:03.270
something called the
Replenish Business Canvas.

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:07.780
And I wanted to suggest that,
if every single startup, not

00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:09.949
[INAUDIBLE] company,
come to the end of it,

00:50:09.949 --> 00:50:11.490
and now I've got
some money, I'll put

00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:12.836
some money towards [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:12.836 --> 00:50:14.502
Uh huh.

00:50:14.502 --> 00:50:15.960
Right at the
beginning, when you're

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.850
formulating your
company, you could

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:21.360
say that this company is going
to be a zero waste company.

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.400
And where am I going
to get materials from?

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:27.480
So right at inception, you could
introduce this whole idea--

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:30.750
what kind of businesses
would we have in the future?

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:32.970
And I'm surprised, but
even at Harvard and MIT,

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:35.910
both of their MBA programs, as
well as Oxford Said business

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:38.190
school, do not have
enough case studies

00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:41.320
of businesses that have done
extremely well in this field.

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.680
So that's one of the projects
within the World Replenish

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:47.220
Index, to build on the case
studies of business model

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:51.690
innovation of where businesses
have done it, have made it.

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:53.580
So it's a lot of work.

00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:56.069
And I need a lot of help.

00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:57.360
Maybe some of you will help me.

00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:57.985
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:57.985 --> 00:51:00.410
[APPLAUSE]
