00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720
I never choose an audience I realized
 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.109
I never choose an audience I realized
that I'm I am a part of that audience

participating in a situation how my own

participating in a situation how my own
my presence is activated and what it

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210
my presence is activated and what it
 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.389
my presence is activated and what it
does to the situation how I'm involved

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399
does to the situation how I'm involved
 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.340
does to the situation how I'm involved
in whatever exchange is occurring and I

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350
in whatever exchange is occurring and I
 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.400
in whatever exchange is occurring and I
think when I realized that I'm a part of

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410
think when I realized that I'm a part of
 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.010
think when I realized that I'm a part of
a group then I think that's really when

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020
a group then I think that's really when
 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.710
a group then I think that's really when
the work begins often from observations

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720
the work begins often from observations
 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.730
the work begins often from observations
of repeated passes through an area I

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740
of repeated passes through an area I
 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.889
of repeated passes through an area I
start to notice the the landscape a

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899
start to notice the the landscape a
 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:15.380
start to notice the the landscape a
little more detailed and nuanced and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390
little more detailed and nuanced and
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.100
little more detailed and nuanced and
from that point I think the work starts

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110
from that point I think the work starts
 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.770
from that point I think the work starts

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780
to to take hold and so there's never
 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.140
to to take hold and so there's never
really an audience that's chosen as much

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150
really an audience that's chosen as much
 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.120
really an audience that's chosen as much
as a realization that I'm a part of this

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130
as a realization that I'm a part of this
 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.810
as a realization that I'm a part of this
audience and I also receive the benefits

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820
audience and I also receive the benefits
 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.719
audience and I also receive the benefits
of whatever sort of charity occurs

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729
of whatever sort of charity occurs
 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.080
of whatever sort of charity occurs
through the work I think that's

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
through the work I think that's
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:49.970
through the work I think that's
important for me to to be a part of it

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980
