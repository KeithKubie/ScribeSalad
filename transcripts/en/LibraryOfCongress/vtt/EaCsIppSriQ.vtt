00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.770
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Welcome to
the Africa Middle East division.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.270
And I'm Mary-Jane Deeb,
Chief of the division.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.110
And as many of you already
know this division is made

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.960
up of three sections.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.410
The Neary section, which is the
biggest section and it's headed

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.780
by Joan Weeks who just left to
see the investors coming up.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.460
And the African section,
and the [inaudible] section.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.870
Together we serve,
preserve, acquire materials

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.990
from 78 different countries in
the Middle East, Central Asia,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.420
the Caucasus, and the
entire continent of Africa.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.080
And our ambassador has arrived.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.650
So hello. Hi Ambassador.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.950
&gt;&gt; Rana F. Nejem: Hi, how are you?

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.250
&gt;&gt; Sit down.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.550
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Okay.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.850
Okay. Please have a seat.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.180
Yeah. That's it.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.560
Yeah. Please, please have a seat.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.910
Okay. Welcome, welcome, welcome.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.350
We just now, just now and I was
saying something about our division

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.260
and our [inaudible] division
is made up of three sections,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:37.060
and the Neary section is the
largest in terms of staff.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.350
We also serve materials, as I
was saying from the Middle East,

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.110
Central Asia, the Caucasus, and
the entire continent of Africa,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:53.020
as well as [inaudible]
materials from the entire world.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.030
We're very active developing
collections, serving our patrons

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.900
in this reading room,
responding to queries

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.380
through our Oscar librarian system.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.040
Briefing visitors coming from
all the countries of our regions.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.070
In fact, John just had
a group of visitors

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.450
from Kyrgyzstan this morning
organizing programs, symposia,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.820
displays, exhibits,
workshops, and so on.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.260
And we also invite scholars
and experts who have research

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.860
and done work in our areas
of responsibility to share

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.600
with us their insights
and their findings,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.220
so that all of us attending
these programs

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.110
and participating leave
enriched with new information

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.020
and a better understanding
of the cultures

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.620
and societies whose
publications we collect and serve.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.540
A case in point of course is
our speaker today, Rana Nejem,

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.400
who will be talking
about her new book,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.420
When in the Arab World an
Insider's Guide to Living

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.760
and Working With Arab Culture.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.160
And she will be introduced by Arab
world's specialist, Nawal Kawar.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.790
But before we start, I just
want to say how delighted I am

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.690
that among us today is Ambassador
Dina Kawar, who I was very familiar

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.980
with on television and
many of you would be to,

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.000
who was appointed Ambassador
Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.740
of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
to the United States in June 2016.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.610
She served as the permanent
representative of Jordan

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.260
to the United Nations from
August 2014 through June 2016.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.210 position:56%
She has led the Jordanian delegation
during Jordan's non-permanent

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.280
membership of the United Nations
Security Council from 2014 to 2015,

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.330
and became the first Arab woman
to ever preside over the council.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.510
In February 2016 she was
appointed by the president

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.830
of the General Assembly
as a co-facilitator

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.610
for the high level meeting of the
plenary of the General Assembly

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.670
on the large movement of refugees
and migrants from the Near East

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.640
and Africa, an issue which is
very close to my own heart.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:17.180
But now to introduce Rana Nejem is
Arab word specialist Nawal Kawar.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.800
And yes they are related.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:29.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nawal Kawar: Thank you Mary-Jane.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.840
Rana Nejem, we are
really very pleased

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.370
to have our guest speaker all
the way from Amman Jordan.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.740
Author, social and
cultural intelligence coach,

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.170
Rana Nejem started out her career

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.140
as a broadcast journalist
with Jordan Television.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.270
After working with CNN during
the first Gulf War she moved

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.070 position:56%
to the Royal Hashemite Court where
she was responsible for his majesty,

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.370
the late King Hussein International
Media Department for two years.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.350
Rana then moved into the
field of communications

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.850
and public relations
leading the public diplomacy

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.490
and communications work

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.760
of the British Embassy
in Amman for 18 years.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.080
Throughout her career, whether
it was formulated communication

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.870
strategies, advising
diplomats and business people

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.360
on cross cultural communications,
conducting interviews with heads

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.010
of state or making arrangements
for royal visits and VIP events,

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.740
intercultural intelligence

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.010
and business protocol were always
an essential part of her work.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.130
Rana learned firsthand from
top professionals in the field,

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.920
and put it all into practice
throughout her career.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:55.460
Rana founded her own company in
2013 called Yarnu, Y-A-R-N-U,

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.120
an Arabic word meaning
to look towards to aspire

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.880
to with calm and serenity.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.800
Yarnu helps people to distinguish
themselves by raising their social

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.950
and cultural intelligence
enabling them to float with ease

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.730
and confidence from one
situation to the other.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.120
Yarnu has since been
coaching, training,

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.770
and advising business executives,
diplomats, and officers,

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.690
refined their professional
profile, increase the impact

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.410
of their personal presence,

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.700
and raise their intercultural
intelligence.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.880
In other words, sensitivity
to the Arab culture.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.090
She has also been helping
organizations build

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.010
and strengthen the foundation
of their corporate culture.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.780
Her first book, When in the Arab
World, An Insider's Guide to Living

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.870
and Working With Arab
Culture was published

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.950
in the United Kingdom on May 2016.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.890
She is regularly invited
to speak on the subject

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:57.220
of cross cultural communications.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.400
Rana carries a master's degree
in international communications

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.360
and negotiations from the Fletcher
School of Law and Diplomacy,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.240
and is certified as an
international etiquette consultant

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.500
by the International Etiquette
and Protocol Academy in London.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.610
Rana was also trained by the
Protocol School of Washington

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.300
in international protocol
management, and is a trained coach

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.600
in intercultural intelligence.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.510
Please help me welcome Rana Nejem.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:31.370
[ Applause ]

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.400
&gt;&gt; Rana Nejem: Thank you so much,
and thank you for being so patient

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.380
and for waiting here with us.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:45.140
When I first started working --

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:51.520
actually during my
last couple of years,

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.170
few years at the British Embassy

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.780
in Amman my sixth British
ambassador I served with walked

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:04.920
into my office one day and it was
just two weeks after he had arrived

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.870 position:56%
to Jordan to take up his post there.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.220
And he announced to me, "Well Rana,

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.260
I have just been asked
to take part in Hajaha.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.520
Can you please tell me
what this is all about?

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.540
I've already committed."

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.000
Now of course he had no idea
what he was getting himself into.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.310
As when there was a British
national, a British gentleman

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:33.840 position:56%
who was living and working in Jordan
fell in love with a Jordanian girl

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:40.250 position:56%
who comes from a quite a big tribal
family there, and they wanted to ask

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.550
for her hand in marriage.

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:43.960
And the British man didn't
have any of his family there.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.210
So he asked the ambassador
to sit in for that,

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.150
and to be part of his Jaha.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:53.590
Just to give you a bit of an
idea of how daunting this was.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:09:01.580 position:56%
This is what it looks like where the
elders and the most important people

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.780
in the groom's family get
together, and they meet the elders

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:10.810 position:56%
and the most important people of the
bride's family, and then they ask

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.730
for their hand in marriage.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:17.310
And it's something as formal
as this, and as big as this.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:21.360
Now of course all of his diplomatic
training did not prepare him

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:25.590
for Ajaha, and so we
worked together.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.680
He was well-prepared on
what he needed to do,

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.740
how he needed to greet people, how
he had to handle the cup of coffee

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.460
that was going to be
presented to him.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.590
And at the end of it
he actually ended

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.140
up really enjoying the experience.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.690
But the most important thing
is that this set the tone

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:50.550
for the rest of his stay in Jordan.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:57.530
When he was seen to be doing the
correct thing and had just arrived,

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:00.410
it really set the tone and
made the rest of his stay

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.970
in the country so much easier.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:09.230
Now the world does seem
to be getting smaller.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:15.650
The media and communications and
through the whole technology seems

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.350
to be making the world a smaller
place, and seems to be unifying

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.420
in unifying us in many ways.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.080
Still culture will never disappear.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.820
On the contrary, the more
open the world becomes,

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.840
the more important culture becomes.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:39.490
A recent Harvard study
quoted that up to 40%

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:45.500
of international business
ends up in failure and 70%

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:50.310
of those reasons is due to
cultural misunderstandings.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.500
So that is why in this time and
age being culturally intelligent,

00:10:54.500 --> 00:11:01.530
being culturally aware is a crucial
skill that's no longer a luxury.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:06.330
So a lot of culturalists and
sociologists have likened culture

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:11.980
to either an iceberg or a
hippopotamus underwater.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.850
Eighty percent of its
mass is hidden,

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:20.080
it's covered underneath the water,
and culture is exactly like that.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:25.870
It's in that hidden part lies
all the foundations, the values,

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:30.940 position:56%
the beliefs, that drive our
behavior, that make us see the world

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:36.610
in a certain way and to determine
what is appropriate, what is not,

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:40.080 position:56%
what is acceptable, and what is not.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.020
And it is in that part
where culture lies.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.680
So what does that mean to us?

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:55.270
The reality of the matter is
that there is no impartial ground

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.190
from which to interpret reality.

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:08.160
The fact is we see the world
as we are, not as it is.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.380
Our beliefs our values all of those
things that we carry on the inside

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:19.090 position:56%
and that are affected by our culture
determine how we see the world,

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.930
how we view what is
right, what is wrong,

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.970
what is appropriate,
and what is not.

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.160
So we think we use the same words.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.670 position:56%
We think they're universal concepts.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:32.060
They mean the same thing.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.500
What else could they mean?

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.850
Words like.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:37.150
I trust you.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.660
That's pretty clear.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.890
What else could it mean?

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:45.750
But if I was from a
specific culture,

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:51.300
I trust you means I trust
you will do the right thing.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:54.010
If I was from another culture,

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:58.890
I trust you means I trust you
will do the honorable thing.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.940
And honorable and [inaudible]
are completely different.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.150
And if I was from another culture,

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.560
I trust you could mean I
trust you will protect me.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.560
So we say, I trusted
you but you betrayed me.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.090
What do you mean I betrayed you?

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.580
I did the right thing.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.550
Yes, but you didn't protect me.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:22.350
And that's where clashes happen.

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:27.360
So we move to a new culture.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.360
It might be through work.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.210
It might be even just
a new organization

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:34.390
within the same country
where you live.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:39.430
And we do things just the way
that we have always been used

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.140
to doing it, because we think
that's the only way to do it.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.720
But then we realize that the
rules of the game are different.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.390
Things are different.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:53.820
And that is what we
call cultural shock,

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.630
and that should never
be underestimated.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:00.690
Cultural shock is when
your expectations

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:05.240
of how things should be clash
with the reality that you face,

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.590
and things as simple as
just opening the window,

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.250
you're used to seeing
greenery all the time

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:13.530
and then suddenly you're
in a different country.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:17.040
You open the window and you
see just desert and sand,

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.780
or people that look different than
you or the food or the weather.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:25.860
Never underestimate how
difficult that can be,

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.850
and what kind of stress
that can cause.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:32.680
It can cause a lot of stress.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.010
It can cause people
to actually go even

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:40.020
into the victim mentality
of I'm well, I'm fine.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.320
I'm not the problem.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.710
It's those stupid locals.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.760
If only they did things that
they were supposed to do.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.420
Or it's that crooked system.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.640
If only they did things the way
that it's supposed to happen,

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.840
then everything will be fine.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.140
I'm all right.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:15:00.750
It can cause too a lot of
tension in the workplace.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:05.120
It can cause too a lot of problems
at home, and it can actually lead

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:07.730 position:56%
to a lot of substance abuse as well.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:13.210
So even if you are the what
we call cultural learner,

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:16.030
an open minded person
and you have a lot

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:19.120
of other experiences
outside your own culture,

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:23.410
still prepare yourself well
before you work or move

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.550
to any other culture, and
take care of yourselves.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:30.560
Don't underestimate the effect
that that will have on you.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:37.500
But moving to a new culture doesn't
mean that I have to shed my skin.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:42.790
It doesn't mean that I have
to forget about my own values,

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:47.330
forget about my own beliefs,
and go native, as they say.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.710
No. It just means adjusting
the externals,

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:53.850
just adjusting the behavior.

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:59.800
But I keep true to my own DNA, to
my own beliefs, and own values.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.930
And cultural intelligence
is the ability

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:07.080
to first look take an
honest look inside myself

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:12.310
to understand my own beliefs,
my own cultural values.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.530
The reason how I see the glasses

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:17.520
through which I see the
world and judge the world.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:24.570
Only then am I able to
anticipate other people's behavior.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:30.370
Correctly interpret that behavior,
and then adjust my own behavior

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.910
to match the culturally
motivated behavior of others.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:37.690
And that is being culturally
intelligent.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:42.650
Now, a lot of researchers have
come up with many theories,

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:48.900
and tools that are meant to help
us understand how culture affects

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.910
our behavior.

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:54.720
These are old guidelines
that are meant

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.680
to just help us better understand
how culture affects our behavior.

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.550
But the most important thing we
need to always keep in mind is

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:08.920
that we never deal with
cultures, we deal with people.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:13.940
And each individual has
their own self culture.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.940
And by self culture I mean so,
for example, I'm Jordanian,

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:20.360
but I'm far from a
typical Jordanian.

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.450
My mother is Jordanian.

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:23.750
My father is Palestinian.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.430 position:56%
They brought me up in a certain way.

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:26.730
I grew up in Kuwait.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.640
I picked up a lot of that culture.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.570
I studied in the US for a while.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.300
I picked up some of that culture.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.170
I worked with the British
for a while.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.080
I picked up a lot of their culture.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.610
So I have created my own
self culture in the end.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:43.550
So we need to remember always
that we deal with people,

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:48.730
and each person needs to be treated
and respected as an individual.

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.630
But one of the many
theories and tools

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:55.990
that were used was one called
the three colors of worldview,

00:17:55.990 --> 00:18:02.800
which was first brought by Roland
Wooler, who did a lot of research

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:06.190
on the Bedouins and then another
organization called Knowledge Works

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:10.150
that are set up in Dubai and the
Netherlands took up that research

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.420
and expanded it and applied
it on the business world.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:20.240 position:56%
And this is the tool that I use as a
basis in my research and in my book.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:23.680
So let's move on to
When in the Arab World.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.550
Start from the basics.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:32.050
I say the Arab world, but of course
the Arab world is not one big lump.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:36.280
It's made up of 22
independent countries.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:40.740
Each country has its own
specific unique culture,

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.770
unique history, and
unique traditions.

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:49.570
Still having said that, there
is a thread of commonalities

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:55.230
that ties us all together, and that
is based in the Islamic religion

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:57.500
and in the Bedouin culture.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.450
Knowing of course that not
all of the Arab countries come

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:06.870
from the Bedouin culture, but there
is this thread of commonalities

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:11.690 position:56%
that can justify the kind of
generalities that I make in the book

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.530
and that I will make today.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:20.090
But again these are the core,
the values, the main motivators

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:25.800
of behavior that can
explain as a guideline

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:31.020
of what motivates our
behavior in the Arab culture.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.180
Basics again, before
we move any further.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:40.040
Arab and Muslim are
not the same thing.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.580
The media here unfortunately
uses the term

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.990
to interchangeably to
mean the same thing.

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.370
They're not.

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:50.620
Even though the majority of
the Arab population is Muslim,

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.340
not all Arabs are Muslim.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:58.390
Depending on which source you
use up to around 13 percent,

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:01.150
13 or 14 percent are Christians.

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:04.330
And Christianity started
from the Arab world.

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:06.370
It did not come with the Crusades.

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:08.760
So actually Jesus Christ
was born here.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:15.680
And so, not all Arabs are Muslim,
and not all Muslims are Arabs.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.820
Actually the majority of
the Muslim populations

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.880
in the world are is
not the Arab world.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.090
It's in Asia.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:31.630 position:56%
So be careful not to use those two
terms as the to mean the same thing.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:37.270
If we are looking at the
main motivator of behavior,

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:42.890
the centrality of honor,
faith, saving face

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:47.830
and pride cannot be
overestimated in the Arab culture.

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:53.360
It is central to understanding
how we do everything,

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.160
and the reasons why
we do everything.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.400
The main motivator of behavior
in the Arab culture is basically

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.010
to safeguard my honor
and avoid shame.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:09.320
If you were to walk away with just
one thing today if you understand

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:14.590
that the centrality of that
it will help you ease your way

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:17.980
around dealing with so many
aspects of the Arab culture.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:23.130
But who determines whether
I have been honorable

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:26.460 position:56%
or if I have done anything of shame?

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.760
Is it the legal system?

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:32.210
No. It's the people.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:34.280
It's my community.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.070
It's the people around me,

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:40.210
and therefore it makes
absolute sense why we put

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:43.550
such weight on reputation.

00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:48.200
The public perception of how
people see us, and what people say

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.490
about us is very, very important,

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:55.210
because again it reflects
on our honor.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:59.360
And honor here also means might
mean something completely different

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:05.300
from what may be an American
person might conceive as honor.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.990
Remember in these cultures this
is a community based culture.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:10.590
This is where the group,

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:15.240
the community is far more
important than the individual.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:19.260
And here I don't only
represent myself,

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.240
I represent everyone
else in the community.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.700
Just look at the way
that we write our names.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:27.430
So our names as written
so my first name.

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:30.910
My name Rena, followed
by my father's name,

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:36.210
followed by his father's name,
followed by the family name,

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:39.470
and then the tribal name,
if I belong to a tribe.

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:43.400
So just by looking at a person's
name you can actually tell

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:47.080
where exactly they
fit into that society.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.220
You can tell which part of
the country they come from.

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.720
You can tell if it's a
Christian or a Muslim family,

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:57.350
and in many cases you can even tell
their political affiliation just

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.040
by a name.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:04.310
So that's why someone from the Arab
world we might think it's a bit odd

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.750
that you have a middle
name that your parents pick

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:11.420
out for absolutely no reason.

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:15.360
For us it tells a whole story
of where you sit in that --

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.370
where your position
is in that culture.

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:25.060
Saving face becomes a very, very
important concept that you have

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.800
to keep in mind, especially

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.420
if you're doing any
kind of negotiations.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:32.640
If you're giving any
kind of feedback.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:38.220
Again, the main motivator is to
avoid shaming, and to maintain

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.980
that honor, because I don't
just bring honor to my --

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:46.850
I don't just bring shame to
myself, I bring that to everyone

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:51.180
that I represent, everyone
that I hold the name of.

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:55.540 position:56%
Naturally in an honor based culture,

00:23:55.540 --> 00:24:00.850
the family becomes the
most important thing.

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:04.080
Loyalty to the family
comes above all else.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.710
And by family here, I mean
the very extended family.

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:12.110
So we're looking at uncles,
cousins, second cousins,

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:17.180
that whole big family,
extended family is a network

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:20.660
of support for every individual.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:25.870
They are the patriarch is
the head of the family.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:30.010
Elders are revered.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:33.280
They take members of the same
family look out for each other.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:38.010
Our support for each other in
the good times and the bad times,

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.980
but it's also a double edged sword.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.550
Their support for each other,

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:44.500
but they also hold
each other accountable.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.990
And that's why maybe an
uncle might have a say

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:51.240
in who I decide to get married to.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:55.030
But at the other end of the
spectrum, they are always there.

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.320
They're supporting each
other through thick and thin.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:03.220
And that's why you find rarely,
rarely find any homeless people

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:07.340
across the Arab world, because
they're always taken care of,

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.310
taken in by some member
of their family somewhere.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:13.940
And you saw that what happened
exactly during the Syrian crisis

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.640
in the very, very beginning.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.510
All of the Syrian refugees that
came across were actually absorbed

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:24.750
by family members in Jordan, and
then until a few months later

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:27.820
when all of the family's
homes were completely full,

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.590
then we found that we had --
there were too many people

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:34.470
and the refugees camp
started to be set up.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:38.360
But then the resulting
social structure is

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.870
that children stay
living with their families

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:45.560
until they get married
themselves, and then they move

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.750
out to set up their own families.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:51.900
The end in many cases in
many different cultures,

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.230
and many different
countries you will find

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.900
that the young man will get
married and maybe bring his wife

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.830
and children in the
family home as well.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:02.410
They all take care of each other.

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:08.300 position:56%
When the wife, when the lady goes up
to work the children are left looked

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.770
after either by her own mother
or by her mother in law.

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:16.810
Friday which is the main day
weekend day is spent with lunch,

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:23.530
and with the extended family, and
that's the most important thing.

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:28.100
Family businesses are
most actually businesses

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:32.410
across the Arab world
are family owned.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:38.710
And so if you end up working with
a family business, be very careful.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:41.340
Criticism of any family member,

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:45.500
even though it might be
well-deserved is not a

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.890
good suggestion.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:50.090
So stay away from that.

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:55.350
The difference here, the generation
gap, between the older generation

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:58.300
and the younger generation,
what's called Generation X

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:03.340
and Generation Y, and I think there
are other letters now I think is

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:07.530
more pronounced in the Arab
culture than in any other culture.

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:10.960
The gap there is I
think maybe even wider.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:17.530
The younger generation now
they are 60% of the population

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.860
across the Arab world
is under the age of 25.

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:25.290
That makes it the most
youthful area of the world.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:26.590
Very young.

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:31.440
And this younger generation
is changing a lot of things.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.330
They are much more outward looking.

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:39.810
They are much more connected
to the rest of the world.

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:42.700
They're educated in the
best universities in Europe,

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:47.610
and in the US., and they
want to change things a lot.

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:50.360
But what you find now
that's happening is

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:56.430
that although they may not add so
much as much weigh and value to the

00:27:56.430 --> 00:28:00.950
to the traditions as
their fathers did.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:06.320
Still they are holding on
to the core cultural values,

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:11.130
and they're finding very creative
ways of getting to what they want,

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:15.330
but within their culture,
within their communities.

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:20.910
And you will see, keep seeing
those changes happening now.

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:27.180
The issue of women in Arab
culture I think is one

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:31.790
that is the most misrepresented
aspect

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:40.720
of the Arab culture probably Arab
women across the board have broken

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:46.650
so many cultural taboos, have
achieved so much across the board

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:50.000
in the fields of politics,
in medicine,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.480
in business, and in everywhere.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.150
I'm not going to go
into the full details

00:28:56.150 --> 00:29:00.570
of how much women have
achieved and all of that issue.

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:06.710
But still the Arab, the structure

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:11.950
of the Arab society is
a patriarchal society.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:19.030
The male dominance is very much
ingrained in the Arab culture,

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:23.010
and many women still
remain under a sort

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:27.160
of a little bit subversive
socially only

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:31.160 position:56%
to the male members of their family.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:35.170
So the main decisions are
made by either the father

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:36.980
or the husband or the brother.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:45.540
But still do not jump
to conclusions here.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:52.010
This is one area of the culture
I think in across the board

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:57.000
where it's very easy to
fall into stereotypes,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.080
and to make judgments
based on appearances.

00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.220
They tell you it looks like a
duck, it quacks like a duck,

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:06.840
it walks like a duck, and then
therefore it must be a duck.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.050
Probably anywhere except here.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:10.860
It's probably not a duck.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.040
You look at this lady
and you think, right.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.760
We see a woman wearing
the hijab covered up

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.950
and we think she's probably
oppressed, she's probably ignorant,

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:24.890
she has no idea about her
rights and gender equality,

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:29.290
and I'm going to come here
and tell her about her rights

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:33.010
and gender equality, and women's
issues and I will free her

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:36.230
from the tyranny of the veil.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:38.450
Think again.

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:40.960
This woman is a Saudi woman.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.310
Her name is Nalla Yan..

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:46.400
She actually owns and
runs the largest financial

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.820
and industrial corporation
in the region.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.150
This is another lady.

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:58.900
She's a minister of
international cooperation in Egypt,

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:03.480
and another also a minister in
a very dominated liberal Qassemi

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.750
and the UAE, very male
dominated culture,

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:09.610
but yet she is the minister,
was the minister of economy

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:13.390
and now has several
portfolios as well.

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:19.710
A group of Jordanian
women MPs as well.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:23.290
The issue of gender equality

00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:27.010
and women's rights is
something that's really fraught

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:30.990
with so many cultural minefields.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:35.420
That whole concept of
the freedom to choose,

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:42.100
and personal freedom is a
very American way of thinking.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.950
Other cultures including the Arab
culture, put a lot more weight

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:50.930
on our position in the
end role in the society.

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:55.750
A lot more, that has a lot more
meaning than personal freedom,

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:59.110
and even freedom the
end of the whole concept

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:01.830
of freedom means something
completely different

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:03.670
in different cultures.

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:08.680
So be aware when not
to jump to conclusions

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:14.920
on what other women need based on
your own cultural views and values.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.860
And this is just one picture

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.850
that you don't often see
coming out of the Arab culture.

00:32:19.850 --> 00:32:22.820
This is a very famous
Lebanese singer.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.890
Her name is Nancy Hallström.

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:30.700
So one other thing that
differs from one culture

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:36.390
to the other is the how we see
this concept of faith and faith.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:44.240
In some cultures, like the American
culture here, we believe here

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:49.220
or it's maybe just the
perception that you are in control

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:54.730
of your destiny, that
you predict the weather.

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:56.330
You work hard.

00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:00.580 position:56%
It's the cause and effect mentality.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:03.020
The [inaudible] thinking,
cause and effect.

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.320
You predict the weather.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.930
I am the master of my ship.

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.360
I control my destiny.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.650
It's a belief or perhaps
it's just a perception.

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:16.290
In other cultures, again it's a
belief or perhaps a perception

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:21.500
that we don't actually have that
much control over circumstances

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.290
or anything that happens around us.

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:28.350
If something happens,
whether it's good or bad,

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:31.550
it was something outside
of my hands left

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:35.370
up to a power far greater
than myself.

00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:36.670
Call it the universe.

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:37.970
Call it God.

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:39.270
Call it Allah.

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:41.570
Call it luck.

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:46.110
How you look at it, different,

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:49.450
so someone from the American
culture might think, hmm,

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:51.880
that's very passive and lazy.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.350
And someone from the Arab culture
would look at the American belief,

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:57.760
and think that's pretty arrogant.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.510
I can work.

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:04.390
I will do all I can do, but
then I get to a certain point

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:07.110 position:56%
and then things are out of my hands.

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:12.290
The belief in we have a term
in Arabic, Kadiatu cadet,

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:17.060
which is faith and God's
will, literally translated.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:19.960
Means that I can do
everything I can.

00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:26.900 position:56%
I will work, do my best, but then
whatever is left is out of my hands.

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:31.210
If you ask any American, a group
of American people you'd say,

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:36.730
so how many of you have already
booked a holiday, a flight,

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:38.380
and booked your hotels
and know exactly

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:41.030
where you're going next
summer for holiday?

00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:42.810
Show of hands.

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:45.660
Have you? No, okay.

00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:48.440
We've got some there.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.740
[laughs] It's very accepted.

00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:54.340
It's the norm that you plan ahead
at least six, seven, eight months,

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.720
maybe a year ahead of time.

00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:01.150
For someone coming from the Arab
culture, that's completely bizarre.

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:06.540
Because I don't know if I'm going
to be alive six months from now,

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:09.840
let alone if I actually am
going to feel like going

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.810
to that particular vacation.

00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:14.410
I don't know who in my family
is going to get married,

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:15.710
who's going to have a baby.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:18.880
I don't know if there's
going to be a war next door.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.650
So we don't plan.

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:22.650
Everything's left to
the last minute.

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:26.560
And that affects every
aspect of our life.

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:30.950
Why we've had business consultants
who come to the Arab world and try

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:33.710
to do financial forecasting.

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:37.810
And business plans, five
year advance business plans.

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:39.340
It's tough.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.570
It's tough.

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:47.560
The belief is that
we are tempting fate.

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:50.350
And of course if you
come to anywhere

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:54.090
in the Arab world what's the
first word that you will hear?

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:55.420
Inshallah.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.720
[laughs] Inshallah.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.720
And Inshallah literally
means God willing.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.050
But when I was doing research
for the book I discovered

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:04.550
that we didn't invent
that concept actually.

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:09.450
There is a Latin term that
the Brits used in the 1900s,

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:14.610
when they signed their name to any
letters, they used the Latin term,

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:18.220
deo volente, which
literally means God willing.

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:20.940
God willing, if God permits,

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:23.590
whatever I said I will
do, I will do.

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:27.050
So we didn't invent that Inshallah.

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:29.760
But again, it is that
concept and belief

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.410
in that things are out of my hand.

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:39.960
I don't have absolute control over
my circumstances and what happens.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:46.260
Religion is also a very
integral part of everyday life.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:51.810
The word "Islam," in Arabic means
the willing submission to God.

00:36:51.810 --> 00:37:01.330
And that seeps through a lot of
things that we do in business,

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:04.820
and politics across the board.

00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:07.860
And you will find it that it
actually has nothing to do

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.400
with the level of education.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.950
It has nothing to do even with,
you know, Christians Muslims,

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:18.190
you find that some of these
beliefs and values and traditions

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:23.650
and the way we do things get mixed
up, and are completely intertwined,

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:27.170
and affect how everything is done.

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:34.580
So if we look at now the style of
communications, if we understand

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:38.150
that the main motivator of
behavior is to safeguard my honor

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:41.750 position:56%
and avoid shame, then it makes sense

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:45.960
that we prefer the indirect
style of communications.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.630
In the western culture
it's very direct.

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:54.430
It's I say what I mean
and I mean what I say.

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:58.580
Very direct, straight
to the point, clear.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:03.070
In Arab culture I have a lot of
other things going on in my mind

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:07.570
that I want to juggle while I'm
trying to get the message across.

00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:10.250
I want to make sure I save my face.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:12.100
I want to make sure
I save your face.

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:14.080 position:56%
I want to make sure I'm honoring us.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.480
And I want to make sure I
safeguard that relationship.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:22.800
There's so many things that
I'm thinking about other

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.320
than just getting that
message across.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.330
And this is one area that
causes a lot of stress

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:31.770
and miscommunications
among different cultures.

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:34.000
So let me tell you an example.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.170
So if I have my boss is John, and
I want to tell John something.

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:42.180
And of course we never
want to upset the boss.

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:45.390
So I think about if
I want to tell John

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:47.090
that I'm not quite
sure how he's going

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:50.340
to take it, who is close to John?

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:53.560
Okay. So maybe Eudunda might be.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.610
So I will go talk to Eudunda and
I'll tell her, Linda I really want

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:59.880 position:56%
to tell John this, but I'm not quite
sure how he's going to take it.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.840
So she would think a bit and
think, don't worry about it.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.130
I'll see. I'll take care of it.

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:07.800
She will then think
and go tell him Hamid.

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.030
And we'll tell Hamid this is
what we want to tell John.

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:12.330
What do you think about that?

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:15.720
And then Hamid will go tell John.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.760
Message delivered.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.240
No confrontation.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.740
No problem.

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.760
Now John would then of course
have a nervous breakdown,

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:29.590
because he would be very
offended and would think first,

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:32.780
why are you going behind my back?

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:35.520
And second, why are you involving
people that don't need to know

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.050 position:56%
about this issue in the first place?

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:42.300
But if you understand the
reason why this is happening,

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:45.190
and it's about avoiding
confrontation,

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:47.830
trying to get that message across.

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:52.870
One, saving face, saving
honor, saving the relationship.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:59.540
It gets very complicated, but
there is this is how you can

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.780
when you understand why it happens,

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:09.510
then it might lessen the offense
taken or the reaction taken.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:13.210
Having said that, of course,
there are certain ways

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:17.000
that we are much more direct
than any other culture.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.410
It's one of the stories that I use

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:24.470
in the book is this David he
walks, he's working in Jordan.

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:30.320
He gets into a taxi, and
the first question is,

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.710
"Hello, where are you from?"

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:34.100
He says, "From the UK."

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.660
"Oh, Manchester United.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:36.960
Nice football.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.330
Are you married?"

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:39.980
"Yes." "How many children?"

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.280
"No children."

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.580
"Really, why?"

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:45.120
"We don't have any children."

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.930
"Have you been to the doctor?"

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:53.420
[laughs] And of course when
David wants knows this is the --

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:54.980
wants to end the conversation,

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:57.770
he would end it with,
"It's out of my hands.

00:40:57.770 --> 00:41:00.050
It's all in the hands of God."

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:03.110
And that's where the
conversation ends.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:04.780
But somebody like David

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:09.150
who was actually very culturally
aware never got offended by that,

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:12.310
and he would laugh and think that
if somebody in the UK if I had

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:16.000
to have this conversation somewhere
in the UK, it would be horrific.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.160
Completely out of out of order.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:22.360
But then this is the difference
between what is accepted

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:25.940
and what is not and what
is direct and in direct.

00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:30.400
But one of the other ways of
communicating that's very important

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:34.940
in Arab culture is the face
to face communications.

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:40.540
While it is you can actually
get a lot done over email

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:44.110
or just a phone call
in other cultures,

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:47.610
don't expect that to happen
anywhere across the Arab world.

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:51.410
It has to be done face to
face, and it takes time,

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:55.640
because everything is
about the relationship.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.090
Relationships are more
important than anything else,

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:05.750
and you will find in many cases
that people will take a decision

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:08.490
that might be bad for
business, but that in order

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:11.220
to safeguard a relationship.

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:14.690
So while it takes a little bit of
time to build that relationship,

00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:18.030
and it's said that two American
business people can get off

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:22.320
to different planes,
meet in an airport lobby,

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.770
and set up a business
together if they have a product

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:28.010
and a business plan
they will do that

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:32.620
and they walk away their different
paths, and it will be successful.

00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:35.250
That can never happen
anywhere in the Arab world.

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:37.310
Everything is based
on relationships,

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:41.290
and building relationships
is core, but takes time.

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:43.830
And that is where it's
the investment

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:46.160
in that relationship
that's very important,

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.740
and it needs to be
done face to face.

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.340
After you've established that,

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:52.840
then you can take it to
emails and telephone.

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:58.090
But it has to be that trust and the
relationship has to start first.

00:42:58.090 --> 00:43:03.740
One thing if I may really
more and against here,

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:11.490
it's that condescending attitude
that we get a lot from a lot

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:14.350
of foreign experts
that come our way.

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:21.120 position:56%
Now, the region, the Arab region has
been developing at such a fast pace

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:28.450
that it's going incredibly fast
that it's actually outrunning,

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:31.930
if you like, the abilities
of a lot of its people

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:34.410
and the abilities of
some of its leaders.

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:38.280
So that's why we will
always continue to have

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:41.790
to need the foreign
experts and the advice

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:46.570
of the foreign experts,
but be careful here.

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:50.760
The all that used to we used
to have, the older generation

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:55.930
of Arabs towards the foreign
expert is diminishing fast.

00:43:55.930 --> 00:43:59.720 position:56%
And you will find that in especially

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.860
in the GCC there's the national
pride is growing more and more.

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:08.150
And they are replacing a
lot of the foreign experts

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:10.630
with the local nationals.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:15.010
Be aware of this condescending
attitude

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:18.560
of we are here to instruct you.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.030
Or we are here to teach
you, because we know better.

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:23.330
We know the right way.

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:26.330 position:56%
Just do as we say, and we've got it.

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:34.640
That's one thing that a lot of
foreign experts make that mistake.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.870
It's a very small community.

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:41.440 position:56%
Everyone knows everyone, and
everything travels by word of mouth.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:47.200
And if your reputation is that
you are in a place of trust

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:50.370
and respect, that will travel fast.

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:53.020
And you will be able
to do great business,

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:56.190
but otherwise that news
will travel fast as well

00:44:56.190 --> 00:45:03.670
and you will not be able to do
much anywhere in the Arab world.

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:07.470
Language. Lost in Translation.

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:10.720
The Arabic language, just to say

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:14.150
that very quickly, it
comes in two parts.

00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:16.640
The instructions were
to write this in Arabic,

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:20.450
and they did exactly that.

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:22.340 position:56%
The Arabic language is in two parts.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:26.990
There's the classical Arabic, and
there's the colloquial Arabic.

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:30.880
The classical Arabic is the same
Arab language, the same Arabic

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:34.740
that is spoken across
all 22 Arab countries.

00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:39.080
It's the same Arabic that is
written in books, in newspapers,

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:40.440
and you will hear it read

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:44.120
on the television newscast
or the radio newscast.

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:47.500
That is the same one that's
across all of the Arab world.

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:51.400
And then there's the colloquial
Arabic, which is different

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:57.260
in each country, and each country
has its different dialect as well.

00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:00.920
So, but you'll find that, for
example, the GCC countries,

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:05.370
the Gulf countries
have a similar dialect.

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:08.800
The Levant, Jordan,
Lebanon, Palestine,

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:13.270
and Syria have similar dialect.

00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:15.050
Egypt is very distinct.

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:16.600
Iraq is very distinct.

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:21.270
And the North African countries
all have a similar dialect as well.

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:26.150
But each country has
separate accents.

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:31.210
You can tell the difference between
Kuwait, and [inaudible] and Saudi

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:35.100
by the accent, and the
certain words that they use.

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:43.650
The important thing here is if you
think that you can do a campaign

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:49.390
or issue a press release at
headquarters, here in the US,

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:53.890
and then send it out for
translation, think again.

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:57.060
A lot can get messed
up in the translation.

00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:00.490
When I was working with a
British foreign office I worked

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:03.070
on a campaign, and in 2012

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:07.730
for the 2012 London Olympics there
was a fantastic campaign called The

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:10.060
Great Britain campaign.

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:12.980
A great year for Great Britain.

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:17.590
And everything was fashioned was
Great Britain is Great Britain.

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:20.090
Education is Great Britain.

00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:21.660
Sports is Great Britain.

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:25.060
And I was one on the panel
that was trying to translate

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:27.850
that campaign into Arabic.

00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:31.780
And if anyone speaks Arabic can
understand that this actually

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:37.120
when you translate it, it rings
about all the colonial past.

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:42.810
And actually it is
completely counter campaign.

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:45.810
So it's actually very,
very negative.

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:49.340
And we ended up choosing
at least in Jordan not

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:51.370
to use the Arabic translation,

00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:54.350
because it was actually
counterproductive,

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:56.850
and was getting us into an area

00:47:56.850 --> 00:47:59.380
which we were trying
to work against.

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:02.090
So be careful.

00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:04.370
Just the translation will not work.

00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:09.840 position:56%
It's really advised to use the local
talent that you have in the country.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:13.900
They know the nuances of the
language, and what would go,

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:17.910
what would work here,
and what would not.

00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:23.380
So in closing, cultural
intelligence again starts

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:27.180
from an honest look
inside ourselves first.

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:32.800 position:56%
I have to look inside myself at my
own beliefs, my own cultural values,

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:37.630
how I view the world, and how I
determine what's right and wrong.

00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:43.280
And only then can I anticipate
other people's behavior.

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:48.380
Correctly interpret that behavior,
and adjust my own behavior

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:52.710
to suit the culturally
motivated behavior of others.

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:55.410
And remember again, we never,

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:59.670
we don't deal with
cultures, we deal with people.

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:04.580
And every person must be
respected as an individual.

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:09.960
Use the local talent you
have wherever you are.

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:12.450
Ask, you will always get an answer.

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:16.980
People are very friendly and open
and would love to give advice.

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:19.590
Don't make assumptions at all.

00:49:19.590 --> 00:49:24.170
And don't forget to get a
copy of one in the Arab world.

00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:25.970
[laughs]. Thank you.

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:31.210
[ Applause ]

00:49:31.210 --> 00:49:33.810
&gt;&gt; Nawal Kawar: Thank you,
Rana for a wonderful speech.

00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:35.860
Now we open the floor
for questions, please.

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:40.510
&gt;&gt; Rana F. Nejem Questions, yes.

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:49.530
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:56.620
&gt;&gt; I was wondering in technical
terms what is the attitude

00:49:56.620 --> 00:50:00.800
of society towards old
people, the season,

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:05.470
the experience like
at the workplace.

00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:14.540
Are they regarded just
as revered or as regarded

00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:18.950
as [inaudible] their wisdom
on the job [inaudible]?

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:22.000
&gt;&gt; Nawal Kawar: Repeat that.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.860
&gt;&gt; Rana F. Nejem: The question
is how are older people

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:29.680
in the Arab culture, what's the
attitude towards older people

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.370
in the Arab culture in the
workplace in particular.

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:36.450
Are they revered or are
they expected to retire?

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:43.480
It actually it varies again.

00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:48.820
But in general, the wisdom

00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:55.130 position:56%
of the older generation is very much
respected, and they are even the way

00:50:55.130 --> 00:51:01.560
that you speak to an older person
is and the way that you communicate

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:05.790 position:56%
and interact with an older person,
the way you address an older person,

00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:12.540
there is a lot of respect when
you are actually interacting

00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:14.920
with somebody older.

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:19.540
In the workplace now just
recently things are changing

00:51:19.540 --> 00:51:24.840 position:56%
as the younger generation are coming
more and more into the workplace,

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.890
and because of the
invasion of the technology

00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:35.820
and how things are being
done are changing a lot.

00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:41.540
There is this attitude of, and of
course with social media changing

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:46.270
that as well, which gave
everyone a megaphone and a size

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:49.980
that is quite larger than
their true size I would say,

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:53.760
has changed the balance
a little bit.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:58.080
And undoubtedly it is
creating some sort of,

00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:04.410
I don't know if it's tension
or how things are changing,

00:52:04.410 --> 00:52:10.000
but in general the culture
continues to respecting the elders

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.490
and the wisdom of the Elders
is very, very important.

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:17.100
Thank you.

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.950
Question? Yes.

00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:25.900
&gt;&gt; I'm curious about how the US
[inaudible] culturally speaking

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:34.090
[inaudible] better in communicating
and understanding [inaudible]

00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:38.640
where you see trends

00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:46.930
in how [inaudible] related
to various societies.

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.330 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rana F. Nejem: So the question is

00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:55.200
about whether the American
military has been able,

00:52:55.200 --> 00:53:00.190
have learned to be more culturally
sensitive in the Arab countries

00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:08.480
where it's functioning,
where it's present.

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:13.770
It's difficult to generalize
here, but I think there were a lot

00:53:13.770 --> 00:53:19.990
of in the past there were several
clashes or incidences that showed

00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:24.260
that there was very little cultural
awareness and understanding.

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:27.530
And so what ended up happening
now is that you will find

00:53:27.530 --> 00:53:31.210
that they are very isolated
from the rest of the culture.

00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:37.070
So they live wherever there is
a US military base you'd find

00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:40.630
that isolated from the
rest of the culture.

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:43.340
They have their own, I
don't know commiserate,

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:45.680
they have their own entertainment,

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:51.240 position:56%
so that they don't actually interact
a lot with the local culture.

00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:56.550
This differs from one
country to the other,

00:53:56.550 --> 00:54:02.460
but I would say more
cultural sensitivity

00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:05.720
and awareness is still needed.

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:11.260
And it's just because when
you don't know something,

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:15.630
and you make assumptions on what
you already believe is right,

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:19.480
you're going to do what
you think is right.

00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:21.440
Which is the natural thing.

00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.600
It's your default setting.

00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:28.000
But that thing that's right for
you doesn't work in another place,

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.090
and that causes offense,
but you don't know

00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:32.420
that you're causing offense.

00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:35.550
And so I think there is still room

00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:41.970
for a bit more cultural awareness
training, and more knowledge,

00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:48.500
more about the nuances, the
values, the beliefs, the motivators

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:53.090 position:56%
of behavior, rather than just giving
them a list of do's and don'ts.

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:56.410
Don't sit with the sole of
your foot facing somebody.

00:54:56.410 --> 00:54:57.710
Don't do that.

00:54:57.710 --> 00:55:03.040
Those are those are very important
things, but they don't explain why.

00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:07.370
Does that answer your question?

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:08.860
Thank you.

00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:10.160
Yes.

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:22.240
&gt;&gt; I was really fascinated by your
remarks on the men in Arab world,

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:34.620 position:56%
and the assumptions that others make
about the [inaudible] about choice

00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:43.300
and about being independent.

00:55:43.300 --> 00:55:50.240
And I guess I want more insight
about this younger generation

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.540
of women in the Arab world.

00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:53.600
How do they define feminism?

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:54.920
What do you think you
can share, you know,

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.500
maybe just give us some
light on that [inaudible]/

00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:58.800
&gt;&gt; Rana F. Nejem: Yes.

00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:04.300
yes. So the questions about how the
younger generation of Arab women

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:09.460 position:56%
and how they are viewing feminism
and how they are viewing their role,

00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:10.920
their world, their rights.

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.930
It's fascinating to see the
changes that are happening.

00:56:13.930 --> 00:56:15.810
But the number of women actually,

00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:18.560
and from the younger
generation who choose.

00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:21.990
And I underline choose to wear
the hijab, which is the scarf,

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:25.780
which is very different from the
niqab is actually on the increase.

00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:27.460
They are a lot more now.

00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:30.910
But the interesting thing is that
how it is -- how you doing that.

00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:33.770
How they're doing it
with it's into fashion.

00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:38.090
And now you find so many new young
fashion designers who are coming

00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:43.770
up with the most amazing designs
on the catwalk for specially

00:56:43.770 --> 00:56:46.770
for Arab women who
want to be fashionable,

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:50.160
but want to be modest
at the same time.

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:54.760
And you find that it's
simply an item of clothing

00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:59.330
that does not prevent them from
doing anything or being anywhere.

00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:03.260
They go out to restaurants,
they dine.

00:57:03.260 --> 00:57:05.710
There's sometimes there's
alcohol being served.

00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:07.860
As long as they're not
drinking that's fine.

00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:09.690
They are in sports.

00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:11.010
They're in football.

00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:13.180
They're in medicine.

00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:15.870
They can do anything.

00:57:15.870 --> 00:57:20.770
This is simply an item of
clothing that reflects on --

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:25.700 position:56%
it's something that's their cultural
or religious values and beliefs

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:28.170
that does not prevent
them in any way

00:57:28.170 --> 00:57:34.120
of achieving their full potential
in any field that they choose.

00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:37.980 position:56%
So we look at that item of clothing,

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:45.110
and we give it a lot more weight
meaning than it really needs to.

00:57:45.110 --> 00:57:49.740
We attach so many of our
own assumptions to it.

00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:53.950
That she's not free, she's
oppressed, she's ignorant,

00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:57.400
but that's all of us really.

00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:06.510
It's in the eye of the
beholder, as it said.

00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:11.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.180
&gt;&gt; Everything you said
I identify with.

00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:16.920
When you hear somebody saying
it, it's just a comedy.

00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:18.220
It's true.

00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:21.620
[laughs] I remember my children
who were raised then in France.

00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:33.290
You know, in Jordan everybody
asks how many kids do you have.

00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:40.170
What this, what that, and the
French they [inaudible] that.

00:58:40.170 --> 00:58:43.650
They find if interfering
in private matters.

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:46.240
So my children was always
getting, you know, a cold shower.

00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:51.810
Then they ask somebody
do you have kids?

00:58:51.810 --> 00:58:53.220
It's like this is very personal.

00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:57.750
This is very private.

00:58:57.750 --> 00:59:03.870
And it took them a while to
realize the cultural aspect,

00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:06.160
so they stopped doing it, you know?

00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:07.460
&gt;&gt; Rana F. Nejem: Yes.

00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:10.420
&gt;&gt; And it's true that there is so
many things that can be offensive,

00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:13.280
and [inaudible] because I have
a copy you kindly sent me,

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:15.160
and explaining these
things [inaudible]

00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:19.420
and everybody who's interested
and at least or even not,

00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:21.400
just in these cultures
[inaudible] read them.

00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:24.700
So I just wanted to tell you bravo.

00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:26.000
&gt;&gt; Rana F. Nejem: Thank you.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.300
Thank you.

00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:28.600
Thank you.

00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:29.900 position:56%
It's very interesting, so the topics

00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:31.200
of conversation there's
a whole chapter

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:32.500
on the topics of conversation.

00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:35.640
So in the US, for example when
you meet somebody you chit chat,

00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:36.940
the small talk we call.

00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:39.130
And the small talk is
you ask about the wife.

00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:44.120
How's the wife, how the -- you
don't do that in the Arab world.

00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:46.540
The wife is completely private.

00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:47.950
You never ask about the wife.

00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:49.300
You ask about the family.

00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.600
You ask about the children,
but never the wife.

00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:51.900
And when you go visit
somebody's home,

00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:53.200
you never take a gift that's
personal for the wife.

00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:54.500
You take flowers, chocolate, not a
bottle of wine, unless you really,

00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:55.810
really know that they drink, and
you've visited their house before,

00:59:55.810 --> 00:59:57.110
but the wife is always private.

00:59:57.110 --> 00:59:58.410
So it's interesting how.

00:59:58.410 --> 00:59:59.710
Yes.

00:59:59.710 --> 01:00:01.010
&gt;&gt; Just more like a comment.

01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:02.310
But this is all about
[inaudible] world.

01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:07.990
But with experience Egyptians
are not [inaudible] Egyptians.

01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:09.300
&gt;&gt; Rana F. Nejem: Definitely.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:10.600
Definitely.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:15.320
Of course now there's -- this
is what I said in the beginning.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:20.760
These are the basic values
that are the same more or less

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:23.100
across the Arab world,
but there are differences.

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:28.180
Of course life in Beirut is vastly
different from life in Riyadh.

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:31.650
So you will find the social
differences and within each country

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:34.240
if you're in the capital
city it's very different

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.950
than if you're in the rural areas.

01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:42.490
But once you understand those basic
values, the motivators of behavior,

01:00:42.490 --> 01:00:46.200
then you're able to
intelligently weigh your

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:50.270
and adjust according
to each local country.

01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:57.990
And then you're able to really
enjoy the magic of each country.

01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:01.390
Thank you.

01:01:01.390 --> 01:01:03.190
Thank you.
