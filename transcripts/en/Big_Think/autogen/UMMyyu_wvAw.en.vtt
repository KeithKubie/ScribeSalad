world and then there's another person
inside of us that you could think of as

and what the middle way would say is

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640
and what the middle way would say is
 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.239
and what the middle way would say is
that if we get stuck in either one of

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:49.249
that if we get stuck in either one of
 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:53.130
that if we get stuck in either one of
those places we subject ourselves to

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140
those places we subject ourselves to
 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.739
those places we subject ourselves to
sort of stress and agitation so that if

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:56.749
sort of stress and agitation so that if
 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.319
sort of stress and agitation so that if
everything is about function you know

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329
everything is about function you know
 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.569
everything is about function you know
bureaucracy performance that's all we

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579
bureaucracy performance that's all we
 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.730
bureaucracy performance that's all we
care about we might one day kind of wake

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740
care about we might one day kind of wake
 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.950
care about we might one day kind of wake
up and wonder if we have a truly lift

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960
up and wonder if we have a truly lift
 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.719
up and wonder if we have a truly lift
because we've been so focused on just

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729
because we've been so focused on just
 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.240
because we've been so focused on just
getting it right getting it done or you

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250
getting it right getting it done or you
 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.160
getting it right getting it done or you
know whatever it is on the other hand if

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170
know whatever it is on the other hand if
 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.470
know whatever it is on the other hand if
we just focused on the artistic side

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480
we just focused on the artistic side
 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.250
we just focused on the artistic side
that

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260
that
 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.920
that
a free-spirited you know part of us then

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930
a free-spirited you know part of us then
 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.589
a free-spirited you know part of us then
we might suffer from sort of lack of

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599
we might suffer from sort of lack of
 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.690
we might suffer from sort of lack of
momentum we might get frustrated because

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700
momentum we might get frustrated because
 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.670
momentum we might get frustrated because
we didn't have enough momentum and to

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680
we didn't have enough momentum and to
 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.830
we didn't have enough momentum and to
get things done and so what the middle

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840
get things done and so what the middle
 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.839
get things done and so what the middle
way is about it's a philosophy of

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849
way is about it's a philosophy of
 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.509
way is about it's a philosophy of
harmonizing these two things within us

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519
harmonizing these two things within us
 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.660
harmonizing these two things within us
and you know I saw in Pixar a metaphor

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670
and you know I saw in Pixar a metaphor
 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.850
and you know I saw in Pixar a metaphor
for that because it really is a company

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860
for that because it really is a company
 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.640
for that because it really is a company
that succeeded because it was able to

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650
that succeeded because it was able to
 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.369
that succeeded because it was able to
harmonize these two these two ideas and

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:42.379
harmonize these two these two ideas and
 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:43.780
harmonize these two these two ideas and
it but it turns out that it applies to

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790
it but it turns out that it applies to
 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.119
it but it turns out that it applies to
you know much more than Pixar I think it

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129
you know much more than Pixar I think it
 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.039
you know much more than Pixar I think it
applies to building great organizations

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049
applies to building great organizations
 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.910
applies to building great organizations
even living living great lives one of

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920
even living living great lives one of
 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.199
even living living great lives one of
the challenges that we have in terms of

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209
the challenges that we have in terms of
 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.190
the challenges that we have in terms of
experiential you know feeling good

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200
experiential you know feeling good
 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.080
experiential you know feeling good
feeling you know productive feeling good

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090
feeling you know productive feeling good
 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.030
feeling you know productive feeling good
about who we are on what we do is that

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040
about who we are on what we do is that
 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.670
about who we are on what we do is that
we get stuck in stories it's interesting

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680
we get stuck in stories it's interesting
 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.229
we get stuck in stories it's interesting
it's really interesting actually because

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239
it's really interesting actually because
 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.170
it's really interesting actually because
you know at Pixar I was a story company

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180
you know at Pixar I was a story company
 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.819
you know at Pixar I was a story company
so I go for a few years at Pixar on a

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829
so I go for a few years at Pixar on a
 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.740
so I go for a few years at Pixar on a
alone well it's all about story that's

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750
alone well it's all about story that's
 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.849
alone well it's all about story that's
what I learned and then I go off and

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859
what I learned and then I go off and
 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.710
what I learned and then I go off and
study Buddhist philosophy for 10 years

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720
study Buddhist philosophy for 10 years
 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.030
study Buddhist philosophy for 10 years
and I come to this scintillating

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040
and I come to this scintillating
 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.240
and I come to this scintillating
conclusion that it's all about story why

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250
conclusion that it's all about story why
 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.479
conclusion that it's all about story why
is that it's because the ideas of these

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489
is that it's because the ideas of these
 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.970
is that it's because the ideas of these

over again by neuroscience says that we

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310
over again by neuroscience says that we
 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.089
over again by neuroscience says that we
function in a story we have a story in

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099
function in a story we have a story in
 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.250
function in a story we have a story in
our minds about what it means you know
