Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radiolab radiolab from [inaudible], w. N. Y. S. E. N. N. P. R. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and today we have a story that actually kind of seems to stick with those who hear it. Can you hear us now? Hello? Hello. Hello. Hello. Like this Guy Walter Merge. I'm a film editor and sound designer and I've been working in film since the late 1960s the resume includes, I'm going to make them and off we go. The Godfather apocalypse now. I love the smell of that pump in the morning. Ton of other films, the thing we're talking about it, so you should know is the one of the more spectacular stories I've ever heard. How did you bump into this tail?

Speaker 2:          00:49          Well, I was in Leon in France doing a film, unbearable lightness of being. This is back in 1986 I was supposed to be there for a week on it. Wound up, I was there for a month and I ran out of things to read. So I went down the street from the hotel and there was a bookstore and a, I was interested and still am in cosmology. So I picked up a book by the, uh, Carl Sagan of France, a man named Hubert Reeves. [inaudible] actually, he's French Canadian. He translates this Gulf Sago. Anyway, merchant ends up buying Reeves book, goes back to the hotel, finds a cozy spot. I was happily reading away and he was trying to explain with some difficulty because it was a difficult topic. How did matter condense out of the sort of cork soup that we believe happened right after the big bang. And He tried various, uh, attempts scientifically, but then he said, to give you a sense of, uh, the poetry of this moment, the best thing is the story that Muller Parte tells.

Speaker 3:          02:04          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:04          who is Mela party? Well,

Speaker 3:          02:07          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          02:07          he was a journalist, a poet, a diplomat soldier, prisoner film director and somebody who, uh, got around. Yeah. And speaking of getting around in 1942, a Melanie's newspaper [inaudible] the loss, Sarah sent Malaparte Day to report, um, on the eastern and northern fronts of the war. Specifically the Russian Finnish border and he had a front row seat of the siege of Leningrad, the agony of the Nazi bombardment of that city and it's from there. Then Malaparte he tells his story.

Speaker 1:          02:44          So this one day, this was an in the winter, Mala party was posted with the Finnish army who were fighting along with the Nazis and they were perched just north of linen ground on the shores of Lake Ladoga, which is this big lake abutting the city and on this day

Speaker 3:          03:05          [inaudible],

Speaker 4:          03:05          the Nazis are bombarded area around the lake. This started a forest fire, everyone ran for cover, soldiers ran every which way. In the middle of the forest there were Soviet forces that were locked up in a stable and fortunately panicked and broke out of the stable hundreds of them and they just started running in Russian to get away from the fighting. Right. So you have hundreds of horses bolting through this flaming forest heading towards the open space I head, which was the lake and all the ones they burst out in the forest and go barreling into the lake. Stampeding one on top of the other is y'all get deeper and deeper up to their heads. And it is this moment when they enter the length that according to this story, something very weird happens in the blink of an eye, but like

Speaker 1:          03:57          snaps them shot, it just freezes, suddenly turns to ice with a bang. It goes from water to ice with this violence snap and suddenly the horses are in two mellow parte writes that even the waves on the lake were gripped in midair and sort of suspended there. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          04:22          the next morning when Mullah party in the fins woke up, they discovered the forest fire had burned itself out. And look at that, the lake has frozen solid overnight and his finished friends said yes, that sometimes happens and then they are looking to see what are those bumps on the ice over there. They go to investigate and I find themselves in this horrific sculpture garden of horses' heads sticking up out of the solid marble like floor of ice, like you said, hundreds. So hundreds of course heads on roads, abortions, these are the, these are not going to decay, right? Cause it's freezing cold. So they look there, they s those horses stayed there all winter and Muller Party was there in that region of the world. Uh, during that winter and every so often he and the other soldiers would go and have a smoke and they'd go into the sculpture garden and wander around looking up this miraculous thing. So the [inaudible] of the horses frozen in this lake, there's image beautiful and strange and disturbing and

Speaker 1:          05:33          the profound in some way made us wonder, made me wonder. I should say, I told you at the time, it don't trust this story. It's not scientifically impossible. And I hold keeping an open heart. You could this possibly be true. Could, could there be a grain, perhaps several grains, perhaps eight lakes worth of grains of truth. Your heart is story. Just your mind is like loose, like a thick. Anyway, I do

Speaker 4:          05:58          this for a year. Yeah. And you know what? We're going to, we're going to reconstruct that argument right now and take this uptown. All right. All right. Let's do this too. A real scientist [inaudible] this. In the course of our argument, we ended up going uptown to Rockefeller University to meet a couple people who know about ice, so we're going to go play with some super cool of ice among them. This fellow. Okay. I'm Alexandra Petroff. I am the Raymond and Beverly Sackler fellow. Who did you ever wonder who are Raymond and Beverly Sackler? They occasionally almost show up and I almost meet them, but I never have. Yeah. In any case, Alex, who must be said is an amazing dude, graciously agreed to demonstrate that you can in fact create the conditions of that massive lake inside a tiny little test tube. Okay. Could somebody hold this road in here and I'll get the tube set up?

Speaker 4:          06:50          Reached inside his freezer, grabbed his trusty Falcon. This is called a falcon tube. Just a blessing too. Filled with water. No, this is not normal water. This is the really nice water. It's very, very pure water. No minerals, no Dustin. There's like super distilled and he says when you take water like that and you cool it down, you can get it far below its freezing point and it won't freeze unless that is, you happen to have a horse. You have a tiny horse here. We have a tiny hole and we're going to drop that into the Falcon Tube and do that. That's going to be awesome. So he handed us the tube. I'm holding a little vile of super cooled water. What else? What temperature do you think this is that am I gonna make money? This is mine. Minus 20 c c Celsius. Wait, when does water freezes at zero. So it's 20 degrees below freezing point. It's still water. But now for a long cause we unscrewed the cap. Are you, are you filming? We held the little plastic horse over the tube countdown or something. Okay. On the count, three guilty. All right. Three, two, one.

Speaker 5:          08:01          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          08:01          for Jad because the moment that little plastic course hit the water, the water slammed into ice. Suddenly that little guy was trapped in an ice cube. Oh my God. It's Thor's is frozen. That's amazing. Please remember the horse was plastic. No animals were harmed in this experiment. Is this honestly breathtaking? Like it happens so fast. Catastrophic ice formation just like that. Did you hear the c word? Robert? Say it again. Catastrophic. This is Virginia Walker and I'm in the department of Biology Queens University. Virginia was one of the many people that we called up to ask like what the hell? Like why does this happen? It shouldn't. This water just freeze gradually the way that most water does, you know, at 32 degrees Fahrenheit or whatever. No, actually, so you see, this is why we have to start at the beginning. As Julie Andrews said, a very good to start.

Speaker 4:          08:55          Right? Alright. So the only reason that water freezes normally at zero Celsius and 32 Fahrenheit is that the something there that makes it freeze, we call that a nuclear later. Sounds like a superhero. Yeah. All right, so it's a nuclear later. A nuclear is like a seed, right? Didn't know this but it turns out water almost always needs a seed in order to grow ice because it turns out water by itself is not actually that good at remembering how to become ice. That is Erin pedit. She's a glaciologist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and what she means is that when water cools down, the molecules start to slow their movement. They get a little bit closer together and at that point they want all hold hands and become ice. The water molecules don't quite remember very well how they're supposed to be organized. They're like, wait, do you stand here a nice day in here?

Speaker 4:          09:51          How do we do this? Again, they need to be shown what combination of angles work the best to create a nice stable structure. What they need is say a speck of dust. That's the nuclear. If you throw in some dust into otherwise pure water, now they have a guide because ice can start to mimic whatever the, the, the shape of the dust particle is who had happens is that the water molecules start to form a cage around the dust particle. And that cage shape is very similar to the shape they need to make ice. And suddenly they're like, oh, that's how we do it. So in a sense the dust particle is reminding the water molecules how to freeze. Well, no, I don't think of it like that. Virginia says it's actually a not quite so gentle. Really what's happening is the dust particle is forcing the water molecules into the rate shape around it.

Speaker 4:          10:43          It's like a, it's like a command. It's nothing about memory. It's, it's, it's a physical thing. They just get jammed in it. Wow. That's just like Julie Andrews, like a Nazi [inaudible]. So then these, these, these meetings you'll get. So if as we just learned water needs a catalyst to nucleate or in order to freeze, does it this at least raise the possibility that that Finnish Russian lake had reached a super cooled state along come these horses and they were the nucleators maybe they had dust on their hair or whatever, I don't know. Whatever it was, it started a chain reaction. Ice Spread outward from these horses shot across the entire lake and froze the whole damn thing at once.

Speaker 3:          11:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          11:34          if you'll excuse me for just a second, because this is like a tyrading like impulse. I have [inaudible] now we can continue close yours there. Alright, we'll get to your skepticism in a moment, but I want to talk a little bit more about nucleators for a second because when we were talking with Virginia, she told us something kind of cool. We asked her like, what else? Uh, nucleates ice, like we learned about dust, but what else can do it? Okay, so the best nuclear later is ice itself. She says, if a little bit of snow falls into some water or a little bit ice forms in the water, organically, the water molecules will rush around that and Bam, if you don't have ice, what is the second best thing to nucleate this ice happens to be bacteria today. She says there are three different kinds of bacteria that can generate these special proteins, big honkin proteins that can instantly turn water into ice.

Speaker 4:          12:31          In fact, when we were reporting the story of video started circulating on the Internet that showed a scientist taken a bottle of water squirting coat, a little bit of this bacteria in, and then the thing just shot in the ice. And the cool thing is these bacteria are actually plant pathogens or plant killers. So you've probably seen grass growing in your backyard or whatever and it can be all covered with frost, but then you know the frost can melt and it's still green. Yeah, but if those bacteria present, she says they'll spit out their proteins onto the plant, which generates these ice crystals, the ice crystals, then slice the plant open and expose the inside of the plant. At the bacteria say, mm, yummy. He lunch and the eat the uh, eat the inside of the plant. It's a good strategy, but that's not the cool part.

Speaker 4:          13:19          Virginia says she has also found these proteins in bacteria that don't kill plants. So that made me think, made her wonder why, like why would they need to make ice? And that's when it occurred to her and a few other researchers. Maybe it's about transportation. Exactly what we're thinking about. These bacteria are just sitting on these plants and what happens is the wind comes along, blows up this little bacteria into the upper atmosphere, blows them literally up into the clouds. [inaudible] not particularly cold hardy. So now they have a situation, they do not want to be all the way up there. They got to get back down to the earth. And unless they hit your ride on those horses that you keep talking about, they're so light, they might not come down to earth. So what they do, she suspects is they use the plant trick.

Speaker 4:          14:07          They spit out these proteins into the cold wet cloud, which galvanizes the water molecules around them to form a snowflake around their body. So now they've got this little hovercraft that they can use to coast on down 15 meek ice. They can get back down and they can get back down in a different place and start a new colony of bacteria somewhere else. And so by this way, they get dispersed around the whole earth. Think about that. The next time it's winter and it's snows. Apparently if you melt each snowflake, you will find a little bacterium inside it. You're saying all of them, all the stuff I eat, I haven't looked at every single snowflake of course, but it makes perfect sense, doesn't it? But that's a myth. That's a very, very cool idea. Yeah. I suddenly like the bacteria Movio hell of a lot better than the horse movie. So at least I've, you know, and, and it at least has a shot at being true. Yeah. The horses. So when we were reporting this story and talking to Erin Pettit and Virginia Walker and a bunch of other scientists, when we asked them, could an entire league have flash frozen in an instant trapping all those horses uniformly? The answer that we got was no. Did you hear her? No. There. Did you hear the sound of it? Let me ask it to a different way. When you say absolutely not, just to kind of a gentle no, I'd say that's an absolutely not because as Aaron,

Speaker 1:          15:47          you told us when you're talking about freezing an entire lake, oh, you've got a lot of problems to consider. First, the process of freezing actually is a source of heat itself because like when water molecules form bonds to make ice, that's a lot of activity and activity produces energy and now that's going to make things a little bit warmer. Not to mention the fact that horses are warm blooded animals, so they also would slow down the process of freezing. Right. Also the water would never have been pure enough to super cool in the first place because there's, there's too many things in the lake that would provide that initial nucleation, plants, organisms, dirt. Dammit. Did somebody actually see this? What is the actual evidence that um, no, nobody saw

Speaker 4:          16:33          any of this as it actually happened when we told Walter merge with the scientists, told us in typical a multi merge fashion, he was icy, calm, and you reminded us that he never told us it was true that mallow parte often mixed fact and fiction and that the real reason he was attracted to this story was because it offered a metaphor for cosmology right at the beginning of the universe.

Speaker 1:          16:57          Really. I mean, I feel, excuse me if a small bit of skepticism do things. It's true for the universe. Metaphor, metaphor, the metaphor even. So what does he mean? What do you mean? Here's what he means. And if you're a physicist listening right now, just turn off the radio. We're just talking among ourselves here,

Speaker 4:          17:17          right? So you can think of it in one of two ways, right? The first is that idea of super cooling that we saw at Rockefeller where under the right circumstances, water can cool down way below its freezing point, not freeze, and then all of a sudden,

Speaker 1:          17:33          oh

Speaker 5:          17:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          17:38          and he can certainly do that, which we saw at Rockefeller in the test tube. Now, according to Jan 11 professor of physics and astronomy, Foreign College, Columbia University, the metaphor holds because that flash

Speaker 4:          17:50          freezing phenomenon actually happened repeatedly. She says in the moments after the Big Bang, yes, Super Cooling is definitely something that happens in the early universe. She says, right when the universe got its start, he was still small, like the size of a grapefruit inside that grapefruit. It was extremely hot back then. It was probably a million, trillion, trillion, trillion times hotter, million, trillion, trillion, trillion, 10 to the 32 times hotter. But as a little grapefruit began to expand, the temperature started to drop and it dropped and dropped to a point where the universe should freeze, so to speak, but it didn't, and it's waiting. It's waiting to freeze and you're like, what's happening? Why aren't you freezing? Then suddenly, yeah. Oh, there it goes. Phase change the, go ahead. Okay. I don't know exactly what you're saying. We keep going. All I'm saying is there's a lot of face changes. Some of them were super cool. Don't worry about it. Okay. There's another parallel, which I think is actually even more interesting, um, has to do with those seeds we talked about. So if you go back to the grapefruit,

Speaker 6:          18:54          okay,

Speaker 4:          18:54          inside, it's very, very hot. You've got this wash of energy and this energy is uniform, right? It's all [inaudible] the same thing spread evenly, everywhere, the same. But then as things cool, you begin to get these tiny fluctuations, little variations in temperature and density [inaudible] a little bit hotter and denser in one point than another. We're talking about clumps, like maybe over here is a little bit more mattered, right? He'd been over there and these are RC. I see. I don't think that you're describing seeds. Like I understand seed seeds are little things, things that attract other stuff. No, no. But these behave just like seeds because as the universe cools down and expands and begins to add all these new forces and all these new particles, gravity, electrons, photons, atoms, those little bits of variation from the beginning are still there. And now they're growing bigger because now we have gravity, right? So little concentrations of stuff are now attracting more stuff and then more stuff and then more stuff. And as the universe expands, they expand into ultimately those little blips have become these massive objects. It's amazingly the largest structures that we know about in the universe have their seeds in these tiny fluctuations. Does that mean when you yeah,

Speaker 6:          20:15          go on a, on a star wars kind of voyage. So you're in your spaceship and you're going at some incredibly high speeds. You're rushing through the universe and you see huge clouds of gas with nurseries for stars and you leave them and you go to a galaxy and then another galaxy [inaudible] galaxy over here and galaxy over there. And collectively here you're saying that these massive structures, walls of galaxies, neighborhoods of stars, that's gonna are reflections of very early

Speaker 1:          20:48          moment when something went in the initial broil of stuff like this. Some beautiful structures that you're describing are like the snowflakes around the little bit of dust.

Speaker 1:          21:03          What does that mean? That the empty spaces that we see when we gaze at the current universe are actually filled with something that hasn't cooled yet or that his quote or isn't visible to us or is working under different rules? I can hijack your question. I can say we might not have seen the last of the phase transitions. Our Universe is absolutely continuing to cool. Is it really? Yeah, it's cooling very cold right now. We have this, uh, dark energy driving the universe to expand at an ever accelerated rate and it's conceivable that in the future that energy will endorse some phase transition and it will go away or, or decay to something else in this new state of matter. It might do something different to the evolution of universe. So we might have a phase transition in our future.

Speaker 3:          21:55          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          21:56          suddenly they get a little

Speaker 3:          22:02          [inaudible].
