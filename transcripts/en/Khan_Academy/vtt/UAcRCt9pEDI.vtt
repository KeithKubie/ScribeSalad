00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.612
- [Instructor] What we're
gonna be doing in this video

00:00:01.612 --> 00:00:04.513
is get some practice
finding general solutions to

00:00:04.513 --> 00:00:07.059
separable differential equations.

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:10.369
So let's say that I had the
differential equation DY, DX,

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:13.279
the derivative of Y with
respect to X, is equal to

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:14.862
E to the X, over Y.

00:00:15.903 --> 00:00:18.747
See if you can find
the general solution to

00:00:18.747 --> 00:00:20.143
this differential equation.

00:00:20.143 --> 00:00:21.245
I'm giving you a huge hint.

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:24.122
It is a separable differential equation.

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:25.524
All right, so when we're dealing with

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:27.530
a separable differential
equation, what we wanna do

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.711
is get the Ys and the
DYs on one side, and then

00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:32.421
the Xs and the DXs on the other side.

00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:34.646
And we really treat these
differentials kind of

00:00:34.646 --> 00:00:36.785
like variables, which
is a little hand-wavy

00:00:36.785 --> 00:00:37.959
with the mathematics.

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:39.489
But that's what we will do.

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.015
So let's see. If we
multiply both sides times Y,

00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:46.620
so we're gonna multiply
both sides times Y,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.714
what are we going to get?

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:51.253
We're gonna get Y times a derivative of Y,

00:00:51.253 --> 00:00:55.497
with respect to X, is equal to E to the X,

00:00:55.497 --> 00:00:58.615
and now we can multiply both
sides by the differential,

00:00:58.615 --> 00:01:03.574
DX; multiply both of them
by DX; those cancel out.

00:01:03.574 --> 00:01:07.741
And we are left with Y times
DY is equal to E to the X, DX.

00:01:12.508 --> 00:01:15.884
And now we can take the
integral of both sides.

00:01:15.884 --> 00:01:17.881
So let us do that.

00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:20.946
So what is the integral of Y, DY?

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:23.275
Well here we would just
use the reverse power rule.

00:01:23.275 --> 00:01:26.831
We would increment the exponent,
so it's Y to the first,

00:01:26.831 --> 00:01:28.622
but so now when we take
the anti-derivative,

00:01:28.622 --> 00:01:31.649
it will be Y squared, and
then we divide by that

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.499
incremented exponent, is equal to, well

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:37.630
the exciting thing about
E to the X is that it's

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.983
anti-derivative, and its
derivative, is E to the X,

00:01:40.983 --> 00:01:45.150
is equal to E to the X,
plus is equal to E to the X

00:01:47.262 --> 00:01:48.720
plus C.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.190
And so we can leave it
like this if we like.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.120
In fact this right over
here is, this isn't

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.626
an explicit function.

00:01:55.626 --> 00:01:58.672
Y here isn't an explicit function of X.

00:01:58.672 --> 00:02:01.633
We could actually say Y is
equal to the plus or minus

00:02:01.633 --> 00:02:05.168
square root of two times
all of this business,

00:02:05.168 --> 00:02:09.455
but this would be a pretty
general relationship,

00:02:09.455 --> 00:02:13.657
which would satisfy this
separable differential equation.

00:02:13.657 --> 00:02:16.347
Let's do another example.

00:02:16.347 --> 00:02:20.097
So let's say that we
have the derivative of Y

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.314
with respect to X is equal
to, let's say it's equal to

00:02:26.314 --> 00:02:28.481
Y squared times sine of X.

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.491
Pause the video and see if you can find

00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:34.421
the general solution here.

00:02:34.421 --> 00:02:37.549
So once again, we wanna
separate our Ys and our Xs.

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.225
So let's see, we can
multiply both sides times

00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:43.836
Y to the negative two power,
Y to the negative two,

00:02:43.836 --> 00:02:47.422
Y to the negative two, these become one,

00:02:47.422 --> 00:02:50.501
and then we could also
multiply both sides times DX.

00:02:50.501 --> 00:02:53.623
So if we multiply DX here,
those cancel out, and then

00:02:53.623 --> 00:02:56.647
we multiply DX here,
and so we're left with

00:02:56.647 --> 00:03:01.102
Y to the negative two
power times DY is equal to

00:03:01.102 --> 00:03:05.269
sine of X, DX, and now we
just can integrate both sides.

00:03:08.524 --> 00:03:11.790
Now what is the anti-derivative
of Y to the negative two?

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.413
Well, once again we use
the reverse power rule.

00:03:15.413 --> 00:03:17.485
We increment the exponents,
so it's gonna be Y

00:03:17.485 --> 00:03:19.525
to the negative one, and
then we divide by that

00:03:19.525 --> 00:03:21.169
newly incremented exponent.

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.011
So we divide by negative one.

00:03:23.011 --> 00:03:25.001
Well that would just
make this think negative.

00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:27.584
That is going to be equal to...

00:03:28.761 --> 00:03:32.440
So, what's the
anti-derivative of sine of X?

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.398
Well, it is, you might recognize it if

00:03:34.398 --> 00:03:36.629
I put a negative there,
and a negative there.

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.293
The anti-derivative of negative sine of X,

00:03:38.293 --> 00:03:39.557
well that's cosine of X.

00:03:39.557 --> 00:03:43.838
So this whole thing is gonna
be negative cosine of X,

00:03:43.838 --> 00:03:46.469
or another way to write this:
I could multiply both sides

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:48.519
times a negative one, and so these would

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.609
both become positive, and so I could write

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.609
one over Y is equal to
cosine of X, and actually

00:03:57.728 --> 00:03:59.444
let me write it this
way, plus C; don't wanna

00:03:59.444 --> 00:04:00.947
forget my plus Cs.

00:04:00.947 --> 00:04:04.492
Plus C, or I could take the
reciprocal of both sides

00:04:04.492 --> 00:04:07.394
if I wanna solve explicitly
for Y, I could get Y

00:04:07.394 --> 00:04:10.644
is equal to one over cosine of X plus C

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:17.388
as our general solution.

00:04:18.283 --> 00:04:19.993
And we're done.

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:21.993
That was strangely fun.
