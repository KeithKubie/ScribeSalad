00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.874
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We know this point is negative 3,0 so the y coordinate is 0. We want to set y

00:00:04.874 --> 00:00:09.839
equal to 0 and solve for x, so these other choices won't work. So, I'm going to

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:14.454
let the y-value equal 0, and then I'm going to solve for x. 3 times 0 is 0, and

00:00:14.454 --> 00:00:19.493
then I divide both sides by negative 2. So, we get x is equal to negative 3.

00:00:19.493 --> 00:00:24.396
That's our x-intercept. This makes a lot of sense because the x-intercept

00:00:24.396 --> 00:00:29.479
happens when the line crosses the x-axis. So, we can't be vertically up or down

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:34.407
on the y-axis. The y must be zero. This x-axis is just an entire line, with all

00:00:34.407 --> 00:00:39.070
the y-coordinates being equal to zero. So, plugging in zero for y into our

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.365
equation gives us the x-intercept.
