00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.390
Now week 0 and

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:06.230
week 20 are both pretty interesting in
terms of the graph of this equation.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.270
Let's take a look at what's going on.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.080
So, we have this equation which relates
the number of weeks to the money owed,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.410
x to y.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.131
And we know that at 0 weeks,
or x =0, y = 200.

00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:20.501
He owes $200.

00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:23.991
And when x = 20, y = 0.

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:26.590
So after 20 weeks he
doesn't owe any money.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.603
And I can represent
these as ordered pairs.

00:00:29.603 --> 00:00:31.300
In this case, (0, 200).

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.027
And in this case (20, 0).

00:00:35.027 --> 00:00:36.594
And if this is my graph paper,

00:00:36.594 --> 00:00:40.720
I'm going to make each of these lines
represent let's say five on the x-axis.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.115
So 5, 10, 15, 20.

00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:46.540
And each of the lines
represent 50 on the y-axis.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.635
So, 50, 100, 150, 200.

00:00:49.635 --> 00:00:51.220
Well, then I can plot these points.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.481
(0, 200), (20, 0).

00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:58.110
And we see that they're special points.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.155
This point, (0, 200), is special
because it's right on the y-axis.

00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:06.105
And so, we call it the y-intercept.

00:01:06.105 --> 00:01:09.775
It's going to be where the graph
intercepts the y-axis.

00:01:09.775 --> 00:01:13.902
And this point, well,
it lives right on the x-axis.

00:01:13.902 --> 00:01:15.470
So, you might be able to guess.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.540
This is what we call the x-intercept.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.540
And what's really cool is that these
two points fully describe a line.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.680
They represent all the information
I need to know to draw a graph.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.270
Because all I have to
do is connect the dots.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.150
And generally, I want to extend my line
to continue in either direction as well.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.250
And I almost forgot to label my axes.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.510
Now, why don't we practice with
a slightly different graph?

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.870
Can you tell me what the x and
y-intercepts are for this graph?

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.750
Enter the x and y coordinates of
the x-intercept, and likewise for

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.044
the y-intercept.
