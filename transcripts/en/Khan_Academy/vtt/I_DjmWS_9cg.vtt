00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.790
- [Instructor] Hemophilia is
an X-linked recessive trait

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.130
that affects blood clotting.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.030
If someone has hemophilia, their
blood has trouble clotting.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.780
If a carrier woman and a
hemophiliac man have a daughter,

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.380
what is the percent chance
that she, the daughter,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.400
will have hemophilia?

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.750
So, if you're so inspired,
pause this video,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.320
and try to work through this on your own.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.000
All right, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.790
And to do this, let's
think about the genotypes

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.990
of both the mother and the father.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.150
So, let's start with the mother.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.380
And since it is an
X-linked recessive trait,

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.420
we're going to be dealing
with the sex chromosomes.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.440
So, let's just remind
ourselves that the mother,

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.760
because she's female, is going to be XX,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.380
have two X chromosomes.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.620
The father,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.540
the father is going to
have an X chromosome

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.490
and a Y chromosome.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.480
But now let's think about the hemophilia.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.320
They say it's a carrier woman.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.940
So, a carrier woman means that
one of her two X chromosomes

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.340
would have the hemophilia allele,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.050
and the other one wouldn't.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.840
Carrier implies that she
doesn't show the trait.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.300
She doesn't have hemophilia,
but she's carrying one of these

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.700
X-linked recessive hemophilia alleles.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.600
So, we could say that
one of her chromosomes,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.510
one of her X chromosomes
does not have hemophilia.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.000
I use capital H for the dominant allele,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.293
which you would say is no hemophilia.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.740
We tend to use the
capital for the dominant.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.890
And then the lowercase h,

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.850
well, this would be the X chromosome

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.580
that has the hemophilia allele.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.890
And I did it lowercase h
because it is a recessive trait.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.723
And so this is

00:01:36.448 --> 00:01:37.365
hemophilia.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.050
And now, what about the father?

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.140
Well, it's X-linked,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.940
and the father only has one X chromosome.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.720
And they say it's a hemophiliac man.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.750
And so that one X chromosome

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.320
is going to have the hemophilia allele.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.840
And so the reason why
he exhibits hemophilia

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.010
is that there is no other X chromosome

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.090
with the dominant allele to be dominant

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.450
over the hemophilia allele.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.960
But now let's cross these
two with a Punnett square.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.010
So, the father to the
offspring could contribute

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.600
the X chromosome that
has the hemophilia allele

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.393
or a Y chromosome.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.400
And the mother can
contribute the X chromosome

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.850
that doesn't have the hemophilia allele

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.690
or the X chromosome that does
have the hemophilia allele.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.863
And now I'll draw my
little Punnett square here.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.720
So, there you go.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.650
And so what are the different scenarios?

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.250
Well, this top-left scenario
would be I get the X chromosome

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.100
from the mother that does not
have the hemophilia allele,

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.240
and I get the X chromosome from the father

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.400
that does have the hemophilia allele.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.120
This scenario is the X
chromosome from the mother

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.930
with the hemophilia allele
and the X chromosome

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.320
from the father with
the hemophilia allele.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.460
This scenario is the X
chromosome from the mother

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.710
without the hemophilia
allele, so no hemophilia,

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.970
or with the non-hemophilia allele,

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.620
and the Y chromosome from the father.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.230
And this is the X
chromosome from the mother

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.020
that has the hemophilia allele

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.670
and the Y chromosome from the father.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.040
Now, what is the percent chance that she,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.530
that a daughter would have hemophilia?

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.930
So, which of these
scenarios show a daughter?

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.600
Well, the daughters are
going to be the XX scenarios.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.220
So, these are the two scenarios

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.620
in which they have a daughter.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.430
These two, because there's a Y chromosome,

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.260
these would be them having a son.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.370
So, out of the two scenarios
where they have a daughter,

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.300
one of those scenarios

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.550
you have two of the recessive alleles.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.973
And so this is a situation
where you have a daughter,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.083
daughter with hemophilia,

00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:47.150
hemophilia,

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.010
right over here.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.860
And so, if we know they have a daughter,

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.770
what is the percent chance
that she will be a hemophiliac?

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.550
Well, one out of two,

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.290
so there is a 50% chance.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.520
Now, what's useful about
this Punnett square

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.340
is you could answer
all sorts of questions.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.610
You could say what is the percent chance

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.980
that they have a hemophiliac son?

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.270
Well, one out of these four
scenarios is a hemophiliac son.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.100
Then you would say there's a 25% chance

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.090
that they have a hemophiliac son.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.790
Similarly, there is a 25% chance

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.090
that they have a non-hemophiliac son.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.650
If someone said what is the percent chance

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.020
that they have a hemophiliac offspring?

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.090
Well, that would be these two
scenarios right over here.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.780
So, two out of the four scenarios
are hemophiliac offspring,

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.750
so that would be 50%.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.280
If you said, given that they had a son,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.620
what is the percent chance that
they don't have hemophilia?

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.370
Well, you would say, given
that they have a son,

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.390
so that would be those two scenarios,

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:45.647
one out of those two scenarios,

00:04:45.647 --> 00:04:47.690
the son does not have hemophilia.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.180
So, that would again be a 50%.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.313
So anyway, hopefully this was useful.
