Speaker 1:          00:01          So today we find ourselves in a very different novelistic world than we've been in for the last week and a half on the road. Um, did anyone take this course because they love on the road? Anybody one sort of ambivalently yes. Okay. Sometimes I do get students who, um, have just an image of this novel in their mind or they read it when they were in high school and have a sort of irrational, passionate love for it. Um, and, and so sometimes people approach it in that way. And I think in a way it holds that aura around itself in our culture and in the history of the novel in this period that we're studying together. I'm going to talk a little bit about it's publishing history. Um, it's compositional history actually at the end of my two lectures on the novels. So I would ask you just to reserve whatever curiosity you have about that.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Um, so I, in a way, I'm flipping my usual practice. I would tell you a little bit about its publication history at the beginning. I'm going to do that at the end. Um, for this reason that it has such a special place in the imagination of our culture and so I'm going to talk about that after we have a better understanding of what's going on in the book. My point at the end of my lecture on the Lita on Monday was that [inaudible] is trying to imagine an autonomous work of art that has a life to it that is in some sense animated or personified, and that this desire to make the aesthetic something living introduces to the world of the aesthetic, the problem of mortality, it's mortality that gives it that sense of ephemeral value, but it's also mortality that threatens to cancel it out altogether.

Speaker 1:          02:10          The language that the beets tried to imagine tried to write takes up some of these problems that we saw in Dubach off. Unlike Novakof, these writers are not trying to make a language that is autonomous and separate from the world, so you will not see the kind of artifice and the Labor detention to form. You're not going to have a writer spending a month on the representation of a barber from Kaz beam. You're not going to get that in the beats. Um, instead you're getting something, a language that tries to come as close as possible, not necessarily to life in all its facets, but to life as we experience it in a certain way. This is not a rejection of modernism and its desire for the autonomous work of art. Um, because partly as I've shown the, I like the desire for the autonomous work of art shades into the desire to replicate life.

Speaker 1:          03:29          There is that desire much more explicitly in the writing of Jack Kerouac, the desire to replicate experience as you read the feeling of having the experience that the writer wants you to have and that the writer himself has had, that's always going to be important, um, to understanding this work. So that's one aspect in which it shares something with modernism. Even though stylistically and as a matter of craft and composition, it looks very distinct. The other way it shares an ambition of modernism is precisely in that effort to communicate experience consciousness. So if you've read it all in the novels of, for a Virginia Woolf, for example, or in James Joyce's novels, you know, that part of modernist innovation, part of the stylistic difficulty is the effort to put on the page what happens in the mind, that sense of the mind drifting from one idea to another that you get in Virginia Woolf's prose.

Speaker 1:          04:41          So magically in Woolf's prose. So that is something these writer's share with modernism. But there's one big difference and I want to exemplify that for you just by reading to you two parallel texts, one from the modernist Canon and one from the beat Canon. So first I want to read to you, um, the footnote to ts Elliot's the wasteland. Now, the wasteland was the first, uh, the first poem to have footnotes and you have to ask yourself, what do you have to think? The poem is in order to think that it needs footnotes. Um, so I'm going to, uh, say a little bit more about that, but let me just read to you first, um, from the notes on the wasteland, not only the title, but the plan. And a good deal of the incidental symbolism of the poem were suggested by Miss Jesse l Weston's book on the grail legend from ritual to Romance Cambridge.

Speaker 1:          05:52          He has a little bibliography there. Indeed. So deeply am I indebted Miss Weston's book. Will Lucy elucidate the difficulties of the poem much better than my notes can do and I recommend it apart from the great interest of the book itself to any who think such elucidation of the poem worth the trouble to another work of anthropology. I am indebted in general one which has influenced our generation profoundly. I mean the golden bough I have used, especially the two volumes, Adonis Atis, oh Cyrus, anyone who was acquainted with these works will immediately recognize in the poem certain references to vegetation ceremonies. And then there are particular notes, uh, for the different parts of the poem. That's the introduction to the footnotes. What I want you to note there is the sense that the matter of the poem comes from an archive and archive of scholarly work, a body of knowledge that you read about. So now, and I also want you to note that language, Miss Jessie Western. It's a very mannered decorous language. Now I would like to read to you from the footnote to how Allen Ginsburg's famous poem that for many people embodied at the time what it meant to be engaged in this new literary project. So this is footnote to how

Speaker 2:          07:29          holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy.

Speaker 1:          07:40          The world is holy. That is holy. The skin is holy. The nose is holy. The Tang and cock and hand and Asshole, holy, everything is wholly, everybody's holy. Everywhere is wholly. Every day is in eternity. Every man's in angel, the bums as holy as the Sarah Fim. The Madman is holy. As you my soul are wholly, the typewriter is holy. The poem is holy. The voices holy, the hearers are wholly the ecstasy is holy. Holy Pete, her Holy Allen, Holy Solomon, Holy Lucian, holy Kerouac, holy Hunka, holy Burroughs, holy Cassidy, holy. The unknown, buggered and suffering beggars. Holy. The hideous human angel colts.

Speaker 1:          08:35          Little different tone, don't you? Few things I want to note about that. Besides the obvious, the fallout of poetic inspiration is not to be found in an archive. It is not be found in Miss Jessie Weston's book on ritual and Romance. It is not to be found with a bibliography saying Cambridge. Okay. That's not where you find the fount of the great poem. The footnote to Howell says that the source of Howell, that's what footnotes. Are there an indication of the source? It says that the source of the poetry is that wholly lived experience and a particular slice of lived experience. The formerly rejected the in decorous the ecstatic. I noticed that, um, several of you were smiling in a way as I read that suggested you were embarrassed by the performance. Right. I did not elicit this by accident. Embarrassment is something that the beats value.

Speaker 3:          10:10          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          10:11          When Ginsburg first read Howl,

Speaker 3:          10:14          okay.

Speaker 1:          10:15          He, uh, he was on stage and there was a little bathroom was that, this was an in, uh, um, I think it was in a bookstore. I can't remember. I, I didn't reread my notes on how, um, and so when the show started, he was, he was in the bathroom on the pot with the door open and then he sorta hiked. He got up and he hiked up his pants and he walked out and he, he gave his reading of how this is indicative of the sense that he wants to lay bare in a literal way, all the see Munis of human life, all the aspects of what it means to be an embodied person. All the ecstasies that come from that embodiment. And of course this is not at all original to Ginsburg. Uh, if you read Walt Whitman, you will see much, uh, much of the same ethos and probably a lot better poetry. Um, so Ginsburg is not the first to do this in the American tradition for sure, but it's a very important part of what the beats revive. And I want to get at that question of embarrassment because it comes up very explicitly on page 36 embarrassment is the monetized in on the road.

Speaker 3:          11:44          Okay.

Speaker 1:          11:45          And it's assigned what I think is a very interesting provenance. So this is Chad king talking to sal paradise. Uh, quavering twain comes out when he speaks. The thing I always liked sell about the plains Indians was the way they always got sedan and embarrassed after they boasted the number of scalps they got in Roxanne's life in the far west. There's an Indian who gets all red over blushing because he thought so many scalps and he runs like hell into the plains to glory over his deeds in hiding. Damn, that tickled me. This sense of embarrassment is the sense that the excess of what joy in this, uh, in this, um, passage, the Indians bravery, his achievement, his success, all of that is in excess of the decorous presentation of that experience, of that real world of life, of that excessive joy. And it's given here this sort of cliched noble origin with the native American, the plains Indian. So there's a sense in the plains Indian that he is both the embodiment of a noble restrained lineage, but also deepen that American past is this sense of, of great access. Embarrassment tells us we're in the presence of the excess. And that's why beat writers court it, that's why I courted it. Um, today for you,

Speaker 1:          13:49          the excess requires for the beets a new kind of language, one aspect of their language, which maybe you've noticed it on the road. It's not quite so pronounced and on the road as it is elsewhere, certainly in the letters that, that these figures right to each other. Um, part of that is the elimination of small words, VI and um, the abbreviation of certain words, your to why are there all kinds of little abbreviations they they make. And it suggests that language has to be wrenched out of its conventions. Syntax can be set aside, language needs to move at the speed of experience and at the speed of ecstasy. So that's one small way in the language that they practiced, tried to imitate the experience that they were a immersing themselves in. Um, but there were more formulated, formulated, um, ways of capturing that experience in language.

Speaker 1:          14:57          Jack Kerouac, uh, had a list of essential that he taped up on his wall when he was writing. Um, and this is what they include, scribbled secret notebooks and wild type written pages for your own joy. And that's why our your own joy, submissive to everything, open listening, tried never to get drunk outside your own house. Well this is a piece of advice. Clearly he never took. Be In love with your life. Be Crazy dumb. Seem to have the mind blow as deep as you want to blow, right what you want. Bottomless from bottom of the mind, the unspeakable visions of the individual entranced fixation, dreaming upon object before you. And then my st my, my favorite one is you're a genius all the time. Now try putting that up in front of your desk. You're a genius all the time. It will help you to produce a lot of writing.

Speaker 1:          16:09          I guarantee. Um, Kerouac tried over and over again to write on the road and it was an effort to practice this kind of free language that would be uninhibited and that would gesture towards some deeper, bottomless part of the human experience. The human soul. Sometimes it was spiritualized. Um, in this sense, this is why I put this quote up on the board from on the road. We've got to go some place, find something. There's a relentless seeking sense that's at the heart of this work. Now, for those of you who don't know, I'm on the road, does document pretty closely the actual road trips that Jack Kerouac took, uh, with Neal Cassady and a whole host of others. And I can do a little decoding for you. Old Bully is William Burroughs and his wife, Jane Jane Lee. Um, Hunka, I can't remember who Hunka is now in the book.

Speaker 1:          17:27          These are some minor characters who lived with them and went to Columbia with them or were in their circle when these writers lived in the neighborhoods in New York, around Columbia University. So Alan Ginsburg is Carlo marks. Um, and Ginsburg went to Columbia. He was kicked out of Columbia, um, and then sort of went back, was in and out of school. So a lot of them were in this little community and they picked up wanderers and various people who, um, wanted to learn from them. And that's what Neal Cassady, uh, was to them at first I kind of wander or who wanted to be in their intellectual, uh, but Bohemian circle.

Speaker 3:          18:13          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:14          So you see the kind of language that Neal represents, um, at the very beginning of the novel. First of all, he's introduced in this very mysterious way.

Speaker 3:          18:33          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          18:35          First reports of him, this is on, on the first page of part one. The middle of that first paragraph, first reports of him came to me through Chad King, who'd known, who showed me a few letters from him written in New Mexico reformed school. So his letters come out of this western land, New Mexico and a land of criminality, the reform school. So he's exotic just from the very beginning and it's an exotic language. It's the letters that come out of this exotic place that first catch their attention.

Speaker 3:          19:14          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:15          I was tremendously interested in the letters because they so naive. Lee and sweetly ask Chad to teach him all about Nicha and all the wonderful intellectual things that Chad knew. At one point Carlo and I talked about the letters and wondered if we would ever meet the strange Dean Moriarty. This is all far back when Dean was not the way he is today when he was a young jail kid. Shrouded in mystery. Then news came that dean was out of reform school and was coming to New York for the first time. Also there was talk that he had just married a girl called Mary Lou. It's that passive sense. There was talk who's talking? We don't know. That passive verb there was talk gives you the sense that there's this wide community passing word mouth to mouth of the coming of a mysterious spiritual figure. First reports of him news came. There was talk. So language is this communal set of rumors spiritualized by its very vagueness and shared quality and then it's just fascinating to listen to what Dean says. No, this is on page two. This is how he talks. All this

Speaker 1:          20:47          time dean was telling Mary Lou things like this. Now Darling, here we are in New York and although I haven't quite told you everything that I was thinking about when we about when we crossed the Missouri Cross Missouri and especially at the point when we passed the Boonville were reformatory which reminded me of my jail problem. It is absolutely necessary now to post pone all those leftover things concerning our personal love things and at once begin thinking of specific work work life plans and so on in the way he had in those early days. His language is a sort of mishmash of poorly used academic locations, work life plans. It sounds almost like a corporate speak in a way. It has that, that um, dry quality to it.

Speaker 3:          21:39          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:39          And then on the top of three we get another example. In other words, we've got to get on the ball, darling. What I'm saying. Otherwise it'll be fluctuating and lack of true knowledge or crystallization of our plans. So this is not yet that idealized speech that cure wack is dreaming of when he writes the list of essential for spontaneous prose. That's deans language is not that in these passages is desire for the intellectual download from Chad is not what's going to make him the figure of the new language for so

Speaker 3:          22:25          okay.

Speaker 1:          22:25          Rather it is another kind of language that he represents that will be that kind of germ of what sal was looking for.

Speaker 1:          22:38          This is UC also want to, at the beginning here I went to the cold water flat with the boys and dean came to the door in his shorts. Mary Lou was jumping off the couch. Dean had dispatched the occupant of the apartment to the kitchen probably to make coffee while he proceeded with his love problems for to him, sex was the one and only holy and important thing in life. Although he had to sweat and curse to make a living and so on. You saw that in the way he stood bobbing his head, always looking down, nodding like a young boxer to insert two instructions to make you think he was listening to every word throwing in a thousand yeses and that's right. There's this sense of enthusiasm. So his response is not an articulation of some thought, but in a fusion. Yes, that's right. It's a visceral response and you see it even more clearly on four.

Speaker 3:          23:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:39          So he's staying, Dean is staying with sound and sal has writing and they're ready to go out and sell. Says, hold on a minute, I'll be right with you. As soon as I finish this chapter and it was one of the best chapters in the book. Then I dressed and off we flew to New York to meet some girls. So I'm going to skip along a little bit. Um, I was, uh, let's see. As we, uh, actually I'm going to read that part. As we rose, as we wrote in the bus in the weird phosphorescent void of the Lincoln tunnel, we leaned on each other with fingers waving and yelled and talk to excitedly. And I was beginning to get the bug. Like Dean, he was simply a youth, tremendously excited with life. And though he was a con man, he was only calling because he wanted so much to live and get involved with people who would otherwise pay no attention to him.

Speaker 1:          24:32          He was calling me and I knew it for room and board and how to write, et Cetera, and he knew. I knew this had been the basis of our relationship, but I didn't care and we got along fine. No pestering, no catering. We tiptoed around each other like heartbreaking new friends. I began to learn from him as much as he probably learned from me as far as my work was concerned. He said, go ahead. Everything you do is great. He watched over my shoulder as I wrote stories yelling. Yes, that's right. Wow Man. And Phew. Wow is dean's word.

Speaker 1:          25:07          Wow is the kind of word that means nothing, but it suggests the immediacy of Dean's engagement. So all that talking on the bus and the way they're moving their hands, the bug, that's all where this language is rising from. That's where the new language it was going to come from. And you can see how so assimilates that on page 35 this is just as he is coming into Denver. I said to myself, wow, what will Dan for me like I got on that hot road and off I went in a brand new car driven by Denver businessmen of about 35 he went 70. I tingled all over accounted minutes and subtracted miles just to head over the rolling wheat fields, fields, all golden beneath the distance snows of SDS. I'd be seeing old Denver at last. I pictured myself in a Denver bar that night with all the gang and in their eyes I would be strange and ragged and like the prophet who has walked across the land to bring the dark word and the only word I had was wow.

Speaker 3:          26:29          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          26:29          So Neil's so I mean, uh, sorry. Yeah. Um, dean sense, I will do this and please forgive me. I will sometimes slip into calling him dean because he didn't, uh, sorry. Do you ever mind, you know what I'm saying? Um, I will sometimes slip into calling him kneel when his name is dean. Um, Dean has already projected this motive language into south. So even as he's saying to south, teach me how to write, what he's doing is teaching sao how to write, how to write this kind of book, how to be the prophet of wow.

Speaker 3:          27:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:16          This is all over the text. If you look at on 62, page 62, some of these little stories, Remy woke up and saw me come in the window, his great laugh, one of the greatest laughs in the world [inaudible] in my ear. And then if you just skip up to the top of 63, the strange thing was that next door to Remy lived in Negro called Mr. Snow. Who's laugh I swear on the Bible was positively. And finally the one greatest laugh in all this world. The laugh is a lot like the wow. It's that sound you make just because you're experiencing something just because you're having a response to what's in front of you. Something someone says. Okay, that's another example. Um, and the last one I'll give you is on 55.

Speaker 1:          28:14          This is when they've gone up to the mountain pass after getting in fights in the bars in Denver in the whole eastern dark wall of the divide this night there was silence and the whisper of the wind, except in the ravine where we roared. And on the other side of the divide was the great western slope and the big plateau that went to steamboat springs, springs and dropped and led you to the western Colorado Desert and the Utah desert all in darkness. Now as we fumed and screamed in our mountain nook, mad drunk and Americans in the mighty land, we were on the roof of America and all we could do was yell, I guess across the night eastward over the plains where somewhere in old man with white hair was probably walking towards us with the word and would arrive any minute and make us silent there, yell at the top of the world, seems to sow something that calls for a replacement.

Speaker 1:          29:17          It calls for some other profit to come walking ragged towards them and make them fall silent with his word. But in the meantime, what you have is the continual reproduction of that yell, that laugh that wow, that, yes, that, that's all right. All those things they say just to register their existence and their relation with one another. I want to note something else though about the first time that Dean and sal meat and the contextualizing of that meeting, when they first meet in that passage that I read to you, he's just rising up from having sex on the couch with Mary Lou in someone else's apartment. He sent the owner of the apartment into the kitchen so he could have sex with Mary Lou on the couch. In other versions, he says that, um, that dean got up and was naked, not that he was in his shorts.

Speaker 1:          30:22          There's an immediate sexual sense that charges the relationship between these people. It also, those relationships take place in the context of continual negotiations of sexual relationships. And so the book begins with that explanation that I first met Dean not long after my wife and I split up. I had just gotten over a serious illness that I won't bother to talk about except that it had something to do with the miserably weary splitting up in my feeling that everything was dead. Deans negotiations between Mary Lou and Camille in Denver where he has his schedule and he has this exact time he has to get from one hotel to the other to sleep with each of them. And then he has to meet Carlo Ginsburg in the, I mean this bird Carlo marks in the basement in the basement, uh, to have his, his conversations to get to the bottom lessness of each other's mind.

Speaker 1:          31:26          All those negotiations are absolutely crucial. It's what they spend their time talking about. Often it's what they spend their time negotiating. So the search for the immediate language of experience is part and parcel of a very complex negotiation of sexual ties between multiple people. And it's not just between the men and the women, it's between the men and the men. And that moment when, um, when south meets dean at the door and he's naked, it's reflected when he sees dean with Camille. Camille opens the door to their room when they're in Denver and he finally sees dean in Denver. He opens the door to the room and there's a picture that Camille has drawn of Dean, a portrait of him completely naked. And it notes, you know, his, his penis. In that picture it says, if Sal's first experience of Dean is already in that scene, assimilated into the image of Dean, the disembodied aesthetic image of dean.

Speaker 1:          32:43          But that aesthetic image of Dean is all bound up in these negotiations. So it's a picture that Camille has drawn. And of course Camille doesn't know that he's sleeping with Mary Lou in another hotel on the same day and so on. So all of that is very palpable and Sal's own desire for Dean is sublimated in those scenes, but it's everywhere at the level of the language. And if you note the repeated presence of that question, where was dean, where was dean? He's always missing. When sal gets to Denver, that's what he wants to know. When he gets back to New York. Finally at the end of this first road trip, he has missed dean. There's always the sense that dean evades him, and I think part of that sense of any vacating object of desire is again, the pursuit of sex in this novel. It's part of the pursuit of sex.

Speaker 3:          33:54          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          33:57          You might think given all this and given the ultimate plot of on the road, that being on the road is about pursuing that kind of desire, and that is necessitated by leaving home. You have to leave home in order to pursue that desire. But I would suggest to you that home is absolutely crucial to the production of this desire. And I want to point you to page 26

Speaker 1:          34:32          this is south story about big slim hazard. A Hobo that he wants knew as a little boy. Oh, so he was a hobo by choice as a little boy. He'd seen a Hobo come up to ask his mother for a piece of Pie, and she had given it to him. And when the Hobo went off down the road, the little boy had said, my work was that fellow. Why that's a Hobo Ma. I want to be a Hobo someday. Shut your mouth. That's not for the like of the hazards, but he never forgot that day. And when he grew up after a short spell playing football at Lsu, he did become a hobo. Being a Hobo is produced in this little vignette by the experience of seeing a Hobo get pie from your mother. Now, did any of you notice how often sal eats pie? Let me just demonstrate the litany of Pi. Okay. Page 15

Speaker 3:          35:36          yes.

Speaker 1:          35:38          Actually, let's start on 14 or perhaps on 13

Speaker 4:          35:44          hmm.

Speaker 1:          35:45          13 along about three in the morning after an apple pie and ice cream in a roadside stand. That's so top of 14 I ate another apple pie and ice cream. That's practically all I ate all the way across the country. I knew it was nutritious and it was delicious. 15 bottom. I ate apple pie and ice cream. It was getting better. As I got deeper into Iowa, the pie bigger, the ice cream richer. There were the most beautiful bevies of girls everywhere. I looked in Des Moines that afternoon. They were coming home from high school, but I had no time now for thoughts like that and promised myself a ball in Denver. And if you look on one oh seven, the first thing sell does when he gets home is eat. When I got home, I ate everything in the icebox. My mother got up and looked at me.

Speaker 1:          36:35          Poor little Salvatore. She said, in Italian, you are Theon, you're thin. Where have you been? All this time I had on two shirts and two sweaters. My canvas bag had torn cotton field pants and the tattered remnants of my Herati shoes in it. My aunt and I decided to buy a new electric refrigerator with the money I had sent her from California. It was to be the first one in the family. There is a sense in which hunger, the hunger generated by the road in south case. In this last scene he's been panelists. All he had was cough drops to eat at the very end. Um, that the hunger generated by the road exists in a necessary relation to the consumption of home. And I would suggest to you that the consumption of home is driven by a certain kind of desire as well. That desire to move up in the American class structure, the first electric refrigerator in my family, he's earned a little money on the road and sent it home.

Speaker 1:          37:46          What it does for him is allow him to buy his aunt, this symbol of a middle class American domesticity and he is a happy participant in this new purchase. This is not exactly just what the women do while the boys are out on the road. The boys want the pie. The boys want to become hobos because there's a kind of hunger that's generated at home. It's satisfied at home, but it's also generated at home. And I want to suggest to you that part of the misogyny of the novel, which I'm sure is palpable to all of us as we read part of that misogyny is connected to this consumptive ethos. So when we talk about desire for something, we've got to go some place, find some thing. The very vagueness of that desire is connected with the basic hungers of the body for sex, for food, for sleep. Even we see dean sort of begging for sleep, uh, after his conversation with Carlo marks in the basement in Denver. Those kinds of desires are connected also with that American habit of consumption. This is a consumer society. In the 1950s it was already very much so. The mass production after World War Two had already taken hold. Supermarkets as we saw in wise blood are already something one can be fond of as Enoch was. And so if this is a novel whose aura has always said to us, be free, be counter cultural.

Speaker 1:          39:52          What I'm suggesting is that it's structured around a very deeply embedded American cultural trait of consumption. It spiritualizes that kind of desire and my symbol for it is pie.

Speaker 3:          40:19          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          40:21          One I'll show you one last thing about how the language works and this is on page 49

Speaker 3:          40:36          okay.

Speaker 1:          40:38          To set aside the critique of that search for a moment. I just want to move back into it in these spiritual terms and see what we can see.

Speaker 1:          40:51          When Dean and Carlo are talking to each other, there's a lot of anxiety on either part about whether they have actually attained that thing that they were looking for. On 48 they're talk is decide is described as business in the beginning. Then they got down to business. They sat on the bed, cross legged and looked at each other. I slouched in a nearby chair and saw all of it. They began with an abstract thought, disgust. It reminded each other of another abstract point. Forgotten in the rush of events, Dean apologized but promised he could get back to it and manage it. Fine, bringing up illustrations and then they have this very complicated back and forth about things that they remembered or didn't and they hash these things over.

Speaker 3:          41:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:43          Then Carlo as dean, if he was honest and specifically if he was being honest with him in the bottom of his soul, why do you bring that up again? There's one last thing I want to know, but dear sal, you're listening. You're sitting there, we'll ask cell. What would he say? And I said, that last thing is what you can't get, Carlo, nobody can get to that last thing. We keep on living in hopes of catching it once for all.

Speaker 3:          42:14          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          42:15          So all this language is produced because you can't ever get to that last thing. You have to keep hashing it over. But if you, if you, um, go to the next page,

Speaker 3:          42:27          yeah,

Speaker 1:          42:27          you can see actually two pages over. You can see that already sao is taking what he can get from this language and transposing it into his experience of reality. So Carlo had earlier, just, sorry to flip back and forth. So much had had, had read earlier his poem, this is on 47, um, to sell. He's, he'd been reading poetry.

Speaker 1:          43:01          Carla woke up in the morning and heard the vulgar pigeons yakking in the street outside his cell. He saw the sad Nightingale's nodding on the branches and they reminded him of his mother. A gray shroud fell over the city, the mountains, the magnificent Rockies that you can see to the west from any part of town where paper machine say the whole universe was crazy and cockeyed and extremely strange. So this is what Carlo represents in his poetry. Well, if you look Sao after witnessing what it means, what their business is with one another, the way they try to get to the bottom of each other's soul.

Speaker 3:          43:36          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          43:37          he looks out and he sees the world through Carlos eyes. He's been awake though all this time. Listening. What were you thinking, Sal? I told them that I was thinking they were very amazing maniacs and that I had spent the whole night listening to them like a man watching the mechanism of a watch that reached clear to the top of Berta to burritoed pass and was yet made with the smallest works of the most delicate watch in the world. They smiled. I pointed my finger at them and said, if you keep this up, you'll both go crazy, but let me know what happens as you go along. I walked out and took a trolley to my apartment and Carlo Marx's paper machine mountains grew red as the great sun rose from the eastward plains. So the poetry that is part and parcel of the between Dean and Carlo, Carlos Poetry seeps out of that basement room and there's a, a real spatial sense here that it's being generated at the base of the world and it goes up in, it transforms these mountains into paper mushy.

Speaker 1:          44:51          It makes them in one sense, false. There's a falseness to the overlay that Carlo gives to sal and through which he then sees there's a falseness, a craftiness, but it's a kind of folk craftiness. This is not the craftiness of modernism. This is paper machete, a fairly crude folk art. Anyone can do it, get your strips of newspaper and paste them up. So it has a quality that is different from Humberto elaborate worldview through which we see or don't see Lolita. It's a very different kind of crafting, but yet it does replace reality in a similar way or it makes demands on reality that pushed the real back. And so even though they can never get to the bottom of their souls, they can never get a cell says that last thing you could. That's what you could never have. Even though that's true, it has this world making power.

Speaker 1:          46:10          To what end will that power be used? This is one question I want you to think about as you finish this novel. What do these figures think language can be used for? What's it good for? What can it do for them? What beyond that kind of economics of desire, that accounting, if you look on 1-081-OH-SEVEN-108 again, the very end of the section, I had my home to go to my place to lay my head down and figure the losses and figure the gain that I knew was in there somewhere too. What are the losses? What are the gains? Is it just a representation of an imaginative and desire full economy, or is there some other thing being produced here? What is the sump thing? What is the someplace? So in that relation, I'd like you to think about the representation of America in the novel. What do you see there when you think about the America? They're giving us all these figures, so that's free or reading in section. Um, please bring Lolita. I think you're going to spend most of your time talking about Lolita section for on the road. We'll probably be next week unless you're TF wants to bring up some brief questions about it. Um, but that's all for today.
