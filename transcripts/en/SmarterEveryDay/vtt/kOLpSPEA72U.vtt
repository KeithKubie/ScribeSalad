[music]

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.110
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.150
So we just got off this boat and we're gonna walk for about an hour in the jungle

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.180
to find a moth pupa. OK Phil just found it.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.260
So what are we looking at here?
(Phil) This here is the pupa

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.280
of a moth called a Urodid Moth. Now the moth itself

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.310
isn't that special looking but this pupa here, is just

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.320
incredible.
- So that's the chrysalis inside?
- Yep. So that's

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.330
the actual pupa inside and then on the outside is the cocoon.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.380
So most moths will make a really strongly woven silken cocoon

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.390
and try to hide, but this guy has a different strategy.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.420
And instead it just dangles almost a foot down

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.430
from a leaf and then it makes its cocoon there.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.460
And that probably protects it moreso from ants than

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.510
anything else.
- It seems so counterintuitive though to build something like

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.520
that. It's almost like 'hey guys check me out'. Oh crap!

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.570
Look what I was leaning on. Golly!

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.600
- You've got a butterfly on your hat. You know that?
- On my hat? Where?

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.610
Oh yeah.
- It's a satyr.
- A satyr?

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.650
I can only think about these ants right now. Are you using a macro

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.670
lens or just a 100?
- I'm using a 105 macro.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.680
Should be able to see the fine structure..
- Oh that's awesome.
- .. of this cocoon,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.720
is really one of a kind. You can actually find these guys up in North

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.760
America if you're lucky.
- So how does he.. OK so he's

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.780
gonna become a moth right? So how does he get out once he's...

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.800
- It kinda looks, if you look at the bottom there, it almost looks like a little escape shaft.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.840
So it's possible that once it comes out as a moth it'll just shoot right down.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.880
- Do you wanna put your finger under it, so we can see the scale?

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.900
You got your manicure? You ready for this?

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.920
- Been cleaning my nails all day.
- Cool.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.960
[music]

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.980
OK so please make this transition with me.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.010
So, as soon as I got back from the amazon I had to go to a wedding reception. As I'm sitting there making

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.040
small talk with this guy I start explaining this beautiful cocoon I found in the rainforest

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.080
because it made such a huge impact on me. So I explained that if a cocoon is to keep

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.100
predators out, why would I put holes all in my cocoon?

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.120
And the guy said something that shocked me. He goes 'Oh that's interesting. I happen to be a butterfly

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.150
farmer'. I've come here to Mr John's house, and I've brought

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.200
my kids with me, and John owns one of two butterfly farms in Alabama.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.240
He's gonna show us a little bit about cocoons. How do you sell butterflies? How does this work?

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.270
(John) Well that is a fascinating question. That's actually one of my favourite questions to answer.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.300
[laugh]
But this is actually the general way I ship butterflies.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.320
Right in like this. And I'll just pad them and put layers. Most of my butterflies go

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.380
to zoos, botanical gardens around the country.
- So you don't really sell like

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.400
ten at a time, you sell hundreds at a time right?
- Right. I would say my average size order is about

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.440
a hundred butterflies a week. So what we have here, this is a Luna Moth cocoon.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.460
And some people are confused about the difference in a cocoon, here

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.500
and a chrysalis, or a pupa here.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.530
And the difference really isn't that great. Inside the cocoon is actually

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.550
your pupa. So this, the cocoon itself is really

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.560
just the covering that the pupa spins around itself. If you look here

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.580
at the spicebush swallowtail, it does not have a cocoon. So it's just

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.610
the pupa, whereas the luna moth actually spins the cocoon around

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.660
the pupa.
- This is the picture of the thing that we took in the rainforest

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.670
- Yeah that is a beautiful example of a cocoon.
- Why is the

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.690
here I'm seeing these cocoons are solid, but on that thing you know, there's holes in the

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.730
cocoon. Why would it do that?
- Well that's actually a very important defense mechanism. If you look

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.760
at the cocoon on this lunar moth it's very tightly woven.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.790
So if this was hanging on a tree like the one you found down

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.840
in the amazon, if it was hanging like that, as massive amounts of

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.890
rain fell, it would actually fill up with water and actually drown the pupa.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.010
So those large holes actually allow the rain to just fall through

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.060
instead of filling up the pupa.
- Oh so a pupa actually has to have air?
- Correct. Yeah

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.110
People don't think about that a lot but pupa breathe, just like any other living animal. They need air.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.150
So if they're surrounded by water, if that cocoon was to fill up with water it would actually drown the pupa.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.170
- Oh wow. Interesting. Well thank you very much John.
- You're welcome, enjoyed it.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.190
- Last thing. You hear us using the term chrysalis. That comes from the Greek word cresos, which

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.210
means gold. Some butterfly pupa have a gold shimmer to them, so what's why

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.230
they're called a chrysalis. I thought that was pretty interesting. OK my goal here was for you to learn,

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.280
enjoy and maybe see something beautiful you've never seen before. I will now try

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.320
to earn your like or subscription by providing a link in the video description to the high resolution

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.360
photos of the cocoon, because it's pretty awesome. Anyway I'm Destin.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.390
You're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.430
(Destin) Gerson I gotta ask, what are you doing man?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.470
- Steps back and use the binoculars. [laughs]

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.480
- I think Gerson needs some glasses. [laughs]

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.520
How long have you lived out here?
- Well,

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.540
I am from here. I was born here. I actually know this place very well.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.590
I have almost ten years guiding in the area, but I never seen this

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.630
before.
- Never? Are you just not a very good guide?

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.670
[laugh]
- I like the birds more than the butterflies,

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.710
but I always focus in details, new things,

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.750
because I like these things, but I never seen this, honestly.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.770
- Awesome, so you've lived here your whole life and you've never seen this.
- No really.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.790
And if you want to check out John's stuff, I may or may not leave a link, depending on what we decide. [laugh]

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.810
So anyway, have a good one.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.173
