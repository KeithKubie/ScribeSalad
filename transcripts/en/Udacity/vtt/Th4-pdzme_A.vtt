00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, our force is 15 N and that force was downwards.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Our displacement are Î”x with 7 m upwards.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We can multiply these numbers but we have to remember these are in opposite directions.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The work done by gravity is -350 J. The total work is 0.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, anytime you see a zero in physics, you just start to wonder what's going on?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Is it a coincidence? Probably not.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let's think of few examples where work is done

00:00:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and see if we can come up with any where the total work is not 0.
