00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.590
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: --pipeline for writing more
books. So, if you have ideas for other things

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:12.980
you think he should write future books on,
you can pitch him on your ideas. So, his most

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.901
recent book is "iPad Means Business."

00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:22.230
And it's all about how the iPad is being received
and how excited, particularly enterprises

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.310
and educational institutions, are interested
in this new format--the tablet--and what Apple

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.390
is doing around the tablet as well, some of
the software and some of the services that

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.079
they're offering around this.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.260
How this is changing the landscape, what potential
he sees, and also how he's been using it.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.360
A lot of the book is case studies and it's
some personal experiences of his, but case

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.399
studies of other people. So, do dig in and
ask about some of the specific ways that people

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.049
are really using this technology.

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:55.120
He's been sort of an anthropologist out there
learning about it and he can tell you all

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:03.629
about what he's seeing in tablet usage and
where he sees this going. So I think that

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.799
covers it. Is there anything else I should
mention? OK.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.329
&gt;&gt;Julio Ojeda-Zapata: My next book is about
Google+.

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:14.509
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah, his next book sounds
like will be about Google+. And we've been

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.979
tickled by the idea that it might be, there
might be a book out there even further about

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.530
Google Apps as well. So, this is why I say
he's maybe open to pitching if you can get

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.950
him interested in something.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.539
But Google+ is on his mind for sure right
now because it's hot. So, without further

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:34.400
ado, Julio. Take it away. And he'll present
for a little while and then we'll open it

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.609
up to Q&amp;A. I may ask some questions, but I
think we have enough people here that we can

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:40.810
just open it up. Thanks.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.109
&gt;&gt;Julio Ojeda-Zapata: I'm really happy to
be here, because I'm a long time user of Google

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:52.270
services. Big fan of your company. Big fan
of your products. Two notes of apology.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.619
Number one, I lost my glasses. I don't know
where the hell my glasses are. And so, you

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:05.229
guys are all fuzzy blobs, which is great for
my stage fright. So, but I might be squinting

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.410
a little bit. And the other note of apology
is I'm a little intimidated that I'm here

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.780
on the same day as George R.R. Martin, who
is one of my personal heroes.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:21.420
That's a lot of pressure. What I'm gonna do--.
I was talking to Jason about the appropriate

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.400
format. I had prepared a long presentation
and his suggestion was de-emphasize that a

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.780
little bit and just have a conversation. So,
I'm gonna whip through my deck, like super,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.360
super fast. If I'm going too fast, slow me
down.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.610
But you guys are all Googleheads, so you should
be able to keep up. I'm speaking to you today

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.180
as a tech-book author and as a technology
enthusiast. So, I cover technology, but I'm

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.450
also fond of technology, which is what makes
my job so much fun.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.690
I'm a user and lover of most things Google,
going all the way back to the time when Google

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.670
first started allowing people to associate
their domain names with Google Apps. I've

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:14.580
been using Google services for ages. At the
same time, I'm a somewhat frustrated Google

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.580
user.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.220
I have some specific issues, some specific
problems, some specific complaints which I'll

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:28.510
briefly address today in the form of a constructive,
courteous criticism. And I'm gonna keep things

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.200
really simple. I'm just gonna very quickly
touch on three things today. The first one

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.200
the column.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.230
I write a weekly technology column. And my
column, this Sunday, is about Google Apps.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.532
So, I thought I'd give you guys a sneak preview
of that. It's very unorthodox for me to be

00:03:46.532 --> 00:03:52.110
revealing what I'm writing in my Sunday column
well prior to that. I hope I don't get in

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.840
trouble with my boss, but I'm gonna talk about
it a little today and if you go to my Google+

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.070
account, you can see the full text of the
column posted there.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:09.150
The other thing I'm gonna touch on briefly
is my iPad book and how it relates to Chromebooks,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.100
which I'm pretty excited about. And I'll tell
you a little bit about my next book, which

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:23.870
is about Google+. And just a little background
about myself. Google Apps are my life.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.440
I have my personal domain name associated
with Google Apps. I've done that for ages.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:37.461
I love it. Moving my domain name over to Google,
it was a long time ago, it took me a lot of

00:04:37.461 --> 00:04:43.120
courage to take that step. I had my domain
name somewhere else. The Google option was

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.680
very appealing, but sometimes I don't embrace
change as freely as some other people.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.240
So, it was a really big step, right up there
with marriage and having a kid for God's sake.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.590
I'm only partly kidding about that.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.990
[laughter]

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.990
So, Google services are my life. These are
examples of other services that are just huge

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.270
in my life. My Google Voice account is my
primary phone number. If you're calling me,

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.260
you're calling my Google Voice.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:17.210
It's my primary number. Reader is amazing.
It's a treasure trove of information every

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.170
day. I just can't believe it. I've recently
gotten into cooking a little bit to help my

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:29.980
wife out. And being able to search for recipes--huge.
Tasks. I recently discovered Google Tasks

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.780
canvas view, which is this very elaborate
desktop interface that I didn't know was there.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:41.370
It was really amazing and so, I've been using
Tasks heavily since then. And Google+ is currently

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.300
my favorite social network. I'm a big user
of Twitter. I hate Facebook. I love Twitter.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:53.360
I've written a book about Twitter. But Google+
is just really amazing. I really like it a

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.680
lot.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.870
The subject of my column for Sunday--I'm just
gonna whip through this very quickly--is--.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:08.980
I love Google Apps, but I also have some frustrations.
Apps, for a very long time, has been my productivity

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.620
hub. I reached a moment of great frustration
at the Pioneer Press.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.120
The Pioneer Press where I work has Windows
PCs with Microsoft Word loaded on it and they're

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.090
doing the Exchange thing. And if you write
a story at the Pioneer Press, you're doing

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.240
it at the paper. And if you go home you're
screwed because if you think of a change you

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.990
wanted to do in the story, it's back at the
paper.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.880
And it's like, suddenly it dawned on me. This
is madness. It's absolute madness. I should

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:39.180
be able to work everywhere from any computer
any time I want. And so, I did something very

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.120
rebellious. I didn't ask for permission. I
didn't tell anybody anything. I just moved

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.270
all my work stuff to the Google cloud and
I've never looked back.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:57.460
I'm the only one at the paper who's done that.
And it's been great for productivity. And

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.590
so, it's really, as a family man, it's nice
to be able to just go home and pick up where

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:10.699
I left off at the office if I need to do something
at home. But I'm having this very fierce internal

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:13.800
debate about the cloud.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:22.020
I like the desktop paradigm, as well. I mean,
I think sometimes there's a place for the

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:28.551
desktop and I wonder if there should be a
hybrid situation when working in the cloud,

00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:34.330
but I'm also working on the desktop. I realize
that when I say that, is Apps too cloud-centric?

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:41.700
I realize that's sacrilege in this room, but
this is what I've been thinking about. I've

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:50.651
been thinking about cloud/desktop hybrids.
And you guys have tools that are like that.

00:07:50.651 --> 00:07:55.910
There's Google Apps Sync. There's Google Cloud
Connect. Very interesting experiments. As

00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:00.070
I understand it, they're only regarded as
the interim measures, but they've been useful

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.100
for me.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:10.630
And Microsoft's Office 365 is coming on the
scene. It's a Google Apps competitor. It emphasizes

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:17.430
the web as well as the desktop. It has these
working together. Very interesting. It's very

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.610
interesting to me. Apple's iWork is a different
situation.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:28.400
Apple emphasizes the desktop, but with its
latest version of iWork and the latest version

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:34.459
of IOS mobile operating system, it's setting
up a syncing engine so that if you're working

00:08:34.459 --> 00:08:42.079
on a Mac, a Mac laptop or a Mac desktop or
an iPhone or an iPad, it doesn't matter which

00:08:42.079 --> 00:08:46.550
version of, for instance, Pages for word processing,
you're using.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:51.319
You make a change on one device, it's reflected
on all other devices. You can't edit the document

00:08:51.319 --> 00:08:57.420
on the web in the Google way. There's no web
interface, but everything is synced from device

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:03.990
to device. I'm a big Mac user. I'm a big user
of Google services and I'm a big user of Macintosh

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.480
hardware.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.879
And this is very interesting to me. Again,
I'm a long time Google Apps user. I love it,

00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:17.180
but this is the first time I've actually toyed
with the idea of actually using Pages as my

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:22.369
primary. I've never liked Pages, but this
whole iWork’s syncing is very interesting.

00:09:22.369 --> 00:09:29.350
So Apple has my attention there.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:38.189
The Mac OS X now has AutoSaving in versions
which is similar to what I use in Google Apps.

00:09:38.189 --> 00:09:48.879
Seamless editing across desktop and mobile.
And here's the rub. Here's where we get to

00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:55.720
the key problem. If I'm using Google Apps
on a Mac, a Windows PC, a laptop, a desktop

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.459
computer, perfect.

00:09:57.459 --> 00:10:03.769
The hardware fades into the background. I
get my work done. I'm not worrying about my

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:07.800
physical location. I'm not worrying about
which computer I'm on. I'm just focused on

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:14.310
my work. But then, if I try to use Google
Apps on the iPad, everything screeches to

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:15.360
a halt.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:21.510
Earlier today, I had a briefing with a Google
Docs manager and so this slide may be slightly

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:27.509
out of date. He told me that they're working
on that. They're really working to make the

00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:34.360
mobile experience for Google Docs and Google
Apps users better. But my question is, when?

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.480
Now? Tomorrow? When?

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:43.800
'Cause this Apple stuff is calling to me.
So, right now I'm just experiencing too much

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:51.279
friction, too few features on the mobile.
And so, that's my bottom line. You gotta fix

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:57.480
the whole iPad situation, or I'm, unfortunately,
just gonna move on.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:03.620
So, and the other thing I talked to Jason
just a little bit about is today I'm a little

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:10.619
annoyed that the shiny new bells and whistles
that are rolled out to generic Google users

00:11:10.619 --> 00:11:17.279
are often slow to arrive for paying Google
Apps users like myself. And so again, I don't

00:11:17.279 --> 00:11:20.259
think I'm telling you anything you haven't
heard about.

00:11:20.259 --> 00:11:27.970
But Google+ has amplified that frustration
because I had to dust off an old generic Google

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:35.699
account that I never use to start a Google+
account, which has taken off. I mean, the

00:11:35.699 --> 00:11:41.369
amount of energy, the amount of engagement
that I have found on Google+ is amazing.

00:11:41.369 --> 00:11:48.839
I just, in a very short time, I have almost
a thousand followers now. All of these great

00:11:48.839 --> 00:11:53.129
conversations going on. But I'm really stressed
out because all of this is happening on this

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:58.319
Google account that I don't wanna use. My
primary Google account is over here.

00:11:58.319 --> 00:12:03.720
And I'm doing Google+ over here. And how's
that gonna work? Is Google gonna let me port

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:09.269
it over at some point? How easy is that gonna
be? Do I have to export my data, then reimport

00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:14.879
it over here? I know you guys are thinking
about that, but I just thought I'd throw that

00:12:14.879 --> 00:12:19.249
out as a source of frustration.

00:12:19.249 --> 00:12:25.749
And Google+ is just the latest example of
that for me. As a paying Apps user, I want

00:12:25.749 --> 00:12:37.709
the shiny, new stuff. I should mention that
Google Apps is very big in my family. I persuaded

00:12:37.709 --> 00:12:43.980
all my relatives, my son, my wife, my parents,
I told them, "You should all use Google Apps.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.929
You should get your own domain name. Get your
own identity on the internet. Port it over

00:12:48.929 --> 00:12:56.489
to Google Apps account. Get busy with Google
Docs." My son and my parents and I, we all

00:12:56.489 --> 00:13:01.119
collaborate on documents. We're all in different
places. We can all work together.

00:13:01.119 --> 00:13:07.240
And my son was visiting my parents in New
Hampshire the other day and I said, "Hey,

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:13.379
I should do a Hangout. We should do a Hangout,
do a Google+ video thing." And then I screeched

00:13:13.379 --> 00:13:18.970
to a halt. Oh, wait. We're all using Google
Apps. It's just not gonna work. So, source

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:23.759
of great frustration for me.

00:13:23.759 --> 00:13:34.860
So, very quickly, my book is not a how-to
book. It's a business book. It's a work of

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:41.879
business journalism. If you read my book,
you're gonna read a lot of stories about entrepreneurs,

00:13:41.879 --> 00:13:50.509
about large companies, about K12 schools,
universities and why they're using their iPad,

00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:54.009
how they're using the iPad, how that's going.

00:13:54.009 --> 00:13:59.749
It's a series of stories. My book is the only
book of its kind. It's the only book that

00:13:59.749 --> 00:14:05.029
addresses this whole iPad as productivity
in a journalism capacity. I'm a journalist.

00:14:05.029 --> 00:14:10.119
I tell stories. And so, my book is a very
good complement to a lot of other books that

00:14:10.119 --> 00:14:11.369
are out there that are how-to.

00:14:11.369 --> 00:14:20.199
How to do this. How to do that. Those books
are the how and my book is more the why. So,

00:14:20.199 --> 00:14:25.639
I think if you haven't read my book, I think
you'll find it enlightening. The central thesis

00:14:25.639 --> 00:14:35.579
is that the iPad is great for work. And as
a tablet devotee, I'm very interested in Android.

00:14:35.579 --> 00:14:37.209
I'm very interested in Android Taoism.

00:14:37.209 --> 00:14:42.579
I can't wait to get back to my office because
there's a shiny ten-inch galaxy tab waiting

00:14:42.579 --> 00:14:50.070
for me on my desk there with Verizon LT. Ooh,
I'm real excited about that. But I'm also

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:55.970
very frustrated because I'm rooting for Android.
I see how well Android has done on the phone

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:56.970
side.

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:06.819
But I'm wondering, why aren't there more apps,
more tablet-friendly apps for Android devices?

00:15:06.819 --> 00:15:14.970
And maybe you can, when we have a conversation,
can shed some light on that. So, and just

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:20.449
very briefly want to say that I'm very, very,
very excited about Chromebooks.

00:15:20.449 --> 00:15:30.069
The Chromebook technology appeals to me greatly
because I can just crack the lid on one of

00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:35.889
these devices and see all the tools that I'm
familiar with and get right to work. So, I'm

00:15:35.889 --> 00:15:41.040
very excited about Chromebooks. I'm a little
torn, though. Some of the pluses are it has

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.040
a keyboard.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:46.049
I'm hopeless with the iPad's virtual keyboard.
I just can't use that thing to save my soul.

00:15:46.049 --> 00:15:50.089
So, being able to have a physical keyboard
is important. All the web apps, I already

00:15:50.089 --> 00:15:57.769
know. Chromebooks are very affordable. But
Chromebooks may be a little ahead of their

00:15:57.769 --> 00:15:58.769
time.

00:15:58.769 --> 00:16:02.049
I'm a big science fiction reader and I read
about novels that are set in the near future

00:16:02.049 --> 00:16:06.319
where the internet is this ubiquitous mist
that you never even think about, you never

00:16:06.319 --> 00:16:13.101
even worry about it. It's just there. And
I don't think we're quite there yet. And I

00:16:13.101 --> 00:16:17.170
think the Chromebooks lives in that future
where it's assumed that the internet is always

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:18.170
available.

00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:25.160
And we're almost there, but not quite there.
So, one of my big things is what happens if

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.609
you get on a plane with a Chromebook? Everything
screeches to a halt. And I think Google had

00:16:29.609 --> 00:16:32.879
an answer for me on my flight out here. It
was the first flight I was ever on that had

00:16:32.879 --> 00:16:33.879
Wi-Fi.

00:16:33.879 --> 00:16:42.400
So, I paid five bucks and I Wi-Fi and I used
my Chromebook. Yay. So, and just very briefly,

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:50.839
my next book about Google+--. My publisher's
based in Cupertino. They're called Happy About.

00:16:50.839 --> 00:16:56.149
And they have a series of THiNKaha books,
which are quick reads.

00:16:56.149 --> 00:17:03.170
They basically take a concept and they synthesize
it down to little, pithy nuggets of wisdom

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:09.649
and information. And the series tackles every
subject under the sun. It's sort of like For

00:17:09.649 --> 00:17:16.179
Dummies books, but even more abbreviated.
And my publisher talked me into doing a book

00:17:16.179 --> 00:17:18.529
about Google+.

00:17:18.529 --> 00:17:23.770
I'm very excited about that. So, I'm happy
to take your questions.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:32.269
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, let me just lead it
off with a question that's going back into

00:17:32.269 --> 00:17:36.639
the presentation. I think one thing that would
be interesting to hear a little more of is

00:17:36.639 --> 00:17:42.970
some of these particular case studies, uses
of the iPad, or tablets generally, that you

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:44.620
thought were unexpected, really interesting.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:50.029
You mentioned TV anchors. Maybe just two or
three of these things that opened your eyes

00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:54.450
or got you thinking a different direction
with how this new form factor might be used.

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:59.480
&gt;&gt;Julio Ojeda-Zapata: Well, the iPad, I must
confess. I'm a little set in my ways, frankly.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.669
I'm very fond of my desktop computer when
everyone's using laptops. I'm very fond of

00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:05.649
traditional computers when everybody's using
tablets.

00:18:05.649 --> 00:18:10.190
I must confess, even though I'm a tech writer,
sometimes I get set in my ways and the new

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:15.940
stuff initially confuses me a little bit.
And it took me a while to understand that

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:22.950
tablets, they had very little onboard storage.
Tablets are windows. They're windows into

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.049
the cloud.

00:18:25.049 --> 00:18:31.639
A very Google concept. And in my book, it
was very interesting to run into example after

00:18:31.639 --> 00:18:37.310
example after example of companies that figured
out, "Hey, all we have to do is stash your

00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:44.400
stuff in the cloud and just give everybody
tablets--. Architectural consultants that

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.320
are at work sites or whatever.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:54.639
And they punch up their box dot net accounts
and pull up all their information." And companies

00:18:54.639 --> 00:19:02.830
have been thinking along these lines for a
very long time. But they have never had hardware

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:09.000
which lent itself to this. The hardware that
existed before that was very heavy, very awkward,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.519
very hard to use.

00:19:10.519 --> 00:19:17.320
So, the iPad came in and filled a need that
existed there for a long time and a need that

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:22.750
people had already felt and had been asking
for. But it was the right device to solve

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:28.641
that problem. That's the fundamental concept
that I run into with company after company

00:19:28.641 --> 00:19:29.641
after company.

00:19:29.641 --> 00:19:38.600
Like schools, it's the same thing. I was recently
at a middle school where they were about to

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.970
deploy, they were about to give every kid
an iPad. It was a fun day because the students

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:48.340
knew the iPads were coming but the teachers
were playing coy. They didn't tell the kids

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.600
when the damn things were gonna get here.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:54.110
The kids kept asking, "When are iPads coming?"
The teacher says, "I don't know. Just go do

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:59.610
your work." And then the PR people at the
school said, "Hey, you might want to come

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:03.880
to our auditorium. We're having a pep rally
that will have a very interesting ending."

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:11.920
And at the end of the pep rally, the rotund,
the principal with a big belly waddled onto

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:18.870
the floor and he started dancing. And then
all of a sudden, all the teachers came dashing

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:27.120
off the bleachers and they all had t-shirts--
the school is called Heritage Middle School--the

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.309
t-shirts all said "iHeritage."

00:20:29.309 --> 00:20:35.590
And all these teachers with their black t-shirts,
they all started line dancing. And at the

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:41.100
end of ten minutes of line dancing, they unfurled
this big banner that said, "The iPads are

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:50.380
here." And the kids just went berserk. It
was amazing. And I mentioned that--.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:58.470
There's a Google side note to that. I mentioned
that the excitement, the way the kids went

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:04.110
crazy, was really amazing. I mentioned that
because there's sort of a Google counterpoint

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:09.650
to that. I was watching Jimmy Kimmel the other
night and Joshua Topolsky, the very well-known

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:13.740
tech writer, was on there and Joshua Topolsky
did an Oprah thing.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.970
I don't know if any of you guys saw this.
He did sort of an Oprah thing where he announced,

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:25.059
"Everybody in the audience is getting a Chromebook."
And it was the same situation. Everybody went

00:21:25.059 --> 00:21:33.340
absolutely berserk. Somebody said, "It was
the best day of my life, man."

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:40.620
And the reason I mention that is because I
personally liked the idea of Chromebooks,

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:47.600
but I was a little dubious about whether people
were gonna go for them. And I'm pleasantly

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:53.500
surprised to see that they're selling well
and that there does seem to be a degree of

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.029
underlying enthusiasm for them.

00:21:56.029 --> 00:22:01.040
And that makes me happy because I think the
Chromebook is a great counterpoint to the

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:06.470
whole tablet thing. I'd like to see both kinds
of technologies flourish. So, I'm rambling.

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:07.470
Any more questions?

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:09.500
[pause]

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:22.110
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Sort of a follow
up on the last one, but I was also curious

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:25.384
about some of the other applications like,
news anchors and stuff that you mentioned.

00:22:25.384 --> 00:22:31.320
So, if you can go and just tell us how people
are using tablets in business.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:39.700
&gt;&gt;Julio Ojeda-Zapata: Yeah, you might seen
it on a slide I whipped through really quick.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:46.470
I was walking through my newsroom one day
and I walked by the desk of a women. Her job

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:51.649
is to monitor the local TV newscasts.

00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:57.250
And I walked by her desk and one of the--.
Vineeta Sawkar, which is an anchorwoman of

00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:02.860
Indian extraction, she was doing her newscast
and I walked by the TV on the desk. And it

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:09.320
was like, I sort of did a double take and
said, "Is she using an iPad for God's sake?"

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:18.150
And I did a little poking around and as it
turns out KSTP TV, one of the local, it's

00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:26.530
a local ABC affiliate where I work, they had
apparently issued iPads to all their anchors

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:36.639
and created a backend web app that would have
all the latest scripts and would update. Up

00:23:36.639 --> 00:23:43.460
to that point, the anchors would, whenever
they had scripts to use on the set, they would

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:44.460
print them out.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:48.000
And if there were any changes they had to
print them out again. And the TV station went

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.100
through just a massive amount printing money
every year. So, the issued iPads to all the

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:58.929
anchors, gave them this web app, just click
the button to refresh to update all the information.

00:23:58.929 --> 00:24:04.390
And not every anchor at the TV station went
for it. A lot of them were just old school

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:11.200
and they just wouldn't have it. But this woman,
even though she's not very much of a geek

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:17.780
at all, she embraces instantly and she just
loves it. And so, if you watch her on the

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:20.710
news, you can't tell there's an iPad in front
of her.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:28.320
But she's basically using the iPad as kind
of a teleprompter. And there's this other

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:33.700
TV station in Duluth, Minnesota, which is
northeast of the Twin Cities. They're doing

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:41.850
something similar, which is really interesting.
Apparently, you can buy a teleprompter, a

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:46.549
full teleprompter-like apparatus that has
a slot.

00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:54.019
You slide the iPad in and the iPad interacts
with mirrors that are built into the device

00:24:54.019 --> 00:25:00.929
and that becomes a teleprompter that journalists
can sort of use in the field to read off the

00:25:00.929 --> 00:25:09.129
iPad. So, that's a very interesting example
of a specialized way that the iPad is being

00:25:09.129 --> 00:25:11.259
used in a particular niche industry.

00:25:11.259 --> 00:25:18.330
If you watch the Royal Wedding, the ABC anchors
that were sitting in their little booths,

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:23.960
overlooking Buckingham Palace, they were all
using iPads and holding up the latest thing

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:31.820
from Twitter or whatever. So, the tablet and
specifically the iPad is really, really taking

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.149
off in television journalism.

00:25:33.149 --> 00:25:40.990
They're just absolutely--. TV journalists
are just absolutely nuts about it. So.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:51.039
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: What about the construction
site? [ inaudible] where you've seen that

00:25:51.039 --> 00:25:52.039
type of [inaudible]?

00:25:52.039 --> 00:25:57.330
&gt;&gt;Julio Ojeda-Zapata: When we get into like,
really specialized situations like construction

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:03.309
workers, architectural consultants and so
forth, working out in the field at project

00:26:03.309 --> 00:26:04.309
sites.

00:26:04.309 --> 00:26:14.490
Or people in warehouses, like driving their
forklifts around. In those kinds of scenarios,

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:20.559
the iPad has become absolutely ubiquitous.
It's being used everywhere in all those situations.

00:26:20.559 --> 00:26:28.009
And again, it gets back to specialized information
that needs to be at people's fingertips.

00:26:28.009 --> 00:26:34.059
There's this one company that I researched
that has a very large warehouse. And they

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:39.460
have a lot of people driving the forklifts
around, moving things back and forth. And

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:45.320
they need to periodically get instructions
from a back end database. And in the past,

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:51.090
they would have to stop their vehicles, get
out of the vehicles, go up to the wall, poke

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:53.269
a monitor to get their latest instructions.

00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:59.399
And now they just have the iPads built into
their vehicles and they're just massively

00:26:59.399 --> 00:27:07.309
efficient. I researched this one company that
does a lot of shipping out of centralized

00:27:07.309 --> 00:27:14.880
shipping facilities. And the iPad has massively
increased their productivity because essentially

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:21.190
the iPad is feeding them the information that
the workers need on an as needed basis and

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:25.890
telling them what are the most efficient routes
within the facility to get from Point A to

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.600
Point B to Point C, do this, do that, do that.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:35.249
And it just feeds them information at regular
intervals. And they're not doing these wild

00:27:35.249 --> 00:27:41.029
goose chases through the facility anymore.
They're working at maximum efficiency. So,

00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:42.330
those are examples.

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:44.080
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: [inaudible]

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:50.639
&gt;&gt;Julio Ojeda-Zapata: I'm being general because
there are many solutions for this. In some

00:27:50.639 --> 00:27:56.190
cases, native apps are developed. In other
cases, they're working off the web. The general

00:27:56.190 --> 00:28:04.080
idea is the same. So. Higher education is
really big. I talked to a lot of--.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:12.020
There's this one college student who's the--.
He's a good friend of a friend of mine. And

00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:18.129
he was the first college student to take an
iPad around with him to class. He'd take the

00:28:18.129 --> 00:28:25.350
iPad with the keyboard. And he's kind of a
grumpy guy, so he initially was the only person

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:30.100
doing this and everybody would walk up to
him and say, "Is that an iPad? Can you tell

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.279
me about it?"

00:28:31.279 --> 00:28:35.919
And it was like, he just went--. He reached
the point where he just became suicidal 'cause

00:28:35.919 --> 00:28:39.700
he was sick of hearing that question. He's
very relieved now because everybody at his

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.889
college is doing that now. Do you have a question?

00:28:41.889 --> 00:28:45.289
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: I actually used
to live in Minneapolis for the last three

00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:50.999
years. And I still read the Star Tribune,
the Pioneer Press, and NPR news and MinnPost.

00:28:50.999 --> 00:28:57.350
And one thing I noticed was that I never actually,
I never saw tech columns in those sorts of

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:58.350
newspapers.

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:02.669
Maybe I just wasn't looking for them. Do you
find that local news and newspapers like Pioneer

00:29:02.669 --> 00:29:07.879
Press are really pushing for tech because
of all the cutbacks and buyouts that they're

00:29:07.879 --> 00:29:09.730
just letting PC Mag and CNet do all that sort
of work?

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:13.139
&gt;&gt;Julio Ojeda-Zapata: I'm sorry, you didn't
see a lot of tech columns out there?

00:29:13.139 --> 00:29:17.760
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Exactly, yeah.
I didn't even know the Pioneer Press had a

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.129
tech column. And granted, I wasn't specifically
looking for it, but it didn't seem like it

00:29:21.129 --> 00:29:27.460
was promoted. And I just wondered is there
a place for local news to have coverage like

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:32.789
that, or do you find that that's fading away?

00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:36.610
&gt;&gt;Julio Ojeda-Zapata: It started--.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:37.679
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Step up to the VC mic. Right
this way. Check one.

00:29:37.679 --> 00:29:39.960
&gt;&gt;Julio Ojeda-Zapata: It's a case by case
situation. For example, the Pioneer Press

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.490
has me. I write about consumer technology.
That partly involves reviewing products, that

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:51.919
partly involves researching local stories
that have a technology--.

00:29:51.919 --> 00:29:57.039
Just to give you an example, last Sunday I
had an article on the front page of the Sunday

00:29:57.039 --> 00:30:04.270
paper about social media overload. The subject
that triggered that--. The reason I did that

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:08.529
story was because of Google+. Some people
were saying, "Oh, jeez. Now there's another

00:30:08.529 --> 00:30:09.669
social network?"

00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:14.340
And so, I interviewed a lot of people and
asked them, "How are you dealing with all

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:19.399
these networks that are making demands on
your attention?" So, that's what I do at the

00:30:19.399 --> 00:30:25.220
Pioneer Press. The Star Tribune doesn't have
anybody like me. They do have a guy who writes

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.129
a tech help column.

00:30:27.129 --> 00:30:33.970
And that guy writes business stories. And
so, each of the news entities in the Twin

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:39.899
Cities does it a little differently and I
think that is the sort of thing that is reflected

00:30:39.899 --> 00:30:45.720
in other news markets as well. Technology
coverage at mainstream newspapers has faded

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.159
a little bit.

00:30:47.159 --> 00:30:53.230
Not as many papers are doing that. Not as
many papers have dedicated tech sections like

00:30:53.230 --> 00:31:00.020
they used to. But the Pioneer Press still
seems to think that they have a place for

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:03.519
me, so I'm grateful for that.

00:31:03.519 --> 00:31:13.480
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: A lot of the use
cases that you listed for the iPad, especially

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:20.630
the most recent ones, they seem like things
that could be done with any portable computer

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:25.830
or a laptop, maybe even a smartphone, possibly
a Chromebook, but maybe that's too recent.

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:36.500
So, what would you say is the factor that
makes it the iPad specifically that makes

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.500
this all take off?

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:41.549
&gt;&gt;Julio Ojeda-Zapata: The one thing that people
have told me over and over is that the iPad

00:31:41.549 --> 00:31:46.001
very often is like a piece of paper. Like,
if you have something on a piece of paper

00:31:46.001 --> 00:31:51.749
and you wanna show it to somebody, you say,
"Here. Take a look at this."

00:31:51.749 --> 00:31:58.259
And so, the iPad at meetings, salespeople
talking to prospects in hallways or university

00:31:58.259 --> 00:32:04.929
administrators gathering around an office
table or whatever. The iPad, there's a level

00:32:04.929 --> 00:32:09.881
of intimacy to the iPad 'cause you can just
pull up something on your screen and just

00:32:09.881 --> 00:32:11.059
hand it to somebody else.

00:32:11.059 --> 00:32:16.279
It's a little more awkward to do that with
a laptop with the lid and you have to fumble

00:32:16.279 --> 00:32:24.450
and pull something up with your mouse. There's
a neighbor of mine who's in the book. He works

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:30.700
for an engineering company. His company in
Minnesota does a lot of business with companies

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:31.700
in the Orient.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:37.629
And they have a factory that has certain specific
procedures, things that they make. And they

00:32:37.629 --> 00:32:43.720
came up with a series of videos to show to
potential customers. So, they have all these

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:50.519
videos queued up on the iPad and wherever
they are, whenever they're trying to woo a

00:32:50.519 --> 00:32:53.809
new client, they can just pull up the videos
on the iPad.

00:32:53.809 --> 00:33:03.509
And the iPad is just the perfect device for
that. There's something about presenting information

00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:09.200
to people on a laptop that flips a switch
in many people. People say, "Oh, you're gonna

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:13.159
show me a PowerPoint or something on the laptop?"
And they just completely zone out.

00:33:13.159 --> 00:33:21.480
It's a visceral instinctive thing. You're
gonna teach me something on a tablet? They

00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:26.580
completely switch off. That happens a lot.
For some reason, that happens less with the

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:30.600
iPad, but maybe because it's a shiny, new
toy that everybody's fascinated with.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:36.389
But if you want to get a visual point across
to somebody and you're picking the device

00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:43.059
you wanna do that with, the iPad potentially
is a better option because you're gonna have

00:33:43.059 --> 00:33:47.749
a more receptive audience. So, the smartphone
is obviously another option. The smartphone's

00:33:47.749 --> 00:33:49.070
a computer in your pocket.

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:56.019
It's very small. So, I think the iPad hits
that sweet spot. Does that make sense? Any

00:33:56.019 --> 00:33:57.019
other questions?

00:33:57.019 --> 00:34:08.320
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: 
And is there anybody on VC who has a question

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:13.420
as well? We should open it up.

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:18.500
&gt;&gt;Julio Ojeda-Zapata: Can I talk a little
bit about Google+? I just wanna tell you a

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:27.850
little bit about Google+, why I'm excited
about it. There's an iPad connections to that.

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:36.351
I wanna compliment Google on Google+ because
Google+ has done something very interesting

00:34:36.351 --> 00:34:42.710
that I didn't know could be done, which is
to create a kind of social network that's

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:48.610
different from other social networks and fills
a certain specific needs that I didn't even

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:50.770
know I had.

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:58.110
This has all been very interesting for me.
I love Twitter. Twitter, to a large degree,

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:05.510
is my life. I met a lot of friends on Twitter.
I have a lot of very elaborate, very constructive,

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:14.540
very fulfilling interactions with other human
beings in Twitter, but the text limit is a

00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:15.700
constraining factor.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:25.670
It cramps my sail badly. Facebook is a really
creepy place. And I think that is largely

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:34.320
due to the character of the people who founded
Facebook. I'm not gonna go into too much detail,

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:40.200
but there's a level of trust that I lack in
using Facebook because there's a level of

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.300
trust that I lack in the people that run the
place.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:51.600
And it's prison-like. You can get in but it's
very hard to get out. Facebook fills a role

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:55.500
in my life 'cause a lot of my family members
are on there, so I'm on there because a lot

00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:02.930
of people are on there that don't use other
social networks. As a journalist, I have found

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:11.950
Google+ to be liberating because very unexpectedly,
it has become for me an alternate blogging

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:12.950
platform.

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:18.170
I like to blog, but the problem with blogs
is it's hard to build and to sustain an audience.

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:27.000
And I tried a little experiment on this trip.
I decided that on this trip, I would do the

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.650
bulk of the documenting--things that happened
to me, pictures I posted, things I wrote about

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:34.540
the trip--I would do that on Google+.

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:41.480
And I discovered to my very pleasant surprise
that it's a blogging platform. You can write

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:46.520
long posts. You can go back and edit the posts.
There's an edit button for God's sake. Other

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:50.680
social networks, you can write something,
you're done. You can't change it.

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:59.740
There's a mistake, you can't fix it. You can
attach photo albums. And so, I've been pleasantly

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:05.430
surprised by the level of engagement. I'll
write something and I get a lot of feedback.

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:13.630
I get a lot of plus ones. People comment on
it. And so, I just wanna tell you guys, I

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:15.940
think you guys are onto something.

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:23.690
I think this is gonna work. And I'm really
pleasantly surprised about that. But what's

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:30.320
the deal with the app networking on the iPad?
I mean, what is up with that? I just--. It

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:35.420
just blows my mind. And Facebook, by the way,
is about to release, if it hasn't already,

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:37.440
released an iPad app.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:44.080
So, you guys gotta keep up with that. So,
thank you very much for Google+. I'm very,

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.930
very excited about it.

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:57.610
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: OK. Well, I think if nobody
else has questions, I think we're set. So,

00:37:57.610 --> 00:38:01.830
thank you again, Julio. Appreciate it. And
thank you everybody for coming. Thanks to

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:02.830
the folks on VC.

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:02.831
[applause]
