00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go through the answer together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We definitely want to name our procedure t_string,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and now the real trick to this is just writing a good regular expression.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Here I've written a regular expression that starts with a double quote,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
ends with a double quote, and can have anything that's not a double quote--

00:00:17.000 --> 09:59:59.000
remember that super useful carat character--0 or more times.
