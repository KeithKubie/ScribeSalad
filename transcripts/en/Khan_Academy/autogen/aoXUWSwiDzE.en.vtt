00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.510
 Let's solve a few practical tasks, 

00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.500
 related expressions containing 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.190
 a variable. 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.240
 And in these first tasks the goal is to record the following 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.185
 in a more concise form, ignoring the multiplication symbol or 

00:00:11.185 --> 00:00:14.130
 leave the multiplication symbol. 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.900
 Here we have 2 times 11x, i. if we have 11 hyks, then 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.100
 we will have 2 times those 11 chicks we will have 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.970
 with 22 hyks. 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:32.400
 Another way we can imagine this, 2 times at 11h, we can 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.960
 to consider it as equal to 2 times by 11, and all that 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.120
 is multiplied by x, and we will have a tie with the 22nd hyks. 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.065
 We had 11 hyks, we would have twice as many hikes, 

00:00:44.065 --> 00:00:46.500
 so we'll have 22 hiccups. 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.700
 Let's see, we have 1.35, multiplied by y. 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.510
 Now we will make a direct simplification here 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.180
 of the record. 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.630
 We have 1.35, multiplied by y-we will use a different color-1.35, 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.720
 multiplied by y-here is a small point. 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.710
 In the algebra, we can get rid of this little point. 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.760
 If we have a variable after which a number comes, we know that 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.220
 this means 1.35 times this variable. 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.560
 So we can translate this as equal to 1.35u. 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.350
 We have saved him from being overwhelmed by 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.360
 the sign of multiplication. 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.540
 Let's see, here we have 3 times 1/4. 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.000
 And this is actually a direct multiplication with a liver. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.020
 And in Task 3 - this was Task 1, Task 2, 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.190
 task 3- 3 times 1/4, this is exactly equal to 3 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.500
 on 1, multiplied by 1/4. 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.050
 By multiplying the numerators, we get 3. 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.790
 By multiplying the denominators, 1, multiplied by 4, we denote 4. 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.560
 And at number 3, I received 3/4. 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.740
 Finally, we have 1/4, multiplied by z. 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.650
 We can do the same thing we did here, 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.030
 in Task 2. 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.950
 That was exactly equal to 1.35e. 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.130
 Same as 1.35e. 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.180
 And here below we can translate this or as equals 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:15.230
 1 / 4z, or we can treat it as 1 to 4 times 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.260
 on z on 1, which is exactly equal to z times 1, on 4, 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.980
 multiplied by 1, or is exactly equal to z on 4. 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.560
 So all of these are tantamounts here. 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.440
 So what do we have to do down here? 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.610
 Calculate the following expressions, where a is equal 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:47.320
 at 3, b is equal to 2, c is equal to 5, and d is equal 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.860
 to minus 4- or, in fact, we have to say negative 4 is the right one 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.540
 term. 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.160
 Negative 4. 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.110
 And we just replace it. 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.930
 Every time we see one, we'll be minus 3 out there, 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.660
 or a negative three. 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.410
 Every time we see b, we will positively put 2. 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.180
 Every time we see with, we will put 5. 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.750
 And every time we see d, we will have 4. 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.710
 Now I will solve a few of these. 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.540
 We will not solve them all in order to save time. 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.240
 Let us take example task 5. 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.640
 Given is our example 2 times a plus 3 times b. 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.340
 Well, this is exactly equal to 2 times-instead of, 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.340
 we know that this will be equal to negative 3. 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.930
 So, 2, multiplied by minus 3, plus 3 times b-what is b? 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.960
 We have given that b is equal to 2, so we have 3 times 2. 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.510
 And what is that equal? 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.840
 2 times minus 3-let me use a different color-2 times 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.050
 minus 3 gives minus 6, plus 3 times 2. 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.580
 3 times 2 is 6. 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.230
 This is a positive six. 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.180
 And this is equal to 0. 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.390
 Note the action line. 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.360
 We did the multiples, we did the two multiples 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.680
 before we add the two numbers. 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.510
 Multiplication and division are performed before collection 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.030
 and subtraction. 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.160
 Let's solve task 6. 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.850
 I'll write it here. 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.320
 We have 4 times per village. 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.180
 4 times-how much is equal to? 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.260
 We have been given that is equal to 5. 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.080
 Thus, 4 multiply by 5, this is ours, plus d. 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.375
 d is minus 4 or negative 4. 

00:04:33.375 --> 00:04:39.090
 So we have 4 times 5, which is 20 plus the 4th negative 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.000
 the same as minus 4, so this is equal to 16. 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.280
 Task 6. 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.910
 Let's now solve a problem from the toughest down here. 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.690
 This task 10 looks a bit more scary. 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.650
 Task 10 here. 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.395
 So we have a minus 4b in the numerator, I do not know if you see it, 

00:04:59.395 --> 00:05:00.730
 it's kind of small. 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.180
 but is minus 3. 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:09.570
 Thus, we have a minus of 3 or negative three times minus four times b. 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.620
 b is 2. 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.520
 Ie. 4 times 2. 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.240
 Remember this is here, and that's where b is. 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.940
 How do I know it? 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.730
 I'm told here above. 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.780
 So, we have all this on all this 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.670
 is on 3c plus 2d. 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:41.630
 So, 3 times - what was it with? c is 5 plus 2, multiplied by d. 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.910
 How much is d? 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.350
 d e 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.070
 minus 4. 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.550
 And let's count here. 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.440
 We must have a turn to act. 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.310
 Multiplication is done first, before collection 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.560
 and 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.910
 subtraction. 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.900
 This will be equal to minus 3 minus 4, multiplied by 2, 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:09.710
 minus 8, all this on - 3 times 5 is 15, plus 2 times 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.590
 by minus 4 is minus 8 or 15 plus negative 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.750
 eight is 15 minus 8. 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:23.330
 And now, the numerator becomes negative 3 minus 8, which is 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.870
 negative 11. 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:32.850
 And in the denominator we have 15 minus 8, which gives 7. 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:39.510
 So in Task 10 we simplified to minus 11 on 7. 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.920
 There it is visible. 

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.450
 Let's solve two of these tasks here. 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.400
 Okay, we see some progressive indicators. 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.350
 I will choose one of the more difficult tasks. 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:56.640
 Let us solve this here, task 18. 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.850
 We have 2x a square minus 3x per square, plus 5x minus 4. 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.030
 So, well, it was not that difficult. 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.940
 For all our tasks we have work with x. 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.100
 But what we can do here - let's record. 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:12.680
 2x per square minus 3x per square, plus 5x minus 4. 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.400
 And we are told that x is equal to minus 1. 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.720
 What we can do is simplify this expression before 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.700
 to substitute with minus 1. 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.340
 And how much does it give 2 by something minus 3 something? 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:25.460
 How much does it give? 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.750
 Here we have 2x of a square minus 3x per square. 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.780
 And 2 by something minus 3 something, it will give 

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.730
 minus 1 on this thing. 

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.050
 So that there-or minus 1 on this thing- 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:45.450
 this will give a minus 1x per square plus 5x minus 4. 

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.880
 We have been told that x is equal to minus 1. 

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.220
 So here we have minus 1, multiplied by x per square, negative 1 per square, 

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:58.500
 plus 5 times x which is minus 1, minus 4. 

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.120
 How much does it do? 

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.180
 Negative 1 per square gives 1. 

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.510
 Gives only 1. 

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:08.780
 And this whole expression is simplified to minus 1 plus 

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.140
 5 times minus 1-course, 

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.880
 we first perform the multiplication. 

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.690
 So here we have minus 5 or minus 5 minus 4. 

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:22.840
 Thus, minus 1 minus 5 gives minus 6, minus 4, equal 

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.710
 to minus 10. 

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:32.369
 And I'll decide these last two to have a model for everyone 

00:08:32.369 --> 00:08:38.299
 types of tasks in this kind of expressions for variables. 

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:42.380
 The weekly price, with, the produced x distance 

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:47.050
 Controls-the price is with, x is the number of remote controls-this 

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.480
 is given by this formula. 

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.260
 The price is equal to 2000 plus 3 times the number 

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.840
 of remote controls, where the price is in dollars. 

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.880
 Question a, what is the cost of production? 

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.510
 of 1000 remote controls? 

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.330
 Well, the cost of the remote controls is x. 

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.010
 So for part a-I can write it here-the price 

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:15.090
 will be equal to-just use this formula-2000 plus 

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.840
 3 times the number of remote controls. 

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.880
 x is the number of remote controls. 

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.695
 So, 3 times 1000. 

00:09:23.695 --> 00:09:28.430
 And this will be equal to 2000 plus, 3 times 1000 

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:33.810
 is 3000, all this gives $ 5,000. 

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.500
 So, that's part, $ 5000. 

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.530
 Now part b. 

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.870
 What is the cost of producing 2000 remotes? 

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.450
 Well, the price-I use the same formula-is equal 

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:51.330
 of 2000 plus 3 times the number of remote controls. 

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:56.350
 So, we have 3 times in 2000. 

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:02.050
 And this is equal to 2000 plus 3 times in 2000, which is 6000. 

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:06.900
 All this amounts to $ 8,000. 

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.770
 We are now in charge of 22. 

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:13.720
 The volume of a box without a lid is given by the formula, 

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:21.240
 the volume is equal to 4x, multiplied by 10 minus x per square, where x expresses 

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.700
 length in inches, and v - volume in cubic inches. 

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.700
 What is the volume when x is equal to 2? 

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.570
 Thus, part a, x is equal to 2. 

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.790
 We just substitute with 2 everywhere where we see x. 

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.170
 The volume will be equal to 4 times x, x is 

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:47.330
 2, multiplied by 10 minus 2 per square. 

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:53.980
 And this will be equal to: 4 times 2 is 8, multiplied 

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.950
 at, 10 minus 2 is 8, square. 

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:02.550
 So, we have 8 times-this is equal to 8 times- 

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.460
 8 per square is 64. 

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.000
 We can say that this will be 8 at third degree. 

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.380
 And 64, multiplied by 8-4, multiplied by 8 is 32. 

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:21.070
 6, multiplied by 8 is 48, plus 3 gives 51. 

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:27.430
 So we got 512. 

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.500
 So, what is the volume at x equal to 3? 

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:36.310
 I will calculate it here in pink color. b, when equal to 3, then 

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:42.480
 the volume is equal to 4 times 3 - now x is equal to 3 times multiplied by 10 

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.410
 minus 3 per square. 

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:52.230
 4 times 3 is 12, multiplied by 10 minus 3 is 7 per square. 

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:56.390
 This is equal to 12, multiplied by 49. 

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.810
 And to get the right answer, let's multiply that. 

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:05.740
 Thus, 49 times 12-2 times 9 is 18, 2 times 4 

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.335
 is 8, plus 1 gives 9. 

00:12:08.335 --> 00:12:09.240
 We put 0. 

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.180
 1, multiplied by 9 is 9. 

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.630
 1, multiplied by 4 is 4. 

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.912
 And then we add both. 

00:12:15.912 --> 00:12:23.390
 We obtain 8, 9 plus 9 is 18, 

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:26.066
 and then we have 1 plus 4, this makes a total of 588.
