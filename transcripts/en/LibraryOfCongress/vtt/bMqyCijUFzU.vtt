00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C..

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:10.090
&gt;&gt; So next up to the stage we
have a very special author.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.740
Ms. Cokie Roberts is
not the daughter of one

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.120
but two U.S. representatives,
and she spent a lot of time

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.540
as a young person right here
in and around Washington,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.130 position:56%
D.C. She grew up to become a
reporter, a TV producer, and a host.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.430
A news commentator.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.730
An analyst.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.820
And she's the author of books
for both adults and children's.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.580 position:56%
She's won many distinguished awards
for her contributions to journalism,

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.460
and she has been named a living
legend by the Library of Congress

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.600
who is putting on this
very book festival.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.370 position:56%
So you can meet Ms. Roberts and have
a book signed from 2:00 to 3:00 p.m.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.020
in the book signing area
across the hall here.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.510 position:56%
Please give a warm round of applause
to living legend Cokie Roberts.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.290
[ Applause ]

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.090
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Hi guys.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.630
[ Applause ]

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.070
I'm sorry to be up
here away from you.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.410
I wanted to be down there
with you, but they tell me

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.400
that the microphone won't work.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.420
And I don't think I can shout
loud enough so here I am.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.430
But I wanted to talk to you about
why I started writing these books.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.970
Which are wonderfully illustrated
by the fabulous Diane Goode,

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.450
who's an incredible illustrator.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.990
And maybe the kids, you can
answer these questions for me.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.540
So when you're looking at
the pictures in history

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.320
and you see pictures like the
Declaration of Independence

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.180
or the Constitution
or things like that,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.810
is anything missing
in those pictures?

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.230
Yeah, go ahead.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.880
Women. Women.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.180
There are no women.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.230
Do you think actually -- do you
think there were women then?

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.380
[laughter] Really?

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.680
How do you know?

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.900
I mean, there's absolutely
no evidence of it.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.200
So what do you know?

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.500
Who knows?

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.820
How do you know there
were women then?

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.970
Go ahead. Women to have children.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.900
So you think there wouldn't
have -- there you are.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.480
[laughter] So there probably
wouldn't have been men

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.780
without women.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.210
Right? Yeah.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:29.230
Well, I was really upset that
we never had any reason to know

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.240
that there were women
in all of our history.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.680
They were left out of the stories.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.670
And, of course, they
were terribly important.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.970
And so I've written a
bunch of books about them.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.290 position:56%
And the first one of this period
where we started the country I wrote

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.920 position:56%
about people like Martha Washington.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.000
It's a book called
"Founding Mothers."

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.660
Who was Martha Washington?

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.960
Somebody else.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.050
Yeah. Go ahead.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.130
She was George Washington's wife.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.630
Right. Well, she was.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.310
But she was also very important.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.600
Every year of the very long
revolution she went to camp

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.660
with all of the soldiers.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.810 position:56%
And George loved for her to be there
because she would cook for them

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.120
and sew for them and pray with
them and put on dances and things.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.880
And so she was very
important to the cause.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.990
And there were lots of
other women in that period

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.950
who were incredibly meaningful
to the formation of the country.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.170
Can anybody tell me what
Benjamin Franklin did?

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.630
Anybody know?

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.930
Let's see.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.230
Go ahead. No?

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.320
Go ahead. He what?

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.690
He did invent stuff.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.710
Did he do anything else?

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.840
Yeah. Yeah, you.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.640
He what?

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:06.740
[ Pause ]

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.950
The answer was that he supposedly,
according to the young woman,

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.340
discovered, as she
put it, electricity.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.280
[laughter] He did have
the kite experiment

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.610
and found about electricity.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.130
But one of the other
things that he did was --

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.200 position:56%
we always learn in our history books

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.260
that he was the first
postmaster general

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.810
of the United States before
there was a United States.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.150
But the fact is he wasn't here.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.450
He wasn't in this country.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.750
He was in England.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.140
And he was there for
years and years and years.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.980
So his wife ran the post office.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.830
And she was very good about it.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.860 position:56%
And she also ran all the businesses.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.230
And she didn't mind it.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.820
She was very good at it.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.850
But she wanted him to
come home from England.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.310
She missed him.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.020
And she would write to him
and say, come home, come home.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.650
And he would say, no, no, no.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.410
I'm busy here in England.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.030
And then she died.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.590
And so he had to come home.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.740
And he wrote and said my wife in
whose hands I've left the care

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.790
of my affairs has died
so I had to go home.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.550
Poor Ben. So I wrote
about those women

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.570 position:56%
in a book called "Founding Mothers."

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.540
But there was still
so many more women

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.540
who were doing important things

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.110
as our country became a young
country and started to grow.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.740
And so I wanted to talk
about them as well.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:41.680
And some of them were wives or
daughters or sisters of presidents.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.270
Like Martha Jefferson Randolph

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.210
who was the daughter
of Thomas Jefferson.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.800
Thomas Jefferson's wife had
died before he was president.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.610
And she helped him a lot.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.720
He wrote her long letters.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.630
And she also had to run his
house for him at Monticello.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.070
Have any of you been to Monticello?

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.900
Yeah? And he would have
so many people coming

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.810
through that it was
very difficult for her

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.330
because she would never know how
many people were going to be there.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:25.090 position:56%
And at one point, she had something,
like, 53 people spending the night

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.450
that she had to make dinner for.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.850
And find beds for.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.370
And all that.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.010
But when he was the White
House when he was president,

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:39.150
Martha had the first baby
ever born in the White House.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:44.290
And it was a place
that was not expecting

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.430
to have mothers having babies.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.920
And the woman who was
brought in to help take care

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.570
of her said she couldn't
find anything.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.960
She couldn't even find
cloths to help.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.480
She said it was bachelor hall.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.720
But Martha had the
baby there anyway.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.650
And here's another person who
had a baby and then carried

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.430
that baby across the country.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.180
Do we know who she is?

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.170
No, not Pocahontas.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.510
Anybody know?

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:19.910
Yeah. Sacajawea.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.360
And Sacajawea was really
a remarkable person.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.600
After Thomas Jefferson
became president,

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:34.150
he managed to buy a huge part
of the country from the French

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.680
and really doubled the
size of the country.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.090
But he had no idea
what he had bought.

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.840
And so he asked a couple of
guys named Lewis and Clark

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.810
to have an expedition and go
see what it was out there.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:54.540
And so they went to St.
Louis which was kind

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.770
of as far west as anybody went.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:02.080
And they went up the river
and they found an Indian tribe

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:08.660
that had a Frenchman who had
married a young Indian woman.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.320 position:56%
She was probably about 15 years old.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:16.750
And he could translate for them
and she could translate some more

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:21.300
from French to Native
American languages.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:26.160 position:56%
And before she left, though, on this
big trip that was going to go all

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.880
across the country, she
was about to have a baby.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.610
And so she had the baby.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:38.800 position:56%
And as soon as she had the baby, off
they went with crossing the country.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:43.710
And she had the baby on her
back as she crossed the country.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.500
And it turned out that
she was incredibly useful

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.690
to Lewis and Clark.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:52.700
She would find all kinds
of things for them to eat.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.340
She could find the way when
nobody else knew where to go.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.640
At one point, their boats
got swamped in the river

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.870
and she was able to
find the provisions

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.280
and get them back in the boat.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:09.870
And they said she was wonderful and
her husband was completely useless.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.130
He was no good at all.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.570
And then they reach the
Indian reservation --

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:17.870
well, it wasn't a reservation then.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:22.080
The Indian lands which were
her people and she discovered

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.420
that her brother had
become the chief.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:29.160
And so she was able to
work it out with him

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.440
that he would give them horses.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.980
Because they couldn't get
across the Rocky Mountains,

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.180
those great big mountains,
without some horses.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.350
So, they traded horses
for some guns.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:43.300
And she was able to
make that happen.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:47.300
And she got all the way
across the country with them.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:52.290
And then all the way back
with this baby getting bigger.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:57.220
And when they got back,
William Clark said

00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.840
that she said done incredible work

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:07.670
and that she deserved a greater
reward than she had been given.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:08.970
Well, that's true.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.900
Because she had been given zero.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:15.380
Nothing. But he then
did help raise her baby.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.330
So he did try to help her out.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:21.860
So she was a very important
person in this period of time

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.100
when the country was
becoming a new country.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.680
Another person that I had
not known about who turned

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.970
out to be a very influential
person in her part

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.660 position:56%
of the country was Lucy Terry Prince

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.650
who composed the first
African-American poem.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.620
She didn't write it down.

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.240
It was recited.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:47.790
People said it out loud for
years and years and years.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:51.610
Like a hundred years before
anybody wrote it down.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:57.000 position:56%
But everybody remembered her because
she was somebody who could really,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.740
to not just tell a story
but make an argument.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.720
And she went to court.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.020
Yes, she was.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.250
She was a former slave.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:11.750
She was in New England but she was
somebody that everybody respected

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:18.070
and she was able to make the
case for her sons to go to school

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:23.780
and to really be known in
the community so much so that

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.690
when she died the newspapers
wrote about her.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.070
Which was highly, highly unusual.

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.980
For the newspapers to
write about a woman at all.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.250
Much less a woman of color.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:41.750
But when she died, the newspaper
said, in this remarkable woman,

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:46.930 position:56%
there was an assemblage of qualities
rarely to be found among her sex.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:51.710 position:56%
So they were willing to say she was
really important and did good things

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.740
but they were not quite
willing to say

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.400
that that was true of other women.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.850
But they were wrong.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.340
Because there were women
doing all kinds of things.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.620
There were women like
Isabella Graham.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:10.570
Isabella Graham had come the
this country from Scotland.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.690
She had a bunch of little children.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.320
Her husband died.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.710
And she was very poor.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:21.360
But she started a school in New
York, and all have the girls

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.450
of the important people
went to her school.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:29.820
Martha Washington's granddaughter
Nelly Custis went to her school.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:33.470
And she made some money at
her school and then was able

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:38.900
to do the work she really wanted to
do which was to help other people.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.800
And so she worked with
Eliza Hamilton.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.650
Does anybody know who
Eliza Hamilton was?

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:50.420
Yeah? She was Alexander
Hamilton's wife.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.720
You all can probably
sing the songs about her.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.620 position:56%
But they worked to set up an
orphanage which was really something

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:04.310
because women -- married
women were not allowed

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:06.220
to own any property at all.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.970
Their clothes on their bodies,
the jewelry in their ears,

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:12.300
everything belonged
to their husbands.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:16.900
So they couldn't buy the
land to have an orphanage.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.910
They made sure that it
was an unmarried woman

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:22.160
who represented them to do that.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.460
But then they had to go
out and raise the money.

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:32.440
And take care of getting the
legal rights to the orphanage

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.340
which meant going to
the state law makers --

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.870
the people who were making
the laws -- the legislature --

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.370
and getting them to do what
they needed to be done.

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.840
And this was all very public work

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.110
which nobody really
expected women to be doing.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.310
But they did it because
they understood

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:55.560
that even though the country
was a great country --

00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:00.170
and still is a great country --
and it was growing and exciting

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:06.720
and people were moving west and
able to do all kinds of new things,

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.300
that there were some people who
really weren't able to do that.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.600
And who were poor.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.900
And who needed help.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.490
And that was particularly
true of women and children.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:20.770
And so they started all
kinds of organizations

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.050
to help those women and children.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.550
And that's why I always say

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.810
that they're the people
who shaped our nation.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:29.110
Because they're the people

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:34.170
who really made it a better
place for everyone to live.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:38.880
And there were a loft of women
who were in that same situation.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:45.140
This is a woman who we know well
in Maryland Elizabeth Bayley Seton

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:52.520
who was a young, rich
woman in New York.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:57.190
And then her husband lost
his money and then died.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:02.270 position:56%
And she found herself in a
terrible situation S.he was in Italy

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.560
at the time because he had
gone there to try to get well.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.680
And she became a Catholic.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.260
And that was something
that was not very popular

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.510
in the United States at that time.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:18.600
And so she had a hard time getting
people to come to her school

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.130
that she had tried to start
so she could feed her family.

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:28.720 position:56%
But then she was invited to Maryland
where Catholics were better liked.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.360
And she became a religious woman.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.100 position:56%
And she started schools in Maryland.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:42.340
And really started the whole
enterprise of having schools

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.960
for Catholic children
called "parochial schools."

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.240
She started that whole movement.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:53.760
But she also started orphanages and
hospitals all around the country.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.420
Again, going west.

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.460
Going out by herself.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.290
Or with just another
woman to make it

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:05.140
so that the country would
be a better place for all

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:09.300
of its people whether
they were rich or poor.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:13.150
And Rebecca Gratz was a
person who did the same thing.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:18.410
She did it primarily for Jewish
children and in Philadelphia.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:23.390
And she worked, again, to
just make it a better place

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.530
for people who needed some help.

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:32.640
And so these women really did
make this country a different kind

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.940
of place from other countries.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:38.570
Europe did not have
these same traditions

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:42.820
that these women established
in America of saying,

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.850
we want this to be a country
that's good for everybody.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:51.890 position:56%
Now, some of them had been to Europe
like Elizabeth Kortwright Monroe.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:54.870
She was married to
one of our presidents.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.520
Anybody know who that
might have been?

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.740
Huh? If her last name was Monroe?

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:05.620
Yeah. Hand up back there.

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:06.920
James Monroe.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.200
Right. But before he was
president, he was in France --

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.790
representing the United
States in France

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:17.260
and France was having
a lot of troubles.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:23.890
And Lafayette, who had helped us
a whole lot during the revolution,

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.190
had ended up in jail.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.870
And his wife ended up in jail.

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:31.230
And she was afraid she was going
to have her head chopped off

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:35.060
because that happened to a lot of
people in France at that point.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:40.800
And Elizabeth Monroe went
to the prison and said,

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:45.930
we Americans don't want that
to happen to Mrs. Lafayette.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:48.200
And so she saved her life.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.930
And it was very, very brave

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:52.980
because they might have
chopped off her head too.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.280
But they didn't.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:58.090
She was able to come home and be
a first lady of the president.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:03.540
And then you have Louisa
Catherine Adams.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.440
And she was the wife of who?

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.750
Who do you think she
was the wife of?

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:13.170
Go ahead. Which John Adams?

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:16.580
You know? She was the
wife of John Quincy Adams.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:21.150
Does anybody know the name
of the wife of John Adams?

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.130
Yeah. Abigail.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.430
That's right.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.530
And Abigail Adams as
a wonderful character.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.100
And I write a lot about
her in the other book.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.850
But this is here daughter-in-law
Louisa Catherine Adams.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:38.100
And her husband John Quincy
was not a very easy person

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.340
to get to like at all.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:44.490
And he could be very
much a sour puss.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:50.160
So she felt that it was really her
job to get him elected president.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.250
And she would write letters back
to her father-in-law John Adams

00:18:54.250 --> 00:19:00.210
and tell him about how she was
the one who had to do it --

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.370
to get her husband
elected president.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.010
And in the end, she did.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.130
But before he was president,

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:12.140
he was the American's
representative in Russia.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:16.010
And Russia was -- as it is
still, of course, very far away.

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:18.400
But then, of course,
you had to go by boat.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.060
And then by carriage across Europe.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:22.800
It was very difficult.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:27.020 position:56%
And they went with their
2-year-old son Charles Francis Adams

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.640
who then later became
famous himself.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.390
And they discovered
that even little kids

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:38.100
like two-year-olds were expected
to go to fancy parties in Russia.

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.920
And they gave them
champagne to drink.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.220
And so she was amazed at that.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.240
And one of the parties he
had to dress in costume.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.920
So he dressed up like
an American-Indian.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.980
And that's the picture
of him in Europe.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:20:00.480
But she was a very interesting
person who really would have lots

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.610
of parties in Washington so
that she could get people

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:09.710
to know her husband better so
that when he ran for president

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.070
that they would vote for him.

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:16.860
And that's eventually what
happened because he was elected

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.140
by the members of Congress.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.880
And they had gotten to know
him at Louisa's parties.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:24.650
So he became the president.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:28.200
So these were women who
did an awful lot of things.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.130
They were political women.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:33.150
They were women who
started organizations

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:35.040
that still exist today.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:40.200
That orphanage that Isabella
Graham and Eliza Hamilton started

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.500
in New York is still there.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.030
It's the Graham Windham society
still serving the children

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.330
of New York.

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.340
And that's true here
in Washington too.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:55.370
After the British came in 1814 and
burned the city, Dolley Madison,

00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:59.090
who was first lady at the time,
worked with women in Washington

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:02.640
to start an orphanage
here and it still exists.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.750
It's Hillcrest still serving
the children of Washington.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.910
So these women were extraordinary.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:13.330
They not only did all the things
they were expected to do in terms

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:18.740 position:56%
of running a household and raising a
family and taking care of everyone,

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:23.980
but they really made this
country a more compassionate

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:29.980
and more considerate
place for all Americans.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:34.730
And their institutions are not
only were remarkable at the time

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:36.450
but they were long-lasting,

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:39.810
still serving people
in this country today.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:41.950
So that's why I love
writing about them.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:46.240
Because they are not only important

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:50.920
and interesting but
they're inspiring.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.860 position:56%
They tell us stories that we can
try to copy and try to be like them.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:00.110
So I'm thankful that you let me
talk about them with you today.

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.600
And if any of you have questions,

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:02.900
I'd be happy to answer
your questions.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:04.700
So thank you very, very, very much.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:09.220
[ Applause ]

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:10.520
Yes. You have had your hand up.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.320
You're going to have to scream.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:20.510
[ Pause ]

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:24.690
No. Lafayette's head
did not get chopped off.

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:28.800
Lafayette they sent to a
prison in Austria far away.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.720
But then he got out
and he came to America.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:36.260
And there was a huge
celebration for him.

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:41.490 position:56%
In 1824, they lit up the capital
building with all kinds of lights --

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:44.950
and this is, of course,
before electricity so they had

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.600
to do all kinds of fancy things.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.920
And he went around the country and
everybody was thrilled to see him.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:55.040
And so he lived happily ever after.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:02.400
Go ahead. [pause] He got out of
prison because the bad people

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.490 position:56%
in France were no longer in control.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:09.540
Different people had taken over.

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:10.880
&gt;&gt; Why did Lafayette go to prison?

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.180
[laughter]

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.230
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: Well, he went to
prison because people who disagreed

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:18.720
with him had taken over
the government in France.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.260
Other questions?

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:26.810
Yeah. What time period do I think
I'm going to write about next?

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:28.370
That's a very good question.

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:32.320
After this book, I wrote a
book about the Civil War.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.940
Actually, Washington
in the Civil War.

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:40.900 position:56%
Women in Washington and the Civil
War and it's called "Capital Dames."

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.710
I haven't done a children's
version of it but I hope I will.

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:49.070
Because they were also very, very
important and interesting women.

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.260
And for us here in
Washington, it's a lot of fun

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.630
because it's about our home town.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:58.590 position:56%
But I'm writing a book now about the
period where women finally, finally,

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:02.080
finally, finally got the vote.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.450
And we're about to have --

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.170
[applause] we will have in
2020 the hundredth anniversary

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:10.900
of women getting the vote.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.120
So we're going to have a
lot of books about that

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.690
and celebrations about that.

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:17.330
And mine is taking a different tact

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:21.030
but it is going to
be about that period.

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:23.200
Anybody else?

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.500
Other questions?

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.510
Yeah. Go ahead.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:40.400
[ Pause ]

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.570
Question is: What woman in
the book was my favorite?

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.130
You know, I don't have a favorite

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:47.350
because they're very
different from each other.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:50.090
And some of them I would've
loved to have dinner with.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:54.300
Like Dolley Madison would really
be fun to have dinner with.

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.440
And she put on a lot
of good parties.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:02.040
But then there are people who
I admire like Isabella Graham.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:06.460 position:56%
Or a woman I didn't talk about today
but who's in this book who's called

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:12.400
"Judith Sargent Murray" who
wrote very important articles

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:17.710
and books very early in
the late 1700s, early 1800.

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:19.980
And she said then --
she wrote about how men

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.600 position:56%
and women should be equal even then.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:26.410
And she said, you know, anybody
who sees a 2-year-old boy

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:32.080
and a 2-year-old girl doesn't say
that boys are smarter than girls.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.810
So what happens?

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:37.780
What happens is that the girls
don't get the education they need.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.880
And so she was very keen
that girls got educated.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.400
And really after the revolution we
started seeing many more schools

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.060
for girls.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.360
Anybody else?

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:56.690
Yes. You have to come so
that I could hear you.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:59.590
What was my favorite
book when I was a kid?

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:02.300
Well, I loved books constantly.

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.950
I'm going to say one that you
have probably heard too much

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:09.150
about which is "Little Women"
but I did love "Little Women."

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:15.530 position:56%
And, in fact, in the -- in
"Capital Dames," the Civil War book,

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:17.940
Louisa May Alcott who
wrote "Little Women" is

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:21.440
in that book 'cause she came
to Washington briefly to serve

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.140
as a nurse during the war.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.040
But I loved "Black Beauty."

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.910
I loved -- there were a series of
books that I haven't seen lately.

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.100
They were called the
"Five Little Peppers."

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.590
They were the five little Peppers.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:36.320
And five little Peppers and how
they grew and all that so --

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.820
but they I read constantly.

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:43.320
I would climb a tree with a
book so nobody could find me.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.950
Yes.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:48.870
&gt;&gt; Why did you want
to write the book?

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.430
&gt;&gt; Cokie Roberts: I wanted to
write the book because I looked

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:54.330
at pictures from our history

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.360
and I didn't see anybody
who looked like me.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.180
And anybody who looked like you.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:03.870
And so I wanted to make it
so that when you read books

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:09.410
about history you would see
somebody who looked like you.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:11.390
Well, thank you all
so very, very much.

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.240
It's been a real treat
to be with you.

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.240
[applause] I appreciate it.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:20.100
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
