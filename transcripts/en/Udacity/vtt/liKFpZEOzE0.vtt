Hi! Welcome back to Unit 3.

00:00:02.011 --> 00:00:05.440
Today you're going to learn some new techniques for your GPU toolbox.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.000
First, how to analyze the speed and efficiency of GPU algorithms,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.356
and second, 3 new fundamental algorithms: Reduce, scan, and histogram.

00:00:14.356 --> 00:00:17.856
Really excited about this material so let's get started.
