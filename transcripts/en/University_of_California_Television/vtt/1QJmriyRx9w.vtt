00:00:05.648 --> 00:00:08.231
(upbeat music)

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.030
- Welcome to A Conversation with History.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.310
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.940
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.770
Our guest today is Sir Lawrence Freedman

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.770
who is Professor Emeritus of War Studies

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.800
at King's College in London.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.120
He is a prolific writer
of articles and books

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.660
on issues of security

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.200
including nuclear deterrents,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.063
matters of war and peace.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:06.460
He has many publications.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.630
Some of his books include

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.730
Nuclear Deterrents, Strategy: A History,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.580
and his most recent book

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.350
is the Future of War: A History.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.640
Sir Lawrence, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.473
- Good to be here.

00:01:23.473 --> 00:01:24.745
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:28.433
- I was born in the northeast of England,

00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:33.490
a place called Whitley Bay,

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.160
which is close to Newcastle

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.923
and I stayed there until I
went to university at 18.

00:01:38.857 --> 00:01:40.491
I've never really been back.

00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:42.160
- And looking back,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.010
how did your parents shape
your thinking about the world?

00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:50.033
- I mean, my father was,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.203
had a shop,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.210
was not particularly
successful at business,

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.860
but he'd been a commissioned
officer during the war.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.393
He was in the Fleet Air Arm,

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.930
he joined in 38.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.580
He ended up Lieutenant Commander,

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.540
so that was very important to me.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.806
It was important to him.

00:02:14.806 --> 00:02:18.529
So the sort of the shadow
of the second world war

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:20.303
was very important.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.160
Being Jewish was important

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.500
because where I was there
weren't very many Jews.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.500
So it was, I had a sort
of sense of difference,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.260
but as I went into my teens

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.970
became interested in the Holocaust

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.030
and started to find out more about it.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.470
That was important.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.180
But basically it was a not unusual

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.423
sort of lower middle class upbringing.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.073
My parents were close.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.600
I was influenced by my brother,

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.540
because neither of my parents
had been to university,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.760
he was the first to go to university.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.093
But there was nothing
particularly exceptional about it.

00:03:01.093 --> 00:03:05.190
- Was there discussion at the dinner table

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.420
about war and issues of
current events and so on?

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.463
- Certainly a lot about current events,

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.220
particularly Sunday lunch.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.520
My dad was working all
hours the rest of the time.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.780
Sunday lunch was important for us,

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.970
when the family conversations took place.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.520
And yeah, we were,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.183
it was a particularly aware family.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.200
My brother being a bit older than me

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.473
was very influenced by politics.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.840
By the time I went to
university when I was 18,

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.610
I was very political, very determined.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.250
This was the 60s, I was
very determined to be

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.710
very radical and change the world.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.150
- And where did you do your undergraduate

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.180
and graduate work?

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.610
- So I went to Manchester
University in the northwest

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.630
of England,

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.768
did my undergraduate there.

00:04:00.768 --> 00:04:01.601
(coughs)

00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:02.434
Excuse me.

00:04:02.434 --> 00:04:04.127
Then I went to York.

00:04:04.127 --> 00:04:08.660
I did a Masters and actually
taught there for a year.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.460
And I ended up at Oxford to do my

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.333
what they call a D.Phil., a PhD,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.170
and finished it off there.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.580
- And as you did your advanced studies,

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.560
was there one mentor or teacher

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.390
who was really influencing you greatly

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.510
in terms of the direction
your studies took?

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.343
- Yes.

00:04:32.096 --> 00:04:34.771
By the time I got to Oxford,

00:04:34.771 --> 00:04:39.183
I had a, I think, pretty
wide ranging education

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.540
and I had done sciences at high school,

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.653
so I moved into the social sciences.

00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:52.190
I was interested in political
sociology, political theory.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.480
And I moved into an
interest in military things

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.450
almost by accident

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.180
because I was interested
in the role of experts

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.060
and I'd chosen, because I
wasn't scared of the science,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.990
I chose a nuclear scientist.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.190
Then I ended up at
Oxford and Michael Howard

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.943
became my supervisor, and,

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.620
that was, and still is, in fact,

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.040
he's 95 now,

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.770
a very close relationship.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.030
He was my mentor,

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.920
every move I made in the
earlier stages of my career

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.900
I would be consulting him.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.510
But basically he was a role model.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.770
When I found out he was
going to be my supervisor

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.030
I didn't know of him.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.130
I went to buy a book of essays of his,

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.670
Studies of War and Peace.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.963
I started reading them and I
didn't stop until I'd finished.

00:05:47.387 --> 00:05:48.960
And I felt this is what I want to do.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.560
I loved his ability to

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.450
capture great historical movements

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.240
in a matter of sentences

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.020
and his ability to synthesize,

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.563
his readiness to look at
disciplines outside history,

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.050
his policy engagement.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.970
I just thought this was a
very complete sort of figure

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.250
and that shaped me a lot.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.480
- I like to ask my guests
what they see as the skills

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.193
and temperament involved in what they do.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.803
- Well it's an interesting, I mean,

00:06:31.393 --> 00:06:32.860
you also have to be very careful

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.490
talking about your own skills.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.570
I think what I've found,

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.263
given the stuff I'm dealing with,

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.120
which is in some cases very distressing,

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.043
often very controversial.

00:06:47.043 --> 00:06:49.650
People have strong feelings about it,

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.740
say if you're dealing with
the Arab-Israeli Conflict

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.440
or nuclear weapons.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.106
These are things people, quite rightly,

00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:02.280
have very strong feelings about.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.310
So to navigate one's way through this,

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.720
my basic approach has always been

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.130
to stay as close as
possible to the evidence.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.940
And if the evidence tells me

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.270
what I want to think is wrong,

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.493
I have to accept that.

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.900
So I think the first principle is

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.820
get the best evidence you can.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.950
And so I sort of think
of myself as a scavenger

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.760
for information.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.980
You've got to keep on looking.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.140
You've got some point you've got to stop

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.380
because otherwise you'll
never get anything written,

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.010
but I think that's the first principle.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:40.463
The second is the onus's
own need to communicate.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.397
I shouldn't eschew that

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.446
if I want to come up with new words

00:07:49.446 --> 00:07:51.490
or use fancy language

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.070
that I'll keep my audience.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.970
If I really want people to read me,

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:56.781
I've really got to work at that.

00:07:56.781 --> 00:07:59.840
And again, that's something
I got from Michael Howard,

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.533
who's a brilliant stylist.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.453
So I think,

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.033
I'm not in favor of over-egging it.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:15.050
I don't think good
writing has to be flowery.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.890
I think good writing can be
quite terse, short sentences.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:23.890
So I think that side of
things is very important.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.610
Third thing, I think,

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:30.291
is you've got to be prepared to be wrong,

00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:32.890
you've got to be able to take risks,

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.960
try out an argument,

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.960
but I've never been of the
view that I'm infallible.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.603
Looking back,

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.240
both personal and academic,

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.410
whatever detriments I've made

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.063
that I might make differently later on,

00:08:55.774 --> 00:08:56.680
it's quite important to note

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.170
that I've spent a lot of
my time in administration

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:02.330
and management while also
trying to write books

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.270
and I always found that

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.660
if you can lead,

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.190
I think people have to
be prepared to lead,

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.130
but it makes leadership easier

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.700
if people know that if they argue with you

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.040
and talk to you, you might can be changed,

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.320
so I've always tried to
keep an open mind as well.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.300
- What about temperament?

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.150
Patience must be very
important as, for example,

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.570
your beautiful book on strategy.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:35.410
That's really a complex project

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.070
requiring a lot of patience

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.530
and looking at a lot of sources.

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.803
- I didn't think of it that way.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.870
I'm not impatient,

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.280
but I wouldn't consider
myself most patient of people.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.020
I think the thing is once
I'm into a piece of writing,

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:54.423
a piece of research,

00:09:55.966 --> 00:10:00.966
it is almost like going into
a completely different mood,

00:10:02.675 --> 00:10:04.850
become a different sort of person.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.823
My wife refers to it as my writing daze.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.803
So I sort of get into a place where,

00:10:14.241 --> 00:10:16.332
I find it exhilarating.

00:10:16.332 --> 00:10:21.332
I've never written on the basis
of ordering all my material

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.823
and then meticulously working through it.

00:10:25.743 --> 00:10:27.773
I'm always playing with it, changing it,

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:33.210
and finding a new reference, exploring it,

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.980
which of course is much
easier to do these days

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.840
than it was when I started.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.156
So I don't find, I don't
think of it as being patient,

00:10:41.156 --> 00:10:42.793
and indeed,

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:47.020
with most of the books I've written,

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:49.920
I'm incredibly reluctant
to stop fiddling with them

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.240
even when we're into proof stage

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.650
and the publisher's are going crazy

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.970
with the changes I want to make.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:00.970
I sort of see it as a constant
discussion with myself

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.200
to try to find out what's going on,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.120
why this is an interesting topic,

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.050
how the argument can be developed.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:10.290
- And what is the key to creativity?

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.589
Is it a kind of a flexibility

00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:17.700
which you identify when
you're talking about strategy

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:22.700
as a way to be able to
respond to surprises

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.840
in what you're discovering as you research

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.920
and think about what you're researching?

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.570
- Yes, I mean, I've
always been very eclectic.

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.170
I suppose this is something
also about my approach,

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.050
and again, from Michael Howard.

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:36.630
I've always been instinctively
interdisciplinary.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:40.020
I've never, I started off

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:43.840
I suppose identifying as
a political scientist.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.330
Actually I would have said
a political sociologist

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.500
after my undergraduate times,

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:54.430
and then I sort of became
more of a historian

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.400
and known as a historian.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.420
But I always thought of
myself as a bit of a hybrid.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:03.160
And part of the fun is
seeing how other people

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.020
approach topics.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:06.820
So for example when I did
the book on deterrents,

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.350
I read quite a bit of criminology

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.460
because they deal with deterrents

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:14.700
and the comparing how they address,

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.340
criminologists address the issue

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.240
gave me some ideas about how people in

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:25.040
security studies might address the issue

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.090
and doing strategy was even more of that,

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.280
social psychology and economics and so on,

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.020
and it's intellectually
challenging and that's good,

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.250
but I think it also gives you

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:41.600
a chance to see things
through different eyes,

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.970
and this is obviously
different from a lot of people

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.050
in my field because they
worry much more about

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:51.480
the disciplinary boundaries
and advancing the discipline,

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.820
and I'm actually not really interested

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:53.890
in advancing the discipline.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:58.189
I've never seen that as
what I'm trying to do.

00:12:58.189 --> 00:13:02.890
I don't think what I'm doing is science.

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:04.603
I think it's systematic, I hope,

00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:07.913
and rigorous and evidence-based,

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.030
but I don't want to make great claims

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:17.030
for what I'm doing as
developing a discipline

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.030
that others will follow or
build on what I've done.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:23.191
I've always seen it as setting myself

00:13:23.191 --> 00:13:25.570
some perplexing problems

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:28.123
and try to find out the best answers.

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.930
- Your strategy book and your new war book

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:34.920
both have a subtitle of A History.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.920
And history is very important for you.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:44.267
What does working as a historian provide

00:13:45.824 --> 00:13:48.770
in furthering your insight?

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:50.960
This is not true, obviously,

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.720
or at least I think it's not true,

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.670
political science and security
studies in the United States.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.770
- Yeah, I'm very careful to say a history,

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:00.203
it's not the history,

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.140
partly because the history would be

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:06.430
beyond an individual,

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.673
so I would, a history is
to make clear it's my take,

00:14:11.871 --> 00:14:16.871
and reflect my familiarity with
U.K. and American materials

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:22.390
I can move into other countries

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:26.309
but I don't feel as comfortable there.

00:14:26.309 --> 00:14:30.609
Careful not to overstate
the range of what I'm doing.

00:14:30.609 --> 00:14:35.609
I think history is the core
discipline for politics.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.840
Maybe political scientists
don't always follow it,

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.870
but that's their mistake.

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:46.870
The idea that you can take something from

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:52.250
Asia in the 21st century

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.460
and then something from North
America in the 20th century

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.170
and something from Europe
in the 19th century

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:01.730
and code them and do a regression analysis

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:02.800
and believe you're saying

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.530
you've got a generalization
about national politics,

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:06.420
I just don't accept.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:10.573
I think it's a specious sort of science.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.313
And that's actually
not produced very much.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.890
It tells us more than we could work up

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:23.570
by what's often derisively
called intuition.

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:25.543
I think we could work it,

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.077
you can know a lot about
international history

00:15:29.077 --> 00:15:31.120
and have the sense of possibility

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.810
that it doesn't require you to go through

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.450
all that sort of business.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.680
The value of history is
it gives you chronology,

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.760
it reminds you that when
one thing was happening,

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.210
other things were happening

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.640
that may well have impinged on it.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.110
It tells you that what happened before,

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:52.100
how that's shaped,

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.420
and if you're interested in, as I am,

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.270
particularly in the history of ideas,

00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:59.160
these ideas come from places,

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.770
and often what's interesting
is how concepts and ideas

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.380
develop in one setting

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.170
and move into another setting,

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.793
and it's the changes that are interesting.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.010
So this is not to say
you can't do comparisons

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.600
or case studies, and so of course,

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:16.600
all of those things are helpful,

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:21.303
but history always gives
the context and sequence.

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.940
You read a lot of stuff where people

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.352
have just lost any sense of chronology

00:16:29.352 --> 00:16:32.485
and therefore the
comparisons they're making

00:16:32.485 --> 00:16:34.700
are invalid for that reason.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.880
- What does this tell us
about theory and practice

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.630
basically, that, and here I mean,

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:47.630
that the ideas affect what we do with

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.470
unintended consequences, really?

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.840
- Yes and I think that's one reason why

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.620
the theorists or academics

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.830
should be humble in this.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:01.110
We're not accountable except to our peers

00:17:03.929 --> 00:17:06.810
and there's this enormous
pressure these days

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.380
to have impact and to be engaged

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.690
and in my time I've done plenty of that,

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:13.910
so I'm not, by no means

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.870
opposed to engagement with practitioners.

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.840
It is always important to have a good feel

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.700
for the constraint under
which they're operating

00:17:25.825 --> 00:17:30.037
and one of the points I'll
make to younger scholars

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.220
if they're interested
in policy engagement,

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.870
is remember that this is a two-way thing.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.910
The great advantage of
working with practitioners

00:17:40.576 --> 00:17:42.550
is that you learn from them,

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:44.950
not only you pick up what's on their mind,

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:48.160
bits and pieces of important
information and so,

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.360
but you understand the
way the system works.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:56.460
This is infallible people working
in imperfect organizations

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.690
with no time or under an
awful lot of pressure.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.000
And the pressures are
often quite eccentric.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.320
So unless you've got,

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.690
you know, even that seems
to me an important insight

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.460
that can then influence the way you work,

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:12.920
and most of my work, looking back,

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.210
is about policy making,
one way or the other,

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:16.860
it's about how decisions are made

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.590
and how choices are made.

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:23.050
- But you don't write it to
influence policy, really,

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:26.050
you're focused on the wonder

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:28.640
of understanding the context.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.940
- I think it's important,

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.340
I never, I wouldn't write a book

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.580
with the aim of producing
lots of policy recommendations

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:38.857
at the end.

00:18:38.857 --> 00:18:40.750
Apart from anything else,

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:43.430
and I've seen this happen numerous times,

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.450
you know, this sort of
endless academic cycle

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:49.370
of a problem, a call for proposals,

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:50.850
the grants are handed out,

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:53.980
the researchers are recruited,

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:54.813
the work is done,

00:18:54.813 --> 00:18:55.970
by the time it all comes out,

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.720
the policy debaters moved on anyway.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:04.720
So I don't see myself as
driven by policy agenda,

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.700
and I think academics
should feel perfectly free

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:10.554
to write something
because it's interesting

00:19:10.554 --> 00:19:12.130
and it advances scholarship,

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.243
I think that's what we do.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.893
When I've got involved in policy debate,

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:25.793
I find it's often most
useful in providing context,

00:19:28.202 --> 00:19:31.110
why we've got this problem now,

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:32.887
what's the origins of that problem,

00:19:32.887 --> 00:19:35.323
but also conceptually.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.320
People keep on talking about deterrents

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.360
as a concept that was
developed during the Cold War

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.230
particularly, but not solely associated

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:46.570
with nuclear weapons

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:50.020
and is then transferable
to almost any given

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:51.950
security problem.

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:53.700
It's an interesting question to ask

00:19:55.325 --> 00:19:58.560
and unpacking the concept
can give you clues

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.860
as to where it might be
relevant and where not.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:05.010
Those are the useful things
I think academics can do.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.389
What do we do about Korea?

00:20:07.389 --> 00:20:09.989
What's the next step with Iran?

00:20:09.989 --> 00:20:14.240
I have views on these, I can make my case.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.910
I may know quite a bit about the issues.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:22.910
But I wouldn't want to
overstate my views compared with

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.630
somebody who's bang in the middle

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.310
of the actual policy making.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.363
- And in addition to history,

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.360
one senses this comparative
drawing on other fields

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.938
and insights, for example,

00:20:36.938 --> 00:20:39.020
at the end of the book on strategy,

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:43.860
you emphasize that, or you
propose a kind of working notion

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:48.030
of thinking of strategy
as a script, really.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:52.850
- Yeah so that came from social psychology

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.860
and I certainly wasn't the
first in the field to do that.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:59.250
I mean, a number of other
people have picked up on

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.660
this idea before.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.960
So I thought to emphasize my originality,

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.433
I was derivative there,

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:10.520
but I tried to make a bit more of it.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.820
And so part of it was this idea of script

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:17.290
which is sort of the mental
template that you have,

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.320
that you recognize a situation

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.980
and something in your head
tells you it's that situation

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.200
and this is what you might expect next,

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.500
and then you realize
actually there's differences

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:31.580
from your expectations so
you develop improvisations

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:32.880
as you go along.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:35.150
Then what we've found having done that

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:37.210
was to look at how people
also think of scripts

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.713
which is from plays and drama,

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.210
which led to a comparison between

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:48.160
the control the dramatist
has over the plot

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.483
and the strategist who
doesn't have control,

00:21:50.483 --> 00:21:53.490
which becomes a way of making a point,

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:56.410
of stressing what, which was to me

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.443
the most important thing about strategy,

00:21:58.443 --> 00:22:01.920
that it is about adaption and flexibility

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.020
and improvisation, and it's not a plan.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:06.650
It doesn't follow a sequence of steps

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:08.810
to a definite destination.

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:11.320
So I just find it very suggestive

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.473
to draw on these other approaches,

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:20.490
but I turn it into something of my own.

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.673
A long time ago when I was at York,

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:28.040
and in those days there
were these big debates,

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.220
still going on,

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:34.090
about whether there are
paradigms in political theory,

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:37.210
social theory, that you're a Marxist,

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.980
or you're an idealist or
you're a realist or whatever,

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.970
but I thought this was pretty artificial.

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.570
I remember one of my
colleagues at one point sort of

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:48.327
saying, almost in exasperation,

00:22:48.327 --> 00:22:50.787
"Well tell me at what point
does mindless eclecticism

00:22:50.787 --> 00:22:52.999
"become creative synthesis?"

00:22:52.999 --> 00:22:54.446
(laughs)

00:22:54.446 --> 00:22:56.453
And I always thought that
was a great question.

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:01.590
- I get also the sense that you are

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.440
how do I want to say?

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.400
The hidden elephant in the room is that

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.730
you are a student of
human nature actually,

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:15.730
and because as you write
the complexity of humans,

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.320
willfulness, folly, hubris, stupidity,

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.270
intelligence, creativity, solidarity,

00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:30.740
the human dimensions of
war are really striking

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:35.740
as you become unconventional
when you look at

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.113
what actually happens in war.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:43.743
- The interesting thing about
war as a topic for study.

00:23:45.057 --> 00:23:46.207
It's a very grim topic.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:50.803
But it also shows human
nature at its extremes.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.803
So it brings out the worst
and can bring out the best.

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.450
And often in the same person.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:03.180
So that's what makes it
particularly interesting.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.930
It always used to be my argument

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.960
as to why we had a department
of war studies at King's

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.960
was this is a phenomenon
that illuminates so much else

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.923
about humanity.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:24.120
Also I think it's important to maintain

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.674
the sense of what you're talking about

00:24:26.674 --> 00:24:31.490
are human beings in stressful situations.

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:36.490
Again going back to political
science approaches to war,

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.433
it can become rather dehumanized.

00:24:42.448 --> 00:24:45.213
How do you round up
deaths to a round number?

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.243
How do you show whether
you've counted accurately?

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.980
How do you capture the aftermath of war,

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:58.980
which is often full of
famine and economic distress?

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:07.660
So the indirect effects of war

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.940
can be as severe as the direct.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:14.940
So if you're not prepared to
address that and cope with that

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:18.980
then it becomes a very dehumanized topic

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.670
and you can see why
people do it sometimes,

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:23.810
because you can be overwhelmed

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:28.103
by the numbers, which is why,

00:25:29.192 --> 00:25:33.123
a particular story from
the Holocaust can be,

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.410
touch you far more than talking about

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:39.790
the overall statistics
of the numbers killed,

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:44.790
and it's actually one reason
why I think warfare now,

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.060
the sort we've been involved in recently

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:51.740
often involves, at least for
the Americans and the Brits,

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:55.730
individual, personalized
deaths that you can

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:57.890
look at the pictures of the individuals

00:25:58.773 --> 00:26:00.920
and think what's been
lost and what they did

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.783
rather than just, we lost 10,000 today.

00:26:07.724 --> 00:26:10.060
So I think if you lose that,

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:13.090
you don't understand
what's going on properly,

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.770
but also you forget why the topic matters.

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.410
- Ideas are important to you

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:20.263
and ideas have also been important

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:26.190
in understanding how we

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:28.650
explain the structural conditions

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:29.990
that might lead to war,

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:34.953
and so if we look at today, environment,

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:41.980
one concept that's there is the idea

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:44.013
of the rise and fall of great power.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.240
Talk a little about that idea

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.960
and whether it helps us understand

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:54.199
what's going on in the world
with America in decline

00:26:54.199 --> 00:26:56.053
and China rising.

00:26:58.572 --> 00:27:01.197
- It's a really interesting topic because

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:08.260
it's an issue that never quite goes away.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.570
So when I started

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:14.740
really getting interested in this stuff,

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:16.203
which was 72,

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.183
that's when I started my PhD,

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.580
the talk then was of the
decline of the United States,

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.710
Vietnam and then into Watergate and so on

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:28.290
compared with the rise
of the Soviet Union,

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.910
big military build up which was going on.

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:33.633
And then in the late 80s

00:27:33.633 --> 00:27:36.390
it was the US that was overstretched

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:41.390
and Japan and Germany
surging forward economically.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:45.980
And now it's United States in decline

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.943
and China moving forward, so,

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:53.320
and getting the measure of the Chinese

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.980
is an important part of understanding

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.870
what's going on to the US.

00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:59.097
One response to that is to say,

00:27:59.097 --> 00:28:00.497
"Well we've been here before

00:28:00.497 --> 00:28:02.420
"and it didn't quite
turn out as expected."

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:04.340
The United States kept on going

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.750
and these other countries
fell by the wayside,

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:08.960
Soviet Union eventually imploded,

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.910
Japan went into years of stagnation,

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:14.710
so who knows what will happen with China.

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.410
That can be misleading, this
time it may be different.

00:28:18.939 --> 00:28:23.913
And then you get the question
of historical parallels.

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:28.308
So Gray Mallerson produced this book on,

00:28:28.308 --> 00:28:33.308
what was it, 16 cases of transition from

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.890
one great power to another

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:39.720
and normally this leads to war.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.613
I think it's, I mean I don't
agree with the analysis.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.550
I'm not sure these cases tell us

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.850
as much as he thinks they do,

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:51.880
but it's still an
interesting issue to raise.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:56.040
Is there something about
this transitional period?

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:59.930
Kori Schake has just
produced a lovely book about

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:04.930
the transition from the UK
and Germany to US and Germany,

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.223
which was peaceful,

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:09.940
and that allows it to look

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:12.770
at some quite important issues,

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:15.720
not just about the structures
of international politics

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:19.960
and power but values and
similarities between the societies.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.000
So I think that as with
all of these things,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.360
there's an interesting question there,

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.600
there are comparisons to be made,

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.200
but it's only the starting point.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:32.900
What's very dangerous is to
start reasoning by analogy,

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.690
because this happened, then
this time it's also gonna happen

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:41.230
The advantage of making
these comparisons over time

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.110
is to ask what's different,

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:45.504
not why this is bound to be the same.

00:29:45.504 --> 00:29:50.504
- It's rich in insight but not necessarily

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:52.770
a foundation for prediction.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:55.020
- Not a foundation for
prediction, certainly.

00:29:58.714 --> 00:30:01.410
In some cases, people aren't really

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:02.253
even making comparisons.

00:30:02.253 --> 00:30:04.323
Some people talk about
appeasement or Munich or so,

00:30:04.323 --> 00:30:08.040
and it's just a short out
for we don't trust foreigners

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:10.570
and they'll get one
over on us or something,

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:14.610
it's not even serious
comparative research,

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:16.610
and work has been done on

00:30:21.152 --> 00:30:26.152
July 14 or Munich or
Vietnam as being shorthands

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.020
for things you've got to be careful about

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:32.920
rather than the basis for serious

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.463
and for analytical comparisons.

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:40.010
But when you do look at,

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:43.650
you can start to have
a view about causation,

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:48.643
about what can really make
a difference in situations.

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:52.663
To take one example,

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.130
it was clear for whatever reason,

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:57.710
not just the railroads,

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:01.743
other decisions in July,
August 1914 were rushed.

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:06.060
People felt that they had to move quickly.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:11.040
That had enormous influence on ways people

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.980
thought about crisis management afterward.

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:14.990
How do you buy time?

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:17.790
How do you get a chance
to look at your options?

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:21.193
So then you can look at Kennedy in Cuba.

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:24.170
In today's age of social media,

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:29.080
would he have been able not
to say anything in public

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:31.870
for so many days while
he worked out what to do?

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:33.940
Because we know if he had to
make an immediate decision

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.623
it would have probably
been much more military.

00:31:38.997 --> 00:31:42.787
The work, Tom Schelling's,
I did on nuclear strategy

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:48.240
was all about his concern, all about,

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.250
a lot of it was about,

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:53.170
whether the pressure to preempt.

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:55.720
And so you've got a theme there

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.920
that you can follow all the way through

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:02.920
about crisis stability and preemption,

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.710
where you can look at these cases,

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:07.163
and you can learn from them,

00:32:07.163 --> 00:32:10.990
they can be suggestive as
to risks that you might face

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:12.510
in the future.

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:17.510
So although every episode
is special in particular

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.280
and peculiar, often,

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:23.280
it doesn't mean to say
you can't be looking back

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.140
to comparable episodes

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.710
to alert you to possibilities

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:28.270
that you might otherwise miss.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:32.390
- In the first section
of your book on war,

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:37.187
you focus on the German
victory over the French in 1870

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:43.053
and it is a case where the

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:48.280
interpretation of that by the actors

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:52.100
and the people who wrote
about it was wooden

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.500
and not nuanced in the way

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.590
that you were just describing

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:02.590
of how we draw ideas from the patterns,

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.160
by understanding the history.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.360
Talk a little about that,

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.440
because the notion was decisive victory

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.170
meant on the one hand

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.100
that you could still win a war that way

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.250
but on the other hand,

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:18.250
people then used that
as an occasion for fear

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.070
about the lack of preparation

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:22.770
least they attack again.

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:26.280
- Yeah so, the more I looked at Sedan

00:33:27.459 --> 00:33:31.197
the more fascinating it became a sort of,

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:36.025
well we now call it an
inflection point, I suppose,

00:33:36.025 --> 00:33:39.800
not least because it completed
the unification of Germany.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.780
- This is the Battle of Sedan in 1870.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:43.083
- September 1870.

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:47.313
So it was a classic ideal type battle.

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:50.830
Started in the morning,
ended in the evening.

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:52.530
It was clear who'd won at the end.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:56.003
The French army had been badly defeated.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:02.090
And the normal assumption
from going back a long way

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:06.910
was that if you won a battle in that way,

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:09.343
you'd won the war, and politics followed.

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.140
And of course that's
not quite what happened,

00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:16.120
because the French people
didn't accept the result.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.560
Napoleon was out, Napoleon third was out

00:34:20.027 --> 00:34:21.077
and a republic called

00:34:22.211 --> 00:34:24.076
and an irregular conflict began.

00:34:24.076 --> 00:34:28.770
So the interesting question,
one interesting question

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:32.453
was what the German general
staff took from this.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:36.929
And because von Moltke, who was
the architect of the victory

00:34:36.929 --> 00:34:39.850
and who was undoubtedly one
of the great strategists

00:34:41.641 --> 00:34:42.641
of the 19th century,

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:47.580
they were so in awe of his
legacy, so committed to it,

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:51.790
that they didn't want to lose faith

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:54.090
with the idea of the decisive battle.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:57.470
It just became a much more
demanding military challenge

00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:58.340
than it'd been before,

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:01.750
and even von Moltke
himself became skeptical

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:04.270
about the possibilities.

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:05.370
They pushed on.

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:10.370
So they weren't prepared
to abandon this hope.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:15.820
Secondly the arguments about
what happened after the battle

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.300
with the French irregulars

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:22.960
meant that they became very sensitive

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:26.336
to how you made sure that
civilians didn't get involved

00:35:26.336 --> 00:35:27.923
in the future.

00:35:31.172 --> 00:35:35.540
So they took calculated action
in Belgium and elsewhere,

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:36.740
particularly in Belgium,

00:35:37.866 --> 00:35:40.270
at the start of the first world war

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:42.500
to repress the local population

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:46.130
so that they accepted the result.

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:51.130
Third, these tactics adopted by

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:56.440
the Germans against the French people

00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:00.930
after September 1870

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:04.240
were the matter of big
debate between von Moltke

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.550
and Bismarck,

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:08.060
and this debate was really important,

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.172
I mean Bismarck got his way,

00:36:11.172 --> 00:36:15.900
but left a view which is
incredibly strong to this day

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:20.330
that politicians should not be allowed

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:22.243
to interfere in operational matters,

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.830
that the politicians could
decide who you were fighting,

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:28.870
where you were fighting,
why you were fighting,

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:30.740
what should be done with the victories

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:31.660
when they've been achieved,

00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:33.710
but everything that went on in the middle

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:35.663
was a military responsibility,

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:39.683
which I think is untenable position,

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:42.750
but was nonetheless

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:49.050
one that you could see
very strictly adhered to

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:50.250
by the German general staff,

00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:54.310
they couldn't share in December of 1914

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:57.263
the full implications of their plans.

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:01.610
They didn't subject themselves
to civilian interrogation

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:03.780
about what it all might mean,

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.460
and of course the famous
comment after the war

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:09.040
by Clemens, so the war is too important

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:10.340
to be left to the general,

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.430
reflected that strong view

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:16.260
that just letting the
military establishment

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:17.870
determine everything about how the war

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:21.110
was going to be fought could
just lead you into disaster,

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:23.150
which is not to say that
politicians by any means

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:24.060
get these things right,

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:28.773
but it's just that the
military prerogatives could be,

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.130
could lead to danger.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:34.260
And you see that in this book

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:37.143
but I was, just been looking at

00:37:37.143 --> 00:37:40.730
some of the debates of
the late 50s in the US

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:42.150
about nuclear strategy

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:44.920
and read Daniel Ellsberg's latest book

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.560
which is a very powerful description

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.740
of what had happened then.

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:55.440
You find the Anti-Strategic Air Command,

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.080
Curtis LeMay and Thomas Power,

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.100
both using this argument

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.280
that this has nothing to
do with the politicians,

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:04.190
even when you're talking
about nuclear strikes

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:06.240
that are gonna cause hundreds of millions,

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.720
literally hundreds of millions of deaths,

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.380
this is an operational matter,
not for the politicians.

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:14.333
So the strength of that
idea is very powerful.

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.950
- This is an interesting discussion

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:20.120
because what you're demonstrating is

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.700
your role as a historian

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:27.700
is to focus on the
context and implications

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:32.240
in a way, so as a theorist,

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:35.450
you're able to go back and see patterns

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:38.130
that the actors themselves

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:41.500
recognize different patterns

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:46.280
that in the long run turn
out to have consequences

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.759
for other actors which changes
the meaning of their insights

00:38:49.759 --> 00:38:51.940
- Yes, I think that's true.

00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:52.853
I think the,

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.698
if you look at this particular issue of

00:38:58.698 --> 00:39:01.960
operational control, which leads,

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.730
you know, eventually to
the American military

00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:07.960
to describing an operational
level of strategy,

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.963
which is basically an apolitical level,

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.070
where the politicians stay
out, no micromanaging.

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:17.120
- And this is actually the policy of

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:19.650
President Trump in Afghanistan,

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:21.409
turning it over to the people.

00:39:21.409 --> 00:39:22.760
- And you know one of the dangers is

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.900
it allows politicians to
abandon their responsibilities

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.110
because, again, we've seen this in the UK

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.050
with Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:34.200
is, well you know I took military advice

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.440
and you wouldn't want me to
question military advice,

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.430
and I followed it.

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:40.780
Well no, actually you should
question military advice,

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.700
that's part of your job.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.238
You may follow it in the end,

00:39:44.238 --> 00:39:46.073
but you've certainly got to question it.

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:49.363
And you can see this,

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:51.970
again it's not in this particular book

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:54.820
but I did a couple of essays recently

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.850
on the development of
the idea of strategy,

00:39:57.850 --> 00:39:59.540
well how did people actually define it

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.180
during the 19th century?

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:03.623
We had a very narrow military definition.

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:05.510
It was about battle,

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:07.950
tactics was about how you fought,

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:10.580
strategy was about how you got
into the position to fight.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.373
And then policy was something else.

00:40:13.350 --> 00:40:14.740
So we now think about strategy

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:19.740
as the interaction of policy
and military activity.

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:21.683
But this came quite,

00:40:21.683 --> 00:40:25.000
and you can see the sort of stirrings

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.430
in the late 19th century,
early 20th century

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:32.150
as military theorists realized

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:34.610
that it's much harder to make the case

00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:36.910
that they are solely in control,

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:40.100
they should solely be in control
of how forces are deployed

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:42.750
because they depend on the
politicians for the basis,

00:40:44.494 --> 00:40:46.123
the budgets,

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:51.380
and so is it reasonable to
say that we've been let down

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.230
because you haven't given enough money

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:55.980
or you haven't secured
this bit of foreign land

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.500
in order for us to place ourselves

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.770
in preparation for a campaign,

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:03.260
and then say what happens thereafter

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.550
has nothing to do with you?

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:07.083
And so you can see them grappling with it.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:09.218
But in the end,

00:41:09.218 --> 00:41:13.093
the comfort zone is that
politicians should keep out.

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.613
I think that's completely
broken down over the last

00:41:17.613 --> 00:41:18.940
couple of decades

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:21.900
where clearly the wars
that were being fought

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:25.230
were so political in
everything that was being done

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:27.590
that we've moved so far away from the idea

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:29.770
of the decisive battle

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:33.450
to a large number of
smaller scale encounters

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:35.090
which add up to something

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:38.113
that looks a lot different in the end.

00:41:39.539 --> 00:41:42.210
You can argue for the strict separation,

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:47.210
but the ethos is still very much there.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.940
- One of the sections of your book

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:54.883
looks at what fictional
writers were saying about war.

00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:59.574
I sense that you're constantly asking

00:41:59.574 --> 00:42:02.540
where do the ideas come from?

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:03.960
What are the ideas?

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:07.280
What motivates the people with the ideas?

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:11.800
What is their agenda beyond
what they're arguing about?

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.323
- Yeah I think fiction's,

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:19.680
especially on some of
these really big questions

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:22.563
of what war might look
like, very important.

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:25.660
And at different times they're have been

00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:28.653
different fictional approaches to this.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.760
The best example is probably H.G. Wells

00:42:34.346 --> 00:42:36.780
who, incredibly prolific,

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:38.293
had a political agenda.

00:42:39.752 --> 00:42:42.300
He was sort of Fabian socialist.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.780
Great believer in world government.

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:47.170
He thought world government
would only happen when

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:49.764
states abandon nationalism,
and they'd only do that

00:42:49.764 --> 00:42:53.110
when some horrible, great big enormous war

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:58.110
had shown them how dangerous this was.

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:01.010
So there's a book he wrote
called The World Set Free

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.270
which captures this idea,

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:05.475
the world would be set free from war.

00:43:05.475 --> 00:43:07.925
It was published just
before the first world war,

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.860
which introduced the idea of atomic bombs.

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:17.410
Now he was pretty au fait
with the science of the time.

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:22.930
We know what he'd read

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:27.480
and we know who he modeled
key characters upon.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.550
He didn't particularly describe accurately

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:31.770
what the bombers would be like

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:33.730
or how they would be constructed,

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:36.020
but you know, this was at
a time when a lot of people

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:39.000
were saying they could
never be constructed.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.750
But we do know that in the early 1930s

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:46.040
Leo Szilard, who was the Hungarian

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:49.320
who had emigrated in order to escape,

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.210
anti-Semitism was then in London.

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:55.070
He later came to the
states and was the person

00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:57.530
who was very influential
in persuading Einstein

00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:59.732
to write to President Roosevelt

00:43:59.732 --> 00:44:01.760
about an atomic bomb program,

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.470
led to the Manhattan Program.

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:06.180
Well we know that he'd
read, he'd met Wells,

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:08.713
he'd read The World Set
Free quite recently,

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:14.080
and when he was thinking
about the problems

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:17.923
and decided how a chain
reaction was possible,

00:44:18.771 --> 00:44:21.090
it was the atomic bomb.

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:23.473
And so it's called the
atomic bomb because of Wells.

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:31.263
Wells' influence in other areas,

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:35.450
when tanks came along
during the first world war,

00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:37.984
that bore very little
relationship that those,

00:44:37.984 --> 00:44:40.980
the armored vehicles Wells had described

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.450
in a much earlier book,

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:46.180
but those who are worrying
about this question

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.290
still had Wells in mind,

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:50.880
so I think they are influential,

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:55.210
and it's one of the big
issues with his vision

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:57.960
was whether he was correct,

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.613
not in the sense that
we got world government,

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:05.980
but after the demonstration
of the power of atomic bombs,

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.420
we haven't had another nuclear war,

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:09.763
hopefully we never will.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.157
But that's quite a long run

00:45:13.157 --> 00:45:15.183
that we've been through already.

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:20.040
So you know, maybe there
was a kernel of truth

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.140
in what he was saying.

00:45:22.992 --> 00:45:27.190
- A section of your book
looks at future wars,

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:32.107
the introduction of cyber, of robots,

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:36.880
conflict taking place in mega cities

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:41.880
and so this raises the
other important dimension

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:45.947
in addition to ideas and
where they're coming from

00:45:45.947 --> 00:45:49.480
and that is the love
affair with technology,

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:53.520
that technology will change everything

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.850
with regard to the next war.

00:45:56.850 --> 00:46:01.310
But it's really, history
tells us, well no it won't.

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:04.644
- Well it does but not to
the extent that people hope.

00:46:04.644 --> 00:46:06.950
And not necessarily in
ways that they imagine.

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:10.690
So for a country like America

00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:13.210
which would prefer capital intensive

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:15.340
to labor intensive wars, as it were,

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:19.941
technology's an enormous
attraction, it always has been

00:46:19.941 --> 00:46:24.941
as a way of gaining some
sort of strategic advantage,

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.593
reducing dependence on man power,

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:33.543
or people power now,
because it's men and women.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.030
So that's always been a part.

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:44.030
And there's a tendency, which
became very strong in the 50s

00:46:44.130 --> 00:46:48.060
after a succession, if you
just think of the tank,

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:50.143
the aircraft, radar,

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:55.573
submarines, missiles,

00:46:56.490 --> 00:47:00.363
then atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs,

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:04.510
that technology would keep
on throwing up new challenges

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:05.413
and so on.

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:09.393
What happened I think was,

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.940
the new technologies couldn't change

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:17.010
the basic logic of what we came to call

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:18.780
mutual assured destruction.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:23.650
So it didn't make a lot of
difference in that sense.

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:25.480
It raised new questions and challenges

00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:28.150
but it didn't really shift that.

00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:32.100
Then there were the new
technologies associated with

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.620
the digital age,

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:35.160
which seemed to provide an alternative

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.023
to reliance on nuclear weapons.

00:47:38.809 --> 00:47:40.800
And what I think we've seen here,

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.870
there's two points,

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:45.160
these do allow you to do
things you couldn't do before,

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.673
so you can't ignore that,

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.690
but the actual way they're employed

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:54.600
and what they're employed
in combination with

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:56.510
makes a difference.

00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:59.640
For example, in fact, two examples.

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:04.640
One, the great advantage of
precision-guided munitions

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:06.570
was that it would enable you

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:10.680
to avoid civilian targets.

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:14.360
You could attack the center of a city

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:17.540
and you wouldn't hit
a hospital or a school

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:19.494
because you knew where the
hospital and the school was

00:48:19.494 --> 00:48:21.370
and you were sufficiently confident

00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:23.250
in your cruise missile or whatever

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:25.990
that it would work it's
way around the street map

00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:28.798
and hit exactly what
it was supposed to hit.

00:48:28.798 --> 00:48:31.270
And that's true if you want
to fight a war that way.

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:33.660
But if you decide that actually
really what you want to do

00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:35.290
is to hit hospitals and schools,

00:48:35.290 --> 00:48:36.450
it'll do that too.

00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:37.943
It's a choice that you've now got

00:48:37.943 --> 00:48:40.880
that you didn't have before.

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:45.030
And therefore, it doesn't
mandate a particular strategy.

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:46.370
I think we wanted to think

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:48.930
that these weapons mandated a strategy

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:51.150
that allowed you to spare non-competence

00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:53.673
but it turns out, not necessarily, so.

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:59.520
Another example is the ease with which

00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:05.530
a lot of the critical
enabling technologies

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.540
are now disseminated to anybody,

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:11.910
an individual who wants them.

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:15.633
So that, you know, the time
of the Gulf War in 1991,

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:23.680
there were a series of
resources that were space-based,

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:29.020
accurate imagery of where
forces were deployed,

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:30.913
speed of communications,

00:49:35.032 --> 00:49:37.900
positioning, so you knew where you were,

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:39.550
you knew where other people were,

00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:41.463
navigation,

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:44.560
all of these are now on your iPhone.

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:50.120
So things that really made a difference

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.280
to the ability of the American military

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:57.303
to catch the Iraqis completely by surprise

00:49:57.303 --> 00:49:58.427
and completely outfight them

00:49:58.427 --> 00:50:00.123
are now available to me.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:05.243
Now I don't link them
with any firepower myself,

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:07.323
but others do.

00:50:11.209 --> 00:50:12.440
Then of course, later on

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:13.930
you've got the social media side of it

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.900
and all of a sudden all series
of instruments are available

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:18.270
to whoever wants them,

00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:21.381
and again, it doesn't mandate
a particular approach,

00:50:21.381 --> 00:50:24.680
it doesn't make war less destructive.

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:28.220
It doesn't mean that in the end

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:30.780
people will fight with the
weaponry that they can find,

00:50:30.780 --> 00:50:34.520
however crude and basic it is.

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:37.050
But it does create new
choices and new possibilities.

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:40.300
- But it also leads to
the wrong lessons learned

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:42.670
when you go into Iraq a second time

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:45.960
and don't deal with the consequences

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:48.650
of your quick victory.

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:50.520
- Yes but I think

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:54.820
there's obviously a number
of things going on in 2003

00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:58.410
of which one was Rumsfeld's
determination to demonstrate

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:02.950
that in contrast to Colin Powell

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:06.220
who wanted half a million troops

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:10.960
to defeat Iraq in 1991,

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.142
Powell could do it with
a third of the number,

00:51:13.142 --> 00:51:15.590
Rumsfeld could do it with
a third of the number,

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:16.423
and he could.

00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:21.080
But what I meant was
that they had no capacity

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:22.340
to deal with what followed.

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:23.880
It wasn't that Rumsfeld
hadn't thought about it

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.060
he just didn't want to have
anything to do with it.

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:30.650
And not being forced
to answer the question

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:34.383
are you sure you can avoid these issues?

00:51:35.698 --> 00:51:37.310
It was a perfectly good argument

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:41.100
that you don't want to hang around,

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:42.610
you want to get out as soon as possible,

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:44.950
that eventually you'd be seen as occupiers

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:46.390
and be part of the problem,

00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:49.040
to which the answer is
yes, that's what'll happen,

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:52.800
and you won't be able
to avoid that problem

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.060
by becoming occupiers and running away

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:56.190
because you won't be able to get away

00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:57.298
because you won't have anything,

00:51:57.298 --> 00:51:59.163
nobody to hand over power to,

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:01.363
and so it proved.

00:52:06.098 --> 00:52:07.900
This is stuff that I dealt with a lot

00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:10.620
as a member of the UK Iraq Inquiry

00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:14.660
is that the issues are recognized,

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:17.018
they're somebody else's problem,

00:52:17.018 --> 00:52:18.969
and no preparations are made,

00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:21.250
hardly any preparations are made

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:22.893
for what may need to be done.

00:52:24.618 --> 00:52:26.314
It's not a question of,

00:52:26.314 --> 00:52:28.639
I mean there's always gonna
be a degree of improvisation,

00:52:28.639 --> 00:52:29.940
but if you've got no capacity,

00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:32.363
just don't have the numbers of troops,

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:35.933
you don't have the
administrators prepared,

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:38.970
you haven't thought about issues

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:40.700
as simple as curfews,

00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:43.400
then don't be surprised when things

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:45.320
go very badly wrong and a lot of people,

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:48.330
Iraqi and American and
British lose their lives.

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:51.993
- One final question
requiring a brief answer.

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:56.670
What would you like
the different audiences

00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:59.773
to get from your book
On the Future of War?

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:02.640
The public on the one hand,

00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:07.305
the policy makers on the other.

00:53:07.305 --> 00:53:08.660
- The only sort of message which is

00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:11.103
maybe a bit late is be skeptical.

00:53:15.724 --> 00:53:19.100
When people tell you this
is how it's gonna be,

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:23.170
say, "Are you sure?" and ask questions.

00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:27.090
That's the basic message
for policy makers.

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:28.630
Message for academics

00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:35.570
about the limits of quantification

00:53:35.570 --> 00:53:37.450
but also in a way it can be useful,

00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:42.450
it's not a wholly
anti-quant book, not really.

00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:44.650
I think for the public,

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:46.490
what you want out of a book,

00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:48.040
you want people to find it interesting,

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:50.650
to want to keep on turning the pages

00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:54.390
and to discover things about the past

00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:57.470
that they may not have known

00:53:57.470 --> 00:54:00.100
and in the process to
make them skeptical too,

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:03.960
to ensure if you're working in this field

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:07.320
without pushing too hard
or being to pious about it,

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:11.773
you're hoping for a more
informed, more questioning public.

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:14.990
And if it helps a bit
towards that, that's great.

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:17.980
If they just find it
interesting, that's great too.

00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:20.400
- Well Sir Lawrence,

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.430
on that note I want to thank you very much

00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:26.490
for being our guest on
Conversations With History

00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:28.690
and I think I will show your book,

00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:30.720
The Future of War: A History

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.823
which, there's a lot more in it

00:54:34.823 --> 00:54:39.823
than we were able to discuss
in this hour of conversation.

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:42.690
So thank you very much to our audience

00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:46.528
for joining us for this
Conversation with History.
