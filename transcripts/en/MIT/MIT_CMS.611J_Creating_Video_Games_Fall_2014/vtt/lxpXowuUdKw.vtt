00:00:14.471 --> 00:00:18.070
GUEST SPEAKER: That says
choices for your game project.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.552
These are the six choices that
I want to make available to you.

00:00:22.552 --> 00:00:27.550
The next one is perhaps the most
challenging one intellectually.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.135
It's about new
funding mechanisms

00:00:29.135 --> 00:00:31.650
for disaster preparedness.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.180
I will explain this.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.076
We call it forecast-based
financing, or FBF,

00:00:37.076 --> 00:00:42.364
and it's the one that has the
most potential to transform

00:00:42.364 --> 00:00:45.500
the humanitarian world.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.640
All right, moving
to the next one.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.095
The next one is
the most complex.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.660
Do you see the drawing of
the time bomb with the fuse?

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.490
OK.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.380
So allow me to give a
little bit of context.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.700
We did a little bit
of this conversation

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.880
when I showed up
a few weeks ago,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.382
but I imagine you
all forgot by now.

00:01:14.382 --> 00:01:20.230
The humanitarian sector has
two main funding mechanisms.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.241
Imagine a pot of money.

00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:27.330
Even if there's almost no
money there, if the pot exists,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.820
money can go in to then
be taken out to spend.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.770
One of the pots of
money that exists,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.640
one of the funding
mechanisms that exists,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.820
is for disaster response,
meaning hurricane or flood

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:41.930
or volcanic eruption.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.030
Something has already
happened, is happening,

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.300
and is killing people.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.930
People are dying, but
if you did something,

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.840
you could save lives, for
example, get on a boat

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.990
and rescue people who
are stranded on a roof.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.045
Or people are sick,
go give them medicine.

00:02:00.045 --> 00:02:03.230
This is disaster response,
and if you spend money,

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.820
you can do very good things when
the funding mechanism exists.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.986
There's another pot of money
which is for a normal day.

00:02:10.986 --> 00:02:12.220
The Red Cross has vehicles.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.720
The vehicles need maintenance.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.270
They need to change tires.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.580
You need to buy a new computer.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.680
You need to pay rent
and electricity bills.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.690
You need to train staff.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.233
So on a normal day, you
have a budget for, you know,

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:29.060
either maintenance or
development of new projects

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.740
or writing proposals and so on.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.920
And that pot of money exists.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.600
We call it the annual appeal.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.750
Every year we appeal
for help, and people

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.240
or donors or governments
give us some money.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.530
What does not exist is what
the drawing, the cartoon

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.160
depicts, which is when
there's a signal from science

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.470
that a disaster-- that something
bad is likely to happen soon.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.125
We don't have money to fund
action before the disaster,

00:03:02.125 --> 00:03:04.870
after the forecast.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.030
So you can click
to see the text.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.010
The context is that there's
that missing money pot.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.737
We have my for
after a disaster, we

00:03:12.737 --> 00:03:14.840
have money for the
normal day, but we

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.250
don't have money for before the
disaster after the forecast.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.189
The issue is that if you spend
money in that time window

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:24.105
before the disaster and
after the science says

00:03:24.105 --> 00:03:27.880
a disaster is likely, you
can do very good things

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.170
for very cheap and relatively
simply and much more reliably.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.790
It's not only more expensive,
but more difficult,

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.270
to save a life when
the storm waters are

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.930
flashing through a city and
people are about to drown.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.820
The boat is unsafe.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.520
Whereas if you do
it the day before,

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.050
when the water has
come down from the sky,

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.100
but it's still in the
river and not in the city,

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.930
people can take action
by just walking away

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.752
on their own means,
with their valuables,

00:03:57.752 --> 00:04:01.200
and not just depending on
someone to show up with a boat.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.720
So we came up with a
financial mechanism.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.670
We call it
forecast-based financing

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.840
for disaster preparedness,
which is [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.090
in our particular method.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.610
There's a pot of money,
so like a bank account.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.500
You need to have a
threshold of disaster risk

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.190
that needs to be exceeded.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.949
So it can't be
two drops of rain.

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:22.239
It has to be a lot of rain.

00:04:22.239 --> 00:04:23.280
It cannot be some breeze.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.100
It has to be a hurricane
of Category 1 or more.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.735
But once the threshold is
established and reached

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:31.580
by the forecast, then there's
some standard operating

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.270
procedures, some actions
that people have to take,

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.860
spending money to save lives.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.630
And that is something
that if you could come up

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.940
with a game that captures that,
this is the one that if we help

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.280
communicate
forecast-based financing--

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.850
I said to the public, because
it can work for a broad audience

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:53.980
digitally.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.020
Ideally it would reach those
who can contribute either money

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.440
or decisions, muscle power.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.030
The chances of
embrace for this one

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.800
are not as high as
all the previous ones,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.570
but if it were to happen, it
would have the highest impact.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.575
Because right now
there is billions

00:05:10.575 --> 00:05:13.930
of dollars being spent
in the two extremes,

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.480
and if a small
fraction were spent--

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.860
invested in that precious
window of opportunity

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.875
when you see the fuse getting
close, that time of effort

00:05:22.875 --> 00:05:25.523
can really have a
very, very high impact.

00:05:25.523 --> 00:05:27.023
There is a link to
a journal article

00:05:27.023 --> 00:05:31.115
that should be very
clear for MIT students.

00:05:31.115 --> 00:05:33.967
We also have some simpler
readings on general.

00:05:33.967 --> 00:05:35.300
And I have been engaged with it.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.570
And I'm ready to help.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.176
This is, I insist,
the one that is

00:05:39.176 --> 00:05:41.190
intellectually most challenging.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.177
But I think if you
nail it, it will also

00:05:43.177 --> 00:05:45.295
be the most rewarding.

00:05:45.295 --> 00:05:45.795
Questions?

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.140
PROFESSOR: So one thing.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.550
When we first started
designing this class,

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.735
this was actually
the problem that we

00:05:56.735 --> 00:06:00.350
were most interested in, mainly
because the other problems we

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.380
just hadn't heard about since.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.920
The cholera was a recent
proposal that was asked for,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.520
and Ebola, of course,
very recent as well.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.060
So if you really enjoyed
some of the challenges

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.120
from projects two and
three, and you really

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.050
took on the planning
aspects, the trade-offs

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.640
aspects of those
two games, if you're

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.990
looking at kind of trying to
communicate to another person

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.717
how these kind of
probabilities works,

00:06:25.717 --> 00:06:27.300
this is probably a
really good project

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.940
you might be interested in.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.950
And I should say also that
working with a few MIT

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.460
teams, including the
Humanitarian Response Lab,

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.105
including the
Environmental Engineering,

00:06:40.105 --> 00:06:43.922
we have two generations of
three students plus on professor

00:06:43.922 --> 00:06:47.820
go to Uganda to work on
making this happen for real.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.230
We got German money to do
it in Togo and in Uganda.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.850
So it's beginning
to happen, but it's

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.400
hard to explain
because it's dry.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.710
It's like explaining insurance.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.370
People get bored
before they get it.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.065
So maybe a game
can help motivate.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.180
STUDENT 1: Our team is working
on forecast-based financing.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.080
So because we're about
planning for disasters,

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.430
our game is pretty
heavy on chance.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.990
But we want to teach the
players to do is to use planning

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.040
and forecasting
in order to reduce

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.510
the effects of that chance and
sort of gain valuable skills

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.760
in mitigating that.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.110
PROFESSOR: So basically
if you have-- there's one,

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:41.050
two, three, four,
five testers, plus

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.720
let's say each team send out
two people to test other games.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.050
Remember to rotate.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.820
We're going to do this
for about 20 minutes,

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.570
as long as it takes, and
then see where we are and do

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.896
it again to get some
just quick testing

00:07:54.896 --> 00:07:56.270
and make sure that
the five of us

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.765
get to play a good
number of your games

00:07:58.765 --> 00:08:00.930
and give you some
feedback on that.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.220
So remember if you're
using digital--

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.780
if you're not-- If a computer's
not being used for testing,

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.780
close it, or make it look
like it's not being used

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.220
for testing by typing on it.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:13.580
All right.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.791
Let's get started.

00:08:14.791 --> 00:08:18.158
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:08:24.057 --> 00:08:24.640
STUDENT 1: Hi.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.560
We're forecast-based funding.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.640
The general idea
behind our concept

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.612
is that planning
ahead for disasters

00:08:31.612 --> 00:08:33.559
is much better than
trying to react to them.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:36.530
So if you can have operating
procedures or ways of planning

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.049
for them and money
allocated for that,

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:43.830
you can reduce loss of lives
in the event of disasters.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.900
We are actually
between two prototypes

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.300
right now that we're testing
to try and get at the ideas.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.810
The first one is a sort
of higher-level city-based

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:57.700
simulation of cities
at risk of disaster,

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.450
which you then have
to fortify by training

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:03.530
volunteers or preparing for
upcoming disasters in order

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.231
to prevent too much damage
from happening to them.

00:09:06.231 --> 00:09:08.355
One of the problems that
we're seeing with the game

00:09:08.355 --> 00:09:11.520
is that it's kind of abstract
and not as interactive

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.730
for players to
connect with, but they

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.427
are getting a good understanding
of the idea of planning ahead.

00:09:17.427 --> 00:09:19.510
STUDENT 2: And so to try
and address those issues,

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.140
we have a second
prototype right now,

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.770
which is about trying
to actually, like,

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.550
rescue volunteers in
a flooding-- rescue

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.290
people in a flooding city.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.030
And so that hits the other
end of the scale, where

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:35.815
the player is told ahead of time
this disaster was planned for,

00:09:35.815 --> 00:09:38.040
versus this disaster
was not planned for,

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.472
and the appropriate
effects for each.

00:09:41.472 --> 00:09:42.930
And then they have
to rescue people

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.040
under those two
different conditions,

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.100
and then they get
to directly compare

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.230
what the experience
is for, like,

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.319
acting in one circumstance
versus the other.

00:09:54.319 --> 00:09:55.860
STUDENT 1: Over the
next couple days,

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.136
we'll be looking at what we
learned from both of them

00:09:59.136 --> 00:10:01.010
and trying to either
combine them or pull out

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:05.739
the parts that we thought were
really useful to make one game.

00:10:05.739 --> 00:10:07.780
PROFESSOR: I can tell
you've worked hard on this.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.250
This one's a hard one.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:10.230
STUDENT 1: Yeah.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:13.067
PROFESSOR: Did we assign you a
target audience for this one?

00:10:13.067 --> 00:10:15.150
STUDENT 1: I think it was
stated a couple of times

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.460
that we should be looking
at people like policymakers

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:21.460
or donors in the sense of people
who would be allocating funds

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.100
from governments or
nonprofits, things like that,

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.196
basically to make it clear
that this type of planning

00:10:28.196 --> 00:10:32.057
is a good idea.

00:10:32.057 --> 00:10:32.640
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.225
And what-- have you decided
on a technology yet,

00:10:35.225 --> 00:10:37.215
or are you still pondering it?

00:10:37.215 --> 00:10:38.340
STUDENT 1: We're probably--

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.624
STUDENT 2: We're using Phaser.

00:10:39.624 --> 00:10:40.207
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:10:40.207 --> 00:10:43.616
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:45.064 --> 00:10:45.564
All right.

00:10:45.564 --> 00:10:46.538
Thank you.

00:10:46.538 --> 00:10:49.947
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.610
STUDENT 1: Our game
is called Hello Waves.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.270
We don't have the
title screen in yet,

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:04.150
but the idea is still
forecast-based financing.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.710
So it's a little washed out
on there, but if you can see,

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:11.120
there are these five different
sand castles, with workers

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.982
associated with each, and
up here in the corner,

00:11:14.982 --> 00:11:16.940
we have a forecast of
what the water level will

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.792
be like in a couple days.

00:11:18.792 --> 00:11:21.250
This is the water level right
here, and throughout the game

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.710
it'll rise and
fall, and the idea

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:28.340
is not to let your workers get
drowned by the rising water.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.985
The other aspect of
the game, though,

00:11:29.985 --> 00:11:32.750
is that you have a certain
amount of supplies,

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.040
and whenever you move
someone from their castle

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.460
in order to prevent them
from getting drowned,

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.950
they will consume
supplies from that stock,

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.620
and if you don't
have enough supplies

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.660
then they'll take damage.

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.367
So as you can see
right now, everybody's

00:11:47.367 --> 00:11:48.200
in their own castle.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.010
If we click Next Turn, the
water level will change,

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:53.330
and we'll see that the
forecast will update.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.800
We have a range of
values on this forecast,

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.932
a high prediction
and a low prediction,

00:11:58.932 --> 00:12:00.640
and if you mouse over
any of the castles,

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.690
you'll see a red line
appear on the forecast,

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:07.430
just to help you orient what
heights are on the forecast,

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.080
or if you're looking
at the forecast,

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.040
what it is in the real world.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.530
So you can see the water
move over these couple days.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:16.112
Right now the forecast
is pretty low.

00:12:16.112 --> 00:12:17.820
If we see that it's
kind of getting close

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.278
and we're worried about someone,
we can click and drag them

00:12:20.278 --> 00:12:25.190
to another castle, and on the
next turn they'll move over.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:26.810
You can also click
people to toggle

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.809
between building and gathering.

00:12:28.809 --> 00:12:30.350
It's very hard to
see the status text

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:31.558
right now because it's small.

00:12:31.558 --> 00:12:33.940
We threw that in
quickly for right now.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.120
But he is set to
building and these three

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.350
are set to gathering.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.370
So we'll see that the
each turn these three will

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.680
gather one supply each.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.620
This teddy bear
will consume one.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.500
So we'll see
supplies go up by two

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.450
and victory progress
will go up by one.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:51.400
What we have planned
for the rest of the game

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.310
is we've made a lot
of progress in terms

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.620
of the intuitiveness of our
game once you understand it.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.200
But right now, there's a
lot in the game that isn't

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.950
explained from the get go.

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:03.590
And so if I give
that spiel to anyone,

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:07.210
they can play the game fine,
and they do pretty well with it,

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.100
but you just open up
the game you're lost.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.470
So a lot of our work is
going to be on the UI,

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.460
of making things
more self-evident

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.420
and making sure that people
can understand what's going on

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.422
and what their actions
will do without me having

00:13:19.422 --> 00:13:20.825
to stand there and tell them.

00:13:24.919 --> 00:13:25.960
PROFESSOR: Any questions?

00:13:29.356 --> 00:13:29.856
All right.

00:13:29.856 --> 00:13:32.291
So I'm going to ask you again,
Tom, what is your biggest

00:13:32.291 --> 00:13:34.260
risk going forward?

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.460
STUDENT 1: So--

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.110
STUDENT 2: I mean,
I think in terms

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.880
of our technical
implementation, we've

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.090
already got good playtests
of our work done,

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:44.610
and we have all of
our major graphics in,

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:45.610
and things like that.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.830
So I think our major
risk going ahead

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:51.300
is not being able to
explain the game properly,

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.000
and so even if we have
a finished product,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.030
it may still not
be playable if we

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:57.989
don't write good instructions.

00:13:57.989 --> 00:13:59.030
GUEST SPEAKER: All right.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:05.350
So on that front, think
of incremental additional

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.850
features.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.620
So the game begins with a
super-simple, even maybe

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.150
too boring choice, but
then a new choice arrives.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:15.130
So the learning by
playing can be staggered

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:16.790
in a way that is intuitive.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:17.290
Good.

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:21.192
Good luck to you, and we'll
talk more about choices later,

00:14:21.192 --> 00:14:24.815
but-- I should say that this
high versus low prediction

00:14:24.815 --> 00:14:27.275
is something that I wish
scientists did like you're

00:14:27.275 --> 00:14:29.656
doing, because most
people say one value

00:14:29.656 --> 00:14:31.808
and then it's not that
value, it's up here,

00:14:31.808 --> 00:14:33.753
and then everyone doesn't
believe forecasts.

00:14:33.753 --> 00:14:34.253
Good.

00:14:34.253 --> 00:14:34.753
Thank you.

00:14:34.753 --> 00:14:35.720
STUDENT 1: Thank you.

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:39.132
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:39.538 --> 00:14:40.121
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:14:40.121 --> 00:14:40.621
One down.

00:14:45.917 --> 00:14:46.500
STUDENT 1: OK.

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:51.230
So it's a little light on there,
but our game is Hello Waves.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.370
It's a game about
forecast-based financing

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.590
that we're developing
for the Red Cross.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.310
The idea of
forecast-based financing

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:00.120
is using the idea of forecasts
about the future in order

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.010
to make decisions that are more
effective than just reacting

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:06.940
to disasters when they happen.

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:12.700
So I'd like to show you a
playthrough of our game.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.590
So, as I said, Hello Waves.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:18.060
Here are the instructions.

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:20.560
We would have done a tutorial
if we had enough time,

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.190
but this gets the idea across.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:26.950
And designing a good tutorial
that actually teaches

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:30.840
the player well is kind of
hard to do in a logical flow,

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.790
so we have these instructions
that explain how to play,

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:37.300
what the point of the game
is, and a couple of tips

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.280
about how the game works.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.290
So if we go into
the Play screen,

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.380
you can see something
similar to what we showed you

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.870
a couple weeks ago, where you
have all these different toys

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:52.860
at their castles, and as
you go through the days

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.070
you'll see a forecast of
what the water level is

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:57.140
going to be at over time.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.830
And so you can see that right
now they're gathering candy.

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:01.720
The water level will change.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.470
This character is underwater,
and so he takes damage.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.260
And so what you
actually want to do

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.380
is you want to move
toys out of the water

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.050
so they don't get damaged.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.580
However, they can only move
one castle over at a time.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.775
So because we didn't
think ahead well enough,

00:16:15.775 --> 00:16:17.400
we'll see that this
truck will actually

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.259
take damage on the next turn,
because he's underwater.

00:16:21.259 --> 00:16:22.800
Actually, he ended
up not underwater.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.120
We got lucky there.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.470
But theoretically he would have.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.020
And so as you go through
it, the end goal of the game

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.250
is to build a castle.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:34.850
And so every toy
when they're home

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:36.640
can either choose
between gathering candy

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:40.150
to feed evacuated toys
or building the castle

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:42.040
to reach your end
goal of the game.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.716
And then the idea
of the forecast

00:16:43.716 --> 00:16:45.730
is that you want to use
the forecast in order

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.730
to know how much candy
you're going to need over

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:51.180
the next couple days, and to
use it to know when you're going

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:54.740
to need to evacuate various toys
from their variously-heighted

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:55.240
homes.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.065
So back to the presentation.

00:17:01.065 --> 00:17:04.079
Full screen.

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:07.550
So we had a couple of challenges
in the design process.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.170
The first-- and the
major one-- is really

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.990
that we were trying to teach
about forecast-based financing,

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.869
which was a bit of
an abstract topic.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:19.520
It's a little different than
just thinking long term,

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.220
because you have to use the idea
of there's some information we

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.636
know about the
future that we want

00:17:23.636 --> 00:17:25.200
to use to make
optimal decisions,

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.070
or at least decisions based on
some idea of the risk that's

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:30.490
out there.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.504
But we also wanted
to avoid things

00:17:32.504 --> 00:17:33.920
like just pushing
a button to win,

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.460
where you have all
the information

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.260
you ever need, and
there's just one option

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.360
that you know you're
going to pick every time,

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.879
and the game has no
thought whatsoever.

00:17:41.879 --> 00:17:43.420
And we also needed
to think about how

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.770
we were going to communicate
the forecast to the player

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:49.980
so that they could then
use that to make decisions.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:53.010
One of the problems that we
also ran into related to this

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.670
was that we focused
a lot on the idea

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.250
of forecast-based
financing as the topic

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:00.350
and then tried to build a game
built on top of that topic

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.210
instead of building a game that
used forecast-based financing.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:05.590
So that held us back
a lot in the beginning

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:07.950
when we were trying
to come up with ideas.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.220
We also had a really difficult
initial target audience

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:16.430
of policymakers, 50, 60-year-old
government officials or people

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.770
at NGOs who were going
to be using forecasts

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.390
to make decisions
of some sort, and it

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.848
was supposed to teach them
about how they can use forecasts

00:18:22.848 --> 00:18:24.237
to make these decisions.

00:18:24.237 --> 00:18:26.070
Except this was a really
difficult audience,

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.040
because they don't
generally play games

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.404
and they don't
have a lot of time

00:18:30.404 --> 00:18:31.820
to learn about
this kind of thing,

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.940
and so we couldn't
really expect to get

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.690
them to sit down for
a long period of time

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.650
and play around with our game.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.342
In order to deal
with these problems,

00:18:40.342 --> 00:18:41.800
we came up with a
couple solutions.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.580
The first thing was that we
had no idea what kind of game

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:47.160
would work or would make
sense or anything like that.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.990
So what we did is we
just broke our team up

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.390
into multiple groups
and came up with a bunch

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.160
of different prototypes.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.990
On paper we had two
different prototypes,

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.040
one that focused on
the idea of managing

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.010
a city and its resources
and its response

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:02.640
to disasters, versus
focusing on individual people

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.640
and how you're going to
move them around to keep

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.340
them safe from the disasters.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.300
And then we went
into a whole bunch

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.820
of different digital
prototypes, one

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:12.540
that was a text-based game
about managing a city.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:17.010
We had one that looked
like this, where

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.550
you had two different
cities and you

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:20.590
were specifying what
workers were going to do

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:23.880
or when they would leave the
city in order to stay safe.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.630
And then we would take
the different ideas

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:27.260
that we were learning from
both of these prototypes,

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.270
combine them together,
take things out,

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:35.150
and our final prototype actually
uses ideas from all of these.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.150
Another solution that we
kind of got lucky with

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:41.029
is when Pablo came
to play our game,

00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:42.570
he told us that we
actually shouldn't

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:44.819
focus on the policymakers,
because he wasn't confident

00:19:44.819 --> 00:19:47.720
that he could actually
get them to play the game.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.430
And so we switched our target
to being grade schoolers, which

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:53.250
is why you saw the
sort of cutesy art

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:55.310
with the beach and the toys.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:57.700
This actually made it
a lot easier for us,

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.039
because we could target
people who probably

00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:01.830
had some experience
with games, or at least

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:05.790
wanted to do something fun
and would be curious to learn

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.475
about our topic.

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:15.380
STUDENT 2: So another for
our development process--

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.990
Or I can just speak here, right?

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.656
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:20:17.656 --> 00:20:19.568
Just speak right there.

00:20:19.568 --> 00:20:22.490
STUDENT 2: So
another big issue--

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:24.520
another set of challenges
that we ran into

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.780
was through our
development process.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:31.145
And so we had initially
issues with communication

00:20:31.145 --> 00:20:32.390
and facilitation.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:36.780
Our team had a wide variety of
experiences and backgrounds.

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:40.600
Some were hardcore gamers,
some mostly mobile gamers.

00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:42.430
And so there were
initially a lot

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:46.975
of disagreements on what level
of game we wanted to create

00:20:46.975 --> 00:20:50.540
and what sort of game, casual
versus hardcore, that we wanted

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:54.000
to create, and so we needed
to overcome challenges

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.010
of facilitation and
communication within our team.

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.810
Another major challenge
in our development process

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:04.240
that we had to face came
from our design issues,

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.820
where for a very
long time we had

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.660
a vague vision of what to do.

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:12.140
We didn't know what kind
of game we wanted to make,

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:15.440
and so we purposely tried
to keep our game ideas vague

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.490
as we built prototypes.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:21.110
But then we ran
into issues where

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:24.210
we would have solutions but,
like, no consensus on which

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:29.612
solution was best, and where we
went for long periods of time

00:21:29.612 --> 00:21:31.320
without having a clear
direction of where

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.110
we wanted our final game to be.

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:40.295
So our solutions
for the challenges

00:21:40.295 --> 00:21:44.420
posed by the development
were a team structure.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:48.640
And so we structured
our team loosely

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.950
into three subteams, a
production subteam which

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:56.500
would take care of production,
like the deliverables

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:59.640
and making sure
that all the game

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.950
ideas are being
communicated properly,

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:07.540
a technical team which worked
primarily with the code

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.250
and making sure
the game got done,

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.060
and then a user
experience team which

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:14.800
handled art, UI, and sound.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:20.320
And so we kept the
responsibilities flexible.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:24.710
So as team members got
busy over the semester

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:29.170
or as changing conditions led to
different people contributing,

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:33.910
we kept-- responsibilities
were able to easily flow

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:37.610
between teams and team members.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:40.780
Additionally, another idea we
started with in the beginning

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:44.700
was the idea of subteam
leaders, which were the two

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:46.020
people marked with the Ls.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.360
But that was an idea
we later abandoned

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.480
in favor of just having a
more flexible team structure

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:54.760
or flat team structure.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:59.330
Another solution for helping our
development process was the use

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:03.360
of good code practices, and I
cannot emphasize enough that

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.780
this really helped speed
up our development,

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.110
because we didn't run
into trouble with code.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.780
It was mostly with design.

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:18.020
So we used Yeoman, which is
a JavaScript module system,

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.610
and basically it allowed our
code to be interoperable.

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:25.200
We could write one module
separately from another module.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:31.380
So that solved a lot of issues
with dependencies or people

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.690
working in parallel,
because it allowed people

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:38.230
to work in parallel without
overwriting each other's code.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:42.690
We also used good code practice
with state machines and MVC,

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:45.080
which is model-view-control,
and so we

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.720
had a very object-oriented
code, very modular.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.980
And when we did need to change
our code, rip it all out

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.980
and put it back in, it
actually didn't turn out

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.580
to be too painful, because we
just had to switch a couple

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:58.320
objects around.

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:08.130
And then one final solution
that we used for our development

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:11.320
processes were Slack and Scrum.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:15.460
So Slack is like a
modernized IRC chat room,

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.670
and it's very feature rich.

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:20.320
It has a lot of integrations
with GitHub and Google Drive

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.530
and things like that.

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:25.260
And so that sort of
real time communication

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:27.180
actually made it so
that we didn't really

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.979
have to meet outside
of class too often.

00:24:29.979 --> 00:24:31.520
If someone was
working, we would just

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.770
email out saying
I'm on the Slack,

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:36.790
and then people could
meet on the Slack,

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.430
and it was
full-featured enough--

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.490
like we could send attachments
and things like that--

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:45.670
that most of our in
person communication

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.660
could be done in class.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:52.960
And in class we adopted a sort
of, like, daily Scrum format,

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:58.430
where we simply said what we had
done since the previous class

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:03.500
and what our goals
were until next class.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.190
So in the end, though, we did
have to cut some features.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:12.150
These features
mainly were the idea

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:15.890
of multiple-- again, a
tutorial or multiple levels,

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:18.700
simply because there would just
be too much content that we

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.010
would need to playtest
in order to make sure

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:23.520
that it was of
consistent quality

00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.370
and got our message across.

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:32.010
And also trying to add more
individuality to the toys

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:33.440
that you saw.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.040
They have different
graphics, but that's as much

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.055
as we could do given
the time constraints.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:45.360
So kind of just bring it back.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:51.590
Our three worst
decisions were first,

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:54.280
we did end up spending
a lot of time on code

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:57.120
and assets that never got used.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:02.430
We maybe, like, used 10%
to 20% of our final work

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:04.170
in our final project.

00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.390
Actually, maybe that
is a bit overkill.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:08.120
But OK.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:14.040
Maybe 30% of our final code and
assets in our final project.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.860
This really was due to
this second bad decision,

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:20.750
that we kept the game
and its direction

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:22.470
too vague for too long.

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:24.760
We always were holding
out for, oh, maybe we'll

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.870
be able to come up with
a better game idea,

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:29.550
or maybe we'll find
some magic solution

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:32.710
to how we can make
forecast-based financing

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:34.170
into a game.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:38.230
And because of this
mindset, we spent probably

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:42.390
the first half of the project,
like, just staying too vague.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:45.410
And that hurt us in the end,
because we spent so much time

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:47.710
going in all these
different directions.

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:53.110
And really the
decision that kind of

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:54.530
captures those
first two, though,

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:59.270
is the fact that we tried
to make a game on top

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:00.710
of forecast-based financing.

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:03.110
So we had forecast-based
financing, and we were like,

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.290
how can we skin this as a game?

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:08.300
Whereas once we switched
that mindset and thought,

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:11.580
let's have a game, and how can
we put forecast-based financing

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:12.430
into it?

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:16.640
I think that was the moment that
we then came together as a team

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:22.100
and really started making the
final game that we wanted.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.310
So our best decisions--

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.300
STUDENT 1: So one of
our best decisions

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:31.016
was that we chose good tools
at the beginning, which

00:27:31.016 --> 00:27:32.595
meant that as we
went through all

00:27:32.595 --> 00:27:34.400
these different
digital prototypes,

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.574
we actually didn't have to
completely rewrite our game.

00:27:37.574 --> 00:27:39.990
We could pull out the way that
workers worked in one game.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:42.084
We could pull out the view that
we were using in another game,

00:27:42.084 --> 00:27:44.340
and then we could just
combine them together,

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.842
and that allowed us to
move quickly whenever we

00:27:46.842 --> 00:27:49.180
were changing our prototype.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.716
We also weren't afraid
to trust each other,

00:27:51.716 --> 00:27:54.439
both in terms of what
everyone was working on,

00:27:54.439 --> 00:27:56.730
but also in terms of the
decisions that we were making.

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.021
And so when we said that we
had to throw something out,

00:27:59.021 --> 00:28:03.240
we all understood that it was
for the good of the project.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.230
And we didn't have
a lot of complaining

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.330
or hurt feelings when
something didn't get put in

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:11.472
or when we decided to throw
out certain assets or code.

00:28:11.472 --> 00:28:13.930
And when we got
to the end, we had

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:16.650
been through enough
of this vagueness

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:18.710
that we were all kind
of frustrated with it,

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:21.460
and we realized that we had
an idea that we all liked

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.710
and we really got on board
with it and made it happen.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:25.500
Once we started working
on our final idea,

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:29.198
and we saw that it worked,
basically every decision

00:28:29.198 --> 00:28:31.811
from that point on was how
do we make this game better,

00:28:31.811 --> 00:28:33.560
and we were all on
board with that vision.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:38.400
Thank you.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.852
Any questions?

00:28:39.852 --> 00:28:43.240
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:44.692 --> 00:28:47.596
PROFESSOR: Anyone in the
audience have feedback for them

00:28:47.596 --> 00:28:49.306
first, before--

00:28:49.306 --> 00:28:52.549
AUDIENCE: You can't see
those sand castles very well.

00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:55.090
STUDENT 1: Yeah, we'll have to
make all of our slides darker.

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:56.596
PROFESSOR: Yellow and white.

00:28:56.596 --> 00:28:57.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:00.320
Like, the yellow and white,
on your early screens.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:02.494
I was doing this on
your instruction screen.

00:29:02.494 --> 00:29:03.410
PROFESSOR: It's also--

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:07.365
AUDIENCE: I realize that's the
game, not the presentation,

00:29:07.365 --> 00:29:08.299
but wow.

00:29:08.299 --> 00:29:10.590
PROFESSOR: It's also a little
faded in the game itself.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:12.589
It could be the display
resolution you're using.

00:29:12.589 --> 00:29:15.186
So we're all done
with everything,

00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:16.310
try a different resolution.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:17.518
See if it makes a difference.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.960
AUDIENCE: The music in the
game level was too high.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.370
It was overpowering your voice.

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:27.880
So I think you were
almost hollering just

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.317
to be able to be heard.

00:29:29.317 --> 00:29:30.650
it doesn't need to be that loud.

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:33.191
So you can just crank down the
volume, either on the computer

00:29:33.191 --> 00:29:36.940
or on the controls over there.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.720
Something that I had
a question for, you

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.634
don't have to answer
it today, but you

00:29:41.634 --> 00:29:43.550
might want to put it in
your presentation was,

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:48.600
how long was the design
of what you eventually

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.110
established on the
table before you

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.610
decided that this was the
thing that you were going for?

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:55.950
Because I'm assuming it
was one of your vague--

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:58.440
it came up during
your vague idea phase,

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:02.200
and you're implied that you
were in that mode for too long.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.220
But I don't know how
long it was on the table,

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.300
or was it only something
you figured out

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.782
at the end of the
vague idea phase?

00:30:09.782 --> 00:30:11.240
Because otherwise
you wouldn't have

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.330
been able to switch to
this idea if it was not

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:14.663
on the table in the first place.

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:21.010
And how did you decide this
was it, that the sand castle

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:22.420
game was going to be it?

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:26.290
I understand-- I think you very
clearly explained the benefits

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:27.770
of deciding this was it.

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:30.570
But how did you come
to that conclusion?

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:32.620
So that's stuff I wanted
to hear more about.

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.780
But you don't have
to answer it now.

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:36.875
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:36.875 --> 00:30:38.250
Just a little bit
of specificity.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:41.036
You mentioned you spent too
long on that design phase.

00:30:41.036 --> 00:30:42.160
I wonder how long that was.

00:30:44.989 --> 00:30:47.280
PROFESSOR: You said Pablo
switched your target audience

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.170
for you.

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:52.065
Telling us whether that was
because of the game that he saw

00:30:52.065 --> 00:30:55.090
or because of something else--
if you know that information,

00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:55.910
throw it in there.

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:59.150
If you don't know that
information, that's fine.

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.339
Knowing why you
dropped the team lead.

00:31:01.339 --> 00:31:03.880
You mentioned you dropped it,
but you didn't exactly say why.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.400
Again, really quick.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.270
This is what-- we weren't
getting blah out of it,

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:11.080
or the flexibility
was more, whatever.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.270
And then, yeah, to--

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:13.050
Oh.

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:13.990
Defining your terms.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.550
You were saying things like
casual versus hardcore.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:19.424
Give a little bit a definition
of what you mean by that.

00:31:19.424 --> 00:31:21.090
It means different
things for everybody.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:22.765
So what is your use of that.

00:31:22.765 --> 00:31:23.390
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:25.970
I think he specifically
said hardcore and mobile,

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:28.140
but there are hardcore
mobile players out there,

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:28.849
so this is like--

00:31:28.849 --> 00:31:30.473
PROFESSOR: And casual
can be considered

00:31:30.473 --> 00:31:32.440
a version of hardcore,
just in a different way.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.880
So just be really--
just be a little more

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.630
clear about-- because I
think you were talking

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:37.671
about the target audience
and the kind of players

00:31:37.671 --> 00:31:39.350
and the kind of games
they might play.

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:42.040
So just be a little bit
more focused on what exactly

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.507
you mean by that.

00:31:45.507 --> 00:31:46.343
That's it from me.

00:31:46.343 --> 00:31:46.968
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:46.968 --> 00:31:48.916
So in terms of
technical observation,

00:31:48.916 --> 00:31:52.325
Yeoman is not really
a module framework.

00:31:52.325 --> 00:31:55.247
It's just a system to
generate the project

00:31:55.247 --> 00:31:58.169
and it puts
different frameworks.

00:31:58.169 --> 00:32:00.130
Again, just check that.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:03.340
AUDIENCE: So that's a
terminology issue, then.

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.332
Clearly it worked
out for your team.

00:32:05.332 --> 00:32:07.040
So we're not saying
don't mention Yeoman.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.123
It's clearly a good thing.

00:32:08.123 --> 00:32:11.530
But just check your
definition of what it is.

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.580
Because it'll be more
helpful for other people

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.224
to understand what
it is so that they

00:32:15.224 --> 00:32:17.640
can think about whether they
want to use it in the future.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.910
PROFESSOR: Oh, and
actually-- So your demo,

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:22.150
you spent about three
minutes doing it.

00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:24.690
We are going to have you have
a player from the audience

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:29.470
play your game live, without
getting a lot of help.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:31.030
You can talk over it.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.115
You can, after a while,
start helping them.

00:32:33.115 --> 00:32:34.490
We want to see
them at least just

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:36.080
to start playing on their own.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.980
Decide when you're going
to put that demo in.

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.970
You could actually
combine them both together

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:42.470
if you do it at the
beginning or end.

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:45.990
But if you do that, give the
player a little bit of time

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:47.080
before you start talking.

00:32:49.835 --> 00:32:50.960
AUDIENCE: That's all I got.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:51.680
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.560
Thanks.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:57.060
Snap, come on down.

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:03.020
STUDENT 1: Hello.

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.610
We are Hello Waves.

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:07.620
We're a game about
forecasting, specifically

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:11.610
this idea called forecast-based
financing, of using forecasts

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:14.760
to make decisions about
possible disasters in the future

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.452
and how to prepare for them.

00:33:16.452 --> 00:33:18.910
We'd actually like to start
with a playthrough of our game.

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:23.924
So if anybody would like to
be a volunteer to try it out.

00:33:23.924 --> 00:33:25.740
AUDIENCE: The guest
from not our class.

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.915
Would you please
come down, Andrew?

00:33:28.915 --> 00:33:34.117
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:34.117 --> 00:33:35.700
PROFESSOR: Thank you
for volunteering.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:39.074
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:39.074 --> 00:33:41.472
ANDREW: Hi, I'm Andrew.

00:33:41.472 --> 00:33:42.930
PROFESSOR: Oh, do
you need a chair?

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:43.930
There's one right there.

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:44.454
All right.

00:33:44.454 --> 00:33:44.954
[?

00:33:44.954 --> 00:33:47.078
STUDENT 1: I'm not sure
how to make it full screen.

00:33:47.078 --> 00:33:50.102
But anyways, this is our game.

00:33:50.102 --> 00:33:51.810
I'd recommend looking
at the instructions

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:53.101
first and reading through them.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.170
And we'll keep the
description minimal

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:03.770
as you read through,
just to show the player's

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:05.400
initial reaction to it.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.817
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:07.817 --> 00:34:08.400
ANDREW: Music.

00:34:34.959 --> 00:34:35.750
STUDENT 1: So yeah.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:36.375
Start the game.

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:41.900
So as you can see, our
game, as I said before,

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:46.220
you control some toys
on a day at the beach.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.190
And so by dragging and dropping
them between the castles,

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:58.920
you'll see that their
status is changed, and say

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.010
that they want to move
on their next turn

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:02.567
or that they want
to be collecting--

00:35:02.567 --> 00:35:04.150
or that they're going
to be collecting

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:08.430
candy or anything like that.

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:12.400
And the game is turn-based,
so all of the actions

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.915
will resolve on the next turn.

00:35:42.096 --> 00:35:45.398
ANDREW: Am I reading this right?

00:35:45.398 --> 00:35:46.064
STUDENT 1: Yeah.

00:35:46.064 --> 00:35:47.689
STUDENT 2: You can
also access the Help

00:35:47.689 --> 00:35:49.536
by clicking in the
bottom right corner.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.330
STUDENT 1: And so when
you go to the next turn,

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:14.580
you'll see all the toys move
as specified by the status

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.285
bubble above their heads.

00:36:16.285 --> 00:36:18.326
ANDREW: So go ahead to
the next turn? [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:18.326 --> 00:36:19.754
and Next Turn.

00:36:22.002 --> 00:36:23.460
STUDENT 1: But
unfortunately you'll

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:28.070
find that when toys have been
evacuated, they're unhappy

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:30.510
and need candy to survive,
so they'll all take damage.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:33.480
ANDREW: OK.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.450
I don't want to be
in that [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:39.415
STUDENT 2: So you can try
returning them to their homes.

00:36:39.415 --> 00:36:39.915
ANDREW: Ah.

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:59.710
STUDENT 1: And so you'll see
that on this turn instead now

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:01.710
they have their statuses
set to gathering candy,

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:03.895
except for the dump truck,
who's still evacuated.

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:13.290
ANDREW: Gotcha.

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:15.290
OK.

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:16.790
I think he needs
to be evacuated.

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:27.090
STUDENT 1: Exactly.

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.787
And so the idea is that as
the player plays through it,

00:37:29.787 --> 00:37:32.120
they get better at understanding
how to use the forecast

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:35.087
to make decisions
about the future,

00:37:35.087 --> 00:37:37.670
both in terms of how much candy
that they need to have stocked

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:40.520
up in order to weather
out the rising tides,

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.740
and also in terms
of when they're

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:46.967
going to need to move their
workers out-- their toys out

00:37:46.967 --> 00:37:48.300
of the areas that are in danger.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.280
ANDREW: They're gonna
be really affected.

00:38:24.419 --> 00:38:26.210
STUDENT 1: I think you
have those two guys.

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:28.400
ANDREW: Oh, right.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.310
So is there a reminder
of where they started?

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:30.976
STUDENT 1: Yeah.

00:38:30.976 --> 00:38:32.100
It's on the castle.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.720
It's actually blocked
there right now

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.570
by the toy in front of it.

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:40.035
But there's a little shadow
on there, an imprint.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:51.220
And because he ran out of candy
and then-- Actually, sorry.

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.630
Because he went to a
place that was underwater,

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:57.518
he took too much damage and then
was swept away by the waves.

00:38:57.518 --> 00:39:00.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:08.054 --> 00:39:09.470
STUDENT 1: And so
on the forecast,

00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:13.730
you can see that high water is
coming for quite a while, which

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:15.360
is going to be a
danger for the toys,

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.600
both in terms of possibly
getting swept away

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:22.270
and not having enough candy for
all the toys that you're going

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:23.683
to have to move out of the way.

00:39:23.683 --> 00:39:24.474
ANDREW: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:30.670
PROFESSOR: Ooh.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:32.494
He may be out of luck.

00:39:32.494 --> 00:39:34.730
ANDREW: Yeah.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:40.022
PROFESSOR: And when you've lost
two toys, you lose the game.

00:39:40.022 --> 00:39:41.106
ANDREW: Pretty good.

00:39:41.106 --> 00:39:42.480
STUDENT 1: Thank
you for playing.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.588
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:46.125 --> 00:39:47.500
STUDENT 1: So
that's Hello Waves.

00:39:53.290 --> 00:40:01.100
So in our game we had a
few challenges to overcome.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:04.700
The first was that
our game was based

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:10.150
on forecast-based financing,
which is a very abstract topic.

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:11.730
It's a pretty
understandable idea

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:14.510
of using information about
the future and ideas of risk

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:17.180
in order to decide where
to allocate resources.

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:21.160
But it's still a bit abstract
and building a game around it

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.300
took a little bit of work.

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:25.550
It's useful to note that
it's different than long term

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:26.060
planning.

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.790
It's not just thinking about
what will happen in the future,

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:30.410
you know, building
a dam to prevent

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:32.050
water or things like that.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.630
It's actually about
using the information

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:37.020
you have to make the
best decision for events

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:41.360
that may be upcoming in
the semi-near future.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.370
We also wanted to avoid
making a game that

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:46.980
was overly preachy or
simplified, where it was clear

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:49.610
exactly how you're going to win
and you could just basically

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:51.470
push the forecast-based
financing

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:52.700
button to win the game.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.783
We wanted players to
actually think and understand

00:40:54.783 --> 00:40:57.470
the concept there,
instead of just coming up

00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:00.110
with the buzzword of
forecast-based financing.

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:01.642
And finally, we
had the challenge

00:41:01.642 --> 00:41:04.100
of actually communicating that
forecast to players in a way

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.650
that they would be
able to understand

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:06.980
and then make use of.

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.260
You could see in that game
that we had water levels,

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:11.010
and it would show
on the map, and we

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:13.280
found that players were
pretty good at using that

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.590
in order to make
decisions about what

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:17.110
was going to happen
in the future

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:18.934
and how to allocate
their resources.

00:41:18.934 --> 00:41:21.100
The other big challenge
that we had in the beginning

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:24.950
was that our initial target
audience was policymakers.

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:28.702
Like for Snap, Pablo had come in
and pitched us this game idea,

00:41:28.702 --> 00:41:30.660
and originally he had
wanted us to build a game

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:33.280
for policymakers that
would help them understand

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:35.349
the benefits of
forecast-based financing

00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:37.890
and therefore convince them that
they should develop policies

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:40.880
that would give
resources to plans based

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.410
on forecast-based financing.

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:45.279
So I would like to take
you through a couple

00:41:45.279 --> 00:41:47.320
of our prototypes, just
to show you the evolution

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:52.210
and comment on our process.

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:56.930
Actually, to preface that,
we had a lot of prototypes,

00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:59.980
because our idea was so abstract
and because we weren't sure

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:01.550
how to address our audience.

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:04.310
So we built a lot of
prototypes to start with.

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:08.094
We had ideas that ranged
across levels of scope

00:42:08.094 --> 00:42:10.510
of what you controlled, where
you controlled entire cities

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:12.259
or where you controlled
individual workers

00:42:12.259 --> 00:42:13.676
and moved them
around, and then we

00:42:13.676 --> 00:42:16.009
would pull from all these
different kinds of ideas, what

00:42:16.009 --> 00:42:18.180
worked, what didn't, what
did people understand,

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.400
what confused them.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.680
And from that we got a really
good idea of what concepts

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:24.300
helped people
understand the idea

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:28.350
and brought them into this final
game that we ended up with.

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:31.170
So the project started
on October 15th,

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:32.750
and this was our
first prototype.

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.850
It was a terminal-based
game where

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:37.970
you had some kind of information
about a future rainfall,

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:40.780
and then you had to type in your
commands of how you controlled

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.520
different cities.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:45.360
This-- Actually,
people found it fun,

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:48.050
but as you might expect the
feedback wasn't very good

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:49.860
and people didn't
quite understand

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:51.470
how to move forward with it.

00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:54.750
It put a lot of
cognitive load on people.

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:56.980
So when we moved
forward, we tried

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:01.300
to give people more easily
understandable actions to use.

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:04.350
But the problem with this game
was that it was time-based

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:05.580
and it updated every second.

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:06.680
And so there were
so many numbers

00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:09.054
flying at people that even
MIT students who playtested it

00:43:09.054 --> 00:43:10.320
couldn't understand.

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.550
So we figured that
people like policymakers

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:14.920
who didn't have much
experience with games really

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.230
wouldn't be able to
understand the game at all.

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:19.570
So instead we went
to turn-based.

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:22.870
And that helped, but
at the same time--

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:24.370
it's tough to see
on this projector,

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:26.190
but we have a forecast
underneath that says

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:27.900
how much rainfall is expected.

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:29.900
And again, that wasn't
understandable to people,

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.483
because they couldn't understand
what three inches of rainfall

00:43:32.483 --> 00:43:34.520
meant for their city
and they couldn't

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.292
understand how that contributed
to a possible disaster.

00:43:37.292 --> 00:43:39.250
At this point, Pablo
actually came by the class

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:41.840
and played the game,
and then he told us

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.270
that he wasn't even sure that
he could get policymakers

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:46.730
to play the game, because
they may not have enough time.

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:49.429
Instead he wanted us to
switch to grade schoolers,

00:43:49.429 --> 00:43:50.970
because we could
teach them something

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:53.300
about forecast-based financing
and help them understand

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.687
as they grew up.

00:43:55.687 --> 00:43:57.395
And this was great
for us, because making

00:43:57.395 --> 00:43:59.870
a game that was serious,
easy for somebody

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:02.400
who didn't have experience
with games to play, and also

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:06.320
fun and engaging was too
difficult for us, actually.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.560
So moving to grade
schoolers was awesome.

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:13.950
He also suggested that we try
to make the idea of rainfall

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:16.960
or water levels more
visceral, and that's

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:20.080
when we came upon this
idea of the rising waters.

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:22.470
Whenever players looked
at this, they instantly

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:24.120
understood the
concept of the game.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.700
The feedback might not be there.

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:28.360
The beautiful UI
might not be there.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.660
But the idea of having
cities with workers in them

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:33.377
and a rising water level
coming towards them, everybody

00:44:33.377 --> 00:44:35.710
understood that, and it made
it a lot easier for players

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:37.860
to reason about the game.

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:40.810
From there we added things like
nicer art, better feedback,

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:44.410
which you can't quite see
in a static picture, more

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:46.930
improvements to how
the forecast worked,

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:50.955
and eventually we ended up
with our final version today.

00:44:53.574 --> 00:44:54.990
STUDENT 2: So to
talk a little bit

00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:57.270
about our actual
development process.

00:44:57.270 --> 00:45:00.430
So our team was structured
into three main subteams--

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:03.300
production, which was in
charge of managerial roles,

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:06.600
deliverables, and playtesting,
and so there was a shared

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:10.950
responsibility there,
a technical team, which

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:13.700
was in charge of the
bulk of the coding work,

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.140
and a user experience team,
which would be in charge

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:19.800
of assets and UI design.

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.390
We also initially
envisioned subteam leaders,

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:26.100
where we'd be kind of
communicating through them.

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:28.090
But we found the concept
kind of redundant,

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:31.060
and so we worked pretty much
with, like, a flat structure

00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:34.210
between the three teams.

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:37.770
So from the beginning,
we encouraged good coding

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:42.060
practice, and so we used
good tools available to us.

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:45.110
One of these is Yeoman, which
is a JavaScript scaffolding

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:47.110
framework.

00:45:47.110 --> 00:45:50.530
And this helped us out a
lot by basically automating

00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:55.320
a lot of our JavaScript tasks
and making our code modular.

00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:58.360
We also used Phaser's
state machine,

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:03.070
which is this kind of badly
documented new feature

00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:06.030
in the Phaser game engine,
which was the JavaScript game

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:08.570
engine that we used.

00:46:08.570 --> 00:46:12.319
It's a bit badly documented,
but it did save us

00:46:12.319 --> 00:46:14.360
a lot of headaches, and
once we figured that out,

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:16.840
that proved immensely helpful.

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:22.890
And we also used MVC, which
is a software engineering

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:25.450
term standing for
Model-View-Controller.

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:28.990
And again, by encouraging
these good coding practices,

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:32.590
we reduced dependencies and
made sure that our team was

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:34.760
productive.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.280
In terms of
communication, we-- also

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.504
similar to Snap-- used
Slack, which is kind

00:46:39.504 --> 00:46:40.795
of like a modernized chat room.

00:46:40.795 --> 00:46:43.180
It's very feature-rich,
and so you

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:46.110
can share files in channel
and things like that.

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:49.510
And we also used the
idea of the daily Scrum.

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:52.050
We implemented it
in class, and we

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:56.700
would say what we had done that
class, what we would be doing,

00:46:56.700 --> 00:47:00.950
and what we wanted to
do until next class.

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:05.280
And so the major challenges that
we faced during the development

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.760
process, though, were
that our team members

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.610
came from very
different backgrounds

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:12.875
and had very different
preferences about games.

00:47:12.875 --> 00:47:15.290
You know, some of
our team members

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:18.795
were very hardcore StarCraft
players and very good

00:47:18.795 --> 00:47:21.610
at RTS games, while
other members of our team

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:25.570
preferred like a more laid-back
mobile game, Fruit Ninja

00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:26.760
kind of approach.

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.680
And so trying to mediate
those two viewpoints

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.300
and trying to create
a game that would

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:37.200
engage both types of
gamers was a challenge

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:40.300
that we had to overcome.

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:43.640
And so another big challenge
that we had in our development

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:47.735
process, as you saw
through our progression

00:47:47.735 --> 00:47:49.110
through our
different prototypes,

00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:53.280
was that our direction was not
very clear until about halfway

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.570
through the project.

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:57.950
And so partially because
we had different ideas

00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:59.760
on what the game
should look like,

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:02.930
and also partially because
we had such an abstract idea

00:48:02.930 --> 00:48:05.780
of forecast-based
financing that even

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:09.530
we didn't have that good
of a grasp on initially,

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:11.860
it took us a while
to really get settled

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:13.530
on what we wanted to build.

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:18.050
And so this really challenged
our development process

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:23.990
and made us have to build a
lot before we got something

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:26.760
that we liked.

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:31.720
And so eventually we did end
up having to cut some features,

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:36.320
like multiple levels, or a
guided tutorial for the player.

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:40.140
We thought that this would
introduce too much new content

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:42.220
that would need to be
playtested, balanced,

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:47.030
and tested to ensure
consistency with the rest

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:49.660
of our game, which we viewed
as taking up too much time.

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:52.910
And we also cut the idea of
adding more individuality

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:57.930
to the workers or to
the toys that you saw,

00:48:57.930 --> 00:48:59.780
other than different
graphics for each.

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:06.277
STUDENT 1: So some of the worst
things that we did on our team

00:49:06.277 --> 00:49:07.860
is that we spent a
lot of time on work

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:09.780
that got thrown out entirely.

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:13.070
All the prototypes we did, they
were actually pretty useful

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:16.070
because of the things we learned
about the concept and about

00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:17.720
how people would play the game.

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.570
But we did spend a
lot of time on things

00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:23.050
like art or nitty gritty
details that didn't really

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:25.320
need to be figured out and
that we could have put off

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.950
until later in the project.

00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:32.280
We also kept the game direction
to vague for too long.

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:35.280
As Norman said, we spent
a lot of time with that,

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:38.470
and it probably ate up
too much of our time.

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:41.200
Although it helped
us learn, we could've

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.720
moved faster in the beginning
to get to a solid idea.

00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:47.320
Because once we got to a solid
idea of the rising waters,

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:50.160
our team started to
centralize around a lot

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:53.610
better because we could actually
deal with something concrete.

00:49:53.610 --> 00:49:55.680
While we were dealing
with the abstract ideas,

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:58.180
everybody was all over the
place and arguing about things

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:00.680
that didn't quite line up.

00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:04.070
And the worst decision of
all that we started with,

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:06.860
and that sort of made the
problem of going too vague

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:08.472
and all these other
things happen,

00:50:08.472 --> 00:50:09.930
is that we were
originally thinking

00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:13.670
how do we skin forecast-based
financing as a game?

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:17.490
How do we take this idea of
using forecasting decisions

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:19.880
and then just gamify it?

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:23.280
Which we eventually
realized wasn't fun,

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:26.156
and didn't help us actually
come up with any ideas.

00:50:26.156 --> 00:50:27.780
Instead, when we
flipped it and started

00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:30.910
talking about what game
could we create and use

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:34.760
forecast-based financing to
improve it and teach players

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:38.030
how to play the game, and
therefore allow them to come

00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:40.860
out of the game having learned
about forecast-based financing,

00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:42.180
the world sort of opened up.

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:43.846
Everything became a
lot more interesting

00:50:43.846 --> 00:50:47.532
and we found that we
started to move faster.

00:50:47.532 --> 00:50:49.990
Some of the best decisions that
we made, on the other hand.

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:52.120
As Norman said,
we had good tools,

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:55.260
which meant that even when
we threw out prototypes,

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:58.660
although we wasted things
like art resources and things

00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:01.990
like that, we actually didn't
end up wasting very much code,

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:04.640
because things like the
idea of workers or cities

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:07.140
could literally be pulled
out of the old games we had,

00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:09.510
put into our new game,
and then reworked

00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:13.300
to build our new structure.

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:15.120
We also weren't afraid
to trust each other

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:17.840
and throw out the
things that didn't work.

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.530
Once we started
moving fast, we had

00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:21.210
a lot of ideas that
would come out,

00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:23.320
and we would say, OK,
this doesn't work.

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:24.970
We're actually
going to scrap it.

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:28.840
Or we think that this isn't
the direction we need to go in.

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:32.281
And everybody was willing
to go along with it.

00:51:32.281 --> 00:51:34.530
It's not a good feeling to
see your things thrown out,

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:36.950
but everybody understood that
was for the best of the game,

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:38.741
and I really appreciate
their understanding

00:51:38.741 --> 00:51:40.340
with everything too.

00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:42.360
And part of that all
comes down to the fact

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.550
that we were on board
with our final idea.

00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:47.115
We were all excited about
the concept that we had.

00:51:47.115 --> 00:51:48.740
Part of that might
have been the relief

00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:50.531
of coming to a concrete
idea after spending

00:51:50.531 --> 00:51:51.950
so much time being vague.

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:53.720
But once we had
that concrete idea,

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:57.760
we really moved fast and
worked well around it.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.695
So thank you, and any questions?

00:52:00.695 --> 00:52:04.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:07.572 --> 00:52:08.780
AUDIENCE: Who did your sound?

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:11.090
It's awesome.

00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:13.200
STUDENT 1: That was
from our UI team.

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.185
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:52:14.185 --> 00:52:14.685
OK.

00:52:14.685 --> 00:52:17.015
It's really cool.

00:52:17.015 --> 00:52:18.390
PROFESSOR: Where
did you find it?

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:20.015
STUDENT 2: So it's
on our credits page.

00:52:20.015 --> 00:52:22.590
Most of it was online.

00:52:22.590 --> 00:52:23.950
The credits page in our game.

00:52:27.798 --> 00:52:31.165
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:35.747 --> 00:52:37.830
STUDENT 1: It's a little
small, I guess, up there.

00:52:37.830 --> 00:52:39.449
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.

00:52:39.449 --> 00:52:40.490
STUDENT 1: But it looks--

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:41.450
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:43.622
STUDENT 2: Yeah. "Hold
My Hand," AJP, by--

00:52:43.622 --> 00:52:45.122
AUDIENCE: Would it
be possible maybe

00:52:45.122 --> 00:52:47.569
to create a short URL for this?

00:52:47.569 --> 00:52:48.110
For the game?

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:49.470
STUDENT 2: Yeah, a bit.ly link?

00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:50.180
STUDENT 1: Yeah, sure.

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:52.530
We can make a bit.ly link, and
we'll send it out to everyone.

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:54.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
just so we've go it.

00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:55.314
Yeah.

00:52:55.314 --> 00:52:58.010
STUDENT 1: That's a good call.

00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:59.004
Yes.

00:52:59.004 --> 00:53:01.045
AUDIENCE: Having watched
the early crash and burn

00:53:01.045 --> 00:53:04.126
of the playthrough,
how often have people--

00:53:04.126 --> 00:53:06.250
I don't know if you've
actually had a lot of people

00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:08.490
to play your current
version of your game--

00:53:08.490 --> 00:53:10.720
do people usually take
a playthrough or two

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:13.720
before they start
getting the concept?

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:14.700
STUDENT 1: Yes.

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:17.882
That's why something like a
tutorial would be really nice.

00:53:17.882 --> 00:53:20.090
Unfortunately, we didn't
have the time to put it in--

00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:21.048
AUDIENCE: Yeah, no, no.

00:53:21.048 --> 00:53:22.510
I was just wondering how that--

00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:23.176
STUDENT 1: Yeah.

00:53:23.176 --> 00:53:27.302
Usually what happens is even
if after maybe a couple turns

00:53:27.302 --> 00:53:29.260
of playing through, they
start to get the idea.

00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:32.410
The problem is that as
the water starts to rise,

00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:36.880
they haven't prepared enough,
and so all their toys will

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.757
starve or get carried
away by the waves, which

00:53:39.757 --> 00:53:42.090
is a bit unfortunate and
probably makes the players feel

00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:43.006
bad on the first time.

00:53:43.006 --> 00:53:44.632
But then they-- It
actually teaches

00:53:44.632 --> 00:53:45.840
them to think ahead about it.

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:48.204
So the next playthrough,
they're much more careful

00:53:48.204 --> 00:53:48.953
and understanding.

00:53:52.817 --> 00:53:55.725
AUDIENCE: So I was
wondering if you

00:53:55.725 --> 00:54:00.530
were playing any other games
or thinking about other games

00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:03.090
as inspiration or
thinking about how

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:05.592
to deal with some of--
hitting the right level

00:54:05.592 --> 00:54:09.860
of strategic thinking
in your game.

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:13.760
STUDENT 2: Well, so I guess in
terms of early on, because we

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:17.110
had a very different idea
of what we wanted to do it

00:54:17.110 --> 00:54:18.340
early on in the process.

00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:21.390
We were thinking about games
like Civilization and how

00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:24.680
did they communicate all
these complex worker movements

00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:27.050
and managing multiple cities.

00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:31.050
But once we actually came
up with this game concept,

00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:35.610
I think we had much,
much smaller goals,

00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:40.780
and so did we have any specific
game models, do you think, or?

00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:43.660
STUDENT 1: There's none that
I specifically think of.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:46.800
There were some things that
we were sort of inspired by,

00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:49.260
standard tricks
like when you hover

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:51.380
over one of the characters,
they got bigger.

00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:54.202
Some idea of showing off
that this is clickable,

00:54:54.202 --> 00:54:54.910
things like that.

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:59.143
But specific games
themselves, not really.

00:54:59.143 --> 00:54:59.684
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:59.684 --> 00:55:02.660
I was just thinking it ended
up being kind of board-game-y.

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:05.340
And I feel like there's
a lot of board games

00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:08.384
where they've been thinking
a lot about getting

00:55:08.384 --> 00:55:14.168
that right level of tactics
rather than strategy.

00:55:14.168 --> 00:55:15.614
But yeah.

00:55:15.614 --> 00:55:17.060
I guess it worked out too.

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:22.090
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned that you

00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:24.950
were able to change
how your workers looked

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:26.465
and just keep your models.

00:55:26.465 --> 00:55:29.928
So that's the holy grail of
object-oriented programming,

00:55:29.928 --> 00:55:31.792
that you have an
object that's reusable

00:55:31.792 --> 00:55:34.220
and you don't have to
throw out the code.

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:36.387
Do you think there's a
reason why in particular you

00:55:36.387 --> 00:55:37.470
were able to achieve that?

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:40.212
Because I think that's
not common, necessarily,

00:55:40.212 --> 00:55:41.503
in object-oriented programming.

00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:48.050
STUDENT 2: Partially a
little bit of OCD-ness,

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:50.240
like, very early
on, very strictly

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:53.610
saying we're going to write
this object-oriented code,

00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:55.860
and we're not just going
to hack things together.

00:55:55.860 --> 00:55:58.660
I think that helped a
lot, because we actually

00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:01.680
spent the time in the very
beginning to think about, like,

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:05.780
which objects were
responsible for what

00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:07.840
and what their
purpose should be.

00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:11.592
So basically, I think because we
moved more slowly in the start

00:56:11.592 --> 00:56:13.800
and thought more carefully
about how that code should

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:18.780
be structured, we ended up with
having an easier time later on.

00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:21.470
STUDENT 1: There's also the
fact that because we had learned

00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:23.700
these things from the
prototype that we were putting

00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:27.880
into this game, that also
meant that the objects that we

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:31.570
created-- because we wanted
similar functionality to things

00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:33.970
that we had already
seen and we knew worked,

00:56:33.970 --> 00:56:36.490
it meant that we were
comfortable pulling out

00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:38.970
the functionality into that.

00:56:38.970 --> 00:56:42.840
So I don't want to say
it was designed to fit,

00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:48.419
but there was the fact that we
moved it on purpose, really.

00:56:48.419 --> 00:56:50.252
AUDIENCE: I would like
to something on that.

00:56:50.252 --> 00:56:54.110
So we had a very good MVC model.

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:58.119
So models were in this
tree-like structure,

00:56:58.119 --> 00:57:00.584
and it was very easy
to change models.

00:57:00.584 --> 00:57:03.570
So models knew about-- Sorry.

00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:05.620
User knew about
models, but models

00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:06.870
had no idea about [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:08.370
So basically, it was quite easy.

00:57:14.070 --> 00:57:15.270
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:16.170
STUDENT 1: Thank you.

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:19.520
