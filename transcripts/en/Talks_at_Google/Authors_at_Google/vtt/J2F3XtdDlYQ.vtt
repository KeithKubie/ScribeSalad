GRETCHEN RUBIN: "The Happiness
Project"-- the way I think

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.620
about it-- is just any kind of
systematic attempt to think

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.650
about happiness.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.770
Because what I found for myself
was that until I really

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.610
started to think about it,
I never thought about

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.570
happiness at all.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.990
I never asked myself whether
I was happy or

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.200
how I could be happier.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.130
And so with "The Happiness
Project" I really set out to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.600
ask myself well, what are the
things that make me happy?

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.730
How can I be happier?

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.480
And what are the small,
manageable, realistic changes

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.710
that I could make in my life?

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.490
So I went about it a very
particular way.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.870
So I gave every month a theme,
and I had several resolutions

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.000
related to every theme.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.140
Whether it was energy, or
marriage, or friendship, or

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.180
play, or whatever.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.670
But then people can do it
all different ways.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.720
One kind of Happiness
Project that I love

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.370
is people who pick--

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.300
and I did I've done
this myself now--

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.810
one word theme for a year to
give your year a driving idea.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.090
So I picked the word
bigger as my team.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.160
My sister pick the
word smaller.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.010
And they both are
great themes.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.460
I have a friend who one of his
themes was fame, and one of

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.720
his other themes was dark.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.660
So you can get a picture
of what he's like.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.720
And so that's another way to
do a Happiness Project.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.530
There's a very prevalent
and highly

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.570
estimable theme in happiness.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.830
Which is to say, if you try to
be happier you'll trip over

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.580
your own feet.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.210
So John Stuart Mill said ask
yourself if you are happy, and

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.570
you shall cease to be so.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.420
So it's this idea that you can't
really try to be happy

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.320
it has to happen indirectly.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.830
And I hate to go up against John
Stuart Mill and Eleanor

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.870
Roosevelt, and many others.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.090
But I really do not find
that to be true.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.930
I find that actually thinking
about it is helpful.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.260
Because it's by really directly
thinking about it,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.580
and saying well, what's
not working?

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.750
How can I be happier?

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.610
That's when I started to really
identify places where I

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.380
could imagine making changes
that would make me happier.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.560
So for me that's what doing a
happiness project The means.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.810
SHAREE: And one thing that you
mentioned was very empowering.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.630
To think of happiness as
something that you can

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.790
actually work towards, and
take small steps towards.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.390
That's a very empowering way
to look at happiness.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.660
Unlike the roundabout way
of getting to happiness.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.590
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Right, right.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.040
Well, and it's interesting
because one of the questions

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.320
is how much is it within
your control?

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.150
And it turns out that
researchers think that about

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.930
50% of happiness is genetically
determined.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.750
So some people are born Tiggers,
and some people are

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.620
born Eeyores.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.340
And we've all seen that.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.600
It's pretty hard wired.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.750
Then about 10 to 20% is
something called life

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.660
circumstances.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.720
Which is age, occupation,
marital status, education,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.440
income, health, things
like that.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.600
Which you maybe have some
control over, but those are

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.930
more like life circumstances.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.760
And then all the rest is very
much within our conscious

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.970
control and is affected by the
way that we think and the way

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:09.770
that we act.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.440
So depending on where your
range is, you can push

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.760
yourself up to the top of your
range, or push yourself down

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.460
to the bottom of your range
by the way that

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.480
you think and act.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.140
And so it isn't just that
it's flowing over you.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.150
To some extent it's not
completely within your control

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.940
to change your nature.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.450
But there are things that you
can do to get yourself up to

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.700
the top of that range instead of
floating down at the bottom

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.075
part of your range.

00:03:35.075 --> 00:03:38.680
SHAREE: That's definitely
good to know.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.460
You also mentioned in your
first book a concept of a

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.710
happiness formula.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.580
And most people think of
happiness as things that make

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.740
me feel good, and then things
that make me feel bad, and how

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.310
to reduce the ones that make me
feel bad and increase the

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.170
ones that make me feel good.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.380
But you bring up an interesting
point about

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.800
feeling right, and about the
atmosphere of growth.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.560
Which, as an adult, I didn't
really think about.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.450
The feeling right part I
understood to an extent.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.450
But the growth part,

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.280
surprisingly, I missed entirely.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.760
Can you elaborate on these
two aspects and

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.860
why they're so important?

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.485
Well I completely missed
the atmosphere of

00:04:14.485 --> 00:04:16.300
growth at first too.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.149
Because I was trying to come
up with my framework for

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.340
understanding happiness, or
thinking about how I wanted a

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.830
framework where every little
piece fit into the puzzle

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.650
somehow, that there was nothing
left on the floor.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.210
And so I came up with that to
think about happiness you have

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.960
to think about feeling good,
feeling bad, feeling right, in

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.300
an atmosphere of growth.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.630
And atmosphere of growth took
me much longer to identify.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.010
So the feeling good is easy.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.570
You want things that make you
feel full of enthusiasm, and

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.910
love, and fun.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.670
And feeling bad, you want to
get rid of things that make

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.320
you feel angry, or resentful,
or guilty, or jealous.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.670
And then feeling right
is trickier.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.440
Because feeling right is the
feeling that our life reflects

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.470
our values, and that we're
living up to our own idea of

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.520
what we want our life to be.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.820
And this is complicated, because
sometimes the things

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.590
that we do to make ourselves
feel right don't

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.950
make us feel good.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:21.330
For instance I was talking to a
guy to who was one of three

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.820
brothers, adults.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.490
And they were very estranged.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.570
They had a father who was
very nasty, apparently.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.560
To the extent that two of the
sons wouldn't speak to the

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.760
father anymore.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.380
And the father was in the
hospital, and the one son was

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.150
going and visiting him.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.960
And he said the thing
is, it doesn't do

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.440
anything for my happiness.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.560
I hate going, I dread
going, he's mean

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.280
to me when I'm there.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.760
He's been mean to me my whole
life, and yet here I am going.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.050
And I said well it's because
it's making you feel right.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.450
This is your idea of how you
should behave as a son.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.800
And even though it doesn't make
you feel good, it makes

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.910
you feel right.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.940
And sometimes that's important
to happiness as well, even if

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.760
it doesn't translate
into feeling good.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.080
And then atmosphere of growth
is a little bit different.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.140
And this is the feeling that
people are happier when we

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.590
feel like we're growing.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.020
When we're learning something,
when we're changing something

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.140
for the better, when we're
fixing something, when we're

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.580
helping someone.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.650
And it could be something as
simple as cleaning out your

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:16.940
refrigerator--

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.790
can give you that little
feeling of growth.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:21.310
Or learning something new.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.020
I'm sure we've all had the
experience of when you're

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.830
trying to learn something
new and it's incredibly

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:25.370
frustrating.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.780
You feel stupid, you feeling
incompetent.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.730
And yet then when you manage
to grow and you managed to

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:34.450
learn something it's
so satisfying.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.100
And the thing that's nice about
the atmosphere of growth

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.870
is this is really something that
you can deliberately go

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.190
out and pursue.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.240
You can really say to yourself
wow, I'm really in an unhappy

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.050
place in my life.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.150
I have a lot going on that's
making me just feel terrible,

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.680
and I need to find
a way to plug my

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.800
battery into something.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.890
What can I do?

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:55.910
And a way to do it is to seek
the atmosphere of growth.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:02.140
Whether it's getting a pet and
house training your pet, or

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.770
fixing something, or helping an
organization figure out how

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.730
to do their books better, or
helping a friend move, or

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.000
cleaning out your closet,
or learning a

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.300
new software program.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:20.380
This atmosphere of growth is
something that is energizing,

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:25.050
and in a way that's very,
very positive.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.300
However, a lot of times
it does come with this

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.040
unfortunate layer of feeling
stupid, incompetent,

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.660
frustrated, having to
work with annoying

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.440
people, all that stuff.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.700
So you have to accept that
sometimes feeling bad is part

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.820
of happiness.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:42.410
SHAREE: It's also interesting
that the atmosphere of growth

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.410
part is probably something we
need most when we are down.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.710
And that's probably when we
are least likely to even

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.226
attempt it.

00:07:50.226 --> 00:07:51.360
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yes.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.730
Annette, you raise a very
interesting point, which is

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.160
that one of the reasons that
I wanted to do a happiness

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.500
project was that I felt like I
would behave myself better if

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.830
I were happier.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.630
And I find that definitely
to be true.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:09.300
I'm more patient, I'm more
forgiving, I'm less irascible,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.870
I'm more generous when
I'm happier.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:16.290
And studies show that although
happiness has this bad

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.710
reputation, and some people
assume that happy people are

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.010
smug, or superficial,
or stupid.

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.550
Actually, happy people are
more interested in the

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.930
problems of other people, and
more interested in the

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:27.790
problems of the world.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.490
They're more altruistic, they
give away more money, they

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.560
volunteer more time, they're
more likely to help out their

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.530
colleagues and their friends
and their family.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.789
And I think when you are happier
you do you feel more

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:40.250
able to try to do something
that's going to bring you that

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.110
atmosphere of growth even if
there's going to be a lot of

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:46.370
frustration or anxiety
attached to it.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:49.140
But when you're not feeling
happy it can feel overwhelming

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.660
to try to plug into that.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.530
And it's the same thing with
helping other people.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.900
One of the best ways to make
yourself happy is to make

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.340
other people happy.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.370
But sometimes when you're
feeling very unhappy yourself

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.670
you don't have the emotional
wherewithal to do it.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.480
And so even though it would make
you feel better if you

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.270
did it, it's hard to get
yourself to do it.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.830
So I think it's worth
understanding that.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.430
So then if you are an unhappy
place and you feel like oh, I

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:15.540
just I just can't handle the
thought of learning how to do

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.660
something new.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.100
If you say to yourself it's
going to be hard, but in the

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.310
end I'm going to get that
charge, I'm going to get that

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.940
feeling of uplift.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.280
Then maybe that can help
you push yourself.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.410
Because you know that in the and
it's going to be helpful,

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:32.870
especially if you're in
a difficult time.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:36.460
SHAREE: So it's about being
conscious of that behavior?

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.960
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah, I
think it really helps.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.050
SHAREE: Another thing that you
mentioned in your first book

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:44.580
is how "The Happiness Project"
could potentially prepare

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.370
people for when bad things
actually do happen.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:49.960
Would you like to elaborate
on that?

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.860
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah, when I
was writing "The Happiness

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:56.560
Project" I was worried, because
I thought I was a

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.200
pretty happy person
when I started.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.720
And I had a great life, and one
of the things I wanted to

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.620
do was to appreciate it more and
not take it for granted.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.760
And I worried that people who
were facing major happiness

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.020
challenges would find what I
was writing about trivial

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.720
almost to the point
of offensiveness.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.340
I'm talking about make your
bed, and someone else is

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:20.670
thinking about they just lost
two family members to cancer

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.820
in the same month.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.620
And so I was concerned
about that.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:31.320
But what I found is I've heard
from so many people who are in

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.020
these very, very challenging
situations.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.960
And they have made
this point to me.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.230
Which is that one time to do a
happiness project is really

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.980
when you are in a very
challenging situation, and

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.880
you're really struggling to
figure out how can you be as

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.310
happy as you can be under
the circumstances?

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.030
Maybe you can't be happy,
but are you as

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.600
happy as you can be?

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.070
Can you make sure you
get enough sleep?

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.650
Can you make sure that
eat regularly?

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:57.140
Can you make sure that
you see your friends?

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.980
Can you make sure that you give
yourself mental breaks

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:01.430
from whatever the
situation is?

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.160
So that you don't burn
yourself out

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.630
dealing with some crisis.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.540
But then another time to do
it is when everything is

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.310
basically going OK, and you do
have the emotional wherewithal

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:16.790
to try to start a book group,
or start exercising.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:22.530
Or figure out ways so that you
can be yelling at your kids

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:23.500
less or whatever.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.730
And so I think there's a
reason to do it when

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.960
everything's going fine, and
there's a reason to do it when

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.830
really everything is not fine,
and you're just hanging on by

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.240
your fingernails.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:36.090
So it was encouraging for me
to hear that people didn't

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:42.650
find my focus on these very
ordinary little parts of life

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.572
to be deeply annoying,
as I feared.

00:11:46.572 --> 00:11:48.870
SHAREE: Cool.

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.400
You also mention in your book
that it's important to follow

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.810
your true nature.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:55.930
And at the same time you
immediately follow it up by

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.740
saying it's important to also
distinguish between the lack

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.470
of interest and the
fear of failure.

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.010
Now how do you make
that distinction?

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:06.106
Because that's a really
good skill to have.

00:12:06.106 --> 00:12:08.060
GRETCHEN RUBIN: So you put
your finger on the big

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.110
challenges within happiness.

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.200
Because on the one hand, you
want to accept yourself, but

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.620
you also want to expect
more from yourself.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.330
And this is just a
constant tension.

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.170
This is like the tension between
being happy in the

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.640
moment and thinking
about the future.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:27.320
You have to think about
both all the time

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.630
and make your decisions.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.920
There's not one easy
way to do it.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:33.240
I have 12 personal commandments
that I identified

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.430
as part of my happiness
projects.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.470
And the first one is
to be Gretchen.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:41.090
And everyone should feel free to
substitute there own name.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.630
And there's this idea that you
have to be yourself, and to

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.270
know yourself.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:50.510
And part of what's hard about
that is that it's very easy to

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:53.290
think about the way you wish you
were, or the way you think

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.550
you ought to be, or the way
other people want you to be,

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.990
and to lose sight of the
way you really are.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.530
Well like I said, I went
to law school.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.620
I was a lawyer for five
years without even

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.080
thinking about it.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.840
So I really have to remind
myself to be Gretchen.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.390
And one of the questions within
trying to be yourself

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.080
is when are you setting
yourself a task that's

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.330
appropriate for you and is
within your own nature, and is

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.330
pushing you in the right
direction to

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:22.050
expect more from yourself?

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:27.000
And when are you really picking
something for the

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:27.760
wrong reasons?

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.090
Or not because it's really
meaningful to you but it's

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:34.350
related to a fantasy of who you
think you are, or the way

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:35.760
you wish you would be.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.300
And it isn't a natural extension
of your personality.

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:44.760
It's not the right
goal for you.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.710
And those things tend
to be very sterile.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:52.500
It's very easy to burn out, or
to hit a dead end with that.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.330
I recently faced this
with driving.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.730
Is anybody here a
fearful driver?

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:58.930
I'm a fearful driver.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:00.180
OK.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.500
So I grew up in Kansas
City, Missouri.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.430
So I got a driver's license
when I was 16

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:06.400
years old, and I drove.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.050
And when I lived in Washington,
DC, I drove.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.030
But I always a fearful driver.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.000
And my sister lived in LA for
three years before she drove,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.940
so you see where I'm
coming from.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:23.280
And we were living in New York,
and basically any time

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.440
we had to drive my husband
would drive.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.750
To the point where I basically
quit driving.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.590
And we weren't driving
that much.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:33.830
But we were driving to Vermont
to pick up my daughter from

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:37.030
summer camp, and I
was not driving.

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:41.460
And I felt like that was an
unfair burden on my husband.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.960
Because even if he got tired
or had to take a conference

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.990
call or something,
he had to drive.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.460
And, also, I was beginning
to feel like it was

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.330
weighing on my mind.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.110
I started having dreams where
there would be an emergency

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:55.040
and I wouldn't be able to go
because I couldn't drive.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:01.200
And I had to ask myself is
being a fearful driver

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:04.530
something that I should accept
about myself as just being

00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:05.580
part of my true nature?

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.250
And has been true of me for as
long as I can remember, and so

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.830
just accept it?

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:13.570
Or can I expect more from
myself, and deal with this

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:14.750
fear of driving?

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.430
And I so desperately wanted to
believe that I should just

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:19.960
accept it, and not
drive ever again.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.390
But I did decide that it was
something where I could ask

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.150
myself to do it.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:29.110
So now I drive regularly, and I
really do not like driving,

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:30.890
but I do drive.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:34.260
And it's been interesting for
me to hear a lot of people

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.380
have something in their life
that they're afraid to do,

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:39.490
that other people do
without thinking.

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:45.960
Riding a bike, public speaking,
swimming, flying.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.240
These are things, for most
people, it doesn't seem like

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:49.860
it bothers them.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:51.430
And then there's the people
for whom it's really

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.630
difficult, and you really have
to say to yourself, do I want

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.640
to expect of myself?

00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.280
But then there's other
things, like music.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.150
I finally said you know what?

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.670
I don't really like music.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.170
I used to think oh, if I would
just go to concerts, if I

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.360
would read, if I would study
up, if I would sit down and

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.590
listen and concentrate I
would love music too.

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:09.710
And finally, I'm like
you know what?

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:12.120
I'm just don't like
music that much.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.150
And I'm sad about that.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:13.880
I wish I did.

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.430
I see why everybody
else likes it.

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:19.870
And I wish I like it.

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:23.070
I wish I could be Gretchen and
love music, and tap into this

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.960
source of joy that so
many people feel.

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.480
But I finally had to just say
yeah, I got to accept myself.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.020
And it's just not for me.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.140
And now that I don't worry about
loving music I have more

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.460
time to do the things I like.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.740
Like read all the time.

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.660
So its attention to accept
yourself and

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.476
expect more of yourself.

00:16:44.476 --> 00:16:46.730
SHAREE: So along the same lines,
how have you seen your

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:50.350
personality change as you've
gone through the several

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:51.730
happiness projects?

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.860
And obviously you like the
way your personality has

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:55.760
changed, if it has.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.770
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Well
it's interesting.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:00.000
Because when I started I took
one of those tests.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.460
Which, by the way,
drive me crazy.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.670
I hate the tests to tell
how happy you are,

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.390
but I score a seven.

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:07.960
I'm pretty happy.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.839
And most people around the world
will say that they are

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:13.349
pretty happy, or very happy.

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:15.339
So most people are pretty happy,
and I'm pretty happy.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:16.589
So I'm average.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.970
And so the interesting thing
for me is that is, I would

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:23.119
say, is my inborn nature.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:26.099
And if I am lying in bed at
night or I'm on the subway

00:17:26.099 --> 00:17:29.460
with nothing to read, and I'm
just staring out into space, I

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:31.810
am at a seven place.

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.940
More or less, usually.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.200
I'm not in a highly ebullient
person, but I'm not a

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:36.750
melancholic person.

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:38.200
I'm just a seven.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.660
But what has changed as a result
of doing the happiness

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.360
project is that my experience of
my life is so much happier.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.250
I spend so much less time
feeling angry, or

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:48.650
resentful, or bored.

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.520
And I spend so much more time
having fun and doing the

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.260
things I value.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.420
Like not worrying about music.

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:02.570
And so even though you can't
change your inborn nature, you

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:03.940
can change the experience
of your life.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.350
And I think the best example
of this-- which I'm sure

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:07.060
everybody has seen--

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.300
is if you've ever had a job that
you really hated you're

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.870
still yourself.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.260
You're still walking around as
yourself, but your experience

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.550
of your life is very
different.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.940
And then if you get a job that
you love, it's like you're the

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:19.570
same person.

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.950
Probably your life circumstances
haven't changed

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.020
very much, and maybe
not at all.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.760
But your experience of your
life is so much happier

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.870
because you're doing something
that you enjoy.

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.440
So that's what I think
has happened.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.490
I'm the same person.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:32.330
My personality is the same.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:35.280
But I just feel like
my experience

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.590
of my life has changed.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.630
Mostly with things that
didn't take very much

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:45.890
time, energy, or money.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:47.610
There's a lot of low-hanging
fruit.

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:50.336
At least there was in my case.

00:18:50.336 --> 00:18:54.800
SHAREE: So how much of the
recording and tracking of the

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:59.030
goals, and the resolutions
impacts the way you perceive

00:18:59.030 --> 00:18:59.920
your happiness?

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.690
And did it change between the
time you were actually going

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.990
through the project, the 12
months, and then after?

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:06.290
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Well, the
tracking is funny.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:08.030
Because actually,
Marcus Mitchell,

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:08.870
who works at Google--

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:10.700
I just saw him, but he had
to go somewhere else.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.590
When he heard about this he
was like well I think you

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:13.790
should have your husband--

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:15.070
they went to college together--
you should have

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:19.490
Jamie score you on a one to
10 scale twice a day.

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:20.250
Then you'd have a record.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.630
And I'm like yeah, that's
not going to happen.

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.410
Yeah, so there are all these
quantified self, and they're

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:29.230
all people who love to track.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.250
I like to track whether I'm
keeping my resolutions.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:34.180
So I like to track whether I'm
actually sticking to the

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.930
things that I'm doing.

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:37.560
I'm a junkie for gold stars.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.640
So I like checking things
off the list, and

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.670
feeling yes I did it.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.000
So I do it in that way, but I
don't track it in terms of my

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:44.940
happiness level.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.320
Because for me, at least, I
find that to be intensely

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.490
annoying, and actually if I
stand around I think am I

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:53.740
happy right now?

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.980
It sort of dissolves under me.

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.720
I feel like it's more helpful to
think about being happier.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.290
Like is this going to
make me happier?

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.040
Am I happier than I
was a month ago?

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.540
So am I moving in the
right direction?

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.990
So I think about more like that,
are things moving in the

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.470
right direction?

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:14.330
Than what's my actual ranking
right now, or how would I

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:15.110
measure it?

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:20.680
Because I do feel like
that can trip me up.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.760
But accountability for

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.180
following through is important.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.250
And I do think one thing--

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:29.400
when people are thinking about
happiness projects for

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.890
themselves--

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:34.390
one thing I think is helpful to
remember is that it works

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:38.040
better when you think of
change in terms of very

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.810
concrete, very manageable
actions.

00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:45.130
So sometimes people will say
oh my resolution is to get

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.010
more joy out of life.

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:49.170
OK so what does that mean?

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:50.960
I have no idea what
that means.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.730
And the person making that
resolution, I don't think,

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:53.470
really has a good idea.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:55.850
Or I want to be less
stressed out.

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:57.560
OK, why?

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.580
Do you feel like you
need more sleep?

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.020
Do you feel like you never
see your friends?

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.505
Do you feel like you need to
make time to exercise?

00:21:01.505 --> 00:21:05.160
Do you feel like you need to
have time to write a novel?

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.570
Why?

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:08.590
Do you feel like you yell your
kids too much in the morning?

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:09.700
Do you feel like you're
hitting the

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:10.820
snooze button too much?

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.520
Do you feel like you're eating
too much junk food?

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.480
Do you feel like you're always
10 minutes late?

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.830
Do you feel like you're letting
down your colleagues

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.070
because you're always
late with projects?

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.930
What do you mean by
stressed out?

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:24.110
Because once you say what would
you actually change?

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:26.200
Then you can say to yourself
this is what I'm actually

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.250
going to do, and then you know
whether you did it or not.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:31.090
And if you consistently can't do
it maybe you need to set a

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.400
different resolution.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:37.760
Or if you can do it are you
seeing any beneficial change?

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:44.740
Because to bring about change
you really need to figure out

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.720
what would actually
be different?

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:54.980
And not just think about vague
aims without a plan for how

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.420
you could bring them
about in real life.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.730
SHAREE: One of the biggest
things I got from your books

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:00.750
was exactly that.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.890
That happiness can be broken
down into actionable items

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.310
that you evaluate yourself
on, on a daily basis.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:09.890
And in that sense it sounds a
lot like the OKRs we set for

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:12.630
ourselves every quarter.

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:16.370
And I think it makes for a
perfect parallel there.

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:20.340
I actually did start off my
own Happiness Project.

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:25.490
I did pause it for a little
while, but what did come out

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:27.780
of it is that I am participating
for the first

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.030
time in NaNoWritMo.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:34.750
And I am, as of this morning,
6,000 words

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:35.970
away from my 50,000.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:36.800
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Oh my gosh,
congratulations.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.100
SHAREE: Thank you very much.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.690
I see myself completing it
by the end of tomorrow.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:42.210
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Wow,
that's amazing.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:42.780
Well congratulations.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.350
SHAREE: Thank you.

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:48.870
So I'm really hoping that a lot
of you go out there and

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:51.710
look at your OKRs, create
daily ones for yourself.

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:53.150
There's really a lot
that'll can out of

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:54.300
having a happiness project.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.750
OK, so I have more questions
for you.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:59.050
Does anyone here have
any questions?

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:01.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:06.720
SHAREE: Oh, National Novel
Writing Month.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:11.150
So you do 50,000 words
over one month.

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:13.510
Doing about 1700 a day.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.560
I skipped a few, so I'm
a little behind.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:19.770
But I'm 6,000 words away from
getting to the 50,000.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:21.820
It doesn't have to be a fully
coherent novel, really.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.350
It's really just
about writing.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.220
It's to get you through
the creative block.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:26.871
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:26.871 --> 00:23:28.210
SHAREE: Yes, exactly.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.990
I mean no one's expecting
to get theirs published.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:31.430
GRETCHEN RUBIN: If you're
interested, there's a book

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.920
called "No Plot No Problem"
by Chris Baty where

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.160
he lays this out.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.590
National Novel Writing Month
is when everybody--

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.070
November is the month.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:43.330
Importantly, because it has 31
days, you have an extra day.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:44.300
That people do it.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.000
And there's screenwriting month,
blog starting, there's

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.200
a lot of offshoots.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:53.080
But I did it just in my own
month reading the book.

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.050
But it's really if you're ever
attracted to kind of a boot

00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:02.410
camp start for something, it's
a way to just, like you say,

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:07.990
get your creativity going by
just consistent productivity.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.430
and it's so much fun.

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.260
It's really, really fun.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:15.150
I mean something like "The Great
Gatsby" was only like

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.040
60, or 70,000 words long.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.950
So if you write 50,000
words in a month,

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:20.710
that's a good start.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:22.450
But anyway, I really recommend
"No Plot No Problem".

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.010
Because it goes through the
theory of how you should think

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.290
about editing, how you should
think about outlining in

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:30.170
preparation, and how this is
meant to spur creativity.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:31.910
Like why you would
do it this way.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.500
But it's tons of fun.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:34.830
SHAREE: Yeah, and you mentioned
in your book.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:36.320
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yes, I did.

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.975
I really enjoyed it.

00:24:37.975 --> 00:24:40.210
SHAREE: So how long did the
habits you developed during

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.900
the Happiness Project last once
you stopped doing the

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.140
check marks?

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.460
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Well, I still
do almost everything that I

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.980
did, because they all
make me happier.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:50.950
And I'm less happy when
I break them.

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:55.210
So for the most part either I
abandoned them right away,

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:57.790
like the gratitude journal,
which drove me crazy.

00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:01.330
Though many people love
a gratitude journal.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:04.500
Almost everything I do and more,
way more, even than I

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:09.240
write about in both
of the books.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.680
For me it's a way of thinking
about the way I behave that's

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.040
very, very helpful.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.410
But it was helpful to do the
charts where I would check it

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:21.120
off, because that kind of
accountability also is helpful

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.710
because sometimes you want to
do something, or you want to

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:25.570
make a change, and it just
falls out of your mind.

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:27.020
You just don't think about it.

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.660
Except for a couple
times a week.

00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.480
And so just even by reviewing
them once a day that helped me

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:33.730
keep them active in my mind.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.220
So for instance, now if I'm in
a conversation and I start to

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:42.310
gossip I may continue to
gossip, I may break the

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:44.710
resolution because it's hard not
to gossip, because it's so

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:45.410
fun to gossip.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.570
But the sirens are going off,
are the horns are blaring

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:51.230
being hey, that's a
resolution here.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:52.460
Are you going to break
your resolution?

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:52.950
Are you going to go?

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:54.660
You're right up the line,
are you going to go?

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:58.250
So I don't forget about
it, and do it.

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:01.360
I'm aware whether
I am or am not.

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:03.970
Under-react to a problem, that's
one of my resolutions.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:07.350
And sometimes I just take it
all the way up to 11, but I

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:11.540
know that's what I'm doing,
and usually I regret it,

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:13.670
because it's better
to under-react.

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:15.880
But it's always in my mind that
there is a resolution

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.310
there that I am either
keeping or breaking.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:21.250
SHAREE: So something about the
initial checking off process

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:22.780
really helps you get
those things in

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:22.890
your mind and ingrained?

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.300
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Just to
reinforce it, yeah.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:26.850
Actually my next book--

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:28.220
speaking of habits--

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.500
is going to be all
about habits.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.070
Because I realize that habits
are really the prequel to a

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.630
happiness project.

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:34.850
Because if you have good
habits it's so much

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:36.390
easier to be happy.

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:40.300
And if you have bad habits
it's a stumbling block.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.760
So the idea of how do you get
yourself in the habit of doing

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.445
anything is something that I am
now completely obsessed by.

00:26:47.445 --> 00:26:48.555
SHAREE: That sounds
fascinating.

00:26:48.555 --> 00:26:49.300
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Stay tuned.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:50.990
SHAREE: Cool.

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:54.830
So one mantra you repeat often
in your book is that you can

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:57.870
only change your behavior
and not that of others.

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.740
And I'm sure that all of the
resolutions you set for

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.460
yourself reflect that.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.090
And why is it that important?

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:07.080
It also screams unfair.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.330
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah, well, it
is a sad truth of happiness

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:12.890
that the only person you
can change is yourself.

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:17.880
Because it's so easy to think
I would be happier if other

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:20.810
people would behave properly.

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.160
And to have a long list of
resolutions for other people

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.840
to follow, perfectly
reasonable.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.360
But it doesn't work like that.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.280
Alas, you can only
take yourself.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:33.180
But I did find that when I
change the atmosphere around

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:33.890
me changes.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:37.450
And when I change, a
relationship changes.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:40.630
And very often I was able to
bring about larger changes

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:43.230
just by thinking about what I
could do differently, or how I

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:44.480
could change.

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:49.570
And sometimes people say to me
well I really wanted to do a

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:52.590
happiness project, but my
spouse doesn't want to.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:55.260
Or my roommates don't want
to, or whatever.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:57.430
And the fact is nobody--

00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:00.950
my husband, he doesn't even make
New Year's resolutions.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:03.150
I mean he would never do
something like this.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:04.280
It's just not his nature.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.980
I mean he feels like a martyr
to happiness at this point.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.160
But you don't need to.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.690
It's not something where
you need other people's

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:12.330
cooperation.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:16.290
Because really it is something
that is all about what can you

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:17.540
do differently?

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.360
Sometimes I think you can all
agree to do something

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:28.070
differently, but I think it
should be the rare exception.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:34.570
Rather than thinking that
handing out ideas for other

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:37.830
people, or thinking about how
other people should change to

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:44.332
bring about change it's
just not possible.

00:28:44.332 --> 00:28:49.480
SHAREE: There's an interesting
and sad fact that you mention

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.690
in your second book.

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:55.280
It says that research found
that perceived time passes

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:58.220
more quickly as you
grow older.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.250
And I think that ties back to
what you mentioned earlier

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:04.950
about growth, and a rich
and vivid experience.

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:05.850
Can you tell us more?

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:07.960
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah, it's this
very interesting thing

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.770
that, as people grow older--

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:11.860
and I'm sure everybody's
experienced this-- that your

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:14.270
perception of time changes.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:17.940
And so looking back at your
life, the first 21 years will

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:21.600
be much will seem like it took
a much bigger percentage of

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.810
your existence.

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:26.960
And it narrows as
you get older.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.500
So between 60 and 80 is much
less than it actually is in

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.090
terms of where it is
on the pie chart.

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:35.440
And one of the things you can do
to counter this is that if

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.260
you do something very novel
and challenging, your

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:40.580
experience of time slows.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:42.900
Because there's so much new
information that you're

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:43.750
processing.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:46.350
And I remember a friend of mine
saying that he was really

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:48.490
happy when he and his
wife had a baby.

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:50.490
He said because life was rushing
by so quickly, but

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.960
when she was born it was
like time stood still.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.380
And her first month of life felt
like two or three years.

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.620
And when I was working at the
Federal Communications

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.590
Commission it was so intense.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:03.050
There was so much going on, it
was so new, there were so many

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:04.230
people, there was so
much that I had

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:05.920
never experienced before.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.540
I mean I was only there
for 14 months.

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.770
But it feels like as
long as law school,

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:10.710
which was three years.

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:13.960
Because law school was pretty
familiar, and one year was

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.390
pretty much like the next.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:16.950
Whereas this was a whole
different thing.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:19.110
Or the time when
I was clerking.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:21.490
It just felt like so
much was happening

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:22.500
because it was so new.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.940
And I've been thinking about
this a lot for myself, for my

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:25.750
own Happiness Project.

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:29.260
Because I feel like time is
going by so quickly, and I

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.000
don't like it.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.080
I don't like this feeling that
everything is racing by.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.520
So I keep thinking, well, what
can I do to shake myself up?

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.790
But the problem is I
don't want a new

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:37.990
career, I love my career.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.250
I don't want to have
another baby.

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.020
And I already have two children,
so it wouldn't even

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:43.585
be that novel and challenging
probably, for these purposes.

00:30:43.585 --> 00:30:45.100
It would have other
advantages, but it

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.100
wouldn't with this.

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:49.570
I don't want to move, I want
to live in New York City.

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:51.770
I don't even want to live
five blocks away from

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:52.790
where I live now.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:53.600
So I'm trying to think.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.960
And there's really nothing that
I want to do, like to

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.230
learn to speak French.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:59.150
I don't really want to learn
to speak French.

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:01.120
I wish I wanted to learn to
speak French, but be Gretchen

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.620
and don't waste your time
learning to speak French.

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:05.160
So I've been really struggling
with this.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.690
One of things about starting a
blog that was amazing for me--

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:11.060
which I didn't really know that
this was going to happen,

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.880
but it did serve that
function for me.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.190
Because I had never done
anything like that before.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:16.400
I didn't know anything
about it.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.350
And so it was huge,
it was new.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.250
It was this whole new
identity for me.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.080
A whole new group of people that
I was hanging out with, a

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.960
whole new skill that I added.

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.950
And that really did
enrich that time.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.300
But now I feel like it's
become part of me

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.780
and part of my day.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:32.170
It doesn't serve that novel
and challenging function.

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:35.230
So I've really been thinking
well what could I do?

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:36.360
Like get a pet?

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.830
I don't want a dog.

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:38.360
I don't know.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.830
So any suggestions I welcome.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:43.570
Because there is something about
the atmosphere of growth

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:46.080
that serves this function
of making life

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.630
more rich, more dense.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:49.075
Probably moving to a
foreign country.

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:53.910
And the more foreign,
the better.

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:58.700
The more dense and rich that
experience would be.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.275
And like I said I don't even
want to leave my neighborhood.

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.690
But there's got to be other
ways to do that.

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:09.030
So that's something that I'm
thinking about, because it's a

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:10.250
very real aspect of life.

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:12.470
And it is something that
we can affect.

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:16.050
SHAREE: You also talk about
unscheduled free time.

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:18.690
And you say that it's very
important for children, for

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.470
creativity, and other
such things.

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:21.895
How about for adults?

00:32:21.895 --> 00:32:23.540
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Absolutely,
but I would say maybe

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:24.980
scheduling free time.

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:27.910
Scheduling unscheduled time,
as paradoxical as that is.

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:29.830
You need to schedule
unscheduled time.

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:33.680
And I'm sure that I am talking
to the people who suffer from

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.980
this, which is this feeling
like everything is flowing

00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:38.120
into everything else.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.450
Either you are working, or you
could be working, or you

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:41.170
should be working.

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:43.700
Or maybe you're kind of working
and you're not really

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.640
at leisure, because you know
you could be working or you

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.890
should be working.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.960
But then there's a lot of
times when you could be

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.000
working, or should be working.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.590
And you're even at work,
but you're not working.

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:55.930
But that doesn't feel
like leisure.

00:32:55.930 --> 00:33:02.810
And to think about giving
yourself a quitting time.

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:04.580
It used to be nine
to five, right?

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.070
Five o'clock was
quitting time.

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:07.930
That doesn't happen anymore.

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:11.640
We all walk around with a
cubicle in our pocket.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.030
So what I do is every day, and
every day it's a different

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:16.790
time because my schedule is
very different every day.

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:20.560
Is I say this time
is quitting time.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.020
And after quitting time,
I don't work anymore.

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.990
I don't check my email.

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:27.305
I don't work.

00:33:27.305 --> 00:33:30.150
And I try not even to do like
household tasks, because I

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:32.180
want it to be leisure time.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:34.000
And it's really important.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.830
Or maybe on the weekend you'll
say from 11 to two is

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:40.200
playtime, and I'm going to
do just what I feel like.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.640
I have a friend who's
a novelist.

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:47.340
And on Sundays he does not
even read nonfiction.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:48.490
He only reads novels.

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:50.130
Which is his work but
also his play.

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:52.670
But he doesn't do any work,
and he won't even read the

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:55.720
newspaper or read a biography.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:59.140
Because he wants to have
total playtime.

00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.260
And then people use freedom.

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:06.250
People have all different ways
of figuring out how to break

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:07.720
free, and to give themselves
free time.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.429
But I think there's sort of
a feeling like I will just

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:13.100
spontaneously have fun
in my free time.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.770
Or I'll do that when I
have some free time.

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:17.710
But you don't have any free
time, like for 10 years.

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:20.460
So if you want to have a
sense of leisure you

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:23.239
have to build it in.

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:27.120
Force yourself to wander,
make time.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:30.370
My daughter is in second grade
and they have choice time.

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:32.710
And I love the idea
of choice time.

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:35.480
Because you can just choose
whatever you want to do.

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:39.310
But I think some people go weeks
and months maybe without

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:42.030
really having choice time.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:46.179
They're just picking
between duty and

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:48.190
sort of the bad trance.

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:49.614
You know the bad trance.

00:34:49.614 --> 00:34:52.030
When you're clicking around
the internet, or watching

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:55.620
television, or flipping through
a magazine that you're

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:58.450
not even that interested in, or
you're eating in front of

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:02.710
the refrigerator, and you're
in the bad trance.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:03.900
Usually, if you're in the
bad trance it means you

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.120
should go to bed.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.290
The bad trance is a sign
of being too tired.

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:11.480
So always go to sleep if you're
in the bad trance.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.590
SHAREE: Bad trance sounds a
lot like trading long-term

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:17.652
happiness for short.

00:35:17.652 --> 00:35:20.320
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Well
that's another

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.700
tension within happiness.

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.680
Which is thinking about what
makes you happy in the moment,

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.430
and thinking about what's
going to make you

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:28.520
happy in the future.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.220
I did the bad trance
is sort of neither.

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.750
It's not very satisfying in the
present, and it certainly

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:33.780
doesn't pay off in the future.

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:34.395
SHAREE: It's even worse?

00:35:34.395 --> 00:35:37.290
GRETCHEN RUBIN: And so if you're
in the bad trance, or

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:38.640
you notice that you're spending
a lot of time in bad

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:43.870
trance you need to think about
what could I do differently?

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:47.730
Either to have more short-term
pleasure by just doing

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:51.270
something that's going to be
more fun in the moment, or by

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:53.440
thinking about how I could use
my time in a way that's going

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.770
to pay off more in the end.

00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:56.760
Because the thing is, a lot of
times, the things that payoff

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:58.660
the most in the end
are a lot of work.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:01.340
Like let's say you were going
to plan a big holiday party.

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.610
I mean it's a lot of errands,
it's a lot of planning, it's a

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:06.230
lot of tidying up the house.

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:11.090
There's a lot of parts of it
that are not that much fun.

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:13.700
But in the end that's the kind
of thing that's going to bring

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:14.580
you a lot of happiness.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:18.990
And so it's better to spend an
hour doing party planning

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:22.520
chores than it is to spend that
hour in the bad trance.

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.990
Even though at the moment that
you're doing it it feels

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:29.220
mildly diverting.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:34.210
SHAREE: I try to distinguish
between the two by the fact

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:37.000
that one leaves you
with memories,

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:37.830
and the other doesn't.

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:42.900
So you might watch a whole
series of something on Hulu.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.310
And at the moment you're
enjoying it.

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:47.950
But when you look back three
weeks later you don't even

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:49.470
remember that you
really did it.

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:51.290
GRETCHEN RUBIN: That
is a great test.

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:52.900
Because I think about energy.

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.960
Like is something energizing
or draining?

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:58.170
But memories is a very
good thing too.

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.210
Though now that's making me call
into question my ambition

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:05.920
to watch all of Homeland within
the next couple weeks.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.790
But I think that's a
really good point.

00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:11.830
Is it something that is
going to be adding?

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:14.060
Or is it just something that's
so ephemeral that you're not

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.070
even going to remember
that you did it.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:17.670
And then the other test
is the energy.

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:20.150
Do you walk away from it
feeling energized?

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:23.531
Or do you walk away from
it feeling drained?

00:37:23.531 --> 00:37:25.830
SHAREE: One other thing
that you mention--

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:28.630
it's also a sad fact, and it's
in your second book.

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:32.300
It says that small children
laugh about 400 times, and

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:35.350
adults laugh about
17 times a day.

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:37.410
And I saw, and I was just
shaking my head.

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:39.000
And it's very true though.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.070
So since you became aware of
this fact have you noticed

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:43.100
yourself laughing more?

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.985
And what do you do to fix it?

00:37:45.985 --> 00:37:48.330
GRETCHEN RUBIN: I'm sure you can
tell this, but I'm a very

00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:52.470
tightly-wound irritable
type personality.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:56.820
And I can take it to 11,
like in a flash.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:58.170
I have this thing,
my mean face.

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:00.540
Which apparently is this
Medusa-like terrifying mean

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.340
face that I make.

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.840
And so many, many of my
resolutions are aimed at

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.840
trying to be more lighthearted,
more calm, more

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.840
patient, more fun, taking
time for projects.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.770
Again it comes back to
this idea of time.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:16.350
Taking time to be silly, not
constantly walking around

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:20.460
marching, or barking out orders,
or crossing things off

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:21.050
the to-do list.

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:22.490
But to make time to have
fun, and to goof

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:24.120
around and be silly.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:29.320
So that kind of fact really did
make me focus on how can I

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.430
be more fun?

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:33.850
And it's interesting just
talking in a workplace.

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:37.620
There's a lot of studies showing
that just having fun

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.710
in the workplace is important,
and levity.

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:42.600
There's an interesting book
called "The Levity Effect".

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.470
And by levity, it doesn't it
mean people are cracking jokes

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:45.490
and actually being funny.

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:49.330
Because actually being
funny is hard.

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:52.250
But people can be lighthearted,
and they can see

00:38:52.250 --> 00:38:54.260
the funny side, especially
when things go wrong.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:57.780
Or they can under-react to
problems, or they can have a

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:03.390
sense of just laughing, and
a sense of lightness.

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:04.820
That is a social lubricant.

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.280
It helps people work with
difficult personalities, that

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.670
helps people deal with anxieties
and tensions.

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:11.950
And so it really is worth
something that.

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:14.650
And also if you're in a conflict
with somebody, if you

00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:20.260
can not make sarcastic asides,
which is the worst

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:20.840
thing you can do.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.150
But if you can find a way to
joke about it or to relieve

00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:27.550
the tension it's really,
really helpful.

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:33.380
If you're in a bad place it's
very hard to see the funny

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.490
side, and to be lighthearted.

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:37.320
But it really, really helps.

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:40.120
And so to think about how to
get more laughing, and more

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:43.460
joking around, and
more playing, it

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.340
makes your life happier.

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:46.830
And I think it also makes
you more effective

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:49.555
in almost any realm.

00:39:49.555 --> 00:39:50.710
SHAREE: That's going to know.

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:54.690
Try to beat 17.

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:55.390
Any questions?

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:56.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:59.355 --> 00:40:01.020
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Or we can just
repeat the question.

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.517
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK, great.

00:40:05.511 --> 00:40:08.505
What was my question now?

00:40:08.505 --> 00:40:11.000
I loved your book,
your first book.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.010
I'm one of these goal-setting
people too.

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:18.290
And I was fascinated/
overwhelmed by the fact that

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:21.840
you added a new goal
every month.

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:22.712
Am I correct?

00:40:22.712 --> 00:40:25.310
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Yeah, Yeah.

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:31.420
AUDIENCE: So after the year was
over, how much did you end

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.996
up actually holding onto them?

00:40:33.996 --> 00:40:35.046
What were the most
important ones?

00:40:35.046 --> 00:40:37.810
GRETCHEN RUBIN: So the question
is everything was

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:40.530
cumulative, so at the end of
the whole thing with both

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:42.240
projects how much
did I hang onto?

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.190
I mean the fact I do almost
all of it still.

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:46.740
Because it really all
makes me happier.

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:48.810
And most of the things don't
take a lot of time

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:50.670
or energy to do.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:53.460
I mean there's kind of this
mental work of deciding to do

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:57.370
it, and sticking to it, but
they don't-- so almost

00:40:57.370 --> 00:41:00.470
everything I do.

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:02.000
Now, I mean, I did it in a very

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.350
over-the-top way, clearly.

00:41:03.350 --> 00:41:05.350
So the idea is I'm trying
out all these things so

00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:06.150
you don't have to.

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:09.960
So most people are not doing
like 100, 200 resolutions a

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:12.230
day the way I am.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:14.593
But I think they're
reinforcing.

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:20.100
I mean I'm very conscious of the
fact that I'm happier when

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.400
I behave a certain
way, or when I

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.070
follow certain practices.

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:26.300
And so then that also helps
me feel motivated

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:26.850
to stick with it.

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:30.600
Because I know that it actually
has an effect, and

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:31.830
really does make me happier.

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:34.045
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:34.045 --> 00:41:36.320
GRETCHEN RUBIN: OK, so this is
funny that you ask that,

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:40.570
because so many people are
like OK is that for real?

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:41.510
Do you still have
the empty shelf?

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:44.780
So for "Happier at Home" I did
this behind-the-scenes video,

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:45.640
which was so much fun.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:48.310
And I showed some of the
things that I talk

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:49.080
about in the book.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.610
Just for fun, it was just
this little fun

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:52.240
extra that I created.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.590
And one of the things that
I show is my empty shelf,

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:57.060
because so many people ask
about the empty shelf.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:00.230
And the fact is it
sounds so weird.

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:02.880
Like why does it matter to
have an empty shelf?

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:07.790
And yet it really catches
people's imagination.

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:11.140
And so many people have told
me how much they love their

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:12.280
empty shelf.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.440
There is something
about that space.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.810
Making that space, holding that

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:20.270
space, having that margin.

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:23.700
Thoreau said I love having a
broad margin to my life.

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:26.850
And there's something about an
empty shelf that gives you

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:28.770
that feeling of having
a margin.

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:30.570
Especially think in someplace
like New York City where you

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:34.860
feel like every little inch has
to have an Ikea thing, so

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:37.070
you can cram as much stuff
in there as possible.

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:39.330
It's nice just to have your
empty shelf, you're like I got

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:41.660
plenty of room, I got
my empty shelf.

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.720
SHAREE: And why do you
think the physical

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:44.955
environment is so important?

00:42:44.955 --> 00:42:47.210
GRETCHEN RUBIN: This
is a mystery to me.

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:51.180
I'm constantly astonished why
it is that outer order

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:53.900
contributes to inner calm to
the degree that it does.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.970
It just doesn't seem like it
should matter that much.

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:59.220
And yet, I feel-- and over and
over people have told me that

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:00.490
they feel the same way.

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:03.550
That there is something about
creating outer order that

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:07.080
makes people feel calmer and
more energetic, more creative,

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:09.830
more in control of their life.

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:13.270
And of all the resolutions when
people tell me oh I did a

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:14.270
happiness project.

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:15.640
I say what did you do?

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:16.900
What did you do to be
happier at home?

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:18.740
Or what did you do to boost
your happiness?

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:20.070
This is the number
one resolution.

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:22.020
And I'm not saying this is the
most significant resolution

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:22.770
you could do.

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:25.000
I'm just saying this seems to
be like the gateway drug

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.550
resolution.

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:29.790
The resolution to
make your bed.

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:32.980
How many people here regularly
make their bed?

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.620
Not that many.

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.930
How many people make their bed
in a hotel room on the morning

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:38.700
they check out?

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:39.490
All right.

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:42.240
OK, we will talk later.

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:46.670
There's something about these
little cleaning off your

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:49.470
desks, filing things, cleaning
out your inbox.

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:52.740
I know woman who told me she
throws away every single thing

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:55.250
in her refrigerator
on January 1.

00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:56.100
It's like inbox 0.

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.210
She just wants everything
gone.

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:01.520
No even half-full bottle
of ketchup.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:05.760
There's something about outer
order, clear surfaces, empty

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:10.650
shelves that helps people feel
calmer and more creative.

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:12.474
SHAREE: You had a question?

00:44:12.474 --> 00:44:13.724
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:25.020
are you more happy or
less happy when

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.210
surround by happier people?

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:26.700
That's one.

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:29.540
And then does it make
you happier to make

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:30.702
other people happy?

00:44:30.702 --> 00:44:32.840
GRETCHEN RUBIN: So the question
is are you happier if

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:34.300
you're around happier people?

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:37.640
And does it make you happy
to make others happy?

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.300
There's something called
emotional contagion.

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:44.870
And that's the term for it,
because we literally infect

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:46.570
each other with our emotions.

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:49.400
And so happy people help
make people happy.

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.480
And so if you're around
happier people

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.130
you will feel a lift.

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:57.750
Unfortunately bad is stronger
than good, and negative

00:44:57.750 --> 00:45:00.040
emotions are more catching
than positive emotions.

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:02.700
So if you're around people with
negative emotions you

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:05.420
will also pick that
up very quickly,

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:06.710
probably even more quickly.

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:09.880
And we pick up these emotions
from each other in seconds.

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:11.600
You could pick it up over the
phone, you could pick up just

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:12.580
by looking at a photograph.

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:14.690
So there's this constant
change of emotions that

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:15.650
happens all the time.

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:18.890
So being around happier people
will definitely help you be

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:20.850
happier yourself.

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:23.660
And then your next question was
does it make you happy to

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:24.910
make other people happy?

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.020
I have eight splendid truths
about happiness, and this is

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:34.360
my second splendid truth, which
is a two-part truth.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:37.410
One of the best ways to make
yourself happy is to make

00:45:37.410 --> 00:45:39.040
other people happy.

00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:43.340
And this is one of the nicest
things about human nature.

00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:44.930
One of the best ways to make
yourself happy is to make

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:45.900
other people happy.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:48.570
And some people argue that
this is a criticism.

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:51.290
Like well no one can be truly
altruistic, because if you do

00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:52.310
something nice for
somebody else you

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:53.460
just feel good yourself.

00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:56.546
Like, oh, well then
forget about it.

00:45:56.546 --> 00:45:59.490
I'm like this is the greatest
thing ever.

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:02.150
I mean nothing makes me happier
than seeing me do

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:03.820
something virtuous.

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:07.560
And the fact that I find that
that makes me happy is good.

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:10.950
So I see that is a positive
effect of human nature, not

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:16.650
something that makes altruistic
behavior less

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:19.190
admirable, or less laudable.

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:21.710
But that's the first part of
the second splendid truth.

00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:23.900
And I think the second part of
the second splendid truth is

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:26.580
also worth thinking about.

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:29.430
So one of the best ways to make
yourself happy is to make

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:30.480
other people happy.

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:33.760
And one of the best ways to make
other people happy is to

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.110
be happy yourself.

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:36.960
And that gets to your
first point.

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:40.280
Which is that a lot of times
we're more able to help other

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:43.320
people be happy when we
are happier ourselves.

00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:46.660
Both because of emotional
contagion, that we help them.

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:49.130
And also back to what I was
saying before is I think when

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:50.530
we're happy we have
the emotional

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:51.780
wherewithal to turn outwards.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:58.410
It is not selfish to want to be
happier, because if it is

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:01.100
we should be selfish, if only
for selfless reasons.

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:05.960
Because it's by being happier
ourselves that we give

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:09.720
ourselves the wherewithal
to think about others.

00:47:12.648 --> 00:47:14.112
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:14.112 --> 00:47:15.881
First of all I think you're
really awesome, I'm a huge fan

00:47:15.881 --> 00:47:16.064
of your writing.

00:47:16.064 --> 00:47:16.980
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Oh,
well thank you.

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:19.615
AUDIENCE: So obviously you've
done a ton of research, and

00:47:19.615 --> 00:47:22.637
experience, and growing over
the past several years.

00:47:22.637 --> 00:47:25.306
So what is the one thing you
wish you would have known five

00:47:25.306 --> 00:47:25.702
or ten years ago?

00:47:25.702 --> 00:47:28.736
Or one thing you'd go back and
tell your younger self that

00:47:28.736 --> 00:47:30.642
you think would have improved
your happiness?

00:47:30.642 --> 00:47:33.160
GRETCHEN RUBIN: So the question
is knowing what I

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:36.440
know now, what would I go back
to the past and tell myself?

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:38.740
I would take it back to that
point that I made earlier

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:41.820
about be Gretchen.

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:43.210
That's another splendid truth.

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:46.720
Is we can build a happy life
only on the foundation of our

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:50.060
own nature, our own values,
and our own interests.

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:53.980
And I'm just one of these people
who spent a lot of time

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:58.370
thinking or being swayed by the
way I thought I ought to

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:00.670
be, or the way I wish I were,
the way other people thought I

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:03.260
ought to be.

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:08.450
And I think that it's really by
trying to figure out well

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:09.350
is this right for me?

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:10.370
Is this something
that I value?

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:11.520
Is this something I'm
interested in?

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:12.770
Does this reflect my nature?

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:17.880
I wish I'd thought about that
much harder, much earlier.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.270
Everything ended
up fine for me.

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:20.355
I mean that's the thing
about drift.

00:48:20.355 --> 00:48:21.570
Drifting into something
like law school.

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:22.750
Sometimes it works out fine.

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:24.180
And that's dangerous right?

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:25.940
Because that's what makes it
even more tricky, because

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:27.780
maybe it'll all work
out in the end.

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:29.450
Don't count on it.

00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:30.750
So it all worked out.

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:32.480
I'm glad, I'm happy
about everything

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:33.140
that happened to me.

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:35.340
But I didn't do it mindfully,
I didn't do it as an

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:38.310
expression of what was
true about me.

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:41.240
And I wish that I had
done if for that.

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.146
Yeah?

00:48:42.146 --> 00:48:43.676
AUDIENCE: It seems like you
really good about being

00:48:43.676 --> 00:48:46.190
systematic about things.

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:49.030
What ways would you go about
thinking about a framework or

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:53.170
discovering what those things
are if you're not super clear

00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:53.490
about them?

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:55.340
GRETCHEN RUBIN: That is
an excellent question.

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:57.120
And in fact, for this new book
that I'm working on about

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.090
habits I have this section that
I'm working on that's

00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:01.140
called quiz for self
knowledge.

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:03.580
And it's just every time I think
about a question that I

00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:05.800
think you need to ask-- like are
you a morning person or a

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:06.640
night person?

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:08.910
This is really important
to know.

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:10.470
Are you an abstainer
or moderator?

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:12.700
Which is something I talk
about in my book.

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:17.560
Are you spurred on by
competition, or are you

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:21.180
unspurred on by competition?

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:25.130
Do you feel very
self conscious?

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:26.610
There's a lot of questions.

00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:30.820
So it's a very, very large
issue, and I've been thinking

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:35.620
about how to systematically
figure out how would you

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:38.920
figure that out without spending
thousands of dollars

00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:41.420
in therapy?

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:44.440
So I don't have an easy question
other than to just

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:47.550
constantly ask that, but I do
feel like I'm trying to

00:49:47.550 --> 00:49:50.030
identify sets of questions.

00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:54.540
So to help spur that kind
of self reflection.

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:58.040
For me I find that it's from
reading other people.

00:49:58.040 --> 00:49:59.420
Like reading Samuel Johnson,
which is why

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:01.230
mention him in my subtitle.

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:02.860
When I read Samuel Johnson
I feel like I

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:03.780
understand myself better.

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:06.090
He just says things and I'm
like, OK, I get it.

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:09.960
Somehow he's able to shine
a spotlight that helps me

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:10.750
understand myself.

00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:14.480
So often by reading I feel like
some things resonate, but

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:18.830
it seems like there should be
other ways to do it too.

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:20.520
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
all we have time for,

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:21.295
thank you very much.

00:50:21.295 --> 00:50:24.060
GRETCHEN RUBIN: Well thank you,
this was so much fun.

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:25.310
Thank you Sharee.
