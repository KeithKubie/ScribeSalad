00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
Don't you love it when someone who rejected you comes crawling back?

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.620
(demonic music) HALLO, IT'S ME! I'M BACK! HALLO!

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.320
You've been waiting months for this.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.120
Years even.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.480
DECADES if your cold black heart is cold and black enough.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.500
And then,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.380
Out of the blue,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.380
You hear that sweet, sweet bloop

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.380
(phone notification rings)

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:29.680
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.480
Look how the tables,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.300
Have turned.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.360
(dramatic bang)

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.840
You know, they say revenge is a dish best served cold

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.120
And I assume that this is because when you're first slighted,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.480
You were probably eating a lot of ice cream.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.460
(crying voice) One day,

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.860
Yer gonna come crawling back to me

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.020
Yooh see (you'll see)

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.800
Hnlp.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.100
I'm calling it right now!

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.500
Yngenna come (you're gonna come),

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.440
Anysngena text me outta buu (and you're gonna text me out of the blue)

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.820
Ann den (and then)

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.780
AH maneven (my revenge)

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.980
Yu'll see! Okay? I told you so!

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.800
I told you so!

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:01.920
(choking noise) x2

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.420
(sniff)

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.640
Aye wubb (I know)

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.420
I'm nice.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.240
I had this guy who had been like a mega asshole to me

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.160
Reach out and say

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.840
Mega asshole: "Hey! let's get together!"

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.980
"I miss you!"

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.400
"It's been a while!"

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.180
And I just couldn't stop that smug sense of satisfaction

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.700
that over came my entire being

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.540
Because three years ago,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.320
We were kinda dating each other,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.420
Kinda seeing each other,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.260
Made out a few times

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.500
And he was gonna move to a different state.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.660
So I said:

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.840
Oh man...

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.860
You're moving?

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.700
...wanna go to lunch?

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.400
My treat.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.260
It will be like our little going away party.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.440
(text sent notification)

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.620
(text notification) Mega asshole: "Nah. See you never."

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.780
Yup.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.720
"See you never."

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.040
HA!

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.800
HA, HA!

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.900
Well it's three years later, bro!

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.720
And guess who wants to see me now?

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.060
So you know what I said?

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.260
Dude, I don't care about you no more

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.660
It's been three years

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.720
Get outta here

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.400
(snicker)

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.100
Ignored

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.720
The "I told you so" in my heart was enough

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.360
But it just sucks when someone disses you that hard but then eventually comes back

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.920
It's like,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.460
You don't even care anymore, right?

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.700
Like, you've had enough time to just completely move on

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.200
I just wished my past-self who was like, eating all that ice cream and crying

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.240
Could look into the future at this moment

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.560
and have her, her just like, her up most righteousness

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.880
But that's not the way that life works, right?

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.920
And look, not everyone who disses you or rejects you is eventually gonna come crawling back

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.420
But,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.300
It's always a possibility

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.120
And I know I should say that you should be the bigger person

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.680
And everyone has their own journey

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.100
And you should try to understand that and learn to forgive and forget

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.600
But,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.200
I'm not gonna say that

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.140
I'm gonna say,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.360
Enjoy that sweet, sweet feeling that you won

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.080
Because you did

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.340
And I'm a petty motherfucker.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.320
I'm Anna Akana.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.580
Stay Awesome, Gotham.
