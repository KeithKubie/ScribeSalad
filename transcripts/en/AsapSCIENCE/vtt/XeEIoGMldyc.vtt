00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.990
More than 10 million sports related injuries
occur in the world every year. To avoid this,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.869
athletes and coaches alike are using a variety
of pre-competition techniques to decrease

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.990
injuries and increase performance. But, what
does science tell us about stretching and

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.949
"warming-up"?

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.820
Many studies have looked at how stretching
can affect athletic performance, and it turns

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.090
out...it depends on the activity! Sports such
as figure skating and snowboarding, which

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.730
require a wide range of motions to impress
the judges, certainly benefit from an athlete's

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.890
flexibility. But for power sports like speed
skating and bobsledding, too much stretching

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.070
may actually cause a temporary decrease in
muscle strength. The overstretched muscle

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.829
becomes less responsive and can stay weakened
for up to 30 minutes.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.989
Although athletic competitions can be strenuous,
there is little evidence to suggest that stretching

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.719
before or after a competition decreases muscle
soreness. Some studies have even noted that

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.640
extreme flexibility can lead to an increase
in the range of stretching without pain. And

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.700
if you can't feel pain, the body doesn't know
when to stop pushing; as a result, injuries

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.719
can occur. Another large study of athletes
found that the least and most flexible participants

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:10.990
were 2.5 times more likely to incur an injury.
So when it comes to flexibility in competitive

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.820
sports, it's most beneficial to be moderately
flexible.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.640
A well designed 'warm up' is also extremely
beneficial. The term itself comes from the

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.680
positive effects of raising the temperature
of your body before a competition. Slowly

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.450
increasing physical intensity prior to a sport
increases muscle temperature, ultimately allowing

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.100
your muscles to contract more forcefully.
More forceful contractions, equals more strength

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.390
and power. Furthermore, slowly adding movement
to your muscles opens up the blood vessels,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.009
allowing blood to flow more easily throughout
the body, and decreases the strain on your

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.100
heart. Finally, as your blood temperature
increases, your blood cells actually hold

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.829
less oxygen. This loose oxygen is then free
to be used by your muscles, increasing overall

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:48.909
endurance.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.869
Science says, it's important not to over "stretch"
it when it comes to flexibility, but physically

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.800
"warming up" your body before each specific
sport might help you burn 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.600
the competition.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.300
Don't forget: we have a new video out every day during the Olympics.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.300
Can't wait? Our amazing partners at the CBC already have five of the videos up now for you to binge on. 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.300
Just head to cbc.ca/olympics/ScienceSays to watch them before anyone else. Link in the description. 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.300
