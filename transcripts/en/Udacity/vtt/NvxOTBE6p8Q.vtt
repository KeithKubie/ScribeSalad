00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.630
What would happen if a germ cell went through

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.440
mitosis? Now think about it for a second. Mitosis

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.060
results in two cells that have the same number

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.750
of chromosomes that the parent cell had, 46 chromosomes.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.530
This means that the germ cell would be making

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.370
two gametes each with 46 chromosomes. If a sperm

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.430
with 46 chromosomes fertilizes an egg that also has

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.550
46 chromosomes, then that would result in a cell with

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.540
92 chromosomes. That's twice as much as human

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.910
cells are supposed to have. If we take this

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.160
to its logical conclusion, while the first humans

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.960
would have 46 chromosomes, the next generation would have

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.870
92 and the next generation would have 184.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.940
And the next generation would have 368, and so

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.870
forth and so on. We would just be in

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.390
this endless arms race, doubling our chromosomes every generation.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.540
So this, just doesn't work. Germ cells go

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.020
through a very special kind of division, called meiosis.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.170
And this division is different from every other cell

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.220
type in your body. And the reason is specifically,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.230
to solve this problem of having too many chromosomes

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.120
at fertilization. What happens is DNAs duplicated just like

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.480
in mitosis, but then there's a round of cell

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.460
division. And then the resulting cells, without duplicating their

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.490
DNA again, go through another round of cell division and in this case we

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.610
separate out. Every chromosome now, is not in a pair. The

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.660
pairs have been broken up. How many chromosomes would a gamete have

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.340
after meiosis? Go ahead and put your, numerical answer in this box here.
