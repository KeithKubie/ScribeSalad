ZACH LIEBERMAN: Most people
think about art as objects,

00:00:02.567 --> 00:00:03.800
that you put
something in a gallery

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.633
like a sculpture or a painting.

00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:08.800
But for us, art is systems,
that we're creating systems.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.300
[music playing]

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.233
AR, it's almost like a layer
of magic on top of the reality.

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:20.033
I would say that we
are artists that work

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:21.567
with software and hardware.

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:24.734
We work with technology, but
to make artistic expression.

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:26.333

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:30.400
MOLMOL KOU: He asked me to
work on the project with him,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.333
and for some reason,
he always asked me

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:35.734
to work on a project at a bar.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:37.367
[laughing]

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:42.467
And the project never
happened, but, you know.

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:44.734
I personally love
things I can touch.

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:47.233
So I love working with
hardware, I love electronics,

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:50.200
I have a lot of
patience with debugging

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.100
like, hardware problem.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.600
And Zach is kind
of the contrary,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.633
he is really good at software,
and software debugging.

00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:00.633
When there's an
integration coming in,

00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:04.834
we both are doing
kind of what we like.

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:08.800
I really want to find a
way to visualize emotions,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.000
so other people can understand
how a person is feeling.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.300
And to have some
kind of empathy,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.133
if they can see the
emotions being visualized.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.266
So this app actually
visualize your speech

00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:28.400
based on the volume, and
how many words you speak,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.767
and how fast you speak it.

00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:32.767
And it's almost like
an audio visualization

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:33.934
turned into a mask.

00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:35.266
The app covers your face.

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.333
[vocalizing]

00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.166
ZACH LIEBERMAN: Really
like to do weird stuff,

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.734
especially with the face.

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:44.333
Like, cut parts of the face,
take the eyes, extend them out.

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.600
Like really, kind of play
with the face, and then

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.800
use that almost
as a kind of mask.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.767
Like, take your left
and your right eye,

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:52.767
create a crown of
them around your head,

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:55.367
and then use that to
hide your identity.

00:01:57.867 --> 00:02:00.900
We've been experimenting
a lot with space, using

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.300
AR to put things in 3D space.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.300
Like put images, or
video, or sound, and type

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.233
was a natural progression
in those experimentations.

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:14.533
What does it mean to
put words in space?

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:18.700
So Weird Type is an AR app that
you can install on your phone,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.066
and it allows you to
write text, and then

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:23.367
place that text in 3D space.

00:02:23.367 --> 00:02:25.700
So that you can write a
message, and you can place it,

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.100
and as you move, the type
can change or animate.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.333
But it really is like
floating in the air.

00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:35.333
Molmol and I have just been
experimenting and playing

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:39.867
with AR, and making these weird
expressions in the studio,

00:02:39.867 --> 00:02:41.934
and posting them online.

00:02:41.934 --> 00:02:44.066
It's so nice to actually have
something that we can give

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:48.333
to people, that people can try,
and they can have the same sort

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:51.800
of joy that we've been having.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.900
So these technologies
are already out there.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.734
Face tracking, you know, these
computer vision techniques,

00:02:57.734 --> 00:03:00.533
these machine learning
techniques, they are out there.

00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:03.266
And what we're trying to
do is appropriate them

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:06.433
and use them for artistic,
for creative expression,

00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:09.200
and also to suggest we can use
them in completely different

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.967
ways, and ways that
governments are not intending,

00:03:11.967 --> 00:03:13.533
and companies are not intending.

00:03:13.533 --> 00:03:16.600
But artists can sort of suggest
different possible futures.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.266
