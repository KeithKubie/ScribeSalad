00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:10.776
Cramming for a test?

00:00:10.776 --> 00:00:14.449
Trying to get more done
than you have time to do?

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:20.188
Stress is a feeling we all experience
when we are challenged or overwhelmed.

00:00:20.188 --> 00:00:22.084
But more than just an emotion,

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:29.001
stress is a hardwired physical response
that travels throughout your entire body.

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:31.949
In the short term, 
stress can be advantageous,

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.232
but when activated too often or too long,

00:00:35.232 --> 00:00:38.209
your primitive fight or flight 
stress response

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:40.172
not only changes your brain

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:46.277
but also damages many of the other
organs and cells throughout your body.

00:00:46.277 --> 00:00:49.219
Your adrenal gland releases 
the stress hormones

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.012
cortisol, epinephrine, 
also known as adrenaline,

00:00:53.012 --> 00:00:55.298
and norepinephrine.

00:00:55.298 --> 00:00:57.742
As these hormones 
travel through your blood stream,

00:00:57.742 --> 00:01:01.359
they easily reach 
your blood vessels and heart.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.931
Adrenaline causes 
your heart to beat faster

00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:09.044
and raises your blood pressure,
over time causing hypertension.

00:01:09.044 --> 00:01:13.794
Cortisol can also cause the endothelium,
or inner lining of blood vessels,

00:01:13.794 --> 00:01:16.104
to not function normally.

00:01:16.104 --> 00:01:18.848
Scientists now know 
that this is an early step

00:01:18.848 --> 00:01:22.398
in triggering the process 
of atherosclerosis

00:01:22.398 --> 00:01:25.892
or cholesterol plaque
build up in your arteries.

00:01:25.892 --> 00:01:31.672
Together, these changes increase 
your chances of a heart attack or stroke.

00:01:31.672 --> 00:01:33.818
When your brain senses stress,

00:01:33.818 --> 00:01:36.549
it activates your 
autonomic nervous system.

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.921
Through this network 
of nerve connections,

00:01:38.921 --> 00:01:42.205
your big brain communicates
stress to your enteric,

00:01:42.205 --> 00:01:47.076
or intestinal nervous system.

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:49.653
Besides causing butterflies 
in your stomach,

00:01:49.653 --> 00:01:54.659
this brain-gut connection can disturb
the natural rhythmic contractions

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.979
that move food through your gut,

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.475
leading to irritable bowel syndrome,

00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:02.626
and can increase your 
gut sensitivity to acid,

00:02:02.626 --> 00:02:05.607
making you more likely to feel heartburn.

00:02:05.607 --> 00:02:07.243
Via the gut's nervous system,

00:02:07.243 --> 00:02:13.118
stress can also change the composition
and function of your gut bacteria,

00:02:13.118 --> 00:02:16.801
which may affect your digestive
and overall health.

00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:20.691
Speaking of digestion, does chronic
stress affect your waistline?

00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:22.104
Well, yes.

00:02:22.104 --> 00:02:24.256
Cortisol can increase your appetite.

00:02:24.256 --> 00:02:27.273
It tells your body to replenish 
your energy stores

00:02:27.273 --> 00:02:33.747
with energy dense foods and carbs,
causing you to crave comfort foods.

00:02:33.747 --> 00:02:37.316
High levels of cortisol can also cause you
to put on those extra calories

00:02:37.316 --> 00:02:40.878
as visceral or deep belly fat.

00:02:40.878 --> 00:02:44.119
This type of fat doesn't just make
it harder to button your pants.

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:46.862
It is an organ 
that actively releases hormones

00:02:46.862 --> 00:02:50.072
and immune system chemicals 
called cytokines

00:02:50.072 --> 00:02:53.974
that can increase your risk
of developing chronic diseases,

00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:56.863
such as heart disease 
and insulin resistance.

00:02:56.863 --> 00:03:01.678
Meanwhile, stress hormones 
affect immune cells in a variety of ways.

00:03:01.678 --> 00:03:06.080
Initially, they help prepare 
to fight invaders and heal after injury,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.136
but chronic stress can dampen function
of some immune cells,

00:03:10.136 --> 00:03:15.072
make you more susceptible to infections,
and slow the rate you heal.

00:03:15.072 --> 00:03:17.026
Want to live a long life?

00:03:17.026 --> 00:03:19.565
You may have to curb your chronic stress.

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:23.741
That's because it has even been
associated with shortened telomeres,

00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:28.369
the shoelace tip ends of chromosomes
that measure a cell's age.

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:30.149
Telomeres cap chromosomes

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:33.601
to allow DNA to get copied
every time a cell divides

00:03:33.601 --> 00:03:36.880
without damaging 
the cell's genetic code,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.744
and they shorten with each cell division.

00:03:39.744 --> 00:03:44.945
When telomeres become too short,
a cell can no longer divide and it dies.

00:03:44.945 --> 00:03:46.635
As if all that weren't enough,

00:03:46.635 --> 00:03:50.498
chronic stress has even more ways
it can sabotage your health,

00:03:50.498 --> 00:03:51.906
including acne,

00:03:51.906 --> 00:03:53.091
hair loss,

00:03:53.091 --> 00:03:54.476
sexual dysfunction,

00:03:54.476 --> 00:03:55.599
headaches,

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:56.754
muscle tension,

00:03:56.754 --> 00:03:58.230
difficulty concentrating,

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.358
fatigue,

00:03:59.358 --> 00:04:01.217
and irritability.

00:04:01.217 --> 00:04:03.816
So, what does all this mean for you?

00:04:03.816 --> 00:04:07.353
Your life will always be filled
with stressful situations.

00:04:07.353 --> 00:04:10.657
But what matters to your brain
and entire body

00:04:10.657 --> 00:04:13.392
is how you respond to that stress.

00:04:13.392 --> 00:04:18.206
If you can view those situations
as challenges you can control and master,

00:04:18.206 --> 00:04:21.092
rather than as threats 
that are insurmountable,

00:04:21.092 --> 00:04:25.875
you will perform better in the short run
and stay healthy in the long run.
