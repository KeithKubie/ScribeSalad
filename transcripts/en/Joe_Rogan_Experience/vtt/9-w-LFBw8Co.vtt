00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.820
The young Jamie [inaudible]. Three, two, one, ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.080
my favorite farmer.

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.390
You're my favorite farmer and I'm your favorite farmer.

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.900
I know that many of them, but you're number one. All right.

5
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.960
I have a feeling that I don't quite farm. The things you would rather use.

6
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.670
What do you mean? Like marijuana is over trying to say.

7
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.880
I wasn't going to say it, but if you're going to bring it up. I love wine too.

8
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.240
You make fucking killer one. Okay. I'm a fan of your wine. Excellent. Thank you.

9
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.540
Go. I have. I've yet to try your food, but I want to,

10
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.990
I didn't even know what an ASTA was until I talked to you. See,

11
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.950
I didn't know or that you use Falcons to kill birds and dad fucking thing you

12
00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:43.380
sent me is dope as fuck. So you have hired. Fuck. You hired a,

13
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:48.340
a person and a couple that raises Falcons to kill pigeons that are fucking with

14
00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:50.840
your food, starlings, sparrows, anything.

15
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.840
Anything that's messing with the grapes. They have the,

16
00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:54.190
these Falcons come through and,

17
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.050
and the thing is the collector birds in the area will have a memory of that.

18
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.020
So like if you have this Hawk come through the,

19
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.880
the vineyard and they just pulverize in those feathers everywhere,

20
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.950
that the community of birds kind of go, Oh, I don't think we should go this way.

21
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.820
We should go that way. The cage with the feathers everywhere.

22
00:01:15.821 --> 00:01:19.870
And then the pigeons on the other side. I was like, what? Yeah, that's a snack.

23
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.190
I was in Venice recently last week. I'm still jet lagged. I'm completely fucked.

24
00:01:24.191 --> 00:01:27.670
I haven't slept solid in five whole days.

25
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.040
My body does not know what's going on.

26
00:01:30.041 --> 00:01:33.730
I'll go to sleep completely exhausted and I'll wake up two hours later feeling

27
00:01:33.731 --> 00:01:37.430
like shit and I can't go back to sleep. Right. But when I was in Venice, um,

28
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.100
there was a guy with a Falcon, he, he had a Falcon with him and I was like,

29
00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:45.880
why is this kind of a Falcon? And then the fucking pigeons come in like crazy.

30
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.090
And when the guys, they were the Falcon, the, the pigeons just ghost,

31
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.410
they're gone. They take off.

32
00:01:50.411 --> 00:01:55.411
So this guy stands there by the dock and Venice as the gondoliers pull up and a,

33
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.510
he's just got this Falcon just sit in there too so that the people can eat their

34
00:01:58.511 --> 00:02:01.120
food. The pigeons are insanely aggressive.

35
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.760
It's a ridiculous place until they see, they see that Falcon done. Fuck this.

36
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.070
You ever see videos online where um, the Mongols use, uh,

37
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.080
the use Eagles golden Eagles to hunt for wolves?

38
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.960
Come on dude, it's wild. And Eagle, which way is like, what? 15,

39
00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:23.440
20 pounds. They fuck wolves up. They swoop.

40
00:02:23.441 --> 00:02:27.880
These wolves are just running for their life as death swarms down from the sky.

41
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.910
We were going to use the drone to get some footage of the Falcons and we're

42
00:02:33.131 --> 00:02:36.760
like, she's like, yeah, that's probably not a good idea. And like, yeah,

43
00:02:36.761 --> 00:02:40.450
cause the, the plates, he goes, no, no, no. Your drone cause the Falcons,

44
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.020
they'll go full force into your drone and destroy it.

45
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.880
So whatever you paid for it, try Gooding your insurance company and going, Hey,

46
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.260
my drum broke. What did you do? Flute near a Falcon. They're going to go, yeah,

47
00:02:53.261 --> 00:02:54.190
good luck. Well,

48
00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:59.191
Peregrine Falcons don't they go like 200 miles an hour through the fastest on

49
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:02.200
the planet. Boom. Fuck, fuck. What?

50
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.070
200 miles an hour. Yeah. Destroy your drone.

51
00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.860
I mean that doesn't even make sense. What do you got? Oh, this is the Mongol.

52
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:11.950
So look, these dudes run, the wools are running away.

53
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.050
The wolves know the fucking drill two men.

54
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.460
And this Eagle just comes down and jacks the Wolf and that's how they skin these

55
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:22.150
wolves. Look at that. Two of them. Boom. Good God. Yeah,

56
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:26.980
they are death from the sky and these guys raise them and then they wear the

57
00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.230
Wolf hat. Yeah, they will. The skin, the firs, everything. But it's just so,

58
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.300
so that's it. What are we talking about? What did you,

59
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:37.360
whatever you want to talk about fellow here. You got some news. Yeah.

60
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.490
So I figured, I know there's a lot of, uh,

61
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.850
there's probably some tool fans that'll probably tune into this specifically to

62
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:44.340
hear some news. Yeah.

63
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.530
So rather than being a Dick and waiting to the end to tell them, I probably,

64
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.610
we should probably tell them upfront, are you like softening? And your age? No,

65
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:53.280
not at all. I just care. I just,

66
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.470
I care about as long as things are taken for us.

67
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:59.410
Cause we're a very difficult band. We're very stubborn and we're, you know,

68
00:03:59.411 --> 00:04:02.530
we're kind of ignorant to what goes on in the rest of the world.

69
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:06.880
And so people are like, guys, come on guys. Uh, and you know,

70
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.350
I mean to their credit,

71
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:12.200
like we did the whole beta max thing didn't work for us and neither did a laser

72
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.050
disc. So we have this new thing called digital media and streaming.

73
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.770
We're going to try it out. You go to extremes. It's a new thing streaming,

74
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.410
so you can just Amazon. Oh, like Spotify, that kind of deal. Yeah. Yeah.

75
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.430
It's just brand new. It's brand new. Yeah. Like on your phone or something.

76
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:32.900
To us it's brand new. What are you doing with it? A,

77
00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.480
we're going to put some songs on it. Oh,

78
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:37.420
so you can listen when you're not even like plugged in anything. Correct.

79
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.240
So here's what I'm going to do now, because this is,

80
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.370
by the time this actually airs, this will have already happened,

81
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:46.030
but you're filming me doing it right? You're going to upload a week.

82
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.420
I'm going to do a thing. Then everybody know I'm a, I'm a tweaker.

83
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.470
Do you have it prepared and everything? Not really. So you,

84
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.650
you're doing this because your fans, which are very rabid, you have rabid fans.

85
00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.490
The tool fans are particularly enthusiastic. They're pretty,

86
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.270
they're pretty aggressive. They, yeah. Well it's cause you guys are awesome.

87
00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.950
Thank you. You fucked up. Made an awesome band. He got some radical fans. Okay.

88
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.450
So, uh, when this, you released this podcast,

89
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.580
the idea was that if you set it on the podcast without letting them know first,

90
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.700
yeah, they deserve to hear first. They've been very patient with us.

91
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.290
Very patient. So this Friday, August 2nd dumped,

92
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:29.530
dumped on the catalog.

93
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.100
The whole catalog catalog goes up on Napster,

94
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.440
on Napster. I, you remember with Napster? I've heard of it.

95
00:05:39.441 --> 00:05:42.040
It's great that Lars guys really upset about it. Yes,

96
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.260
you should talk to Lars about this. He's got a whole thing.

97
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:46.480
He's going to try to figure it out, figure out how to undermine them.

98
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.000
Now he's going to stop it in its tracks. Kettle,

99
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.070
it goes up on all digital and stream.

100
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.920
He's doing this thing on his phone right now as we're talking. I'm dreaming.

101
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.420
So up until this time mats,

102
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.900
you never have had anything up and available. No. You're like,

103
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.320
what's his name? Garth Brooks. Yeah. He doesn't have anything up either.

104
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.430
No comment cards, books, doesn't he? He just wants his,

105
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.960
well it's kind of like a good artistic choice.

106
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:22.670
He doesn't want his stuff to be broken up into songs he wants you to download or

107
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:27.671
to buy his entire CD cause he feels like there's a correct order for songs.

108
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.940
He says that, that's what he says. Yeah we can. We tried to,

109
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.520
we tried that one before and people feel like, no, no.

110
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:37.900
We want you to hear a whole album as you know, in sequence and people like,

111
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.890
like you play them live like, Oh yeah, w I,

112
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.500
we'd never played straight start to finish,

113
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.310
but of course I'm not the guy that said no, no. We wanted you to hear. Yeah.

114
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.450
Cause that's, cause that would be an absolute lie. Yeah.

115
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.840
Yeah. Garth Brooks has some weird things of course. Um,

116
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.160
Garth Brooks is being currently harassed and away we go by Thompson girl.

117
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.000
So it's up there. You go up there. It's out there in the ether. It's out there.

118
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:11.120
So why have you guys not had anything on streaming up until this moment? I yeah,

119
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.800
no I love my brothers. I'm just gonna take the fifth on that one.

120
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.380
Okay. So there was some sort of internal discussion or,

121
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.190
or no discussion or no discussion? Yeah, just the,

122
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.660
the typical tool time of like what it was. There was a meeting.

123
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:31.670
Hmm. Well again, this is what you get with great artists.

124
00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:36.080
You don't get great artists who are also the best promoters. Correct.

125
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:39.740
The ones who are the best promoters, usually they're not the best artist.

126
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.980
Here's what, here's also what we're going to do today. You're doing nothing.

127
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.290
Is this like one of them late night things where you selling knives?

128
00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.120
Oh you got an extra? Yeah. Do you want a knife?

129
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.080
Cause I tell them you can also have some old stock in beta and samurai swords

130
00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:55.640
and shit. Yeah. Uh, no. I'm going to announce the name of the new album

131
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:02.900
like that. Yeah. You're doing it on your phone. First fear of a black planet.

132
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:08.050
And if you're of a black planet sound fear cue,

133
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.510
um,

134
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:13.160
your white guys spinning on an album called black plant would fucking really go

135
00:08:13.161 --> 00:08:14.720
over well and yeah,

136
00:08:14.721 --> 00:08:17.940
that would be the least woke thing you could do in 2000 what you're on.

137
00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.250
You would buy the first copy. A fear inoculum is the name of the album.

138
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.940
Dear inoculum, what'd you say? We buy the first album.

139
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.000
I'm not gonna say that again. I didn't hear what you said.

140
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.920
I might've said cowboy Cerrone. Cowboy Serone. Yeah. Why would you say that?

141
00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:37.040
I dunno cause he swears that cowboy hat and I just assumed that he's got a lot

142
00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:38.840
of black friends. That's it. You're out of line.

143
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.690
I'm totally a trains with all these black guys and now he's going to be mad at

144
00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:44.870
me. Now I've got to apologize to choking. You probably want to hear this.

145
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:49.250
It's probably too busy jumping a jet ski over a bridge. Just jealous of his hat.

146
00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.490
So August 30 and in them hats, you've got some money.

147
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.560
You gotta have it of your own. I guess I do. It's like Sinatra hat.

148
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.450
<v 1>It's a, if you weren't so cool,</v>

149
00:08:57.451 --> 00:09:00.810
that'd be a douche bag hat that's in breaking bad shit right there. I like it.

150
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:04.830
I like that. I like it on you. I like it on you. It looks good on you. It does.

151
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.810
There's, there's things that people like you could pull off one of those, uh,

152
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.640
buckskin pioneer jackets with the fray. You could pull it, you know,

153
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:15.900
they'll have the, what is that stuff called?

154
00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:19.070
The tassels that hang down from the size of the jacket and away we go and away

155
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.050
we go. Yeah, you put it on Instagram as well. We have just, I just put it down.

156
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.690
Instagram matters. We'll get it on Twitter in a minute.

157
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.840
Cause I did more important things. Now people will shut the fuck up.

158
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.120
They'll leave you alone. I liked that little setup too,

159
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:33.120
that you got there with the laptop. Slash. iPad.

160
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.390
I didn't know that they made that kind of a case that doubles as a keyboard.

161
00:09:36.391 --> 00:09:40.800
Right? Yeah. Look at you. All right. Farmers with technology,

162
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:45.240
right. Bait people PPP. So how's the wine business?

163
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:50.130
It's good. We're a little late this year. Um, things are about two weeks behind.

164
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.510
So I wanted to ask you this because this is something that like a lot of people

165
00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:58.260
that are dealing with in the Arizona area that you guys had a lot of rain,

166
00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:00.420
right? Yeah. Yeah.

167
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.200
So I know like hunters and people that are like into the wildlife and everything

168
00:10:04.201 --> 00:10:08.430
like that are really excited about this fall because there's so much moisture.

169
00:10:08.431 --> 00:10:12.900
It's likely the animal populations would be very healthy. Yes. And I mean it's,

170
00:10:12.901 --> 00:10:14.370
you know, with anything there's,

171
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:16.350
there's always going to be both sides of that with,

172
00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.760
with extra rain in the spring comes extra foliage,

173
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.320
extra ground, cover, extra grass. Right. And they fuck with the root systems.

174
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:26.390
No. Then it uh,

175
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:30.330
then there's extra fires cause then when the rain dries up you have all this

176
00:10:30.331 --> 00:10:33.810
extra fuel. Yeah. So fires. There's probably good.

177
00:10:33.811 --> 00:10:35.910
A lot of that can be a pretty intense fire season.

178
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:38.450
I've been evacuated three times. Yeah,

179
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.130
I've got evacuated in October who came real close,

180
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.840
burnt three houses right in front of us.

181
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:47.880
We were in the epicenter of that Woosley fire. Oh God. Yeah.

182
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:52.860
It was pretty crazy. It's white, but you know, it sucks and it's terrible,

183
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.870
but if you live through it,

184
00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.910
the thing that it lets you know is you're not your shit. You're not your stuff.

185
00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:03.030
Oh yeah, absolutely. When we left, you know,

186
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.180
we had to wake our kids up at two o'clock in the morning and I said to my wife,

187
00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:08.800
I'm like, you know, we're fine. We got, he said,

188
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.120
I'm just grabbing my laptop and some fucking underwear. You know,

189
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.420
you go to the store and buy new pants. I'm like, if you lose all your stuff,

190
00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:19.440
you're alive. The only thing I know, I make sure I know where it's at, is the,

191
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.580
is the photo album of photos that I haven't scanned or whatever on my cloud or

192
00:11:23.581 --> 00:11:24.310
whatever.

193
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.960
I've got the photo album in the dogs and then remember to grab the family. Yeah.

194
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:32.430
Remember that. That's important. But yeah, it's like, Oh, natural.

195
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:33.570
There's something crazy,

196
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:36.930
but that's one of the things that I really do miss about living on the East

197
00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:41.931
coast with horrible winters is that there's something comforting in the brutal

198
00:11:42.061 --> 00:11:46.500
force of nature that just forces you to recognize that you are helpless.

199
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:49.830
You're helpless to the blizzard. Yeah. Michigan. I remembered,

200
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:54.640
you know the drifts on the side of the road. Fuck five feet, 10 feet. Yeah.

201
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.250
It's crazy. You still make it. You still make your way to the school.

202
00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.320
You get there, you get there, but it's something about PR.

203
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:04.030
People are so fucking cool when it, when it's really snowy,

204
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.580
like everybody is more humble. They're like, Holy shit.

205
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:07.990
It's like it puts you in your place.

206
00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.960
<v 2>Yeah. That's good. Yes. We,</v>

207
00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.610
we talked a while ago, we were just talking about this,

208
00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.290
this idea of this a sit down.

209
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.300
I remember I kind of talked about that a little bit,

210
00:12:23.301 --> 00:12:26.540
trying to figure out how to like, how to do this. And of course I'm so busy,

211
00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.230
everything that, uh, with what I got going on,

212
00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.960
I would never be able to pull this off. I've never been like, Hey,

213
00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:37.160
I'm going to be the executive producer on this idea that I had. Right. Um,

214
00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.130
so I thought this might be a good forum to go,

215
00:12:40.131 --> 00:12:45.010
Hey you and I tee ball it up to go somebody around with this. Cause I think it,

216
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:49.400
I think it's something that needs to happen and we can take Bob five minutes to

217
00:12:49.401 --> 00:12:53.420
riff on what it shouldn't be. Okay. Right.

218
00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.910
Cause I think that's really the, that's kinda what, uh,

219
00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.830
when it comes down to just trying to make sure that we're not,

220
00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:02.900
it just doesn't turn into some other clickbait reality TV show. Right.

221
00:13:02.901 --> 00:13:05.840
Cause that's not really the point of it. So what do you thinking? Okay.

222
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.240
Well you and I were discussing,

223
00:13:08.241 --> 00:13:09.710
there's like all this stuff going on in the world.

224
00:13:09.711 --> 00:13:13.280
Everybody's divided and freaking out and, and, uh, going down the,

225
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.720
the dopamine rabbit hole of, uh, of, you know, clickbait.

226
00:13:17.721 --> 00:13:22.160
And we can talk about that. I feel like the polarization of everybody,

227
00:13:22.161 --> 00:13:27.140
everybody has a position. They're taken up the stance and this cause. Um,

228
00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:32.510
and I get that and to feel connected, to feel like you're part of a movement to,

229
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:37.460
uh, for injustice or whatever. I completely get that you need to do that.

230
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:42.290
But I think that some point when you start fighting with your neighbor,

231
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.430
you start to kind of lose connection. And I think these things, man,

232
00:13:46.431 --> 00:13:48.650
these are just, they're a poison, uh,

233
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:53.690
in terms of dividing people and, and forgetting to have these conversations,

234
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.950
uh, openly. So the concept, we're like, we're gonna lay it out.

235
00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:03.430
The idea is that we find six different people from completely different

236
00:14:03.771 --> 00:14:08.771
backgrounds that have a very strong feeling about something that they feel

237
00:14:09.081 --> 00:14:13.550
strongly about. Just something, whatever it is. Um, and we get them on camera

238
00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.010
or in writing,

239
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:20.420
whatever they state that they state their position and the ideas that get these

240
00:14:20.421 --> 00:14:24.880
people together with each other and not fight,

241
00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.540
not talk about what they don't agree on,

242
00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:32.410
find the things they agree on and just build on the things that they can agree

243
00:14:33.411 --> 00:14:38.360
on. And then at the end of it we go back and make sure we interview them.

244
00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.240
And the the N the way that they went into the thing,

245
00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:45.560
whatever their statement was about who they are doesn't change. They,

246
00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:46.910
they believe what they believe.

247
00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.480
But in that without compromising the core of who they are,

248
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.320
they end up finding in somebody else an agree to disagree position where they

249
00:14:56.961 --> 00:14:59.420
can actually talk to each other and find out what they do. Like

250
00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.790
<v 1>no, I felt like one on one in person with no one around.</v>

251
00:15:03.791 --> 00:15:06.190
People are much more likely to have those things.

252
00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:10.270
The real problem is when it's being projected to the world and you're looking

253
00:15:10.271 --> 00:15:14.230
for likes and you're looking for people to agree, you're looking for support.

254
00:15:14.231 --> 00:15:16.720
And that's one of the really toxic things about the phones.

255
00:15:16.721 --> 00:15:21.490
And social media is that everybody's playing for likes and the virtue signaling

256
00:15:21.491 --> 00:15:25.930
and the throwing up the, the flag of, of, of righteousness.

257
00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.100
It's so common.

258
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:28.840
<v 2>And I, I was talking to a friend of mine,</v>

259
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.490
she's a working with a young woman doing a,

260
00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.400
a research paper on the very thing and she'd kind of hand me some,

261
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:39.020
some research, uh, that kind of, I kind of suspected and I was like,

262
00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:43.270
what about this, this and this? And kinda not,

263
00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.710
not off topic, but kind of on topic. Uh,

264
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:50.450
the purpose when Oxycontin first came out was that they'd discovered in that

265
00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:55.451
drug something that interrupted and helped fix people who are,

266
00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.980
you know, meth, heroin addicts.

267
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:03.430
It was helping them get sober and getting off the heroin because it replaced

268
00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:07.970
that feeling that they were getting the dopamine wound,

269
00:16:07.971 --> 00:16:12.140
like feeling that escapist thing, uh,

270
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:15.170
that they were getting from heroin. So they would get, you know,

271
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.820
use the oxycodone rom is that unless you cut your hands off,

272
00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:23.500
you can't, you're gonna tick. Another one is some basic addition.

273
00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:27.470
She just replaced the heroin with another thing that's like the dopamine dump.

274
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:29.090
Um, and this is,

275
00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:34.560
they're now finding that that whole process of likes and uh,

276
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.770
uh, you know, validating or not validating, you know,

277
00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:43.880
then you get depressed cause nobody likes your post and you're constantly was

278
00:16:43.881 --> 00:16:46.310
that gonna rat, you know, basically the analogy of the,

279
00:16:46.311 --> 00:16:50.930
of the rat in the aquarium that's keeps hitting the cocaine button. Yeah.

280
00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:56.120
It's the same thing. It effects the same part of your brain. Um,

281
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:58.030
and they're finding there's that absolute connections.

282
00:16:58.031 --> 00:17:02.240
So if you can't go 10 minutes without looking at your phone,

283
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.680
you are an addict.

284
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:08.000
You have to understand that the actual chemical reaction in your body to the,

285
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:10.130
to the charge you get on that.

286
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:15.640
And the fact that it's fed by adjusted titles,

287
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.960
whatever the headline is, if that's not getting it,

288
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.980
they adjust the headline to see if it gets you now and then you click on it, go,

289
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.070
that's the one. And then they adjust that one and it's the,

290
00:17:25.071 --> 00:17:27.170
it's the rat hitting the cocaine button.

291
00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:27.401
<v 1>Well,</v>

292
00:17:27.401 --> 00:17:30.760
I'm glad you used that analogy because one of the things they found out about

293
00:17:30.761 --> 00:17:33.820
that, because some biologists didn't like the, they didn't,

294
00:17:33.821 --> 00:17:36.010
didn't jive with them, the rats with the cocaine.

295
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.880
So then they thought about the environment that the rats lived in and they said,

296
00:17:39.881 --> 00:17:42.790
well let's look at this environment cause these rats are in a cage.

297
00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.190
This is a very unnatural environment. There's lights on,

298
00:17:45.191 --> 00:17:46.300
there's people staring at them.

299
00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:51.660
So instead they put rats in a very rat like environment Woody and grass and

300
00:17:51.901 --> 00:17:56.670
trees and into a natural rat world. Guess what? Rats didn't fuck with the cook.

301
00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:59.550
They left it alone, right? They only hit the Coke one.

302
00:17:59.551 --> 00:18:01.860
They were just destroyed.

303
00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:06.180
Like their life was top turned upside down and they're living in this completely

304
00:18:06.181 --> 00:18:09.000
unnatural environment. They're living in prison. So when you're in prison,

305
00:18:09.001 --> 00:18:12.810
you'll do the Coke. But when they were in a very natural world,

306
00:18:12.811 --> 00:18:16.980
they didn't find it attractive at all. Okay. So on that note,

307
00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.310
<v 2>I would suggest I've just,</v>

308
00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.910
the people we'll help now have read those things that I put up about the new

309
00:18:22.911 --> 00:18:25.460
album and everything. So I'm going to request,

310
00:18:25.461 --> 00:18:28.430
I'm going to bag people who have seen it now.

311
00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.540
I'm not sure where this is going live at this going, you know,

312
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:33.200
tonight it's going to go up tomorrow. Okay, great.

313
00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.780
I'm going to beg as a favor to you and to me, uh,

314
00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:41.820
for people who read that news and are excited about that news to do us all a

315
00:18:41.901 --> 00:18:45.920
favor. Turn your fucking phone off, turn your computer off,

316
00:18:45.921 --> 00:18:49.100
turn your TV off. Go for a long walk.

317
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.640
Just go for a long walk somewhere. Even if it's in the mall or whatever,

318
00:18:53.641 --> 00:18:57.750
just go somewhere else. Go out,

319
00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.970
go talk to a stranger

320
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:06.080
and just find out something about them, no matter what it is.

321
00:19:06.081 --> 00:19:07.520
Just go talk to somebody. Just get,

322
00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:11.660
go out of your house and go have a conversation with somebody. Will stab. Yeah,

323
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:13.460
probably. Um, please still,

324
00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:18.830
unless they have a knife and do not talk to them because they have a knife, uh,

325
00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.870
that did, that. Does that cover the lawyers?

326
00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.690
If I see that stuff you don't want to, you're not approaching violence.

327
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.200
Unstable people don't do anything dangerous. Yeah. Don't do anything dangerous.

328
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:31.550
But just go out, just, just go out for a walk. You have a family,

329
00:19:31.551 --> 00:19:36.110
you have young ones. Do you, uh, how do you approach that with the kids?

330
00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:37.453
Well, you can see,

331
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.930
you can see the fight and the fury and the N crazy,

332
00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:44.510
the crazy meltdowns that we have with our five-year-old.

333
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:47.270
When we're saying it's time to come to dinner,

334
00:19:47.271 --> 00:19:52.271
put your iPad down and it's an absolute fucking meltdown and it's insane.

335
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.690
And when we actually get it away from her and we take her,

336
00:19:56.691 --> 00:20:01.370
may go and we have to explain, honey, this thing is not your family.

337
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:04.220
Where is your family? This thing doesn't care about you.

338
00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.770
The stuff on the other end of this thing doesn't care about you.

339
00:20:06.771 --> 00:20:08.570
We care about you. She playing games.

340
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:12.080
Let's go get the ducks and we'll go get the ducks.

341
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.980
And then within five minutes she's forgotten about the iPad cause she's playing

342
00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:18.710
with ducks. She's playing with docs, right? We're in the, you know,

343
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:21.110
we're in the aviary with the finches and we're around checking the wine,

344
00:20:21.111 --> 00:20:23.660
we're checking the ferments or she comes down while we're trying to record

345
00:20:23.661 --> 00:20:26.900
music. And she's like sitting in the bed listening to what we're doing.

346
00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:31.880
[inaudible] she's involved in doing things and she forgets about this and you

347
00:20:31.881 --> 00:20:35.570
can forget about this. I'm telling you, you can do it. Yes you can do it.

348
00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.690
I use it for, you know, I use it for business but I try,

349
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.470
I got caught up for a while there. I would like find a video game on my phone.

350
00:20:42.471 --> 00:20:43.790
I am going to play this video game four.

351
00:20:43.791 --> 00:20:48.010
I know I've like spent like 500 bucks and then the in app and shit

352
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.030
<v 0>and like wait a minute,</v>

353
00:20:49.031 --> 00:20:52.600
I'm doing the exact same things that I did when I first started the game.

354
00:20:52.601 --> 00:20:56.860
It's no different. I just need better armor. Those get them by the armor,

355
00:20:57.070 --> 00:21:01.300
those in that purchases of the devil. Yeah. So I delete, I delete those things.

356
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.630
Just get caught up in it. You can't, it's, it's something you don't,

357
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.330
people don't realize how,

358
00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.880
you've probably heard it with a bunch of people in here saying the same thing.

359
00:21:09.881 --> 00:21:13.810
Like it's, it's rewiring the way that we think and the way we behave.

360
00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.180
Yes. And the only way to on on do that,

361
00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:22.360
to get away from it is to literally turn it off around Plaag if you walk away,

362
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:26.620
go do something. Well, I know so many people that have switched to S uh,

363
00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:27.483
flip phones,

364
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:33.300
a bunch of them [inaudible] like the drug dealers know Joe comics mostly they,

365
00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:39.190
they have a flip phone to make calls. So someone's still drug dealers

366
00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:46.960
and then they, they keep like a computer for the other stuff or an iPad.

367
00:21:46.961 --> 00:21:51.790
Like already my friend Ari, he, he, he'll, you can call him on his flip phone,

368
00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:54.520
he'll talk to you, but if you text him,

369
00:21:54.521 --> 00:21:57.670
you're making him do that fucking thumb thing that we used to have to do.

370
00:21:57.671 --> 00:22:01.180
We host you four times to get an ass being a part of a bit. Yeah.

371
00:22:01.181 --> 00:22:05.710
You're a nightmare. And so he doesn't have any apps.

372
00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:06.730
There's none of that.

373
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:11.380
But he'll do like Instagram and Twitter and shit on his iPad. Okay. Yeah.

374
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:14.890
That makes sense. Yeah. That's the only way he does it. Yeah, that makes sense.

375
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.200
It does make sense. It's like for him too. He's,

376
00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:21.550
he just recognizes that he can't heal. If he starts getting on it, he'll,

377
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.700
he'll be honest for for seven, eight hours. Then it'll be furious at himself.

378
00:22:24.701 --> 00:22:26.920
Like, what the fuck have I done? I've done the same thing. I'm,

379
00:22:26.921 --> 00:22:30.010
even though I've got three bands and three wineries and a restaurant and all

380
00:22:30.011 --> 00:22:32.380
this things, I still waste.

381
00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:34.780
I end up wasting time on these things and I could get,

382
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:38.170
I could get more done if I didn't have these things in my way.

383
00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:42.880
Do you read comments? I try not to. Yeah. Well, just because people are just,

384
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.020
you know, they're just there.

385
00:22:44.021 --> 00:22:47.620
They need to have a voice and they need to be identified.

386
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:50.890
And the just there a lot of mean spirited things out there and that's,

387
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:54.100
I feel like the world we're living in right now,

388
00:22:54.101 --> 00:22:58.390
there's so much back and forth and there's so much posturing and there's so much

389
00:22:58.391 --> 00:23:02.380
disconnected, disconnected, disconnected behavior that you,

390
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:07.430
we really just need people to reconnect with their loved ones,

391
00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:11.010
especially in your community because as things are progressing in the world,

392
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:13.980
the population and climate change, which I believe are,

393
00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:17.500
there's some stuff coming, you need to connect with people.

394
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.320
You really need to figure things. You think the shit's gonna hit the fan. Yeah,

395
00:23:20.321 --> 00:23:22.420
I do. Woo. Yeah. When, how much time?

396
00:23:22.421 --> 00:23:25.680
We have wished we got one that thought you had some connections with the

397
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.080
[inaudible] North. Okay. I'm going to go to some wooded area. All right. We'll,

398
00:23:29.081 --> 00:23:32.600
you'll be fine. I think the move is going to happen right now. I think. I think,

399
00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:32.890
you know,

400
00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:36.820
based on some of the things that I've kind of seen online and you know,

401
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:40.060
the chitchat and hearing, overhearing conversations with, uh,

402
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.660
with people that are, you know, part of NASA and those kinds of things.

403
00:23:43.661 --> 00:23:47.600
And they kind of go, we got 400 years in the planet's done. Whoa.

404
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:52.790
400 years. Yeah. So if you think in turn, you know, for me, I'm, I'm a,

405
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:57.710
I plan, right planner. Uh, that means that if it's,

406
00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:00.900
if it's, you know, if we're not here in 400 years, well, when's the,

407
00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:03.860
when does that start? Well, that started yesterday. Really. I mean,

408
00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:08.040
when you think about it, there's natural resources and one, you know,

409
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:11.650
it's all this things that start to kind of fall apart and then weird diseases

410
00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:16.580
started showing up and weird fungus. Is that take you out? That didn't before.

411
00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:17.241
Well,

412
00:24:17.241 --> 00:24:22.241
another thing to think is we have only been human for quarter million,

413
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:27.200
350,000 years. Whatever it is, there's going to be something next. Yeah.

414
00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:29.840
You know, whatever it is, it's coming, right?

415
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.550
It's going to be something that can survive this.

416
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.130
So if this stuff can figure out how to cool itself,

417
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:39.380
it'll become self's freelancer. It may be star child,

418
00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:42.950
a huge age. I met ACE really when I was seven years old.

419
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:47.900
He's completely stable. Uh, yeah, I for sure. He's a lot like you.

420
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:52.370
Who thinks the world's going to end in 400 years? I'm such an idiot.

421
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.980
Why did I say that out loud? I'm going to be here at the end of the bad thing.

422
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:56.540
I don't think the world's gonna end,

423
00:24:56.541 --> 00:25:00.110
but I think it's very likely the human beings will be drastically diminished.

424
00:25:00.111 --> 00:25:03.440
Absolutely. And I feel like that's the, I guess I should back up.

425
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.220
That's my point.

426
00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:08.540
The thing that we just are so arrogant about is that we're somehow included in

427
00:25:08.541 --> 00:25:12.290
the future. We're just not included or not included. We've only been here for,

428
00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:16.760
again, 300 whatever thousand years. Right. That's not that long. Yeah. You know,

429
00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:21.170
I mean, even the Andrew talls half a million years before us. Right.

430
00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.730
So going back to now though,

431
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.920
and us getting along now and surviving better over the next little bit,

432
00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:32.360
going back to our, like the people talking to each other, how do we, you know,

433
00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:34.670
how do we tee this up?

434
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.730
Somebody can take it and not ruin it with a reality TV show. Cause they,

435
00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:43.130
you know, that every reality TV show you see it's been manipulated. You know,

436
00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.153
they'll, they'll,

437
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.420
they'll poke the person that they know is going to blow up at some point.

438
00:25:47.421 --> 00:25:51.050
So that causes drama. And again, the dopamine dump, everybody say, Oh my God,

439
00:25:51.051 --> 00:25:53.810
yeah, they're basically doing clickbait in terms of how they're programming the

440
00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:57.400
telegraphy. So how do we, how do we make this so that it's not a,

441
00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:00.650
an opportunity to make a Bach and to do that,

442
00:26:00.651 --> 00:26:04.790
like the genuine healing moment.

443
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:05.773
It can be done.

444
00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.890
I think it's gotta be done online and it's gotta be done with no one involved

445
00:26:09.891 --> 00:26:13.430
other than you and whoever you want to be involved.

446
00:26:13.431 --> 00:26:17.540
No advertising doing that. I mean, that doesn't even have to be you, right?

447
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:22.100
But whoever the person is, right, that, that facilitates this. Right.

448
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:25.460
But you just can't have any producers.

449
00:26:25.461 --> 00:26:28.730
You can't have anybody with a vested interest in success. Okay.

450
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:33.380
It has to be done just purely for the idea,

451
00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:38.090
purely for the exercise of getting people to communicate that have disagreements

452
00:26:38.091 --> 00:26:40.580
and realizing that so much of what we know,

453
00:26:40.581 --> 00:26:44.130
people dig their heels in the sand and they want to be right more

454
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.190
<v 1>than they want to be. You know,</v>

455
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:49.440
more than they want to get along and be harmonious with you.

456
00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:54.780
<v 2>Right. There's a there. Yeah. And I feel like that's, yeah. Look, I acknowledge,</v>

457
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:58.120
uh, that there's monsters in the world. There's fucking monsters. They're in,

458
00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:01.030
they're in, they're in us. We have our own monsters inside of us.

459
00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.030
There's the other monsters that have been nurtured over years to,

460
00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:08.200
to hate each other or hate somebody else, whatever. There's that nurturing,

461
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:11.710
you know, nature versus nurture monster. I get that.

462
00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:14.410
I'm talking about the people that you can figure out a way to like, let's just,

463
00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.290
let's figure this out. Most of us, yes,

464
00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.570
most of us can figure out a way to get along. Most of us

465
00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:22.520
<v 1>go South to most of us in the wrong environment with the wrong people in the</v>

466
00:27:22.521 --> 00:27:27.290
wrong feelings, in the wrong drugs, in the wrong jobs, in the wrong community.

467
00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:31.220
We could be horrific neighbors or getting the Coke button. Yeah.

468
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:34.190
Or we could be a part of a community.

469
00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:39.220
And I just think that we're not designed for this iPhone fucking world.

470
00:27:39.531 --> 00:27:43.340
We're not designed for it. And this getting likes and you know,

471
00:27:43.341 --> 00:27:47.570
and arguing politics on Twitter for 16 hours a day.

472
00:27:47.571 --> 00:27:51.590
There's a few people that I follow on Twitter that I only follow them to see

473
00:27:51.591 --> 00:27:55.550
how, how toxic social media is to their life.

474
00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:59.780
I go and I look at their feed and I mean, I know what they're doing.

475
00:27:59.781 --> 00:28:02.270
They're just fighting with people all the time. But I'll look at it, I'm like,

476
00:28:02.271 --> 00:28:02.901
Jesus Christ,

477
00:28:02.901 --> 00:28:07.250
this guy started at seven 30 in the morning and at nine 30 at nine he's still

478
00:28:07.251 --> 00:28:11.270
going and he's posting every 14 minutes and he's probably reading in between

479
00:28:11.271 --> 00:28:15.800
that. So his entire day is comprised of debating, you know,

480
00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:16.883
a

481
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.740
OCS value in merits versus Trump and versus this and that.

482
00:28:21.741 --> 00:28:25.820
And whether or not Elizabeth Warren's native American and it's like, Oh, chaos.

483
00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:30.200
Just chaos. Trump Trump is a, um, he was,

484
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:32.720
he's got his name on buildings and [inaudible].

485
00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:37.900
<v 2>Oh, Whoa. He's the, he's the politician. He's not a politician.</v>

486
00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:41.650
He's drinking the swamp. Do you know what, that's not a big fan of politicians.

487
00:28:41.651 --> 00:28:45.160
Me neither. Yeah. He's an anti politician though. He might like him. Oh, okay.

488
00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.970
But is he in politics? Always the president of United States. Yeah.

489
00:28:48.971 --> 00:28:53.530
I don't like politicians. Yeah. So is anybody good at that? Who,

490
00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:56.290
if you, if you had a magic wand, you can make someone president,

491
00:28:56.291 --> 00:28:59.090
who would you make it? Oh, man. Um,

492
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.740
I wouldn't wish that. I wouldn't wish that anybody, yeah. Guthrie,

493
00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:09.580
uh, not bill Hicks, Ken Keasy. And although he would,

494
00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.390
cause that would probably change him. Um, do you think it would? Yeah,

495
00:29:13.391 --> 00:29:15.520
I think it changed. Again, it's like, it's a reality TV show.

496
00:29:15.521 --> 00:29:18.610
It's gonna change you when the cameras are aimed at you. When you,

497
00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:22.370
when you replace recognition with attention, it fucks you up. [inaudible],

498
00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.120
especially like at a young age or young, you know, like the boy,

499
00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:27.580
you know the Guinean boy band, like child actors.

500
00:29:27.581 --> 00:29:30.490
Do you know anybody that child actor? Uh, I, yeah,

501
00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:34.180
I know people that are exposed to that world early on and it's a,

502
00:29:34.181 --> 00:29:36.700
it's a dreadful mess. It's a dreadful mess.

503
00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.220
What they have to go through cause they don't understand that attention isn't

504
00:29:39.221 --> 00:29:42.020
that recognition. Uh, and there's

505
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:45.280
<v 0>development where there's developing new people that have actually made,</v>

506
00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.640
made it out of that. I don't think anybody has Leonardo DiCaprio.

507
00:29:48.641 --> 00:29:52.120
I feel like he's still an artist. Right. He's like, he actually, he actually,

508
00:29:52.121 --> 00:29:54.370
he, he holds his own as an artist. Yes.

509
00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:56.680
I don't know what he's like behind the scenes.

510
00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:00.760
[inaudible] like fucking shredding casts with his teeth cause he's out of his

511
00:30:00.761 --> 00:30:04.090
mind come out by now. Okay. Divorce thing. He does,

512
00:30:04.091 --> 00:30:08.860
he seems to like to fuck young pretty girls. Hmm. She's weird. Yeah. Uh,

513
00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:10.810
I just, I feel like,

514
00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.950
I feel like that that poison of the attention is,

515
00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.400
is kinda like that. It's like that dopamine done yet.

516
00:30:17.401 --> 00:30:19.600
It's the same thing if the likes the light buttons. Well,

517
00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.540
it's one of the things that I really admire about your choices that you decided

518
00:30:22.541 --> 00:30:25.770
to get the fuck out of the, the epicenter. Yeah.

519
00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:29.110
And like this is just too much gravity. Yeah. There's too much, just too much.

520
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:33.620
Um, so I don't know, just that's, and also like the,

521
00:30:33.621 --> 00:30:38.621
the decision to start a winery and to like what you've done is kind of gone to

522
00:30:39.191 --> 00:30:43.120
the earth. I mean, I mean it sounds corny, but really what you've done is that,

523
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:47.620
I mean, obviously you have a very sophisticated farm system and your, you know,

524
00:30:47.621 --> 00:30:50.350
you have acres and acres of vineyards,

525
00:30:50.351 --> 00:30:53.760
but what you're doing is the earth. You're growing, you're,

526
00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:55.000
you're part of nature.

527
00:30:55.420 --> 00:31:00.420
And I think that grounding in nature in that way that you're doing it is a

528
00:31:01.391 --> 00:31:06.250
perfect antidote for like this rock star life, which is all, but I mean,

529
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:09.790
you know, that's, that's a byproduct. Uh, I think for me.

530
00:31:09.791 --> 00:31:13.270
But as far as the community, I'm finding that that core of,

531
00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:18.190
of the greenhouses and um, you know, growing, growing vines,

532
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:22.000
it's actually kind of feeds into what we're talking about as far as the

533
00:31:22.001 --> 00:31:25.600
conversation. Cause I talked to, I talked to bat shit,

534
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.320
Portlandia types. I TERT you know, I talked to crystal clutches,

535
00:31:29.321 --> 00:31:32.440
I talked to staunch Republicans that, you know,

536
00:31:32.441 --> 00:31:36.180
look at me like I'm going to start trouble no matter what you know,

537
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:38.410
but I can actually talk to everybody because we're,

538
00:31:38.411 --> 00:31:41.710
we're growing things and we're building a small, we're building our communities.

539
00:31:41.711 --> 00:31:46.210
So as far as politicians are concerned, the ones higher up,

540
00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.870
they got there by being really good con men in liars.

541
00:31:49.871 --> 00:31:54.700
I feel like in general, that's what we see. But down, you know, at this level,

542
00:31:54.701 --> 00:31:55.690
at the local level,

543
00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:59.410
you're just trying to figure out simple problems that you're trying to solve

544
00:31:59.411 --> 00:32:03.520
within your state, within your County, within your town. Those politicians are,

545
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:08.470
you know, you've got to work with them, but they're less crazy. They're less,

546
00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.030
um, owned as more.

547
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.260
So you can actually have conversations with all these people,

548
00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:18.400
especially if you have a grounding in terms of literally the ground,

549
00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:22.490
you literally the ground, I mean your, this. I just think there's something,

550
00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.050
it's, it's,

551
00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:28.450
it's a part of the whole human experience of growing things. Yeah,

552
00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:33.460
I agree. Yeah. I mean I think what you've done is pretty bad ass.

553
00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:38.560
It's the ultimate smart move, you know, in terms of like dealing with the,

554
00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:43.370
especially like the rock star world is so strange cause it's so image-based with

555
00:32:43.371 --> 00:32:44.840
so many, you know,

556
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:48.830
I mean there's a bunch that don't even want to talk or have had rock stars that

557
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:50.210
wanted to come on here,

558
00:32:50.211 --> 00:32:54.920
but they wanted to only do it at night and they only wanted to have it with no

559
00:32:54.921 --> 00:32:58.860
video. They didn't wanted it to be audio only. And I'm like [inaudible]

560
00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:02.460
would I want stick? I just didn't want it to be me.

561
00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:06.680
It was like they were cultivating a thing. It has to be dark in the room.

562
00:33:06.681 --> 00:33:11.330
I want candles. Like okay I'm out. We're out, we're gone. This is not, yeah,

563
00:33:11.331 --> 00:33:15.920
that's not, but you know, I remember that they probably,

564
00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:18.180
they were probably messed up the reason there. Yeah.

565
00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:22.190
The reason they're doing what they're doing is because something happened to

566
00:33:22.191 --> 00:33:25.610
them earlier on and whether it's like, you know, an aggressive, you know,

567
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.230
teacher, uncle, somebody that just kind of, you know, uh, dad was drunk,

568
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:35.000
you know, there's the stuff that pushes them in that direction, uh, to be,

569
00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:39.860
you know, X tress of controlling and, you know,

570
00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:45.100
wanting to be acknowledged and do it exactly my way because I was powerless as a

571
00:33:46.431 --> 00:33:48.320
child. Yeah, for sure Ryan.

572
00:33:48.321 --> 00:33:50.960
And then that's the thing you think you see with actors too,

573
00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.910
and they finally get some success. The,

574
00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:57.620
the whole process of auditioning for things is so brutal because you just,

575
00:33:57.621 --> 00:33:59.630
do you like me? Do you like me? I want you to like me.

576
00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:01.080
Do I get the part at target?

577
00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.750
And then you go through this for years and then finally you do get it.

578
00:34:05.751 --> 00:34:09.060
And then finally you're the fucking man. Like, Oh look, it's Mike.

579
00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:12.250
Mike is the star. Hello Mike. Mike, look, look, we've got your,

580
00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.330
your bagels ready, Mike and you trailers ready.

581
00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:18.740
And then Mike is get me a fucking coffee. Like, Oh, Mike, anything for you.

582
00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.120
And the people act in this rude, disproportionate, very insane way.

583
00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:26.180
And then as they get more and more famous, they,

584
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:30.740
they feel like they're entitled to this treatment. Yes. She gets real strange,

585
00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:35.840
you know, and that I've, and I feel like that's, I've seen it in our world, uh,

586
00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:39.410
between bands. You know, my bands tool, Pulitzer for a perfect school,

587
00:34:39.411 --> 00:34:43.700
all of them you get to, you get to spots where you, you feel entitled,

588
00:34:43.701 --> 00:34:46.550
you're arrogant, you are greedy. Like all those things,

589
00:34:46.551 --> 00:34:47.870
all those things are in all of us.

590
00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:51.290
And you have to check yourself when they come up. Yeah. Or not.

591
00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.840
And you end up being like the bands that you, you are talking about. Yeah.

592
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:58.520
It has to be. This wound won't do it. That's kinda dumb. But well,

593
00:34:58.521 --> 00:35:00.140
bands are odd too, right?

594
00:35:00.141 --> 00:35:04.700
Because you're managing personalities. You're not just,

595
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:08.780
it's not just like one person with a creative vision and they put it down.

596
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:11.300
You have all these other people.

597
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:16.690
And their ideas and you gotta work it out together and there's all sorts of

598
00:35:17.241 --> 00:35:21.290
weird shit going on. Right. Sorry. What'd you do? He shut it off.

599
00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:26.300
Checking my likes. Um, no,

600
00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:29.810
I was just making sure cause I posted that and do you know what?

601
00:35:29.811 --> 00:35:33.770
I just want to make sure Dino knew that we posted it cause then he can talk to

602
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:37.320
release the hounds release downs. Yeah. Um,

603
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.880
a lot of weight lifted off my chest. Like just is it? Yeah. Yeah. It took,

604
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.340
that's a lot of work are we are,

605
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:47.340
the four of us are a lot of fucking work and just to get it,

606
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:52.440
just to get anywhere, um, just to get an agreement where you're okay.

607
00:35:52.441 --> 00:35:54.870
We're all agreeing. Yeah. We're gonna release it. Yeah.

608
00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:58.230
Everything's a fucking committee meeting and it always gets shut down.

609
00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:03.900
What's the hurdle? Uh, well, uh, success.

610
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:08.550
And when you get successful you think you're right about everything and you're

611
00:36:08.551 --> 00:36:11.160
pretty sure as that individual, you know,

612
00:36:11.161 --> 00:36:14.640
I am right and you are wrong because I am successful and we're successful

613
00:36:14.641 --> 00:36:18.840
because of me, not because of you. And so you, it's not that bad with us,

614
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:22.230
but I'm just, it's like those, that's the dynamic. There's a dynamic of like,

615
00:36:22.231 --> 00:36:24.120
you know, I want this and I've,

616
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:27.660
I've always gotten my way and that's why we're successful is because I don't

617
00:36:27.661 --> 00:36:32.400
compromise on this or that. And it's like, I, you know, I'm, I'm the same way.

618
00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:37.490
Do you find that as a parent you sort of have more empathy for like fucked up

619
00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.630
behavior and thinking? Cause you kind of understand like, Oh you,

620
00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:46.710
you got bad data as a a developing unit. Yeah.

621
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:50.910
You were fed the wrong food or the wrong information rather, you know,

622
00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.640
I think mental food will be, I think we discussed this before,

623
00:36:53.641 --> 00:36:55.950
like I think there's a 50 50 on that. Like you can,

624
00:36:55.951 --> 00:36:57.420
you can only guide your kids so much.

625
00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:58.830
They're going to be what they're going to be,

626
00:36:58.890 --> 00:37:00.570
they're going to grow up the way they want to grow up.

627
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.390
But you can try to do is go like, okay,

628
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:07.170
let's just teach you about stoves before you actually have to learn about stoves

629
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:10.260
the wrong way, you know, like the house on fire. Yeah.

630
00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.840
So you can kind of do some of that stove work early,

631
00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:15.930
but eventually they're going to have to do some of that stove work on their own.

632
00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:20.820
But a instructor in our high school, which is funny cause I,

633
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:24.810
you know, we are, he's extreme Republican. I'm, you know, the liberal kid.

634
00:37:24.811 --> 00:37:29.450
But um, he used to share a lot of really, you know, nuggets, right? Uh,

635
00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.880
wisdom. Uh, and he would always have a say. You know,

636
00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:36.930
what is an intelligent person? A person who learns from experience,

637
00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:40.930
who experience other people's experience, right.

638
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.460
Not just your own learn from you on experiences,

639
00:37:44.461 --> 00:37:48.060
but also pay attention that you don't really need to play Russian roulette to

640
00:37:48.061 --> 00:37:51.360
find out. It ends wrong. Don't get close to the bison at Yellowstone.

641
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:55.890
Don't try to get a selfie with the BICE. See the video? No.

642
00:37:55.891 --> 00:37:58.950
Was it [inaudible] year old kid? The whole fucking family.

643
00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:03.860
They apparently got within five yards of this fucking bison. Know that, Oh,

644
00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:04.441
come on.

645
00:38:04.441 --> 00:38:07.890
And then the bison charge and the nine year old kid went flying through the air.

646
00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.070
The thing about the nine year old kid landing though it seems like she landed on

647
00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:14.070
her feet, so I'm hoping she was okay. I haven't read anything to the contrary,

648
00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:17.010
so in my mind she brushed it off and she's like, Whoa,

649
00:38:17.011 --> 00:38:19.630
can't believe I flipped like that. Well, I mean it's like, you know,

650
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:23.940
if she survived, maybe a broken bone would be a good reminder. Yeah.

651
00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:27.140
Sprained ankle. I want the kid to have a sprained ankle, but I just,

652
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:27.871
I don't even want the kid.

653
00:38:27.871 --> 00:38:31.920
I want the fucking parent to get one of those weird diseases like when a twin

654
00:38:31.921 --> 00:38:35.230
falls down. You heard disease? No. Okay. It's like

655
00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.450
<v 1>the moms. Got it. Here it is.</v>

656
00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:41.800
We'll watch your show you this bison just to leave the newscaster. Boom.

657
00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.830
See how she lands on her feet though? I'm pretty, I'm pretty sure she's okay.

658
00:38:44.831 --> 00:38:49.270
I watch this. Whoop bang. I think she's all right. I think she's all right.

659
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:53.710
The thing is, did it trample her after these fucking assholes?

660
00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:59.010
This is the problem with zoos people and this city life that we live where

661
00:38:59.231 --> 00:39:03.430
people do not know what the fuck a wild animal really is. Yeah.

662
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:05.500
You're not supposed to go anywhere near those things.

663
00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:10.620
We're gonna find out they have instincts to stop predation and their instinct is

664
00:39:10.901 --> 00:39:13.590
to charge head force with this fucking 250

665
00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:16.850
<v 2>do it with a red shirt on too. Like, didn't you watch asshole?</v>

666
00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:18.253
<v 1>You should have juked him.</v>

667
00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:23.900
She stepped in for the little kid you piece of shit got over here.

668
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:25.330
You fuck? I mean,

669
00:39:25.331 --> 00:39:29.440
it's a 2000 pound gigantic animal that has to fight off wolves and mountain

670
00:39:29.441 --> 00:39:33.450
lions and bears and yeah, you're going to have your kid five yards away from it.

671
00:39:33.451 --> 00:39:34.070
Right.

672
00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:38.520
<v 2>I, I, you know, we've had a lot of friends, the musician friends that go, yeah,</v>

673
00:39:38.521 --> 00:39:41.970
I want to come out, man, I want to work harvest. You really don't know.

674
00:39:41.971 --> 00:39:45.360
You don't want to work. You really don't want to do this. I mean, I want you to,

675
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:48.990
and I can make it a pleasant experience for you. I absolutely can.

676
00:39:48.991 --> 00:39:50.430
I can make it go fairly seamless.

677
00:39:50.431 --> 00:39:53.370
But you're going to learn some things that you didn't know about yourself. Fact,

678
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:57.090
well, you have to work hours. Yeah. Real. Yeah.

679
00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.300
That's why we can't go to dinner tonight. We've got apples waiting. I got,

680
00:40:00.301 --> 00:40:03.450
I have some Chardonnay already fermenting. You have an apples.

681
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:06.240
I am going to make cider in the morning. That's what we're, so what do you,

682
00:40:06.241 --> 00:40:09.930
do you pick the apples now? Yeah, I have it on in the morning about 40 trees.

683
00:40:09.931 --> 00:40:14.520
My dad and Randy, uh, she's kind of in charge of the orchards and venue, uh,

684
00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:17.040
greenhouses. You saw the, you saw some of the greenhouse footage,

685
00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.830
GI Randy's doing that. Uh, so my dad and her, uh,

686
00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:24.120
picked probably about a half a ton, maybe a ton of apples already off our trees.

687
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.990
So I get back, uh, you know, tonight I fly back tonight and then, um,

688
00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:31.020
in the morning, uh, we're shredding,

689
00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:35.820
shredding apples into a bin like Apple sauce and going to inoculate it and uh,

690
00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.740
inoculated with what uh, I have,

691
00:40:37.741 --> 00:40:40.720
I already have some Chardonnay that's fermenting so I'll take like a gallon of,

692
00:40:40.721 --> 00:40:42.690
of the Chardonnay and just put it in with the,

693
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:46.880
with the Apple so that it will just start different bacteria from the shards

694
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:49.920
name the yeast. The yeast is already fermenting it. Wow. That's badass.

695
00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:53.220
So I'll use [inaudible] with something that's already, it's a wild, jeez,

696
00:40:53.221 --> 00:40:55.860
that's already fermenting. And so putting them with those,

697
00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.660
let it let it the finish up. And do you do this at a stable temperature?

698
00:41:00.661 --> 00:41:03.440
Like does it have to be, we'd know we normally keep the cider.

699
00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:05.340
We've been kind of keeping it like, you know,

700
00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:10.080
70 68 and in a cool room. Not out in the sun.

701
00:41:10.081 --> 00:41:13.380
Hot and not back in the cold, cold, cold room kind of, you know,

702
00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:18.000
60 between 65 and 72. How much cider will you make with all that?

703
00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:21.230
How much did you say out did? Half a ton. We did Logan.

704
00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:24.210
There's models and there's more, there's more apples coming, so we'll have,

705
00:41:24.211 --> 00:41:28.710
we'll probably end up with out about eight barrels worth of cider there.

706
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.780
And that's about good Lord 200 cases number,

707
00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:37.970
still about 300 cans and they got 300 300 flats of cans.

708
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:42.020
So yeah.

709
00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:45.650
So it's fairly limited production in terms of like commercially Oh yeah,

710
00:41:45.651 --> 00:41:48.110
I wouldn't, it's not going to be commercial. It just be in our tasting rooms.

711
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:51.260
Oh, that's cool. Yeah. Wow.

712
00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:55.910
And so how long is the process? How long does it have to ferment? Once we're,

713
00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:57.350
once they're picked, we can actually,

714
00:41:57.351 --> 00:42:00.230
the cool thing about apples is they kind of keep kind of just kind of stack them

715
00:42:00.231 --> 00:42:01.280
up in the, in the,

716
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:05.930
in the walk in cooler on site and then we gather them all up when there's a

717
00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:10.280
critical mass, bring them in, shred them so that Dan will shred them.

718
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:13.370
Probably about a week and a half later, the fermentation's done.

719
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:17.780
The hard part is separating the, the Apple sauce from the juice.

720
00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:22.160
That's, that's hard part. So a lot of people get them super ripe and they,

721
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.810
they crush and press them.

722
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:27.710
So they just get the juice right off the most and they ferment just the juice.

723
00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.050
Other people will shred them.

724
00:42:30.051 --> 00:42:33.440
So there's just like Apple sauce and then they'll try to press that through a

725
00:42:33.441 --> 00:42:35.960
very specific press that kind of gets the juice away from the,

726
00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:39.490
what's the benefit of the former versus the latter? I do the third one, I,

727
00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:42.550
I make it, I shred it. So there's Apple sauce and a mess.

728
00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:46.190
You're fermenting on the app? On the mosque? On the Apple sauce. Hmm.

729
00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:50.390
And then I press as a starts to separate. I'm starting to pull the juice out.

730
00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:52.470
Uh, wants this fermented. No.

731
00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:55.550
Have you done this because you tried the other methods and you like the flavor

732
00:42:55.551 --> 00:42:59.390
of this one better? Uh, so how many times you've guessed a guess?

733
00:42:59.391 --> 00:43:02.030
I've done this. 40. Right.

734
00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:07.160
That's because I'm a liar and I'm good at it. Um, no,

735
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.760
I've done it once. Uh,

736
00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:13.800
and it turned out so because I want to make sure that that wasn't an accident.

737
00:43:14.830 --> 00:43:18.650
I'm going to do it exactly like I did it last time to see if it turns out the

738
00:43:18.651 --> 00:43:19.760
same. And when you did it,

739
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:24.110
did you do it based on someone's recommendation or did you have I did it based

740
00:43:24.111 --> 00:43:28.930
on my, uh, my experiences with fermenting grapes on skills.

741
00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.150
I just kind of looked at that process and went, okay, I see I'm,

742
00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:35.480
we're going to get some stuff. And our, and our cider is extremely dry.

743
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:37.910
It's not a, it's not a sweet cider.

744
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.420
Your normally would think of like slightly sweet cider. This is like a acidic,

745
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.380
a dry cider. Very refreshing.

746
00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:48.500
And is this a side of it's available at your restaurant? Yeah,

747
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:52.850
the Austria down in Scottsdale at the convenience location in Scottsdale and at

748
00:43:52.851 --> 00:43:56.630
the QDC of settlers tasting and the Pulitzer for store in the forehead.

749
00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:59.030
If someone, where would, where would I go?

750
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:02.060
Where would I go if I wanted to try your food and drink your wine?

751
00:44:02.061 --> 00:44:04.430
Like what's the spot? Um, would you recommend? Well,

752
00:44:04.431 --> 00:44:07.250
the easiest one to take a trip. If you want to take a long trip,

753
00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:12.310
you want to go up to up to Jerome and a Cottonwood area to go to those

754
00:44:12.351 --> 00:44:12.830
locations.

755
00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:15.590
There are three locations of different things happening in each one of those,

756
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:18.080
but if you just kind of in Phoenix area,

757
00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:21.080
we have a location over in Scottsdale in old town Scottsdale.

758
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:23.150
So I'm definitely in feeling, what am I on Phoenix?

759
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:28.220
I've got about two nights in Phoenix at the coal America theater.

760
00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:32.760
There you go. So there you going to hit soon. You're gonna hit pizzeria Bianco.

761
00:44:32.761 --> 00:44:36.720
You have to hit there. You got to get Southern rail. A Beckett's table.

762
00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:41.940
Oh yeah. I thought that was like soon. Beckett's table Southern rail,

763
00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:47.070
uh, tar bells, a FNB, which is in Scottsdale. Um,

764
00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:50.940
Scott still has a reputation for cocaine and parties. Yeah,

765
00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:55.710
but it's also got great food. Yes. It's a very interesting place.

766
00:44:55.930 --> 00:45:00.930
It's got a lot of people just have escaped some of the problems in other cities

767
00:45:01.260 --> 00:45:05.490
and gone to Scottsdale. That is a fact. Yes, it's a weird place.

768
00:45:05.491 --> 00:45:07.260
I've always found it. We had a, we had,

769
00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:09.060
we had some decent success up in the Valley.

770
00:45:09.061 --> 00:45:11.310
Like what the vibe that we got with the farms, you know,

771
00:45:11.311 --> 00:45:14.700
farm to table and not just any farm, our farms to your table,

772
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:19.050
a vibe and the, you know, our vines to your glass a scenario.

773
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.750
But its funny down in Scottsdale like okay this is going to go,

774
00:45:21.751 --> 00:45:24.750
we did it and we're like we're going to do more makeup.

775
00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:30.690
I'm going to need implants. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah.

776
00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.340
It's a weird party town in that way. Yeah.

777
00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:37.770
It's like a lot of really pretty women but the specific kind of pretty like porn

778
00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.220
star pretty. The dudes are super pretty too. They're pretty too. Yeah.

779
00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:45.660
Handsome spike terr yeah. Oh yeah. They got the tan jacket and damn. Oh yeah.

780
00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:51.570
You guys tanning bed checking motorcycles. No helmet and on the edge.

781
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:54.870
Yes. I mean if you're going to be in Scottsdale,

782
00:45:54.871 --> 00:45:57.910
it's a great location but there's so many, so many great uh,

783
00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:01.740
chefs and restaurants in that area. There really are.

784
00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.250
And downtown and if you're going to be a Comerica, you're,

785
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:06.870
you're right by Bianco's. You've got a good Bianco's. What does that,

786
00:46:06.871 --> 00:46:11.310
is that an Italian joint pizzeria Bianco, Chris Bianco. Um,

787
00:46:11.311 --> 00:46:13.980
he's got two locations, town and country, and these got one downtown,

788
00:46:13.981 --> 00:46:16.560
but he also has his other place. Oh my God.

789
00:46:16.561 --> 00:46:19.410
I'm going to forget the name right now. That's so dumb. I'm so,

790
00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:22.380
I'm going to get so much shit for this, uh,

791
00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:25.920
his other place and right next to the other place, right next to, uh,

792
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:30.450
Bianco is at town and country. Oh my God. I'm having a brain fart. It's great.

793
00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:34.050
A handmade pastas and the dishes are amazing. Yeah.

794
00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:38.100
I'll check in with you in December. Do you remember it? I remember it by then.

795
00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:42.240
Gotta get off. This CBD oil man is, man, it's rotting your brain, man.

796
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:45.090
You can't be too relaxed, right? Yeah,

797
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:48.870
<v 1>that's CBD fucking, it saves vacations for me.</v>

798
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:52.560
I don't stress out like it's, it's, it's, it's,

799
00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.730
I think it's one of the best things I've ever tried for anxiety. It's,

800
00:46:55.731 --> 00:46:59.070
it's weird and I didn't even know I had anxiety until I started taking CBD.

801
00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:03.960
I take these little jammies. These are, this is a, this will fuck you up though.

802
00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:08.400
This is one in one. This is one part. CBD. Put this one. Yeah.

803
00:47:08.401 --> 00:47:10.500
This is not, put this in your book and put it in your butt,

804
00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:14.970
but you will get no nervous. You're going to get paranoid. But that's a,

805
00:47:14.971 --> 00:47:19.830
it's a weird like the CBD THC high is a different high because CBD does

806
00:47:19.831 --> 00:47:24.330
something to alleviate anxiety and sort of just makes you comfortable with your

807
00:47:24.331 --> 00:47:25.164
own demise.

808
00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:31.700
Lets you do the existential angst is flames don't seem so hot you like,

809
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:36.490
yeah, we're all going to die. Yeah. But right now we're not dead. Cool.

810
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:41.530
Look at the colors, feel it, feel the feel the warm, the sun. But this,

811
00:47:41.890 --> 00:47:45.550
uh, this is not like fun. This is not functional. Like you don't want to,

812
00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:50.560
I don't do this if I have anything super important to do, but, but just CBD oil,

813
00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:55.750
I just find it puts you in a great place. Okay. But I'm terminal,

814
00:47:55.751 --> 00:47:59.560
not topical. Internal. Yeah. Topicals really good for muscle aches. Okay.

815
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:00.430
It's really good.

816
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:04.480
Really the probably the best thing I've ever found for like alleviating soreness

817
00:48:04.481 --> 00:48:05.980
and stiffness and stuff like that.

818
00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:10.300
Cause I found I was in Europe all of a sudden discovered that they actually had

819
00:48:10.490 --> 00:48:15.160
ibuprofen like cream to put on ibuprofen is terrible for you.

820
00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:16.860
Right. Really, really bad.

821
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:21.520
And what I found out was that if you let your pets Likud they get liver failure

822
00:48:21.521 --> 00:48:26.130
and die. So don't, did you accidentally do that? I had,

823
00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:29.100
I had a person who works at the humane society. I mentioned, you know,

824
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:33.220
mentioned that I found this stuff like I just in desperation in Europe,

825
00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:36.160
like you had some sore muscles and uh, she's like,

826
00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:38.860
don't let your pets lick that. Cause they were trying to have,

827
00:48:38.861 --> 00:48:41.350
trying to figure out what these kittens were dying. Oh God.

828
00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.240
My friend Cameron Hanes is a runner and he runs marathons and he runs ultra

829
00:48:46.241 --> 00:48:49.600
marathons. He runs these 240 mile Moab,

830
00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:53.680
fucking ridiculous runs that last three days.

831
00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:58.240
And he was having like all this joint pain. So he's taken ibuprofen every,

832
00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:02.260
Dave ain't taking 800 milligrams, not just once, but sometimes twice a day.

833
00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:04.360
And he was just constant aches and pains.

834
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:06.980
So dr Rhonda Patrick had been on the podcast,

835
00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:09.970
she was talking about the dangers of ibuprofen and about what it does to your

836
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.440
gut biome and how much it fucks you up and actually creates inflammation and it

837
00:49:14.441 --> 00:49:17.560
actually can cause stress or it can cause a strokes rather,

838
00:49:17.561 --> 00:49:20.890
and all sorts of horrible, horrible things. So I call him up and I said,

839
00:49:20.891 --> 00:49:23.830
Hey man, that stuff's fine to take every now and then for a headache,

840
00:49:23.831 --> 00:49:27.040
but you can't take that shit every day. You just can't do it and you're,

841
00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:30.850
you're fucking your body up. Just get off of it. And I sent him the recording,

842
00:49:30.851 --> 00:49:32.980
he listened to it. He was like, Jesus Christ, I want to have a stroke.

843
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:35.380
So he gets off of it. All his pain goes away.

844
00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:40.000
It turned out his pain was being caused not just by the running,

845
00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:45.100
but by the fact that he was creating inflammation by destroying his gut biome,

846
00:49:45.101 --> 00:49:49.240
by taking 800 milligrams of ibuprofen two times a day.

847
00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:53.560
So the idea of like fixing himself was fucking him up.

848
00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:58.420
It's crazy that chasing that, you know? Yeah. So fuck ibuprofen. Okay.

849
00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:01.720
Well I mean, don't I take it every now and then,

850
00:50:02.110 --> 00:50:04.990
but you can't take it every day so you're a liar. No,

851
00:50:04.991 --> 00:50:06.310
I mean just saying don't take it every day,

852
00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:09.490
but if I had like a bad headache I'll take some Tylenol or some shit.

853
00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:13.650
It's not Tylenol, right? Advil. Yeah, though. Yeah. I mean it's, it's,

854
00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.000
it's just not something you're supposed to take all the time.

855
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:19.340
I did fruit all the time. Realize it was doing what you said. Yeah.

856
00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:23.350
Cause I was more achy than I should be. And then like, you know, bad night out,

857
00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:28.160
you didn't drink enough water. Right. Okay. Boom. Hit a come [inaudible] yeah,

858
00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:32.390
then you're fine. You can still do that. But CBD does that too. It's better.

859
00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:36.020
Better for you than all that stuff. Just seems to be no side effects. Okay.

860
00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:41.000
All right. The side effects is a, people think you're a hippie.

861
00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:45.230
That's the only side effect. Right? Right.

862
00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.590
If you say you're into [inaudible] I've just talked so much shit about pot and

863
00:50:48.591 --> 00:50:53.480
now I gotta cut off. No, I was just a part of an elaborate, yo,

864
00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:57.950
listen man, I smoke pot all the time and I talk shit about pot. It's the people.

865
00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:03.050
It's the fucking people that are really into pot. They're knowing they're,

866
00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:06.180
they're annoying you. This Eddie,

867
00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:09.680
isn't that any Rizzy Eddie that maybe is going to jump out from an adult table.

868
00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:14.720
No, I'm just kidding. No, this is a, I got this from, is this from Tommy John?

869
00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:17.600
Yeah. Yeah. Good Lord. That's a baseball bat.

870
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:22.040
Tommy John's not playing games and he wasn't doing this since the 70s and is

871
00:51:22.041 --> 00:51:26.120
still alive. It seems to be fine. Smell scary.

872
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:29.500
Like you just smell it and you're like, this is going to bring back memories.

873
00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:33.800
I don't want anymore. We got rid of those.

874
00:51:33.801 --> 00:51:38.180
Why are you bringing those back? The problem is dummies. The problem is not pot.

875
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:41.770
It's like the problem with every single thing, like it's the problems,

876
00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:42.620
not skateboards.

877
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:44.900
The problem is people want to ride skateboards in the edge of fucking

878
00:51:44.901 --> 00:51:48.750
skyscrapers. Right. Good point. That that's the problem. Okay.

879
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.330
It's like with everything. It's not.

880
00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:54.590
It's the implementation of the idea in a really stupid way.

881
00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:57.500
That's the problem, right? It's not pot. It's people smoke pot.

882
00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:00.440
It's the same day, but you can apply that to almost anything.

883
00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:03.290
Yeah know I hammer it guide or if you can destroy something,

884
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:06.380
whether you can build something with it. Exactly. So it's not really the hammer,

885
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.500
it's you. Exactly. Okay. Exactly.

886
00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:14.360
Some people that are functional on it all day, like be real from Cypress Hill.

887
00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:17.030
I did his show. He's got this hotbox show,

888
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:22.160
I can't believe how high they get their high all day long and then they keep

889
00:52:22.161 --> 00:52:25.700
going. We got so high before the show started. I was like, well,

890
00:52:25.701 --> 00:52:27.560
we must be done. We're going to go sit.

891
00:52:27.561 --> 00:52:32.561
He does this show called the hotbox and you sit in this a beautiful old Cadillac

892
00:52:32.571 --> 00:52:36.350
and smoke weed and talk about life and a, I was like, well surely we're done.

893
00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:38.330
We can't be smoking more wrong.

894
00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:42.440
It gives you these bats of weed and you climb into the car and it's just a

895
00:52:42.441 --> 00:52:46.370
fucking thick cloud of smoke. There's be real, he doesn't fuck around,

896
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:50.270
but he's lucid, completely functional. You'd talk to him,

897
00:52:50.271 --> 00:52:53.660
the guy exercises, he's healthy. He's real friendly,

898
00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:58.580
real friendly. Seems fucking V seems to work out great for him. Yeah.

899
00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:01.160
But not for everybody. Yeah. I'm like,

900
00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:04.620
I'm the pot guy that's under the table freaking out. Yeah. That's,

901
00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:08.720
what do you think of what bothers you when you get high? Um,

902
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:14.600
I think just paranoia. Anything. A noise, a thought. Uh,

903
00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:16.670
you know, they're trying to get me like,

904
00:53:16.671 --> 00:53:21.260
it's super like paranoid parents shouldn't have you just get a little box. Yup.

905
00:53:21.350 --> 00:53:25.800
What about, try a little bit of this [inaudible] CVB. Yo,

906
00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:30.810
<v 2>no, I take one first. I'll show you that. We're going to be fine. No, no, no,</v>

907
00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:34.620
Nope. Yeah. Thank you. Like, you know,

908
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:40.740
stick with line. Yeah. Did you fuck with whiskey? Yeah, I do. Um, I got a thing,

909
00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:45.300
a little collaboration with the, with angels on V bourbon out of Kentucky.

910
00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:47.220
They took some of my, uh,

911
00:53:47.780 --> 00:53:50.460
my fortified wine barrels and took them in there,

912
00:53:50.461 --> 00:53:53.730
finishing one of their reports and one of my barrels, a couple of my girls.

913
00:53:53.731 --> 00:53:58.590
Yeah. Ooh. So was port the same as whiskey port, uh,

914
00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:03.300
is a fortified wine from Portugal. Right. So, uh, you can also,

915
00:54:03.301 --> 00:54:08.290
they're a whiskey. They're an alcohol company. Yes. Yes. So angels MD is, is,

916
00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:12.470
is bourbon, right? They do Ryan bourbon, uh, in Kentucky and they,

917
00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:16.080
and they basically, they have a whole thing about their Angel's envy.

918
00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:20.890
Bourbon is finished in port barrels. Uh, so the guy, they'll find, you know,

919
00:54:20.891 --> 00:54:23.620
I have to get them from Europe or get him from California weather, you know,

920
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:27.420
they're afforded fide red barrel that's had wine in it,

921
00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:31.290
sweet rich wine. And they finished the uh,

922
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:33.000
the bourbon in these barrels.

923
00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:37.320
So now they have some of mind to do a special caduceus collaboration.

924
00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:39.630
You one of those people that I talked to that I go,

925
00:54:39.631 --> 00:54:44.010
where the fuck does he get the time? Cause I do a lot of things.

926
00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:47.010
But then I talked to someone like you, I'm like, no, I don't know.

927
00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:48.820
You do a lot of things. It's,

928
00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:52.350
it's organised into just organizing your time and delegating. Yeah. I mean,

929
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:55.470
cause that's really what it is, is when you get, when you're younger,

930
00:54:55.471 --> 00:54:58.290
you want to go, I did that, I did that, I'm doing that.

931
00:54:58.410 --> 00:55:02.500
And then you realize I can't do all of that. So we just, I have friends,

932
00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:06.600
we are our team of people. Like I can't, we have a poster for a store in Jerome,

933
00:55:06.601 --> 00:55:10.740
Arizona and it has cutting. So we do,

934
00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:13.650
we do printing and shirts. We have a barber shop in it.

935
00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:16.260
We do a full new and used vehicles. Barber shop. Yeah.

936
00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:21.780
It's weird for a ball guy barbershop. I don't use it. Um, except for you know,

937
00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.570
uh, the manscaping uh,

938
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:28.530
new and used vinyl on top floor with all kinds of perfect idea. Like, you know,

939
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:33.510
band stuff, but also like a whole, uh, kind of the gelato shop.

940
00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:36.500
Do people go, they're hoping they're going to run into you? Probably. Uh,

941
00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:39.990
but I don't run it. My wife does. She's absolutely, I couldn't do that.

942
00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:42.690
I couldn't do it at all. Right. Without her. She runs a top to bottom.

943
00:55:42.691 --> 00:55:46.110
All the ideas for all the posts are for merges all, it's all her. She does.

944
00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:50.910
She runs it. It's great. We just had it a popcorn machine. Oh yeah.

945
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:55.620
Yeah. It's just you do that and you get to to,

946
00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:59.910
yeah. How well here's the thing I do jujitsu.

947
00:55:59.911 --> 00:56:03.210
I just don't do it very well cause I don't focus on it all day.

948
00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:07.110
I've learned about your jujitsu over the years and now I'm doing a little bit of

949
00:56:07.111 --> 00:56:11.700
Moitai. Um, I suck at that too, but I'm doing some, I bought a bag.

950
00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:16.800
Yeah. Gloves. What kind of bag? Uh, the fair protects right tax. Yeah.

951
00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:18.000
That's a good bag for you.

952
00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:22.410
Especially you've had some hip issues because it's a very, it's a, it doesn't,

953
00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.220
it's not hard. It's a good bag

954
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.410
<v 0>to hit. I've got a couple of different bags out there.</v>

955
00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:30.920
Tall one was the one I want to have cause I got the shorter fat one. Right?

956
00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:34.090
Yeah that seems pretty heavy. Yeah. That's a different one than the ball.

957
00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:37.120
The balls good. Yeah. The ball snake. Yeah.

958
00:56:37.121 --> 00:56:41.710
The SAC one for knees that I'm the one that I have that heavy bag is great cause

959
00:56:41.711 --> 00:56:45.460
it's, it gives like it's good for tendons and stuff. Cause like a lot of people,

960
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:48.610
you hit those big hard heavy bags and you know,

961
00:56:48.611 --> 00:56:49.750
you can do that when you're young,

962
00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:54.880
but as you get older and you've got 20 years of blasting into bags, full power,

963
00:56:54.970 --> 00:56:57.550
after a while, your joints just start to fucking,

964
00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:02.350
they just start to say fuck you. Yeah. Well I'm finding that for me. Uh,

965
00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:06.250
my friend Todd got me into doing the Moitai cause he's like, look,

966
00:57:06.251 --> 00:57:10.030
we do jujitsu so much. And on the road you're like, you know, you got some,

967
00:57:10.450 --> 00:57:13.540
like we only, we can only find this black belt in town to train with you.

968
00:57:13.541 --> 00:57:18.490
And he's two 10 to 20. So, you know, trying to deal with this weight and like,

969
00:57:18.491 --> 00:57:21.760
I'm kind of sore now for the show and, and that's, uh, that's not good.

970
00:57:21.790 --> 00:57:22.750
The bed is not,

971
00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:26.650
if you traveling to the bed's never ideal and you're in the boss and you're

972
00:57:26.651 --> 00:57:30.760
bouncing down the road and some like, it looks, it's like a, a coffin, right?

973
00:57:30.761 --> 00:57:33.760
That has some kind of palsy all the way down the road.

974
00:57:33.761 --> 00:57:37.660
You're just trying to sleep. Um, so we, he went,

975
00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:39.183
let's do some,

976
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:43.840
let's do some white tie because it's more opening [inaudible] it's left shore

977
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:48.220
kind of going back and you're doing more twisting and just that rhythm and it's

978
00:57:48.221 --> 00:57:51.610
a good workout. Like it's easier on your joints too. So I, you know,

979
00:57:51.611 --> 00:57:54.520
I got into it for that reason just to kind of stand up. Right.

980
00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:58.450
And more so you have someone holding your pants for you. Oh he's got a lot of,

981
00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:01.300
you know, all over the world. He's got great trainers everywhere.

982
00:58:01.301 --> 00:58:04.260
So we were all in. And it's funny that you go into one guy and like yeah,

983
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:06.010
do this. What are you doing? Don't do that.

984
00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:09.080
Like the Olympic last guy said I was supposed to do that. And like you know,

985
00:58:09.130 --> 00:58:12.250
different trainer, different, different guys. You get a lot of that for sure.

986
00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:15.340
There's a lot of people that know for sure that they have the way to do it.

987
00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:21.340
Watching the infinite number of how you wrap your hands videos on YouTube.

988
00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:24.190
No bro, this is the way you, there's only one, only one way.

989
00:58:24.191 --> 00:58:25.060
This is the best way.

990
00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:29.600
My favorite is the ones you slide on and then you just spin it and they Velcro

991
00:58:29.601 --> 00:58:31.960
on. It's like got gel that goes over the knuckles,

992
00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:36.520
don't they slide on like a little glove. It's great. All right. I love those.

993
00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:41.050
It only has like maybe like four feet of actual wrap and then you slide these

994
00:58:41.051 --> 00:58:42.960
things on. You'd go like that, right,

995
00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:46.360
but they had me sitting there like [inaudible] the tube,

996
00:58:46.361 --> 00:58:50.860
like some guys get super serious about folding over the knuckles till you fall

997
00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:54.380
seven times and then you put it over the knuckles, then wrap it down.

998
00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:58.060
Then T through the fingers, bags for the glove gloves.

999
00:58:58.120 --> 00:58:59.530
The gloves are supposed to be the padding ones,

1000
00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:04.270
but you're also what helps is really strengthening your hands.

1001
00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:05.621
There's a lot of,

1002
00:59:05.621 --> 00:59:08.470
the problem that people have is that they don't do anything with their hands.

1003
00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:11.050
They just hit things, which is fine,

1004
00:59:11.170 --> 00:59:14.590
but to really reinforce the structure of your hand,

1005
00:59:14.830 --> 00:59:19.540
you should use those captains of crush grips smashed down those things. They'll,

1006
00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:22.070
they'll create better tendon in the hands,

1007
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:25.190
<v 1>strength of like a mullet and sitting like a Camaro and to do the hand thing</v>

1008
00:59:25.191 --> 00:59:27.860
like this. Those guys can't use the captains of crush ones.

1009
00:59:27.861 --> 00:59:30.200
Those motherfuckers are like 160 plus pounds.

1010
00:59:30.370 --> 00:59:32.880
Did you say he got one that's like one 90 or something? What do you got? Yeah,

1011
00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:36.920
that low. The level three is two 80 what do they look like?

1012
00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:42.280
It's like a neural steel pipe or aluminum outside and thick,

1013
00:59:43.251 --> 00:59:44.450
heavy spring.

1014
00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:49.340
It's like a hand gripper but it's like a real legit hardcore one and so I'll do

1015
00:59:49.341 --> 00:59:53.060
it this way and then I'll flip them upside down and do it that way and then

1016
00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:56.720
I'll, I'll also, I do a lot of chin-ups and a lot of stuff with my hands.

1017
00:59:56.721 --> 00:59:58.520
That's what it looks like. You've seen those fucking things,

1018
00:59:58.790 --> 01:00:03.320
but those are supposed to be like in a Camaro doing that? No. Okay. Not anymore.

1019
01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:08.480
Not anymore. Those guys are dead. Oh Jesus. It goes to 322 yeah. Oh my God.

1020
01:00:08.481 --> 01:00:11.800
Three 65 yet only like five people in the world I've ever done it.

1021
01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:16.270
That is so crazy. If that's according to what I was reading about them,

1022
01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:20.750
I've got the 140 pounds. So how far down do I go?

1023
01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:24.650
Let's say we start with the 16 start with a 60 year. Yeah, sure. Yeah.

1024
01:00:24.651 --> 01:00:27.770
Start with the 60 now. But I mean it just reps,

1025
01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:31.130
you want reps like you just want to be civil, sit around.

1026
01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.920
The idea is that they'd have like a 10 all this.

1027
01:00:33.921 --> 01:00:36.170
Most people I've met guys who are fighters,

1028
01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.860
like really good fighters that have small hands. I mean small hands,

1029
01:00:39.861 --> 01:00:42.260
meaning like the structure, the hand, I mean the meat,

1030
01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.210
the meat of the hand they have,

1031
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:47.480
they don't do anything where they're gripping all the time or polling all the

1032
01:00:47.481 --> 01:00:51.200
time. They're strikers. So they just wrapped their hands up and you know,

1033
01:00:51.201 --> 01:00:53.690
when you're just doing this all the time and throwing punches,

1034
01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:56.180
you're not really making your hand stronger.

1035
01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.120
It's the way to make the hand strong is you've got to squeeze tennis balls and

1036
01:00:59.121 --> 01:01:02.440
squeeze, you know, there's different putties that they may gazing. Yeah,

1037
01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:07.310
gripping Jesus. Fantastic. Doing, like if you grab a jujitsu guy's hand,

1038
01:01:07.311 --> 01:01:11.600
those hands are made out of wood. I like a really good jujitsu guy.

1039
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:15.140
Like in a lot of it has just gheez and G chin ups and shit.

1040
01:01:15.141 --> 01:01:17.930
When you throw theG over the chin up bar and do that, that's,

1041
01:01:17.931 --> 01:01:21.320
that's fantastic too. But when you do that, yeah. You don't fuck with that.

1042
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:26.910
<v 2>Just we'll see dude. I'm like, can you do no G or just G? I do mostly gay also.</v>

1043
01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:29.440
Yeah. Yeah. But I'm, you know, I, I've,

1044
01:01:29.441 --> 01:01:31.900
I'm finding on the road it's just traveling.

1045
01:01:31.901 --> 01:01:34.750
It's easier to do the no-gi cause I can rent that out and hang out with the

1046
01:01:34.751 --> 01:01:37.240
shower and just drive by morning. Do you, uh,

1047
01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:40.780
use special soap and you make sure you don't get any fucking cooties? Yeah,

1048
01:01:41.050 --> 01:01:45.850
that's enough. It's, it's crazy. Yeah. Cody's a real man. Oh yeah.

1049
01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:49.930
They kill people. Well, I noticed like, you know, uh, and it's been,

1050
01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:53.320
I remember as a wrestler you never really saw this stuff.

1051
01:01:53.321 --> 01:01:54.280
You saw a little bit of it.

1052
01:01:54.281 --> 01:01:58.600
But like nowadays it's like they're getting disqualified at regionals because

1053
01:01:58.601 --> 01:02:01.720
they've got a spot on the back and they can't go wrestle and they've worked

1054
01:02:01.721 --> 01:02:06.070
their whole season to get here and it's like, yeah, well we clean the math,

1055
01:02:06.071 --> 01:02:08.410
we do all those things, we clean this stuff. Like where did you get that?

1056
01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:13.340
<v 1>Well staff is in your body and particularly when people blow their nose,</v>

1057
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:17.870
you know, and they wipe their nose and their face and then they roll that stuff.

1058
01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:22.590
Your nose has all sorts of staph inside of it and people get staph in their nose

1059
01:02:22.591 --> 01:02:22.921
as well.

1060
01:02:22.921 --> 01:02:26.130
If they get an abrasion in their nose and that stuff gets in into your skin and

1061
01:02:26.131 --> 01:02:29.880
you don't clean it out, it's also your body has to be healthy.

1062
01:02:29.881 --> 01:02:32.760
And one of the things that happens with wrestlers or any competitive athlete is

1063
01:02:32.761 --> 01:02:37.020
as your body is going through training camp, you are building your conditioning,

1064
01:02:37.021 --> 01:02:40.050
but you're also also compromising your immune system. Like when I was fighting,

1065
01:02:40.051 --> 01:02:42.450
I used to always get sick. I had poor nutrition.

1066
01:02:42.451 --> 01:02:46.170
I wasn't really that smart about it, but I was always getting sick before.

1067
01:02:46.171 --> 01:02:49.770
Like big events also nerves too. Yeah. Nerves, conditioning,

1068
01:02:49.771 --> 01:02:51.720
all that stuff breaks you down. So with,

1069
01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:55.710
with athletes that are doing any sort of combat sport where you're getting

1070
01:02:55.711 --> 01:02:59.490
scratched and you're really susceptible to that stuff.

1071
01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:03.590
So you got to like defense. Stow soap is my thing. I've,

1072
01:03:03.591 --> 01:03:06.480
I fucking love that stuff because it's all natural.

1073
01:03:06.481 --> 01:03:09.990
You're not doing anything like when people use antibacterial soap on the hand,

1074
01:03:09.991 --> 01:03:12.510
the problem with that is that kills the good bacteria too.

1075
01:03:12.900 --> 01:03:16.770
What you want is something that really reinforces the healthy flora but prevents

1076
01:03:16.771 --> 01:03:21.140
all the, the cooties from growing prevent staff. Send me that little list of,

1077
01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:24.150
I'll have him send him. My friend guy Sacco runs a company.

1078
01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:28.260
He developed it because he was a wrestling coach and these kids were getting

1079
01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:31.260
staph and ringworm and shit and was trying to figure out what the fuck is this.

1080
01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:33.440
So he came up with these natural cures for it.

1081
01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:37.940
So I'll just tea tree oil and eucalyptus oil. It's just healthy. Yeah.

1082
01:03:38.070 --> 01:03:42.030
And after you train, just wash your body with it. And leave it on.

1083
01:03:42.031 --> 01:03:45.630
You leave it on like U S suds up, leave it on for a minute or two,

1084
01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:48.420
then rinse it off. And then if you've got any little scratches,

1085
01:03:48.421 --> 01:03:51.540
he's got some ointment you put on the old and it's all natural.

1086
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:56.160
It's all just good for you. Healthy. And then also as good as probiotics,

1087
01:03:56.161 --> 01:03:59.460
like anything, like I'm Kim cheese. Really good.

1088
01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:04.190
Kombucha is really good. Acidophilus yogurt's really good. He just,

1089
01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:08.430
so what about, what is it the that's in the kimchi that that works.

1090
01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.170
It's because they've, they let it go to a vinegar.

1091
01:04:10.171 --> 01:04:14.140
The vulva total acidity is what actually has the probiotics in it. Yes, I do.

1092
01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:17.700
I have all of, I'll let you, they have like 20 olive trees and so, you know,

1093
01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:22.650
we do the brine solution. It's, it's salt and vinegar solution that we're,

1094
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:26.490
that we're curing them in. Is that have anything to do with that at all? Sure.

1095
01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:31.490
The, the, the thing about kimchi is it's a proven health probiotic. Like it's,

1096
01:04:31.491 --> 01:04:34.680
it's one of those things that people have been eating for thousands of years and

1097
01:04:34.681 --> 01:04:38.820
it's just good for your overall wellbeing. I want to know more about this. Yeah.

1098
01:04:38.821 --> 01:04:40.980
So cultures, you know,

1099
01:04:40.981 --> 01:04:45.090
when you're eating these probiotic cultures and there's some really potent ones

1100
01:04:45.091 --> 01:04:47.340
you could buy that are eating, they're required.

1101
01:04:47.341 --> 01:04:50.460
Like there's some that you can get that, um,

1102
01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:52.400
they live on their own substrates.

1103
01:04:52.410 --> 01:04:57.090
So inside the little capsules there's enough of whatever they can feed off of

1104
01:04:57.091 --> 01:04:59.670
where they can be active without being refrigerated.

1105
01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:01.560
But there's other ones that you have to buy,

1106
01:05:01.561 --> 01:05:04.920
like really hardcore ones that you're getting that have to be refrigerated.

1107
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:08.790
Okay. But the, what I like about the food based ones is first of all,

1108
01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:12.060
they taste good. That can be a part of a meal. I don't have to, I like kimchi,

1109
01:05:12.061 --> 01:05:14.310
so I eat it all the time. Kombucha, I like it.

1110
01:05:14.311 --> 01:05:15.870
I drink it all the time and it's just,

1111
01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:19.210
it just reinforces all that healthy flora. Okay. You know?

1112
01:05:19.211 --> 01:05:22.480
And so it's basically got like little soldiers to fight against the cooties.

1113
01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:25.900
You just re, you mean you gotta think of your body as an ecosystem, right?

1114
01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:30.640
Your body is not just you. Your body is a host of bacteria. So much,

1115
01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:34.660
so much. So more eco lie living in your gut than I've ever been.

1116
01:05:34.661 --> 01:05:38.170
People ever know. It's all just a part of you.

1117
01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:41.740
So you just reinforce the good stuff and keep the bad stuff away.

1118
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:43.660
When the commune system gets compromised,

1119
01:05:43.661 --> 01:05:47.500
especially through hard training and then you get scratched in that staff just

1120
01:05:47.501 --> 01:05:47.890
gets,

1121
01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:51.700
did you get a grip on you and gets a hold of you and starts to go and then it

1122
01:05:51.701 --> 01:05:56.050
gets systemic. I mean fucking people die from that stuff. They really do staff.

1123
01:05:56.051 --> 01:05:59.260
In fact, especially that Mercer stuff, man, there's a,

1124
01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:01.510
you remember Kevin Randleman, the UFC fighter,

1125
01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:07.050
he had the most horrific staph infection I've ever seen in my life where he had

1126
01:06:08.021 --> 01:06:12.850
holes where he would lift up his arm and you could see a hole in his underarm.

1127
01:06:12.851 --> 01:06:17.230
We see his muscle all, I mean through the skin. Look at this. He'll show,

1128
01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:22.120
look at it, lets you see it up there. Good Lord. Yeah. Like look at that. Go,

1129
01:06:22.121 --> 01:06:24.790
go large with that. Look at that fucking whole,

1130
01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.560
that red stuff that you see in there.

1131
01:06:26.561 --> 01:06:30.580
That is his chest muscle and he died young man.

1132
01:06:30.581 --> 01:06:33.160
And I think it probably had a lot to do with that.

1133
01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:36.430
And I think what happened with Kevin is if I'm not mistaken,

1134
01:06:36.431 --> 01:06:38.050
he just let it go a little too long.

1135
01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:42.370
And that medication resistant staph infection, that Murcia stuff,

1136
01:06:42.371 --> 01:06:45.970
that's the scary stuff because that's stuff that's evolved in hospitals.

1137
01:06:45.971 --> 01:06:49.910
And then because of people using antibiotics and just,

1138
01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:54.130
I do my best not to take the antibiotics if I can, but if you get that stuff,

1139
01:06:54.131 --> 01:06:54.964
you gotta take it,

1140
01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:58.240
you gotta fucking lock you in a hotel room or in a hospital room rather.

1141
01:06:58.241 --> 01:07:00.640
And they just Ivy the fuck out of you and you,

1142
01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:03.930
I have buddies that were there for weeks. My friend Denny, his,

1143
01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:08.830
his knee was fucked. I mean, he has a, an opening on his leg,

1144
01:07:08.831 --> 01:07:13.330
like a salmon got gutted and they had a go in there and just pull out,

1145
01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:17.260
pause and constantly try to disinfect the area.

1146
01:07:17.261 --> 01:07:21.490
And he was in the hospital for a long time just dealing with his knee and this,

1147
01:07:21.491 --> 01:07:26.230
and this is Trump jujitsu, jujitsu, and he's a world champion. His, uh,

1148
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:31.470
his knee starts swelling up and he wound up going in to get it to them.

1149
01:07:32.050 --> 01:07:33.100
That here's Mikey.

1150
01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:37.570
So many UFC fighters get it and they wind up fighting on antibiotics because of

1151
01:07:37.571 --> 01:07:40.660
it cause they're fighting off. Kevin Lee, when he fought Tony Ferguson,

1152
01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:43.870
as he walked into the octagon, I was looking at his chest. I was like,

1153
01:07:43.871 --> 01:07:46.600
that is a staph infection. He's got a staph infection on his chest.

1154
01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:50.380
And he wound up getting staph apparently the week of the fight. And he was like,

1155
01:07:50.381 --> 01:07:51.760
you know what? We're just going to have to fight.

1156
01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:55.660
This is going to have to deal with it. Oh geez. But, but for him,

1157
01:07:55.661 --> 01:07:58.210
like for Tony Ferguson, when he's fighting a guy with staff,

1158
01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:01.240
like you can get staff from finding a guy with staff,

1159
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:06.310
get staff from other people too. Wow. Nasty. Yeah,

1160
01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:08.230
it's cooties. Let's not do that.

1161
01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.110
My friend Ari was limping around a pool table once we were playing pool.

1162
01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:14.390
He's limping. It's like, what's going on? He goes, I've got a spider bite. Like,

1163
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:16.190
let me say it. He pulls

1164
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:20.960
<v 2>up his knee. I go [inaudible] no staff. I unscrew my cue, I go,</v>

1165
01:08:20.961 --> 01:08:23.690
dude, we're going to the hospital right now. He goes, are you serious? I go,

1166
01:08:23.691 --> 01:08:26.960
fuck you. I'm serious. Like, well you could die. I go, that is huge.

1167
01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:30.980
You have a pissy filled up staff infection on your knee that's compromising the

1168
01:08:30.981 --> 01:08:32.150
way you walk. I go,

1169
01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:34.850
that thing is going to get systemic and it's going to get in your fucking brain.

1170
01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:35.720
Yeah,

1171
01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:40.310
and my dad got bit by a Brown recluse that's bad and he went to the hospital.

1172
01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:42.590
That isn't an area that has Brown recluse. Right.

1173
01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:46.160
I'll say you went to do no problem with our hospital. They're like,

1174
01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:49.370
you know he put some of this on there. He's like,

1175
01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:52.940
I think there was something else wrong. So he comes back a day later going,

1176
01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:54.830
what are these rings mean?

1177
01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:59.480
It means now he's got a hole in his flag that he's having to stick gauze in all

1178
01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:03.200
day long and take changing gauze twice a day and he still has like a dent in his

1179
01:09:03.201 --> 01:09:06.080
leg where it like it ate away. Yeah.

1180
01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:07.580
What could they have done if they caught it early?

1181
01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:11.360
Just giving me any Biotics and just send me out. You know what? We're not sure.

1182
01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:14.300
Just take this. They don't even do that. Like just take this,

1183
01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:16.100
make sure all they do,

1184
01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:21.350
all they had to do and it makes you nervous I think for a month as crater in his

1185
01:09:21.351 --> 01:09:23.420
own leg. It makes me nervous about the hospitals.

1186
01:09:23.421 --> 01:09:27.380
When you hear about nurses that get off on killing people every,

1187
01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:31.640
every so often there's some nurse who just gave people lethal injections or shit

1188
01:09:31.641 --> 01:09:33.830
and just go on. Movie makes a great movie does,

1189
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:38.660
but you know like by the way, if you're a nurse, I'm sure you're awesome.

1190
01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:43.400
It's not you. I love, I love nurses. I love doctors. I love all those people.

1191
01:09:43.401 --> 01:09:48.320
All healthcare practitioners and first responders and lawyers. Yup. Them too.

1192
01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:51.710
But there are some dirty people out there that are monsters.

1193
01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:53.720
Just happened to be nurses, right?

1194
01:09:56.270 --> 01:10:01.270
Spiders on the fucking spiders putting holes in your leg called my dad's spider

1195
01:10:01.791 --> 01:10:04.510
bait for a long time. You didn't live around Rouse thanks to you.

1196
01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:08.240
Got serious rattlesnakes where you live. Well then the rattlesnakes are pretty,

1197
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:11.110
they're pretty good. About just letting you know. Yeah. Yeah.

1198
01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:13.490
They just let you know. They just kind of go on their way there.

1199
01:10:13.491 --> 01:10:17.150
They don't really want anything to do with you. Yeah. The black a, the uh,

1200
01:10:17.230 --> 01:10:20.480
tarantulas, uh, same thing. They just kind of go the other way.

1201
01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:24.620
Tarantulas look terrifying, but there's only the docile. They're pretty cool.

1202
01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:29.280
Yeah, they're, yeah, they, uh, they just hang out then. Not like,

1203
01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:32.060
that's an attack. The Tragile Hawks you got to watch out for,

1204
01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:37.010
was that tarantula Hawk or was that a giant man be looking thing, bring it up.

1205
01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.390
Fuck these things.

1206
01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:43.520
What is it going to get a photo? Oh,

1207
01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:46.730
the world is so scary. My God is,

1208
01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:50.240
he had two people that bear the Florida and they are by sharks.

1209
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:53.570
I'm not sure which one it is. Somebody can chime in. Oh, Jesus.

1210
01:10:53.571 --> 01:10:56.960
That thing's big. Okay. Yeah, I've seen these things before. Yeah. Fuck,

1211
01:10:56.961 --> 01:11:00.590
that's huge. They lay, they, they find that your Angelo,

1212
01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:05.870
they jump on it. They infect it with their eggs. And so the trenches like, Oh,

1213
01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:10.520
I made it out of there and then wanders off and then dies.

1214
01:11:10.521 --> 01:11:14.130
And they did Laro come out of the land. Oh,

1215
01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:18.180
<v 0>nature. You dirty bitch. Yeah. So they're there.</v>

1216
01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:21.630
They're staying is like, you know, level.

1217
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:25.860
They're on top five winning a bullet and like that kind of stuff. Yeah. Yeah.

1218
01:11:25.861 --> 01:11:28.620
Like a, like a centipede. A centerpiece on the list.

1219
01:11:28.621 --> 01:11:32.130
But like not above centipede. Yeah. Really do these things.

1220
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:36.390
That's why you have one on you. Is that you bro, get people to bite. No,

1221
01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:40.230
that's me being terrified. A Senate. That's your right hand. Right am I know.

1222
01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:45.380
Hey, you know what happened now I have now my ring name. Yeah. I'm not set up.

1223
01:11:46.230 --> 01:11:48.570
Is the Senate bead. No. Send a pizza.

1224
01:11:48.571 --> 01:11:51.870
Just there's those things like that caused me to shriek. Like my grandmother.

1225
01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:56.960
I can't, I'm jumping up on a, uh, on a counter man love sat up.

1226
01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:02.380
Yup. That could, it's got a ring to it. I like it. I like it. Yeah,

1227
01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.290
they're creepy. I'll fight Tom cruise.

1228
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:09.150
Have you ever seen a centipede attack or mouse? No. Dude. But the, that, that,

1229
01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:13.440
so apparently the centipedes sting is not as intense as the,

1230
01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:17.100
as the tarantula Hawk from what I read. I don't know.

1231
01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:21.320
I don't know who's doing this, but there's, they need to like, I don't know,

1232
01:12:21.321 --> 01:12:21.961
a man where it hurts.

1233
01:12:21.961 --> 01:12:25.440
What hurts worth the tasers that the pepper spray get back to you at a certain

1234
01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:28.640
job? How do you know a certain moment, you know,

1235
01:12:28.710 --> 01:12:30.560
once you get to that bullet ant level, like, Oh,

1236
01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:34.440
it's supposed to be like getting your arm slammed in a car door for 24 hours.

1237
01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:36.570
Like, how do you know there's something worse than that?

1238
01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:40.020
You have another one that's really bad too. It's like, yeah,

1239
01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:41.580
we're fucking into it. Also,

1240
01:12:41.581 --> 01:12:45.600
$500 to get yourself stung by a tarantula Hawk and we'll see what happens.

1241
01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:50.520
How long does it last? I don't know this. That's the thing. This is, I did it.

1242
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:53.190
This is a crazy guy. He has a YouTube channel. Oh yeah.

1243
01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:57.520
What is that guy's name again? Uh, coyote. Yeah. What did he get stuck?

1244
01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:59.970
I was talking to him for a while.

1245
01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:03.840
I think we're supposed to get him on the podcast. What is his name again?

1246
01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:08.170
Coyote. What is channel's called gray Boulder. I can't remember about that.

1247
01:13:08.290 --> 01:13:12.960
Here he goes, Oh God, bang. Like he's doing it to himself.

1248
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:17.250
Get me, get me [inaudible] look at him. Wow.

1249
01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:22.080
I wouldn't even want to put that jar back on. I'd be like weeping. Whoa.

1250
01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:26.490
It goes on. No, coyote Wilson, what's his name? It doesn't say.

1251
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:30.720
It just says coyote right here. His whole name, he gets done.

1252
01:13:31.230 --> 01:13:33.840
Pope find out this gentleman's name cause I feel like an asshole now.

1253
01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:37.830
I already Peterson coyote Peterson. Why they call them Carly Wilson?

1254
01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:43.080
Let's look at them. They're [inaudible]. Oh, that is not wise,

1255
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:46.800
but neither is that leather hat he's wearing. So wow. What are you going to do?

1256
01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:48.720
That bracelets look questionable as well.

1257
01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:52.080
I think he said this was the worst of anything you'd like to tone pants on some

1258
01:13:52.081 --> 01:13:54.220
of the pants. That's the worst of anything he's ever done.

1259
01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:57.450
He goes and finds everything. That's the worst thing you can do.

1260
01:13:57.451 --> 01:14:00.630
And does the video like this? I watched him deal with it.

1261
01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:03.930
Quite a few of those guys. It's a what? A weird way to make a living.

1262
01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:09.300
Just get fucked up by nature. Worked for Johnny Knoxville. Hmm.

1263
01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:12.400
I want to show you a video of a centipede killing a mouse

1264
01:14:14.410 --> 01:14:18.650
<v 1>there. Horrific centipede verse typed in it as a whole bunch of things that pop.</v>

1265
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:23.230
Take your pick away. You want to go with mouse cause it's particularly uh,

1266
01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:27.790
aggressive in the way they attack mice. Go though. A third down, third down.

1267
01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:31.870
Watch this. Watch this. Smells like, Hey, I'm just a mouse. I'm kind of cute.

1268
01:14:32.170 --> 01:14:35.500
Just chilling, hanging out here in this weird blue floor.

1269
01:14:35.501 --> 01:14:40.450
I'll fucking Jesus Christ. The thing about Santa B's too is they don't just say,

1270
01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:42.280
am I hungry? No.

1271
01:14:42.490 --> 01:14:47.350
They know what they do and what they do is fuck up a mouse that is right out of

1272
01:14:47.351 --> 01:14:51.760
the movie alien. Right? Oh my God. Took the mouse is like Jade's

1273
01:14:53.670 --> 01:14:56.080
fucking J's ass. Look at him. He's already dead.

1274
01:14:57.790 --> 01:14:59.530
I mean that is God damn crazy.

1275
01:14:59.531 --> 01:15:04.060
The mouse is way bigger than him and he's burrowing into his fucking spine right

1276
01:15:04.061 --> 01:15:06.610
now. It's twitching and trying to stay alive.

1277
01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:11.770
The thing about it that's so creepy is it's not necessarily hungry like it just,

1278
01:15:11.771 --> 01:15:16.630
that's what it does. It sees things. It kills it. I'm like, Aw man,

1279
01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:18.970
I'm here with a mouse. Like a bison and a nine year old. Yeah.

1280
01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:23.680
It's like I'm here with a mouse in this weird little fucking environment that

1281
01:15:23.681 --> 01:15:26.890
doesn't seem natural at all, but I'm not going to think about that.

1282
01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:31.540
I'm just going to kill this fucking mouse. That's what's important. Not, not,

1283
01:15:31.541 --> 01:15:35.320
why am I in this? I pushed on me. Why did I do that now? Why did you,

1284
01:15:35.710 --> 01:15:38.020
cause I'm afraid of these things. So he put it on you? Yeah.

1285
01:15:38.021 --> 01:15:41.550
What else are you afraid of? You got divorce papers on your mom somewhere?

1286
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:48.070
No, I just, uh, you know, I gotta put something on,

1287
01:15:48.071 --> 01:15:51.620
I had a frond do some tattoos. I got, I have those snakes here. The Oh,

1288
01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:55.510
the throttle sitting on the things that you're afraid of. You put on. Yeah.

1289
01:15:55.570 --> 01:15:58.660
Well this side is a Dragon's cause I'm here the dragon.

1290
01:15:58.690 --> 01:16:01.590
But this is like where I like to make your work more of.

1291
01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:05.050
I don't know what that movie, you don't know.

1292
01:16:05.051 --> 01:16:08.110
The year of the dragon back would make you work before you went crazy.

1293
01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:11.710
All right. It's fucking great. I'm going to go Dean, Mickey Rourke,

1294
01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:14.560
Mickey Rourke and old. There's two different humans,

1295
01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:17.410
young Mickey working old Mickey Rourke. Young Mickey work was like this,

1296
01:16:17.411 --> 01:16:21.070
like super serious, amazing actor. Did fantastic films.

1297
01:16:21.071 --> 01:16:25.810
Like really good angel on that. Yeah. Angel heart. Um, what else?

1298
01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:30.430
So what ha so didn't he get like in a motorcycle accident and bonk his head?

1299
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:34.390
Is that what happened to Karen? Here's over the edge trailer of it.

1300
01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:37.960
Here's the trailer of it. I'm no, he became a boxer.

1301
01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:41.770
He boxed as an amateur when he was young.

1302
01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:46.630
And then when he was an actor, I think if I had to guess,

1303
01:16:46.631 --> 01:16:49.630
and I'm going just paraphrasing, I apologize if I got it wrong,

1304
01:16:49.631 --> 01:16:53.410
but I think he felt like Hollywood and acting, and I know he's quote,

1305
01:16:53.411 --> 01:16:58.411
he's been quoted on this was so fake and so with lack of a better term,

1306
01:16:58.841 --> 01:17:00.790
feminine. So it was, it was so,

1307
01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:05.260
it was so soft and bullshit that he felt like he had to do something real again.

1308
01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:10.140
So he started boxing again as a world famous movie star and got by.

1309
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:15.170
<v 0>I got punchy. He started sparring with James Toney. And a bunch of other guys,</v>

1310
01:17:15.171 --> 01:17:17.150
a bunch of legit boxers. And from what I heard,

1311
01:17:17.151 --> 01:17:19.370
James Tony used to just touch him up every day.

1312
01:17:20.570 --> 01:17:23.180
And of course you don't want to be that guy you can't hang.

1313
01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:28.310
So he's in there taking fucking jabs to the face and right hands to the face and

1314
01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:32.420
left hooks to the face and upper cuts to the face and his face got deformed and

1315
01:17:32.421 --> 01:17:35.630
then he wound up getting like cheek implants and a bunch of weird shit. Right?

1316
01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:38.920
You got a bunch of weird facial surgery and stuff and I don't like, you know,

1317
01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:43.340
he started losing his mind. But I think CTE played a factor there. I think just,

1318
01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:46.850
I think there's a, to me it's a logical correlation. It's like,

1319
01:17:46.851 --> 01:17:51.430
here's a guy who's this world famous, amazing movie star though,

1320
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:54.140
nine and a half weeks and all these other big time movies.

1321
01:17:54.190 --> 01:17:57.800
You miss out fucking blockbuster movie star and an interesting movie star,

1322
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:59.510
like a really good actor.

1323
01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:04.180
And then all of a sudden he becomes this crazy guy and in between them he's

1324
01:18:04.190 --> 01:18:05.930
getting punched in the face a bunch of times.

1325
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:09.770
Like it doesn't take a genius to make these connections. Right.

1326
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:14.060
I know a lot of guys that were pretty normal when they were young and then

1327
01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:18.050
somewhere into their MMA career, they lost it and they went off the rails.

1328
01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:21.350
There's a growing list of those guys growing. Yes. Yeah.

1329
01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:26.890
Some gals are on that list as well. Okay. Yeah, so it's a, it's the,

1330
01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:29.300
the gals are, there's, as they,

1331
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:33.230
as Ronda Rousey's opened up the door for women's MMA to become more popular,

1332
01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:36.530
that it's going to be more and more women that are taking more punishment,

1333
01:18:36.531 --> 01:18:39.290
including ones that you're never going to see inside the UFC just right.

1334
01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:43.550
And the other thing is like, just training. If you just decided to, I just,

1335
01:18:43.551 --> 01:18:46.280
I don't want to fight, but I want to train. Well that counts.

1336
01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:48.470
All that stuff counts. All those. Right.

1337
01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:52.970
So are you sparring when you're doing more time? Hell no. Thank you man.

1338
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.450
I love you just trying to get in shape and stretch, you know, get down,

1339
01:18:56.550 --> 01:19:00.080
help get the bike yoga. You fuck with yoga? I do yoga. I love yoga. Yup.

1340
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:04.470
It was awesome. Yeah, I do it on my own. Sometimes it's my hotel room.

1341
01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.910
That's how we do my, my wife and I, if she has an, you know,

1342
01:19:07.911 --> 01:19:12.530
she has the online service or would do that, but we are opening,

1343
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:16.250
I just bought a new place. You got a little bit of a fucking yoga school. Yeah.

1344
01:19:16.370 --> 01:19:20.520
Jesus Christ, man. How are you doing all these things? I'm not doing it. Ah,

1345
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:23.360
I'm past it. I know. But delegating,

1346
01:19:23.361 --> 01:19:27.320
how much bandwidth does that eat up to fact that someone else is doing something

1347
01:19:27.321 --> 01:19:29.360
that you're a part of and even though you delegate,

1348
01:19:29.361 --> 01:19:32.300
you still have to like figure out what that person is doing. Hey, why does,

1349
01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:35.450
why is our business going under? And Mike's driving a rolls Royce, like,

1350
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:37.940
you know what I mean? Right. Those kinds of things. Yeah.

1351
01:19:38.210 --> 01:19:41.270
Well I've got a lot of good people around me. We have a nice little community.

1352
01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:44.720
So you just stay chill, take your sandwiches, like drink your port.

1353
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:47.720
We just look at the, what's the, what's the business plan? Is it going to is,

1354
01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:50.590
you know, I think that's the, that's a, that's a,

1355
01:19:50.690 --> 01:19:54.380
that was a very good for me cause I, you know, we lived, uh,

1356
01:19:54.410 --> 01:19:57.350
lived within our means when I was a kid and Michigan, um,

1357
01:19:57.440 --> 01:20:01.960
my parents were high school teachers, which not a huge pay. Right. Uh,

1358
01:20:01.970 --> 01:20:02.900
so we're leaving, you know,

1359
01:20:02.901 --> 01:20:06.530
living paycheck to paycheck in a way that putting some money away, but you know,

1360
01:20:06.570 --> 01:20:07.920
grew on a, he would hunt,

1361
01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:10.710
<v 2>put meat in the freezer. Um,</v>

1362
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:14.520
but then getting into all of a sudden now you don't cut too many years later.

1363
01:20:14.521 --> 01:20:15.900
Then there's band and there's like,

1364
01:20:15.901 --> 01:20:20.190
there's touring money and there's stuff and you kind of lose touch with

1365
01:20:20.430 --> 01:20:24.840
understanding that most businesses operate on a 10% margin, you know.

1366
01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:27.960
So getting back to those kinds of things to look at this,

1367
01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:31.010
cause I'm moving my jujitsu Academy to another building and we're going to put

1368
01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:33.180
in the bag, we're going to put it on it. Kinda yelled at us.

1369
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:38.050
Or you want a goddamn jujitsu Academy too. Right. But you know, looking at it,

1370
01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:42.690
trying to make it work. It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a puzzle that's worth have.

1371
01:20:42.691 --> 01:20:47.280
It's a puzzle that's worth solving because if you understand how to survive this

1372
01:20:47.281 --> 01:20:51.930
thing on that microcosm that you can survive a lot of things, right?

1373
01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:55.020
It can make sure that when shit doesn't go the way you want it to go,

1374
01:20:55.530 --> 01:21:00.530
you've done the work to figure out how to survive in those extreme circumstances

1375
01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:04.040
in terms of business, in terms of, you know, you know, if they caught him,

1376
01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:06.330
he goes the way it goes. And if not,

1377
01:21:06.490 --> 01:21:08.220
we got greenhouses and then we have some wine.

1378
01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:12.720
So we'll eat some salad and drink wine and die. Happy.

1379
01:21:13.230 --> 01:21:15.420
Good way to think. But it's just,

1380
01:21:15.421 --> 01:21:19.110
I just can't believe how many different irons you have in the fire.

1381
01:21:19.111 --> 01:21:22.140
And I know you're delegating, I know you're, you have good people around you,

1382
01:21:22.141 --> 01:21:25.950
but God, that's so much. Do you ever think of simplifying?

1383
01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:29.490
Do you ever think like maybe I should just like pair this stuff down?

1384
01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:32.670
Like in a way we are, and I think this next couple of years,

1385
01:21:33.570 --> 01:21:35.970
the last couple of years has been that like establishing something in Arizona,

1386
01:21:35.971 --> 01:21:40.530
establishing the green, establishing the vineyards, establishing the businesses.

1387
01:21:40.531 --> 01:21:42.660
We've kind of branched out in various ways,

1388
01:21:42.661 --> 01:21:47.661
but I feel like in a way we're expanding to retract and wants me to figure out

1389
01:21:47.851 --> 01:21:51.960
what works. We're gonna bring it all back in, centralize everything,

1390
01:21:51.961 --> 01:21:56.070
make it simpler. Uh, and it's way more sustainable at that point.

1391
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:58.860
Right now we're kind of extended where all over the place kind of doing things.

1392
01:21:58.861 --> 01:22:01.770
But I feel like, you know, getting a few,

1393
01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:05.850
getting fewer rounds and getting some sparring in once, twice a week,

1394
01:22:05.851 --> 01:22:09.180
three times a week. Then you know, having the vineyards going on.

1395
01:22:09.181 --> 01:22:10.380
Cause that's hard work too.

1396
01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:14.820
I don't really have time to train jujitsu or do white tie or any that, you know,

1397
01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:19.590
but you seem to enjoy all these different varieties of experiences too.

1398
01:22:19.591 --> 01:22:24.240
Like Posa for perfect circle tool, vineyard restaurant,

1399
01:22:24.241 --> 01:22:25.080
jujitsu Academy.

1400
01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:29.340
Then it was like you seem to enjoy having all these different plates spinning.

1401
01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:34.470
Yeah. It's fun. Yeah. It's my dopamine. Yeah. If I'm going to have an addiction,

1402
01:22:34.471 --> 01:22:38.990
at least it's going to be some, some awesome kin community attached to me. Yeah,

1403
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:39.660
that's what I'm saying.

1404
01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:44.040
It's like you seem to enjoy having all these little puzzles. Yeah.

1405
01:22:44.290 --> 01:22:47.520
There's little things going on. Yes, absolutely.

1406
01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:50.880
The puzzles are important to keep you alive, keep you irrelevant,

1407
01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:55.710
keep you fresh. Yeah. Goals, positives, goals,

1408
01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:59.280
deadlines, harvest. Yeah. Yeah,

1409
01:22:59.430 --> 01:23:03.150
but know harvest is great because it's not up to you. Right? You're right.

1410
01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:06.040
You're have to, you're marching to the beat of a whole different drummer

1411
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:09.190
<v 0>at that point. And how do you schedule touring? Do you,</v>

1412
01:23:09.191 --> 01:23:14.191
do you scheduled touring directly by when your harvest season is and how the

1413
01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:19.660
wineries, I mean luckily with with tool were popular enough to where we can,

1414
01:23:19.661 --> 01:23:22.450
we can get offers, we can do the touring, you know,

1415
01:23:22.690 --> 01:23:26.440
anytime during the year nothing's going to really adjust or affect how,

1416
01:23:26.441 --> 01:23:30.010
you know, what we want me to make as a living for doing that touring.

1417
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:35.550
Something that I posted for way harder puzzle much that seems smaller.

1418
01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:37.360
It seems like it's not on the same scale,

1419
01:23:37.361 --> 01:23:40.360
but in a way it's more difficult scale cause there's less margin for error.

1420
01:23:40.990 --> 01:23:44.140
So when we tour with that and have to be a very specific way,

1421
01:23:44.141 --> 01:23:47.720
we do it because you got to make sure that we don't pay to do it. Right. Just,

1422
01:23:47.890 --> 01:23:51.520
just started thinking about that thing you did with w with, what was it?

1423
01:23:51.521 --> 01:23:55.000
Rhonda Rousey and who else was in mind? What else?

1424
01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:58.390
That guy you said was president. Oh, that guy. That's right. Trump was in it.

1425
01:23:58.740 --> 01:24:03.210
Yep. Oh, I bet my balls. And last year was that,

1426
01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:07.840
that was 15 those before the elections. I was like,

1427
01:24:07.841 --> 01:24:11.680
right when he announced that he was right around the time. Yeah. Yeah,

1428
01:24:13.170 --> 01:24:17.800
yeah. That was good. Yeah. We got a lot of flack. I was like,

1429
01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.030
what the fuck is he doing? Yeah.

1430
01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:27.050
Did you get all the different Ronda Rousey versions? No. They look like Robusta.

1431
01:24:27.130 --> 01:24:31.570
I know. We've got 'em uh, miss, miss, uh, Krissy cyborgs in there.

1432
01:24:31.571 --> 01:24:36.190
We have miss Holly home. We have a cat Zingano. We have, may we have Rhonda?

1433
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:41.320
I'm the hot one. It's hilarious. No, again,

1434
01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:44.550
where do you have the time to do this? I didn't mean it as a,

1435
01:24:44.630 --> 01:24:46.420
these are friends of mine who did the whole video. I go,

1436
01:24:46.421 --> 01:24:48.820
here's what I have in mind. Then they were like, okay, we'll do it.

1437
01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:52.360
I don't matter mate. I have no idea how to animate.

1438
01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:57.930
You got a lot of shit for this. Uh, not really. I mean, cause it's,

1439
01:24:57.931 --> 01:25:00.510
it's just pure. It's, you know, it's just pure comedy, right? It's like,

1440
01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:04.360
it's not, you know, whatever. I'm not, I, you know, I,

1441
01:25:04.370 --> 01:25:07.870
I'm political to a point on the, when it's like, when it comes to assholes,

1442
01:25:08.110 --> 01:25:12.900
so I don't, like most politicians are easy targets because they're your,

1443
01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:16.480
you already know they're lying right there speaking so that they're just,

1444
01:25:16.481 --> 01:25:17.830
it's good comedy right away.

1445
01:25:17.890 --> 01:25:22.270
I think the best comedy we've had in many years is pen Trump because he's just,

1446
01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:26.520
he sets him up for you. He does, but it's almost, it's, it's,

1447
01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:32.280
what he's doing is so strange because he's not even pretending to be what we

1448
01:25:34.481 --> 01:25:38.950
think of as a president. Like he'll attack people on Twitter. He'll go like, he,

1449
01:25:39.770 --> 01:25:44.320
it's weird. Crazy. It's weird. Like I wonder if the thing we talked about,

1450
01:25:44.321 --> 01:25:45.970
the 400 year line, okay.

1451
01:25:45.971 --> 01:25:47.920
This is me going back to conspiracy theories and there's,

1452
01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:51.550
eddies didn't sneak in yet that he knows that he's working right now. Alright.

1453
01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:54.940
Uh, so teach class, right? Um,

1454
01:25:56.290 --> 01:26:01.240
I feel like it's almost like that is the distraction to keep us all divided and

1455
01:26:01.241 --> 01:26:04.130
keep us all guessing what the fuck's going on. Yeah.

1456
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:06.670
<v 2>Maybe. Maybe, you know, if you're, if you're a good ex,</v>

1457
01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.300
if you're a good conspiracy theorist,

1458
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:10.930
you're gonna put those connections together. Look, look,

1459
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:13.610
the every show that's ever gone, like, okay,

1460
01:26:13.611 --> 01:26:16.250
well we find out that there's this meteor speeding toward earth.

1461
01:26:16.251 --> 01:26:19.910
We can't tell anybody. So if there's anything weird like that going on,

1462
01:26:19.911 --> 01:26:21.980
like there's a, there's a fungus that's gonna kill everybody.

1463
01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:25.850
Don't tell them just everybody arguing, get 'em like, you know, distracted by,

1464
01:26:25.851 --> 01:26:29.420
you know, you know, football. Hey, who's what, who's your team football? Right.

1465
01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:32.600
You know, just, you know, the bread and circus of it. All right?

1466
01:26:33.790 --> 01:26:36.050
You get caught up in having, you know,

1467
01:26:36.051 --> 01:26:40.310
having food and some gladiators and you forget about your civic duty. Right?

1468
01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:41.620
<v 1>Oh,</v>

1469
01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:46.620
that would have to be orchestrated by some genius component of our government

1470
01:26:49.091 --> 01:26:49.924
that does.

1471
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:52.430
<v 2>I think it's accident. I don't think anybody,</v>

1472
01:26:52.431 --> 01:26:53.690
I don't think of bass pulling the strings.

1473
01:26:53.691 --> 01:26:57.650
I think it's just like part of the progression of what happens just happens.

1474
01:26:57.710 --> 01:27:00.360
The Kaliyuga madness. Yeah. It just happens. It just,

1475
01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:03.470
so just because of the natural progression of where things are going,

1476
01:27:03.650 --> 01:27:05.090
it just comes out as a symptom.

1477
01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:08.500
<v 1>That makes more sense to me, that, that,</v>

1478
01:27:08.530 --> 01:27:13.270
that makes more sense to me than this grand conspiracy. I don't think there's,

1479
01:27:13.271 --> 01:27:15.780
I don't think anybody's that organized. No, I don't think so either.

1480
01:27:16.420 --> 01:27:18.090
I think there's chaos going on.

1481
01:27:18.130 --> 01:27:21.280
People capitalizing on that chaos and I definitely think there's lying and I

1482
01:27:21.281 --> 01:27:25.420
definitely think there's conspiracies, but I think more than anything,

1483
01:27:25.421 --> 01:27:30.421
it's just this is the way the world is turning right now because of just how

1484
01:27:30.461 --> 01:27:35.461
society is set up and how disconnected we are to the natural world and how

1485
01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:39.620
connected we are to the digital world. And, right.

1486
01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:44.060
<v 2>And there's, I don't think there's any way out, but I think in the interim,</v>

1487
01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:48.770
I feel like an attempt to reconnect is going to help.

1488
01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:51.370
<v 1>I think generally generationally there's a way out.</v>

1489
01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:54.230
The problem is for our generation, I don't know if there's a way out. Yeah.

1490
01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:59.760
I think especially people like us that grew up without any sort of internet and

1491
01:28:00.071 --> 01:28:04.420
then have watched it transform and completely take over the world,

1492
01:28:04.930 --> 01:28:09.220
whereas the idea of a world without internet is impossible to us.

1493
01:28:09.221 --> 01:28:11.980
It doesn't even compute. But we grew up without it.

1494
01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:14.710
So what happened while we were taken over,

1495
01:28:15.010 --> 01:28:19.540
were taken over by some sort of digital entity. Um, I don't think for us,

1496
01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:24.460
I think that this world has to be figured out by the people that recognize that

1497
01:28:24.461 --> 01:28:28.360
we fucked up. Like we were talking about, learning from mistakes,

1498
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:31.030
learn from other people's mistakes, where they're gonna learn from our mistakes.

1499
01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:33.940
They're going to learn from our mistakes and they're going to see people who

1500
01:28:33.941 --> 01:28:36.610
grew up just like, I mean,

1501
01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:41.830
just like every other really fucked up part of human civilization that people

1502
01:28:41.831 --> 01:28:44.650
have managed to overcome and avoid.

1503
01:28:44.651 --> 01:28:48.190
Whether it's slavery or war with bows and arrows,

1504
01:28:48.191 --> 01:28:51.070
like they've figured out like that was not the way to do it.

1505
01:28:51.130 --> 01:28:52.300
Let's move past this.

1506
01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:56.770
Let's figure out what the folly of our ancestors was and let's,

1507
01:28:56.771 --> 01:29:01.590
let's adjust accordingly. I agree with that. As long as we don't poison earth,

1508
01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:06.330
<v 0>as long as you don't make sane. If you're in Arizona, that's a hot spot,</v>

1509
01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:10.380
like actually hot and we got a lot of water there.

1510
01:29:11.340 --> 01:29:13.110
You have lots of water where you are.

1511
01:29:13.880 --> 01:29:16.410
Well just in general areas when it has water, that's what you know,

1512
01:29:16.411 --> 01:29:19.800
you try by those lawns and pools and Riverside and Palm Springs.

1513
01:29:19.801 --> 01:29:23.610
That's Arizona of water is a really, yeah. I thought that shit was like,

1514
01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:25.350
call it a filter. Yeah. Yeah.

1515
01:29:25.351 --> 01:29:28.560
You have all the mountain ranges around Arizona and down through Colorado.

1516
01:29:28.561 --> 01:29:32.940
All that kind of filters that way and that's that uh, the Salton sea,

1517
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:36.870
that's all because of that Colorado. Your fuck around with that place?

1518
01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:39.540
John just went through there. She showed me a bunch of photos.

1519
01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:42.960
It's pretty amazing. It's insane. Most people don't even know what it is.

1520
01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:46.920
There's an amazing documentary on it. She had just, she just,

1521
01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:51.030
she just bought it, so I'm gonna watch it. [inaudible] fucking crazy.

1522
01:29:51.330 --> 01:29:56.190
That used to be a place where everyone from Hollywood went like they would call

1523
01:29:56.191 --> 01:29:57.510
it the inland Riviera,

1524
01:29:57.840 --> 01:30:01.890
like California's Riviera and they would go there and Sonny bono while he was

1525
01:30:01.891 --> 01:30:06.891
alive was trying to figure out a way to detoxify the water and pass bills

1526
01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:10.530
because a lot of it is runoff from the agriculture from North. Yeah.

1527
01:30:11.610 --> 01:30:14.760
It's crazy. The people that live around there just,

1528
01:30:14.761 --> 01:30:18.630
it's just a rotten wasteland. Look at that. All the dead fish, the,

1529
01:30:18.631 --> 01:30:22.440
there's a seat around the sea. There are,

1530
01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:26.700
it's like sand, but it's white and it's not sand.

1531
01:30:26.730 --> 01:30:29.230
It's actually the bones of dead fish. Yeah,

1532
01:30:29.610 --> 01:30:33.060
but it's so prevalent that you would think that it's sand.

1533
01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:36.310
What a crazy ass place that is.

1534
01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:41.990
That's one of those places. Great. It's worse all the time.

1535
01:30:41.991 --> 01:30:44.540
And apparently if you're in Palm Springs during certain times of the year,

1536
01:30:44.930 --> 01:30:47.120
it WAFs over and hits you. Milly,

1537
01:30:47.150 --> 01:30:52.150
they have done dead zones where millions of tilapia will just wind up on the

1538
01:30:52.281 --> 01:30:56.270
beach dead. And just rotting and smelling through you.

1539
01:30:56.710 --> 01:30:59.510
Have you seen other grasshoppers in Vegas? Yes. That's crazy.

1540
01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:04.010
That's a good play Bible. Yeah. It's in the Bible. That is radar.

1541
01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:06.950
That's what locusts are. Locusts or grasshoppers. Yes.

1542
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:11.240
So the Jesus is trying to tell something, stay out of Vegas

1543
01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:18.860
or don't you can eat grasshoppers too. That's tasty.

1544
01:31:19.170 --> 01:31:22.430
Forgot about that part. Yeah. Well we will find a way to survive.

1545
01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:26.220
Do you guys have a those? A Havoline is an area. Oh yeah. How's it creepy?

1546
01:31:26.230 --> 01:31:27.350
A little fucker, isn't it? Yeah.

1547
01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:31.070
That will tear up an entire vineyard and one night. Oh, well they really, yeah,

1548
01:31:31.071 --> 01:31:31.904
they're crazy.

1549
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:36.550
It's like you see the lot of guys in Texas that the bore are like running wild.

1550
01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:38.750
So they'll give you permits and you in a helicopter,

1551
01:31:38.751 --> 01:31:43.130
you go over the BOR herd that's just destroying agriculture.

1552
01:31:43.190 --> 01:31:45.830
They'll go over and they'll, they'll try to thin them out, but it's, yeah,

1553
01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:48.080
it's just, no, there's no stopping it.

1554
01:31:48.081 --> 01:31:51.200
We don't have that much of a problem with the ham Lena in Arizona,

1555
01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:54.440
but it is a problem. Yeah.

1556
01:31:54.441 --> 01:31:59.030
Well that's at least a wild natural animal. It was introduced have Alina.

1557
01:31:59.350 --> 01:32:01.690
Yeah. Really? Yeah. I didn't know that. Yeah. By who?

1558
01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:05.410
What piece of shit brought that God damn thing. I had no idea. I don't know,

1559
01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:08.850
but it wasn't, it's not native to the area. Was it brought in? I th that's I,

1560
01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:12.910
that's what I was told. Oh, so I know that by, it's a peccary.

1561
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.120
It looks like a pig, but it's a peccary, which is like a cousin to a pig.

1562
01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:19.780
Like a rat or something between a rat and a pig somewhere.

1563
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:24.940
Doug Stan hope lives down in Arizona and he said his neighbor's dog got killed

1564
01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:26.680
by a pack of Havalina. Yeah,

1565
01:32:26.681 --> 01:32:29.320
because the problem was the dog chased the have Lena,

1566
01:32:29.950 --> 01:32:33.190
the male flipped around while the while the kids and the food,

1567
01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:36.620
the other part of the hurt took off and he went on.

1568
01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:40.360
Any like Gordon say it. Yeah. Cause I, we had a,

1569
01:32:40.361 --> 01:32:45.361
we had a Doug Argentina that almost died because a big dog and that and that

1570
01:32:45.731 --> 01:32:50.320
little not so little male have Malino whipped around and this like trying to

1571
01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:55.090
fight my Tyson. It's like it's this compact thing. Yeah. With spikes there

1572
01:32:55.220 --> 01:33:00.220
<v 1>really unusual animal to hunt because they respond to calls the way you wish</v>

1573
01:33:00.290 --> 01:33:01.970
animals would respond to a call.

1574
01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:05.980
Like if you're trying to call on an elk and you're like, man, they're like, Hmm,

1575
01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:08.870
maybe I'll come over there. I was not a chick looking for some Dick.

1576
01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:11.450
They'll get clothes and they'll,

1577
01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:15.260
they'll try to figure out which way the wind's blowing with a Havalina what you

1578
01:33:15.261 --> 01:33:17.510
do as you make these sounds like a wounded animal.

1579
01:33:17.511 --> 01:33:19.460
Like they have these little predator calls where it's like,

1580
01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:22.610
well you're making something. Like,

1581
01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:27.530
it's like something's writhing in agony and making noises and they sprint

1582
01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:31.070
towards it. And then when they realize that it's not what they want,

1583
01:33:31.071 --> 01:33:33.620
they try to turn around. That's when you shoot them. Right. But they,

1584
01:33:33.650 --> 01:33:37.700
they run like no other animal to a predator cause they live in this horrible

1585
01:33:37.701 --> 01:33:41.630
environment desert and it's all mountain lions and Jaguars.

1586
01:33:41.631 --> 01:33:43.130
And whenever the fuck else lives out there,

1587
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.860
<v 0>yeah, they're weird too.</v>

1588
01:33:44.861 --> 01:33:48.880
You see him and that there's this silhouette and then they turn and they're like

1589
01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:51.280
thin. You're like, what the fuck is that? Like,

1590
01:33:51.281 --> 01:33:54.460
so if you try to shoot it had on the bullets, just gonna bounce off that skull.

1591
01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:58.180
They turn on. You can be like the, the side shots, the way to get it.

1592
01:33:58.181 --> 01:34:01.210
But like there's like a flounder. Yeah, it really is.

1593
01:34:01.211 --> 01:34:05.080
Or weird to fucking strange is a, is that a introduced animal?

1594
01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:11.100
It says that it migrated from like South America and Mexico up over a couple of

1595
01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:15.310
centuries, but it may be someone brought it up first. Well, the pigs are,

1596
01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:18.730
the pigs have only been here since the 15 hundreds of Spaniards.

1597
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:20.200
It was crazy Europeans,

1598
01:34:20.201 --> 01:34:23.530
they brought them over here for food and we'll just let these pigs go.

1599
01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:28.080
No one's going to care. Right. Next thing you know, they're almost, you know,

1600
01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:31.080
every, I think they're in every single County in Texas. Yeah.

1601
01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:32.800
And they're making their way across the country.

1602
01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:37.180
They just did devastating things. They're in San Jose and Silicon Valley,

1603
01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:41.980
people's lawns getting torn up by wild pig populations. Yeah. Not cool.

1604
01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:46.150
But the tasty, if you hit them right there, that they have that,

1605
01:34:46.450 --> 01:34:50.260
that Glenn on the gland that you process it wrong and it's that good.

1606
01:34:50.590 --> 01:34:52.920
You just got to know what you're doing. Just don't fuck around with her,

1607
01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:56.860
their glands, just like men, you know,

1608
01:34:59.420 --> 01:35:03.800
please leave my glance away alone. But you are that desert environment.

1609
01:35:03.930 --> 01:35:08.630
It's such a interesting thing cause you think it's desolate but it's a really

1610
01:35:08.631 --> 01:35:10.610
thriving ecosystem. Yeah.

1611
01:35:11.060 --> 01:35:16.060
It really is like just the simple things like our herbs and the tomato is things

1612
01:35:16.251 --> 01:35:20.050
like that. They just, they thrive. Yeah. They're very aromatic. Uh,

1613
01:35:20.090 --> 01:35:24.290
the basles and the other Rosemary's and things. It's just really intense,

1614
01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:26.210
intense stuff. What kind of tomatoes do you grow?

1615
01:35:26.210 --> 01:35:28.010
Do you grow like an heirloom style of tomato?

1616
01:35:28.610 --> 01:35:30.680
Well that doesn't really grow well.

1617
01:35:30.681 --> 01:35:33.890
The ones that really do well on our greenhouses are the little like the cherries

1618
01:35:33.891 --> 01:35:36.530
or a little pear tomatoes, those little smaller, you know,

1619
01:35:36.531 --> 01:35:38.900
smaller versions of tomatoes. They do really well.

1620
01:35:38.930 --> 01:35:42.620
Why do they do better than the ALM ones? I think that there, as far as flavor,

1621
01:35:42.621 --> 01:35:47.030
I like them. I think it's because just the size, the skin contact,

1622
01:35:47.330 --> 01:35:49.550
how much more compact they are.

1623
01:35:49.551 --> 01:35:53.630
There's just more flavor in one tomato rather than the pulping the flavor.

1624
01:35:53.660 --> 01:35:57.890
I would imagine the skin and the outer part is actually more of the flavor than

1625
01:35:57.891 --> 01:36:01.220
just the pulp. I've gotta get a greenhouse. I really do.

1626
01:36:01.221 --> 01:36:03.530
That's something I've been thinking about a lot lately cause I,

1627
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:06.560
I've had vegetables like when I just said I just got back from Italy.

1628
01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:08.930
God damn their tomatoes taste good. Yeah.

1629
01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:12.860
I mean you realize that tomato is actually a fruit. Yeah. And it tastes great.

1630
01:36:12.980 --> 01:36:13.870
They're amazing. Yeah.

1631
01:36:14.150 --> 01:36:17.240
But you get a tomato over here from the grocery store and it might as well be a

1632
01:36:17.241 --> 01:36:21.550
tennis ball. I mean it's, it bounces like a tennis ball at last.

1633
01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:24.500
They last for our tomatoes. Don't you know, we,

1634
01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:28.580
I picked on because we're going to eat them today or tomorrow. Yeah.

1635
01:36:28.670 --> 01:36:30.130
That's the way to live, man.

1636
01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:33.470
That's how people are supposed to live this God damn.

1637
01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:38.390
Waiting forever to eat your food while it just sits on a shelf is nonsense.

1638
01:36:38.660 --> 01:36:42.560
Yeah. It's like, yeah, I got, I got used to that. Now that we have the,

1639
01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:44.690
the greenhouse is going for the last couple of years.

1640
01:36:44.691 --> 01:36:47.690
It's like you get that stuff. That's what we're making. Do you have well water,

1641
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:49.880
uh, we're on the,

1642
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:54.710
we're on the spring that comes down from Mingus mountain Amazon on spring water

1643
01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:56.930
and then we have Wells down on the other sites.

1644
01:36:56.930 --> 01:37:00.500
So your tampon or spring water [inaudible] wow.

1645
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:05.230
So do you have, does anybody add anything to it? Probably, yeah. Cause it's a,

1646
01:37:05.450 --> 01:37:09.830
it's a town so they write the treat it just to be safe. Yeah.

1647
01:37:10.050 --> 01:37:14.330
Unfortunately in Colorado we had a, well we have two,

1648
01:37:14.331 --> 01:37:18.190
we have three wills. Each site has a, has its own well as well.

1649
01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:20.930
You get spring water from that rights because we have the, you know,

1650
01:37:20.931 --> 01:37:25.610
we have the, uh, Oak Creek and um, it's, it's at the page.

1651
01:37:25.611 --> 01:37:28.790
Spring is right there. So we have water,

1652
01:37:29.050 --> 01:37:31.760
dish rights that we actually irrigate the vineyard on those.

1653
01:37:31.761 --> 01:37:34.970
But I went ahead and put in a well on every one of them just as a backup plan.

1654
01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:39.050
Did you get a guy with the stick trying to figure out where the water is?

1655
01:37:39.051 --> 01:37:43.310
The diviner guy does that shit work works for us. How is that real?

1656
01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:44.930
I don't know. I don't know.

1657
01:37:45.230 --> 01:37:48.110
I had a buddy of mine have built a well on his property and he had the guy come

1658
01:37:48.111 --> 01:37:50.160
over with a stick. I'm like, I can't talk to you anymore.

1659
01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:54.560
I got that guy like they know that there's a general area where the water is.

1660
01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:58.450
Yeah. There's some dude with the cell phone in the corner. Go watch, watch this.

1661
01:37:58.750 --> 01:38:02.190
Okay. Watch. He's like, I think it's right here,

1662
01:38:02.790 --> 01:38:06.210
but it's the thing that I've time what I've practiced, but I've seen it.

1663
01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:09.210
I've seen it. I've seen it done where like he's just walking around.

1664
01:38:09.211 --> 01:38:12.570
I'll say it just goes down like, Oh Hey, let's go here. Yeah.

1665
01:38:13.230 --> 01:38:17.310
How the fuck can that possibly be worked on? No, it's good. Here it is.

1666
01:38:17.311 --> 01:38:21.810
Here's this guy. It's called water witching water. Oh, well it's witchcraft.

1667
01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:23.310
Look at this guy. Fuck this guy.

1668
01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:29.190
I'm looking at ways moving his hands. Fuck her too. She's full of shit.

1669
01:38:29.191 --> 01:38:33.150
To look at him more than even done. Ready to be controlling this right here.

1670
01:38:33.330 --> 01:38:35.940
Right here. Oops, you're here. Shoot, shoot.

1671
01:38:35.941 --> 01:38:38.580
Shoot the fuck out of here with that.

1672
01:38:40.290 --> 01:38:43.320
That's nonsense. That's like three card money. Hey, I was asshole.

1673
01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:46.590
I've drilled four Wells and they all been worked before.

1674
01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:50.670
Once you just try to drill a well out of the fucking blue.

1675
01:38:50.671 --> 01:38:55.620
Just flip somewhere. Yeah. 10 10 paces right here. Bam.

1676
01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:59.850
Oh look. Oh well we're under a fucking have network of Wells. Yeah.

1677
01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:04.500
The only thing I worry about Wells is every movie where there's bad people,

1678
01:39:04.501 --> 01:39:08.120
they always throw the bodies in a well, like the doesn't guarantee no hate.

1679
01:39:08.121 --> 01:39:12.360
Can't really fit the body down that no eight, eight inch casing,

1680
01:39:12.930 --> 01:39:13.650
but you can try.

1681
01:39:13.650 --> 01:39:16.590
I mean those people that have yourself a little meat grinder or some hogs,

1682
01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:19.200
it guess you're good. Do you remember the well baby, the kid that fell down the,

1683
01:39:19.201 --> 01:39:24.060
well, it took like days to get him out. [inaudible] then the guy Jessica. Yeah,

1684
01:39:24.090 --> 01:39:27.990
it was her, right? Yeah, I said him. Yeah, and she eventually became like a hot,

1685
01:39:28.050 --> 01:39:31.560
hot, broad. Here's another guy doing it. He's calling. This is called a douser.

1686
01:39:31.590 --> 01:39:34.080
I might be, might be multiple names divided by this sweater.

1687
01:39:34.081 --> 01:39:35.040
I'm not listening to this guy.

1688
01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:39.000
A bottle of water on the ground and he's like proving, well,

1689
01:39:39.001 --> 01:39:41.820
how about we put a bottle of water where he doesn't know where it is?

1690
01:39:41.821 --> 01:39:45.810
You blind blind him, right? He's moving his arms.

1691
01:39:45.990 --> 01:39:48.810
This guy's a dip shit. He's like the worst magician ever.

1692
01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:53.090
Literally like moving his arm. Nothing like, see you've impressed out.

1693
01:39:53.310 --> 01:39:56.280
Watch his hands. Fuck you. Fuck you. Melvin.

1694
01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:01.860
John Baker, professional. Dowser professional. Hoser. He's a Hoser.

1695
01:40:01.861 --> 01:40:04.830
This guy is the stick. That's the one. John, if you're listening, I'm sorry,

1696
01:40:04.831 --> 01:40:06.930
I'm just, this is comedy. I'm sure you're real.

1697
01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:10.260
I'm sure you would do what you're doing is real, bro. Let me see.

1698
01:40:10.290 --> 01:40:14.970
Let me see your hands. Let me see your hands. Let me see your hands. What?

1699
01:40:15.450 --> 01:40:19.680
Oh, Jesus, look at it. It's moving down with my coincidentally,

1700
01:40:19.681 --> 01:40:24.030
my hands are thrusting down at the same time. Yeah.

1701
01:40:24.570 --> 01:40:28.770
Nonsense. He's a professional dowser. What's the name of the religion?

1702
01:40:28.771 --> 01:40:31.950
They have the snakes that bite them in the face. Pentecostals. Yeah. Yeah.

1703
01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:34.770
That was one of those go. Those are my favorite.

1704
01:40:34.800 --> 01:40:36.210
Those are the folks that talk in tongues.

1705
01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:41.100
There's no Pentecostals talking tongues. I'm thinking I'm, I'm conflating them.

1706
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:43.340
I don't think they necessarily the snake handlers.

1707
01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:48.360
I was raised a Southern Baptist and we did some tongs. Did ya? Oh yeah.

1708
01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:50.850
Sat my Lama. Ding dong to do that. Like that one.

1709
01:40:51.330 --> 01:40:53.270
I didn't say it like that because that would be a thing.

1710
01:40:56.350 --> 01:41:00.190
<v 1>Do you know, uh, what's his name? Is it Robert Paulson? Is that the guy?</v>

1711
01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:02.980
He's like the slick back hair preacher. He does that.

1712
01:41:03.370 --> 01:41:06.760
He'll just be on in the middle of talking about Robert Tilton. That's right.

1713
01:41:06.761 --> 01:41:11.370
Robert Tilton is a man. He is

1714
01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:16.480
one of my all time favorite quotes. Every time you write a check to me,

1715
01:41:16.481 --> 01:41:20.630
Satan gets a black guy that's,

1716
01:41:20.910 --> 01:41:25.780
he's got a farting preacher. Yeah, that's him. Yeah. Yeah. That's good.

1717
01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:29.470
He's a dowser as well. Yes. He's out there in the backyard with some sticks.

1718
01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:33.580
You have a flight to head back to your farm yesterday.

1719
01:41:33.581 --> 01:41:36.250
I think you have to leave quite, quite soon. Pretty soon.

1720
01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:40.210
So congratulations on the release of the tool.

1721
01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:44.830
Entire library streaming everywhere. Um,

1722
01:41:45.370 --> 01:41:49.630
congratulations on your vineyards and your wine and your yoga studio and your

1723
01:41:49.631 --> 01:41:54.631
Jitsu studio and my new boy fucking crayon company and your helicopter farm.

1724
01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:58.320
Whatever the fuck else are you doing. All right.

1725
01:41:58.540 --> 01:42:00.730
Is there anything else you need to tell everybody about before we get out of

1726
01:42:00.731 --> 01:42:05.380
here? Man, I'm just so excited we finished this record. Well, listen, man,

1727
01:42:05.381 --> 01:42:07.780
it's always great to see you even ever briefly.

1728
01:42:07.810 --> 01:42:10.000
Next time I'm going to come to your place and eat. Okay.

1729
01:42:10.060 --> 01:42:12.190
Tell me when is a good time and we'll figure it out and I'll,

1730
01:42:12.490 --> 01:42:16.060
I'll fly the messes up there and we'll get some food and some water. Alright.

1731
01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:18.130
I appreciate you brother. Thank you. Thank you. Bye everybody.

1732
01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:29.580
