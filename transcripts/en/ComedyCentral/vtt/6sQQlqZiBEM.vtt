00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.999
- [Jeff] When Ari asked
me to tell this story,

00:00:02.999 --> 00:00:05.062
I was hesitant,

00:00:05.062 --> 00:00:08.180
because I still might go to jail for this.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.894
(hip hop music)

00:00:10.894 --> 00:00:12.649
(swishing)

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:14.426
(bang)

00:00:14.426 --> 00:00:16.343
(bang)

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.314
(bang)

00:00:20.314 --> 00:00:22.314
(smash)

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:24.926
(stabbing)

00:00:24.926 --> 00:00:27.170
- [Ari] Welcome to This
Is Not Happening presents,

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.491
World Of Blunder.

00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:29.620
- If you've never been to the show before,

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.579
this is a bunch of comics
telling fun stories

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:32.943
about real shit that happened.

00:00:32.943 --> 00:00:33.776
Give it up,

00:00:33.776 --> 00:00:35.008
for Mr. Jeff Dye everybody,

00:00:35.008 --> 00:00:39.175
let him hear it!
(clapping and cheering)

00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:44.939
- Thank you!

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:46.755
I gotta tell ya,

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:49.356
when Ari asked me to tell this story,

00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:51.379
I was hesitant,

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.081
because I still might go to jail for this.

00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:57.129
(laughing)

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.156
Well, it's like, yeah, I guess
it is kind of a funny story.

00:01:00.156 --> 00:01:01.477
(laughing)

00:01:01.477 --> 00:01:03.385
Here I am out of,

00:01:03.385 --> 00:01:05.192
just flattery that he asked me to tell it.

00:01:05.192 --> 00:01:09.352
Okay so, I worked the road
and my opening comic is

00:01:09.352 --> 00:01:10.834
my best friend Brandt Tobler,

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:11.716
he's a very funny guy,

00:01:11.716 --> 00:01:13.931
but he's famous for just
gettin' into trouble.

00:01:13.931 --> 00:01:15.453
And I'm pretty famous
for gettin' into trouble,

00:01:15.453 --> 00:01:16.997
and when we started working together,

00:01:16.997 --> 00:01:19.448
it just magnified by like a million times

00:01:19.448 --> 00:01:21.611
of us getting into trouble.

00:01:21.611 --> 00:01:23.297
We're in Marco Island, we're
doing this comedy club,

00:01:23.297 --> 00:01:24.679
this great comedy club,

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:25.848
and someone says,

00:01:25.848 --> 00:01:28.043
hey we should go to
this bar called Vandy's.

00:01:28.043 --> 00:01:30.376
Some old NFL kicker owns it.

00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:34.858
And I was like, wait,
Vandy, like Mike Vanderjagt?

00:01:34.858 --> 00:01:36.838
And they're like, yeah
yeah, you know that guy?

00:01:36.838 --> 00:01:38.637
And if you don't know a lot about sports,

00:01:38.637 --> 00:01:41.621
Mike Vanderjagt is a NFL kicker,

00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:44.114
who is famous for being
an incredible kicker.

00:01:44.114 --> 00:01:46.044
The guy never missed kicks, he was insane.

00:01:46.044 --> 00:01:48.671
But he was equally famous (laughs),

00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:51.025
the same way like the Iron Sheik's famous.

00:01:51.025 --> 00:01:52.183
(laughing)

00:01:52.183 --> 00:01:54.539
Or stories about Tracy Morgan.
(laughing)

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.123
Like these are the kind of,

00:01:56.123 --> 00:01:57.710
famous Mike Vanderjagt is.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.043
He choked a junior high kid,

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:03.261
he's a troublemaker himself.

00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:05.435
Peyton Manning called
him "The Idiot Kicker",

00:02:05.435 --> 00:02:07.107
that's what he's like most famous for

00:02:07.107 --> 00:02:08.329
is being called The Idiot Kicker.

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:10.096
Peyton Manning called
him that in a Pro Bowl,

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:10.929
The Idiot Kicker,

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.859
and I was like wait, Mike
Vanderjagt has a bar here?

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:13.969
And like, yeah, let's go.

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:14.822
So we go,

00:02:14.822 --> 00:02:15.736
we drink a lot.

00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:16.822
I like to drink a lot.

00:02:16.822 --> 00:02:18.587
Me and Brandt got pretty drunk,

00:02:18.587 --> 00:02:20.357
and we're just so excited

00:02:20.357 --> 00:02:21.611
that we're at Mike Vanderjagt's bar.

00:02:21.611 --> 00:02:22.636
We keep asking the bartender,

00:02:22.636 --> 00:02:23.509
"You think he's gonna come in?"

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.074
They're like, "Nah, he
doesn't come in here,

00:02:25.074 --> 00:02:26.613
his wife doesn't let him."

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:28.186
(laughing)

00:02:28.186 --> 00:02:29.019
All that stuff,

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.080
so we just as football fans and drunks,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.913
we're just like,

00:02:31.913 --> 00:02:34.185
man, we'd really like to meet
Mike Vanderjagt blah blah.

00:02:34.185 --> 00:02:37.296
So we're just being
regular idiots and then,

00:02:37.296 --> 00:02:38.798
about two o'clock we're like,

00:02:38.798 --> 00:02:40.353
you know what we should do?

00:02:40.353 --> 00:02:42.152
We're drunk by the way...

00:02:42.152 --> 00:02:45.351
We should steal something
from here, right?

00:02:45.351 --> 00:02:46.915
And then put it at our house,

00:02:46.915 --> 00:02:48.130
and then when people come
over and they're like,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.000
why do you have that whatever it is,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.896
we can be like, we stole
that from Mike Vanderjagt!

00:02:52.896 --> 00:02:53.736
(laughing)

00:02:53.736 --> 00:02:54.694
Right, which sounds like

00:02:54.694 --> 00:02:56.506
a really cool idea when you're drunk.

00:02:56.506 --> 00:02:57.339
I admit it's,

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:59.422
not that cool, but
like, when you're drunk,

00:02:59.422 --> 00:03:01.504
you're like, that's the best idea ever!

00:03:01.504 --> 00:03:02.505
(laughing)

00:03:02.505 --> 00:03:03.431
So we're looking around,

00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:06.315
and everything's kinda tacked down.

00:03:06.315 --> 00:03:08.815
The restroom signs, and
things on the wall...

00:03:08.815 --> 00:03:10.054
Everything's just nailed down.

00:03:10.054 --> 00:03:12.097
They've thought about morons like us.

00:03:12.097 --> 00:03:14.372
(laughing)

00:03:14.372 --> 00:03:16.241
So I went to the front of the

00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:18.688
restaurant or bar, or
whatever the heck it is,

00:03:18.688 --> 00:03:21.035
and the only thing that wasn't nailed down

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:24.011
was his framed Pro Bowl jersey.

00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:26.598
(laughing)

00:03:26.598 --> 00:03:28.371
The Pro Bowl where Peyton Manning

00:03:28.371 --> 00:03:30.111
called him The Idiot Kicker.

00:03:30.111 --> 00:03:31.084
(laughing)

00:03:31.084 --> 00:03:32.222
Now if you don't know
about Pro Bowl jerseys,

00:03:32.222 --> 00:03:33.542
they're like trophies to these players.

00:03:33.542 --> 00:03:35.615
They don't make a bunch,
they don't sell replicas.

00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:37.090
You get one, that's your trophy.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.845
You play in it, and then you frame it.

00:03:38.845 --> 00:03:40.097
I didn't know that.

00:03:40.097 --> 00:03:42.347
(laughing)

00:03:43.397 --> 00:03:45.603
So I wobble back to my buddy
Brandt, and I was like,

00:03:45.603 --> 00:03:46.943
I think I got it man,

00:03:46.943 --> 00:03:49.808
we should get his Pro Bowl jersey!

00:03:49.808 --> 00:03:52.479
Brandt's like, that's the best idea ever!

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.676
(laughing)

00:03:54.676 --> 00:03:57.340
So we hide in the men's
bathroom, and we're like,

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.137
how are we gonna do this?

00:03:59.137 --> 00:04:00.882
So waited for the place to close,

00:04:00.882 --> 00:04:02.214
we tell these girls that we met,

00:04:02.214 --> 00:04:03.311
like hey, just get the car ready.

00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:04.217
We're gonna jump in the car

00:04:04.217 --> 00:04:05.781
and then we'll go back
to where we're going.

00:04:05.781 --> 00:04:07.965
And they girls were like, oh, okay.

00:04:07.965 --> 00:04:10.080
(chuckles) Now they're accomplices.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.441
(laughing)

00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:14.232
So anyways we come out, I take the frame.

00:04:14.232 --> 00:04:15.856
It's like three foot by three foot.

00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:18.511
It's like this huge framed
jersey from the Pro Bowl.

00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:20.024
Take it off the wall, I grab it,

00:04:20.024 --> 00:04:23.313
Brandt grabs an Edgerrin
James autographed jersey,

00:04:23.313 --> 00:04:24.874
so we're both in this together you know.

00:04:24.874 --> 00:04:25.707
(laughing)

00:04:25.707 --> 00:04:27.981
Can't hold both sides,
that don't make sense.

00:04:27.981 --> 00:04:29.626
So we grab each one, we jump in the car,

00:04:29.626 --> 00:04:31.296
we drive back to the penthouse,

00:04:31.296 --> 00:04:33.058
and we break 'em outta the frames

00:04:33.058 --> 00:04:34.596
right when we get back there.

00:04:34.596 --> 00:04:35.429
We putting them on...

00:04:35.429 --> 00:04:36.395
We're like the worst criminals ever,

00:04:36.395 --> 00:04:38.541
(laughing)
by the way.

00:04:38.541 --> 00:04:40.589
Because we're so proud of ourselves,

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:43.027
we're not badasses obviously, you know,

00:04:43.027 --> 00:04:43.860
so we're like all excited.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.429
We're taking photos of us
wearing it on Instagram...

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:47.262
(laughing)

00:04:47.262 --> 00:04:48.818
We're like, we're in the Pro Bowl, whoo!

00:04:48.818 --> 00:04:49.651
We're going crazy.

00:04:49.651 --> 00:04:52.036
We had girls wearing 'em takin' photos,

00:04:52.036 --> 00:04:52.910
we're in the hot tub,

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.820
we're going crazy right?

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.680
So the next morning when
we sober up we're like,

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.378
oh no, this could be a lot of trouble.

00:05:00.378 --> 00:05:02.358
And so we're like, this isn't good,

00:05:02.358 --> 00:05:06.351
but we're also kind of happy
with our new badass reputation,

00:05:06.351 --> 00:05:09.187
like yeah, we don't give a f, you know...

00:05:09.187 --> 00:05:10.923
(laughing)

00:05:10.923 --> 00:05:12.546
That's how badass I am, yeah.

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:13.846
(laughing)

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:15.642
So anyways, we're telling everyone.

00:05:15.642 --> 00:05:17.105
We're like, yeah, you know
what we did last night?

00:05:17.105 --> 00:05:18.730
We're just tryin' to own it, ya know?

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.563
Word gets around,

00:05:19.563 --> 00:05:22.033
it's a five mile by five
mile island in Florida,

00:05:22.033 --> 00:05:24.085
Marco Island, and they're like,

00:05:24.085 --> 00:05:25.354
everyone's talking about it,

00:05:25.354 --> 00:05:26.359
like those are the comedians

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:28.663
came and stole like two
jerseys from the bar,

00:05:28.663 --> 00:05:29.612
and everyone's looking for them.

00:05:29.612 --> 00:05:32.090
The cops reach out to
the comedy club owner,

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.293
'cause our poster's all over
town that we're gonna be there.

00:05:34.293 --> 00:05:35.431
(laughing)

00:05:35.431 --> 00:05:37.772
It was like, I think those are
the guys you're looking for.

00:05:37.772 --> 00:05:39.541
(laughing)

00:05:39.541 --> 00:05:41.970
So the owner calls me, and he's like,

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.318
hey man, the police came to
my son's little league game,

00:05:46.318 --> 00:05:47.607
(laughing)

00:05:47.607 --> 00:05:49.476
and they started asking questions

00:05:49.476 --> 00:05:52.372
about the Pro Bowl jersey.

00:05:52.372 --> 00:05:53.368
Dude! What is...

00:05:53.368 --> 00:05:54.421
Did you do that?

00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:55.257
(laughing)

00:05:55.257 --> 00:05:56.406
(laughs) And I'm like,

00:05:56.406 --> 00:05:57.770
yeah, isn't that awesome!

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.978
(laughing)

00:05:58.978 --> 00:05:59.944
That was us!

00:05:59.944 --> 00:06:01.763
I was just so exicted,

00:06:01.763 --> 00:06:04.556
and he's like, bring
them back immediately,

00:06:04.556 --> 00:06:06.213
or I'm going to tell the police.

00:06:06.213 --> 00:06:08.467
I was like, no, come on
man, don't be like that.

00:06:08.467 --> 00:06:10.175
(laughing)

00:06:10.175 --> 00:06:11.731
Come on, it's cool right?

00:06:11.731 --> 00:06:12.564
Like a child...

00:06:12.564 --> 00:06:13.924
Like, man, come on.

00:06:13.924 --> 00:06:15.619
So anyways he makes us bring it back,

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:17.124
we ditch 'em on the patio.

00:06:17.124 --> 00:06:18.070
We don't wanna turn ourselves in,

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.720
we just like ditch 'em on the
patio of the bar and we leave.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.756
So they have the jersey
back, so everybody's happy.

00:06:22.756 --> 00:06:23.960
And the whole rest of the weekend

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.893
working at that comedy club,

00:06:24.893 --> 00:06:27.138
they're treatin' us like these jerks.

00:06:27.138 --> 00:06:28.509
Ya know, we're just to be goofballs,

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:29.373
we didn't mean to like,

00:06:29.373 --> 00:06:31.517
we weren't trying to
kill anyone or anything.

00:06:31.517 --> 00:06:32.920
Everyone acted like, oh, what about...

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.726
Like, everyone was so Mormon about it.

00:06:34.726 --> 00:06:35.915
(laughing)

00:06:35.915 --> 00:06:37.818
Like, you know, like, oh, I would never!

00:06:37.818 --> 00:06:39.272
It's like, it was just a goof.

00:06:39.272 --> 00:06:40.530
(laughing)

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.349
So the whole time we're feeling judged,

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:44.091
we just feel like, man,

00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:46.597
I really wish we wouldn't
have turned those jerseys in.

00:06:46.597 --> 00:06:47.594
If everyone's gonna treat us

00:06:47.594 --> 00:06:51.684
like we're a bunch of idiot,
jerk, criminal assholes,

00:06:51.684 --> 00:06:53.749
I wish we had the jerseys.

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:55.772
So on the last day of us
working that comedy club,

00:06:55.772 --> 00:06:58.372
(laughing)

00:06:58.372 --> 00:07:01.309
we're like, how gangster would
it be to go back to that bar,

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:02.752
(laughing)

00:07:02.752 --> 00:07:04.488
and just drink in front of everyone,

00:07:04.488 --> 00:07:07.770
like we weren't the guys
that stole those jerseys.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.039
It's the only bar open,

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:09.872
so we go to the bar,

00:07:09.872 --> 00:07:11.558
we just drinking, having a good time,

00:07:11.558 --> 00:07:12.647
and nobody's said anything,

00:07:12.647 --> 00:07:14.218
and if they do look at us weird,

00:07:14.218 --> 00:07:15.694
they kind of don't want to come up to us.

00:07:15.694 --> 00:07:17.096
At two o'clock in the morning,

00:07:17.096 --> 00:07:18.252
I look over at Brandt,

00:07:18.252 --> 00:07:19.522
I got like a thing of whiskey,

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:21.758
and I look over at Brandt,
and Brandt looks at me,

00:07:21.758 --> 00:07:22.591
it was magical.

00:07:22.591 --> 00:07:24.074
I haven't known this guy that long,

00:07:24.074 --> 00:07:26.857
but we communicated with each other

00:07:26.857 --> 00:07:28.808
without saying anything.

00:07:28.808 --> 00:07:31.022
It was just kinda like this,

00:07:31.022 --> 00:07:32.180
let's get 'em back!

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.183
(laughing)

00:07:34.183 --> 00:07:35.167
So,

00:07:35.167 --> 00:07:36.142
they're not in the frames,

00:07:36.142 --> 00:07:37.643
'cause we broke 'em out of the frames,

00:07:37.643 --> 00:07:38.946
so they're somewhere,

00:07:38.946 --> 00:07:40.764
they must be in the back
office or something like that,

00:07:40.764 --> 00:07:41.811
we don't know what we're gonna do.

00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:44.898
So what we do is we lock
ourselves in the women's bathroom,

00:07:44.898 --> 00:07:46.008
(laughing)

00:07:46.008 --> 00:07:48.100
and once the place closes down,

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:48.933
they lock the doors,

00:07:48.933 --> 00:07:49.766
we can hear 'em.

00:07:49.766 --> 00:07:51.180
We're like hidden in the bathroom,

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.092
the women's bathroom, like,

00:07:52.092 --> 00:07:54.064
we're gettin' these things back, right?.

00:07:54.064 --> 00:07:55.389
So, they lock the door,

00:07:55.389 --> 00:07:56.711
and now we come outta the bathroom,

00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:58.804
and there's a guy over
there closing down the till,

00:07:58.804 --> 00:08:01.161
and he's doing his numbers,
like bartender stuff,

00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:02.502
and we're like, alright, let's just go.

00:08:02.502 --> 00:08:04.319
So Brandt darts into the back office,

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:05.486
I don't know where he's at,

00:08:05.486 --> 00:08:06.504
and right when that happens

00:08:06.504 --> 00:08:09.502
I see the bartender look over
at me, and I'm like, oh no.

00:08:09.502 --> 00:08:10.335
(laughing)

00:08:10.335 --> 00:08:11.656
He knows we're in the locked building.

00:08:11.656 --> 00:08:12.489
So he comes over to me and he's like,

00:08:12.489 --> 00:08:13.855
what are you doing, hey!

00:08:13.855 --> 00:08:15.293
I locked the doors, what
are you doing in here?

00:08:15.293 --> 00:08:18.094
So I act like I'm way drunker than I am,

00:08:18.094 --> 00:08:19.263
and I'm on my phone,

00:08:19.263 --> 00:08:22.262
and I'm like, oh, I'm in a
fight with my girlfriend.

00:08:22.262 --> 00:08:24.659
Man, it's so crazy, I just
wish I was gay sometimes,

00:08:24.659 --> 00:08:25.492
you know, dealing with...

00:08:25.492 --> 00:08:27.700
(laughing)

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.777
I'm working this guy, doing
jokes on him and stuff,

00:08:30.777 --> 00:08:32.098
I'm trying to figure things out,

00:08:32.098 --> 00:08:33.743
but the whole time I'm texting Brandt,

00:08:33.743 --> 00:08:37.848
don't come out, there's a giant
man who's gonna beat our ass

00:08:37.848 --> 00:08:40.204
(laughing)
if he knows what we're up to.

00:08:40.204 --> 00:08:42.886
So while I'm doing this,

00:08:42.886 --> 00:08:44.438
Brandt texts me back,

00:08:44.438 --> 00:08:46.438
hey, I got 'em, get out.

00:08:47.568 --> 00:08:49.965
So I go to the guy, alright,
I'm just gonna get outta here.

00:08:49.965 --> 00:08:51.164
He's like, yeah, I don't
know how you're in here,

00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:52.747
I locked the doors.

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:55.321
So he shoves me out,

00:08:55.321 --> 00:08:57.361
I run across the street to the 76,

00:08:57.361 --> 00:08:58.673
Brandt's got the jersey,

00:08:58.673 --> 00:09:00.479
Mike Vanderjagt's Pro Bowl jersey.

00:09:00.479 --> 00:09:01.973
And not only that it was his birthday.

00:09:01.973 --> 00:09:04.096
It was Mike Vanderjagt's
birthday that day.

00:09:04.096 --> 00:09:05.179
(laughing)

00:09:05.179 --> 00:09:06.956
So we stole it, gave it back,

00:09:06.956 --> 00:09:10.095
stole it again (laughs) on his birthday,

00:09:10.095 --> 00:09:10.928
and the next morning...

00:09:10.928 --> 00:09:12.693
I mean it's a strange thing to celebrate,

00:09:12.693 --> 00:09:14.186
but we felt like it was like this victory.

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:16.684
Like, you know what, we did
it, we did a cool thing.

00:09:16.684 --> 00:09:18.810
So I fly to New York,

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.383
Brandt's still on Marco Island.

00:09:20.383 --> 00:09:22.542
I get off the plane in New York

00:09:22.542 --> 00:09:23.946
to about

00:09:23.946 --> 00:09:25.946
15 of these voice mails.

00:09:28.153 --> 00:09:29.717
- [Officer] Yes, this is (beep)

00:09:29.717 --> 00:09:32.095
with your Marco Island Police Department.

00:09:32.095 --> 00:09:34.565
(laughing)
I'm here at Vandy's

00:09:34.565 --> 00:09:36.315
and your name came up

00:09:37.662 --> 00:09:41.188
in an investigation about a stolen

00:09:41.188 --> 00:09:42.427
Mike Vanderjagt

00:09:42.427 --> 00:09:45.231
(laughing)
Pro Bowl Jersey.

00:09:45.231 --> 00:09:49.112
So I have like 15 of these.
(laughing and cheering)

00:09:49.112 --> 00:09:49.945
Keep in mind,

00:09:49.945 --> 00:09:50.807
I've never been in trouble in my life.

00:09:50.807 --> 00:09:51.915
I was like raised in the church,

00:09:51.915 --> 00:09:53.988
which is why this whole
thing's so exciting for me.

00:09:53.988 --> 00:09:54.830
(laughing)

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.995
I'm like Miley Cyrus coming out of my...

00:09:56.995 --> 00:09:58.040
(laughing)

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.697
You know, I was like, yeah, rebellion!

00:10:01.697 --> 00:10:03.639
So anyways, I don't know what to do,

00:10:03.639 --> 00:10:05.752
I sit on it for a couple of days.

00:10:05.752 --> 00:10:07.325
I'm just getting tons of these calls,

00:10:07.325 --> 00:10:08.293
and I'm like, well what are they gonna,

00:10:08.293 --> 00:10:10.537
fly to New York to come
get this thing in Florida,

00:10:10.537 --> 00:10:11.388
(laughing)
I don't know what to do.

00:10:11.388 --> 00:10:13.410
Meanwhile I'm wearing it
everywhere, by the way.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.047
(laughing)

00:10:15.047 --> 00:10:16.193
Starbucks, it's doesn't matter,

00:10:16.193 --> 00:10:17.363
I'm wearing the jersey.

00:10:17.363 --> 00:10:20.396
I'm like, yeah, you know how
I got this, I'm an idiot.

00:10:20.396 --> 00:10:21.933
I haven't tooken it off, pretty much.

00:10:21.933 --> 00:10:25.766
So, then I get this voice
mail two days later.

00:10:27.706 --> 00:10:30.835
- [Mike] Yeah Jeff, this
is Vandy's on Marco,

00:10:30.835 --> 00:10:34.695
I think we have a situation
that needs to get rectified.

00:10:34.695 --> 00:10:36.390
(laughing)

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.533
First of all I need my jersey back...

00:10:38.533 --> 00:10:41.147
(laughing and clapping)
- It's him.

00:10:41.147 --> 00:10:44.847
I'm getting calls from
Mike Vanderjagt himself.

00:10:44.847 --> 00:10:48.180
(laughing and clapping)

00:10:52.141 --> 00:10:54.732
He's like, forget the police,

00:10:54.732 --> 00:10:58.044
I need my jersey, he's begging
me for his jersey back.

00:10:58.044 --> 00:11:00.353
I'll let you listen to the rest of this.

00:11:00.353 --> 00:11:02.901
- [Mike] And second of
all I need two grand

00:11:02.901 --> 00:11:05.984
to fix 'em back up the way they were.

00:11:07.696 --> 00:11:09.516
We have the whole thing on video, so,

00:11:09.516 --> 00:11:10.959
(laughing)

00:11:10.959 --> 00:11:12.523
if you wanna not get prosecuted

00:11:12.523 --> 00:11:14.741
and not get arrested for
breaking and entering

00:11:14.741 --> 00:11:16.158
and vandalism and

00:11:17.767 --> 00:11:19.395
grand theft then,

00:11:19.395 --> 00:11:20.731
just return the jersey

00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:23.845
and give me two grand
to fix what I gotta fix,

00:11:23.845 --> 00:11:27.116
or unfortunately you're
gonna get prosecuted

00:11:27.116 --> 00:11:29.473
and it's not gonna be good, so...

00:11:29.473 --> 00:11:30.753
We have the whole thing on video

00:11:30.753 --> 00:11:31.841
at the front of the restaurant,

00:11:31.841 --> 00:11:33.062
you guys were looking around real good,

00:11:33.062 --> 00:11:35.168
but you forgot to look for
the cameras unfortunately,

00:11:35.168 --> 00:11:37.505
(laughing)
so you and Brandt...

00:11:37.505 --> 00:11:39.629
- So I don't know what to do right?

00:11:39.629 --> 00:11:41.879
(laughing)

00:11:44.703 --> 00:11:46.557
I'm panicking, I don't wanna go to jail.

00:11:46.557 --> 00:11:47.390
(laughing)

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:48.905
I know I'll do well in jail,

00:11:48.905 --> 00:11:50.287
(laughing)

00:11:50.287 --> 00:11:52.980
but for all the wrong reasons.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.789
And so I'm scared, I
don't know what to do,

00:11:54.789 --> 00:11:56.440
and I'm like, well, what
should we do about this?

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.971
Me and Brandt are texting back
and forth what we should do,

00:11:58.971 --> 00:12:02.312
how we should solve this scenario.

00:12:02.312 --> 00:12:05.725
Meanwhile my agents,
my manager, my lawyers,

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:07.008
are all calling me, like,

00:12:07.008 --> 00:12:08.015
what in the heck is wrong with you?

00:12:08.015 --> 00:12:08.848
What did you do?

00:12:08.848 --> 00:12:10.062
We heard about everything.

00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:12.731
I'm threatening to get fired
by all my representation.

00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:14.661
And also they sat me
down and they're like,

00:12:14.661 --> 00:12:16.244
what is this, you broke into a bar,

00:12:16.244 --> 00:12:17.766
you stole a football player's jersey,

00:12:17.766 --> 00:12:21.148
and then you brought it back,
and then stole it again?

00:12:21.148 --> 00:12:22.773
(laughing)

00:12:22.773 --> 00:12:23.820
And I was like, well,

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:26.024
it's not funny when you say it like that.

00:12:26.024 --> 00:12:29.090
(laughing)

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.138
But the cool thing that
I'll leave you guys with,

00:12:32.138 --> 00:12:32.971
is,

00:12:33.826 --> 00:12:36.589
Police don't care about jerseys.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.429
(laughing)

00:12:38.429 --> 00:12:40.196
When you steal a kid,

00:12:40.196 --> 00:12:42.676
they go find the kid real quick, ya know?

00:12:42.676 --> 00:12:43.934
When ya rob a bank,

00:12:43.934 --> 00:12:47.052
they try to get as much of
that money back as possible.

00:12:47.052 --> 00:12:48.895
(laughing)

00:12:48.895 --> 00:12:50.728
I still have a jersey.

00:12:51.838 --> 00:12:54.914
(laughing and clapping)

00:12:54.914 --> 00:12:56.690
You guys are great, thank you so much!

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:59.357
(hip hop music)

00:13:01.708 --> 00:13:04.533
- Jeff Dye everybody, starting
center for my basketball team

00:13:04.533 --> 00:13:06.410
Shawn Kemp's Kids.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.438
Thanks Jeff for doing that.

00:13:07.438 --> 00:13:08.930
What a great fucking story.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.454
I booked him based on story alone.

00:13:10.454 --> 00:13:11.664
I was like dude, just come do that,

00:13:11.664 --> 00:13:13.330
I don't care what else you have,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.382
do that story on this show, so thank you.

00:13:15.382 --> 00:13:18.032
Last week I asked you to
leave in the YouTube section

00:13:18.032 --> 00:13:19.912
your ideas with who is
right and who is wrong

00:13:19.912 --> 00:13:20.980
in that fight between me

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.053
and Bobby and Natasha and Rannazzisi.

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:24.617
And a lot of you guys got it right.

00:13:24.617 --> 00:13:27.044
A lot of you guys were
idiots and crossed me!

00:13:27.044 --> 00:13:29.299
Wrote comments that were
negative towards me,

00:13:29.299 --> 00:13:30.356
which I don't like,

00:13:30.356 --> 00:13:32.041
but legally they make me show them,

00:13:32.041 --> 00:13:33.251
so here are those!

00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:34.878
Next week why don't you leave

00:13:34.878 --> 00:13:38.015
your comments in the comments section

00:13:38.015 --> 00:13:39.123
about your best pranks.

00:13:39.123 --> 00:13:40.880
Don't forget to click on the Reddit link

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.436
to join in the conversation.

00:13:42.436 --> 00:13:44.864
Use the hashtag thisisnothappening.

00:13:44.864 --> 00:13:47.031
I'll see you next Tuesday.
