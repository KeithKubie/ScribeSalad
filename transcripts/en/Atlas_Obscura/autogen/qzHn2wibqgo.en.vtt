once the formaldehyde does its thing and
 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.520

the specimen is real tough we washed out

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530
the specimen is real tough we washed out
 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.850
the specimen is real tough we washed out
the formaldehyde with water baths and

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860
the formaldehyde with water baths and
 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.709
the formaldehyde with water baths and
transferred it to 70% ethanol that's

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719
transferred it to 70% ethanol that's
 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.960

everything of that specimen for research

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350
everything of that specimen for research
 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.840

moment yeah I watched it last night by

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459
moment yeah I watched it last night by
 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:46.900
moment yeah I watched it last night by
the way I rented it so it's cool

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910
