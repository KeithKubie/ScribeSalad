and I was reading this other book while

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580
and I was reading this other book while
 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.300
and I was reading this other book while
back as well which was written by the

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310
back as well which was written by the
 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.720
back as well which was written by the
guy who ran the human genome project and

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730
guy who ran the human genome project and
 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.970
guy who ran the human genome project and
I don't remember exactly what it was

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980
I don't remember exactly what it was
 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.930
I don't remember exactly what it was
called but it was something like a

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940
called but it was something like a
 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.999
called but it was something like a
scientists case for God is something

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009
scientists case for God is something
 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.279
scientists case for God is something
like that and one of the things he

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289
like that and one of the things he
 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.980
like that and one of the things he
referred to which didn't strike me as

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990
referred to which didn't strike me as
 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.540
referred to which didn't strike me as
hard as it should have to begin with was

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550
hard as it should have to begin with was
 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.089
hard as it should have to begin with was
the he thought that one of the phenomena

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099
the he thought that one of the phenomena
 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.220
the he thought that one of the phenomena
say that justified a belief in a

say that justified a belief in a
 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.839
say that justified a belief in a
transcendent being was something like

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849
transcendent being was something like
 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.269
transcendent being was something like
the moral intuition of human beings that

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279
the moral intuition of human beings that
 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.190
the moral intuition of human beings that
you know we have a sense of right and

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200
you know we have a sense of right and
 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.920
you know we have a sense of right and
wrong and you know it's certainly in

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930
wrong and you know it's certainly in
 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.810
wrong and you know it's certainly in
what happens in Genesis and the story of

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820
what happens in Genesis and the story of
 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.229
what happens in Genesis and the story of
Adam and Eve is that that that story

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239
Adam and Eve is that that that story
 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.240
Adam and Eve is that that that story
announces the coming of the sense of

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250
announces the coming of the sense of
 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.440
announces the coming of the sense of
right and wrong right the knowledge of

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450
right and wrong right the knowledge of
 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.880
right and wrong right the knowledge of
good and evil and it isn't something we

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890
good and evil and it isn't something we
 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.529
good and evil and it isn't something we
ascribe to animals it's something that's

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539
ascribe to animals it's something that's
 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.110
ascribe to animals it's something that's
unique to human beings animals can be

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120
unique to human beings animals can be
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.090
unique to human beings animals can be
predators and you know and they can be

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100
predators and you know and they can be
 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.760
predators and you know and they can be
gentle and you can have a relationship

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770
gentle and you can have a relationship
 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.709
gentle and you can have a relationship
with them but you never think of an evil

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719
with them but you never think of an evil
 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.229
with them but you never think of an evil
cat or you know or an evil wolf even

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239
cat or you know or an evil wolf even
 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.819
cat or you know or an evil wolf even
though they're you know they're

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829
though they're you know they're
 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.960
though they're you know they're
predatory about human beings we have

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970
predatory about human beings we have
 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.350
predatory about human beings we have
this capacity to judge between good and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360
this capacity to judge between good and
 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.149
this capacity to judge between good and
evil right and wrong and it's really an

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
evil right and wrong and it's really an
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.120
evil right and wrong and it's really an
integral part of our being and I think

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
integral part of our being and I think
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.679
integral part of our being and I think
you can make an evolutionary case for

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689
you can make an evolutionary case for
 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.570
you can make an evolutionary case for
that a biological case for that as you

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580
that a biological case for that as you
 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.260
that a biological case for that as you
can make a biological case for most of

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270
can make a biological case for most of
 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.630
can make a biological case for most of
what is relevant about human beings

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640
what is relevant about human beings
 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.450
what is relevant about human beings
because we're biological creatures but

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460
because we're biological creatures but
 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.499
because we're biological creatures but
we don't really understand the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509
we don't really understand the
 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.660
we don't really understand the
significance of that like what happens

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670
significance of that like what happens
 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.190
significance of that like what happens
in the story of Adam and Eve is that

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
in the story of Adam and Eve is that
 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.380
in the story of Adam and Eve is that
that's that realization not coming to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390
that's that realization not coming to
 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.700
that's that realization not coming to
the knowledge of good and evil is

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710
the knowledge of good and evil is
 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.380
the knowledge of good and evil is
actually represented as a shift of

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
actually represented as a shift of
 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.719
actually represented as a shift of
cosmic significance right it puts a it

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729
cosmic significance right it puts a it
 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.429
cosmic significance right it puts a it
puts a permanent fracture in the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
puts a permanent fracture in the
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.280
puts a permanent fracture in the
structure of being and you know if you

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290
structure of being and you know if you
 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.490
structure of being and you know if you
think of human beings as insignificant

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500
think of human beings as insignificant
 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.530
think of human beings as insignificant

ants on a tiny dust mote in the middle
 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.889
ants on a tiny dust mote in the middle
of an infinite cosmos cosmos that cares

of an infinite cosmos cosmos that cares
 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.219
of an infinite cosmos cosmos that cares
less for us then who cares fundamentally

less for us then who cares fundamentally
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.319
less for us then who cares fundamentally
if human beings have the knowledge to

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329
if human beings have the knowledge to
 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.389
if human beings have the knowledge to
distinguish between good and evil but if

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399
distinguish between good and evil but if
 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.819
distinguish between good and evil but if
you give consciousness a central role in

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829
you give consciousness a central role in
 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.560
you give consciousness a central role in
being and you can make a perfectly

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570
being and you can make a perfectly
 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.120
being and you can make a perfectly
reasonable case for that because without

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130
reasonable case for that because without
 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.700
reasonable case for that because without
consciousness there's no being as far as

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
consciousness there's no being as far as
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.490
consciousness there's no being as far as
anyone can determine so it may be much

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500
anyone can determine so it may be much
 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.290
anyone can determine so it may be much
more central than we think and

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300
more central than we think and
 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.850
more central than we think and
and I really don't think there's a

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860
and I really don't think there's a
 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.010
and I really don't think there's a
counter-argument to that like not a

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020
counter-argument to that like not a
 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.930
counter-argument to that like not a
solid one you can state that

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940
solid one you can state that
 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.640
solid one you can state that
consciousness is epiphenomena land and

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650
consciousness is epiphenomena land and
 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.930
consciousness is epiphenomena land and
that the world is fundamentally

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940
that the world is fundamentally
 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.030
that the world is fundamentally
materialistic and it doesn't matter that

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040
materialistic and it doesn't matter that
 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.830
materialistic and it doesn't matter that
there's consciousness you can state that

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840
there's consciousness you can state that
 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.600
there's consciousness you can state that
but you can make an equally credible

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610
but you can make an equally credible
 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.030
but you can make an equally credible
case the other way and certainly our

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040
case the other way and certainly our
 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.890
case the other way and certainly our
lived experience is that consciousness

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900
lived experience is that consciousness
 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.310
lived experience is that consciousness
is crucial obviously and we treat each

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320
is crucial obviously and we treat each
 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.290
is crucial obviously and we treat each
other as if most of the time we're

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300
other as if most of the time we're
 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.870
other as if most of the time we're
valuable conscious beings and we

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880
valuable conscious beings and we
 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.640
valuable conscious beings and we
wouldn't give up our consciousness even

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650
wouldn't give up our consciousness even
 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.930
wouldn't give up our consciousness even
though it's often consciousness of

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940
though it's often consciousness of
 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.210
though it's often consciousness of
suffering and so then I think another

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220
suffering and so then I think another
 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.540
suffering and so then I think another
problem with the book is that it's it's

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550
problem with the book is that it's it's
 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.370
problem with the book is that it's it's
sort of predicated on the idea that life

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380
sort of predicated on the idea that life
 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.190
sort of predicated on the idea that life
is for happiness and I don't think

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200
is for happiness and I don't think
 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.540
is for happiness and I don't think
that's right and I don't think that's

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550
that's right and I don't think that's
 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.400
that's right and I don't think that's
how people experience life and I might

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410
how people experience life and I might
 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.270
how people experience life and I might
be wrong but it seems to me that people

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280
be wrong but it seems to me that people
 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.460
be wrong but it seems to me that people
experience life as something like a

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470
experience life as something like a
 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.820
experience life as something like a
series of crucial ethical decisions it's

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830
series of crucial ethical decisions it's
 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.850
series of crucial ethical decisions it's
something like that I mean when I just

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860
something like that I mean when I just
 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.660
something like that I mean when I just
can't imagine and maybe I'm being naive

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670
can't imagine and maybe I'm being naive
 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.390
can't imagine and maybe I'm being naive
about this but I can't imagine that I

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400
about this but I can't imagine that I
 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.820
about this but I can't imagine that I
can't imagine another being

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830
can't imagine another being
 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.540
can't imagine another being
that's like mean in in most senses that

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550
that's like mean in in most senses that
 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.290
that's like mean in in most senses that
isn't constantly wrestling in some sense

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300
isn't constantly wrestling in some sense
 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.140
isn't constantly wrestling in some sense
with what the next proper thing to do is

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150
with what the next proper thing to do is
 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.700
with what the next proper thing to do is
it's not like it's obvious it's not

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710
it's not like it's obvious it's not
 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.830
it's not like it's obvious it's not
bloody obvious and it doesn't mean

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840
bloody obvious and it doesn't mean
 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.570
bloody obvious and it doesn't mean
you'll do the right thing because you

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580
you'll do the right thing because you
 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.970
you'll do the right thing because you
don't law lots of times and you know

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980
don't law lots of times and you know
 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.400
don't law lots of times and you know
that by your own judgement right because

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410
that by your own judgement right because
 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.480
that by your own judgement right because
you're making mistakes all the time

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490
you're making mistakes all the time
 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.920
you're making mistakes all the time
sometimes you don't know what you're

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930
sometimes you don't know what you're
 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.330
sometimes you don't know what you're
doing and maybe it's a mistake and maybe

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340
doing and maybe it's a mistake and maybe
 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.460
doing and maybe it's a mistake and maybe
it isn't and who's to say but that isn't

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470
it isn't and who's to say but that isn't
 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.630
it isn't and who's to say but that isn't
what I'm talking and what I'm talking

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640
what I'm talking and what I'm talking
 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.830
what I'm talking and what I'm talking
about when you know that what you're

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840
about when you know that what you're
 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.570
about when you know that what you're
doing is wrong and you go ahead and do

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580
doing is wrong and you go ahead and do
 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.340
doing is wrong and you go ahead and do
it anyways people do that all the time

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350
it anyways people do that all the time
 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.710
it anyways people do that all the time
and that's also extremely peculiar you

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720
and that's also extremely peculiar you
 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.240
and that's also extremely peculiar you
bloody well think that if you knew it

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250
bloody well think that if you knew it
 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.250
bloody well think that if you knew it
was wrong and you told yourself that it

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260
was wrong and you told yourself that it
 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.020
was wrong and you told yourself that it
was wrong that that would be sufficient

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030
was wrong that that would be sufficient
 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.790
was wrong that that would be sufficient
so that you just wouldn't do it but that

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800
so that you just wouldn't do it but that
 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.380
so that you just wouldn't do it but that
isn't what you're like at all you know

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390
isn't what you're like at all you know
 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.000
isn't what you're like at all you know
and you can tell yourself something is

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010
and you can tell yourself something is
 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.070
and you can tell yourself something is
wrong a 50 times and you'll do it the

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080
wrong a 50 times and you'll do it the
 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.230
wrong a 50 times and you'll do it the
51st time and then you'll feel you know

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240
51st time and then you'll feel you know
 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.840
51st time and then you'll feel you know
like like you deserve to feel probably

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850
like like you deserve to feel probably
 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.130
like like you deserve to feel probably
and but it doesn't stop you and so so

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140
and but it doesn't stop you and so so
 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.900
and but it doesn't stop you and so so
then I think the other problem with the

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910
then I think the other problem with the
 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.720
then I think the other problem with the
viewpoint the idea that the suffering of

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730
viewpoint the idea that the suffering of
 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.750
viewpoint the idea that the suffering of
life eradicate sits utility is that it's

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760
life eradicate sits utility is that it's
 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.690
life eradicate sits utility is that it's
predicated on the idea that happiness or

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700
predicated on the idea that happiness or
 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.080
predicated on the idea that happiness or
lack of suffering even is

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090
lack of suffering even is
 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.760
lack of suffering even is
the right criteria by which to judge

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770
the right criteria by which to judge
 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.330
the right criteria by which to judge
life and I don't think that's how we

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340
life and I don't think that's how we
 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.490
life and I don't think that's how we
actually experience life I think what we

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500
actually experience life I think what we
 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.890
actually experience life I think what we
do instead is put ourselves through a

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900
do instead is put ourselves through a
 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.210
do instead is put ourselves through a
series of excruciating moral choices you

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220
series of excruciating moral choices you
 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.680
series of excruciating moral choices you
know and one of the things that that's

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690
know and one of the things that that's
 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.200
know and one of the things that that's
really significant about the biblical

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210
really significant about the biblical
 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.790
really significant about the biblical
stories and I think about the the entire

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800
stories and I think about the the entire
 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.520
stories and I think about the the entire
implicit philosophy you know that's

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530
implicit philosophy you know that's
 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.010
implicit philosophy you know that's
embedded in the stories is that that's

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020
embedded in the stories is that that's
 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.350
embedded in the stories is that that's
how life is presented in in the stories

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360
how life is presented in in the stories
 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.420
how life is presented in in the stories
is all of these individuals first

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430
is all of these individuals first
 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.950
is all of these individuals first
they're individuals - not groups and

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960
they're individuals - not groups and
 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.650
they're individuals - not groups and
second they're agonizing over their

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660
second they're agonizing over their
 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.750
second they're agonizing over their
moral choices all the time all the time

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760
moral choices all the time all the time
 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.360
moral choices all the time all the time
and they have a relationship with God

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370
and they have a relationship with God
 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.810
and they have a relationship with God
and but it's not a it's not a directive

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820
and but it's not a it's not a directive
 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.800
and but it's not a it's not a directive
relationship exactly even the people to

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810
relationship exactly even the people to
 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.230
relationship exactly even the people to
whom God speaks directly which I suspect

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240
whom God speaks directly which I suspect
 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.969
whom God speaks directly which I suspect
is not something you'd exactly want to

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979
is not something you'd exactly want to
 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:25.850
is not something you'd exactly want to
have happen is it's there's still even

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860
have happen is it's there's still even
 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.870
have happen is it's there's still even
the fact that they have a direct

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880
the fact that they have a direct
 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.909
the fact that they have a direct
relationship with God doesn't stop them

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919
relationship with God doesn't stop them
 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:30.920
relationship with God doesn't stop them
from being tormented continually by

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930
from being tormented continually by
 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.310
from being tormented continually by
their moral choices and so the world is

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320
their moral choices and so the world is
 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.670
their moral choices and so the world is
presented as a moral landscape not as a

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680
presented as a moral landscape not as a
 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.460
presented as a moral landscape not as a
not as a place that justifies itself by

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470
not as a place that justifies itself by
 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.560
not as a place that justifies itself by
happiness it's presented as a moral

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570
happiness it's presented as a moral
 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.320
happiness it's presented as a moral
landscape and people are presented as

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330
landscape and people are presented as
 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.779
landscape and people are presented as
creatures who traverse through the moral

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789
creatures who traverse through the moral
 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:51.260
creatures who traverse through the moral
landscape making ethical decisions that

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270
landscape making ethical decisions that
 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.140
landscape making ethical decisions that
determine the course of the world and

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150
determine the course of the world and
 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.640
determine the course of the world and
that seems to me to be right and that's

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650
that seems to me to be right and that's
 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.830
that seems to me to be right and that's
not a that's not the same as happiness

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840
not a that's not the same as happiness
 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.690
not a that's not the same as happiness
by any stretch of the imagination it's a

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700
by any stretch of the imagination it's a
 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.730
by any stretch of the imagination it's a
whole different category of being and

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740
whole different category of being and
 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.840
whole different category of being and
you know and then I thought that through

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850
you know and then I thought that through
 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.550
you know and then I thought that through
a lot and I think well we do make

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560
a lot and I think well we do make
 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.310
a lot and I think well we do make
choices and what we do is contend with

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:10.320
choices and what we do is contend with
 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.529
choices and what we do is contend with
the future you know and that the future

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:12.539
the future you know and that the future
 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.180
the future you know and that the future
seems to appear to us as a realm of

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190
seems to appear to us as a realm of
 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.570
seems to appear to us as a realm of
possibility that's a more accurate way

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580
possibility that's a more accurate way
 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.159
possibility that's a more accurate way
of thinking about it then then that the

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169
of thinking about it then then that the
 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.469
of thinking about it then then that the
future presents itself to it to us as a

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479
future presents itself to it to us as a
 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:25.279
future presents itself to it to us as a
realm of determined things it's its

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289
realm of determined things it's its
 

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:26.630
realm of determined things it's its
presents itself as a realm of

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640
presents itself as a realm of
 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.340
presents itself as a realm of
possibility and there's good choices in

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350
possibility and there's good choices in
 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.590
possibility and there's good choices in
that realm and there's poor choices or

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600
that realm and there's poor choices or
 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.390
that realm and there's poor choices or
even evil choices in that realm and

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400
even evil choices in that realm and
 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.170
even evil choices in that realm and
we're negotiating continually deciding

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180
we're negotiating continually deciding
 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.460
we're negotiating continually deciding
which of those choices we're going to

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470
which of those choices we're going to
 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.770
which of those choices we're going to
bring into being that seems to me to be

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780
bring into being that seems to me to be
 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:40.640
bring into being that seems to me to be
from

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650
from
 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.710
from
logically indisputable and we certainly

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720
logically indisputable and we certainly
 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.110
logically indisputable and we certainly
treat each other as if that's what we're

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120
treat each other as if that's what we're
 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.070
treat each other as if that's what we're
doing because we hold each other

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080
doing because we hold each other
 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.900
doing because we hold each other
responsible for our actions you know

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910
responsible for our actions you know
 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.270
responsible for our actions you know
with some exceptions and that we're

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280
with some exceptions and that we're
 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.210
with some exceptions and that we're
deciding each moment whether to make

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220
deciding each moment whether to make
 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:58.219
deciding each moment whether to make
things better or worse and that seems to

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:58.229
things better or worse and that seems to
 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:01.129
things better or worse and that seems to
me to be correct and I think that that's

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:01.139
me to be correct and I think that that's
 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:04.100
me to be correct and I think that that's
what these stories illustrate they don't

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.110
what these stories illustrate they don't
 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.590
what these stories illustrate they don't
say that directly you know although I

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:06.600
say that directly you know although I
 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.240
say that directly you know although I
think it gets more and more explicit as

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250
