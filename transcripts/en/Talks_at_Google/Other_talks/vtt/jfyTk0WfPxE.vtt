[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.164 --> 00:00:12.990
NIALL MELLON: And
hello, Googlers.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.010
Thank you for taking time
out of your lunch break

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.350
today to hear about our
story with Mellon Educate.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.010
It all started for me in 2002.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.910
I went on a holiday
to South Africa.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.720
And when we left the main
international airport heading

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.770
for the city center,
I was shocked

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.340
by the size tens of
thousands of shacks abutting

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.480
the side of a modern motorway.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.050
I was fascinated and
disturbed by this sight.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.460
And my girlfriend and I had
rented a house in Cape Town

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.830
for a couple of weeks.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.310
And after a couple
of days, I said

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.150
to the guy who was looking
after the house for us,

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.020
would he mind bringing me
to the nearest township.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.410
I wanted to see who were
the people who were living

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.880
in these terrible conditions.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.170
The first thing
he said to me was,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.770
white people don't go
into these townships,

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.020
and look, it's better
off, you stay out.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.120
It's too dangerous.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.030
And if you want to do something,
donate a bit of money,

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.480
but really it's not a
good idea to go in there.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.870
And being a stubborn
Irishman entrepreneur,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.986
I pushed him a bit
further, and he gave in.

00:01:28.986 --> 00:01:35.500
And four minutes later I was
in a township with a lifestyle

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.690
maybe 300 or 400 years
different to the one

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.290
I was living in the
house that we had rented,

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:42.980
and it was only
four or five minutes

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.520
away from where we were.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.030
I started out probably
very similar to everybody

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.670
here in the room with my
own dreams and ambitions,

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.030
and one of the first things
that really hit me was how--

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.640
I think all of us as we
progress through our career,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.170
when we overcome one obstacle
or we achieve one achievement,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.490
we take on a bigger
target in front of us.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.870
And all of the people that I met
in this township, none of them

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.980
had dreams that
even went a fraction

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.710
as far as mine had gone.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.470
And I met the local
community, and I

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.600
walked around this township.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.780
And the first thing
that surprised me

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.150
was how friendly
everybody was to me.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.990
There wasn't the-- there
wasn't the fear or intimidation

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.210
that I had felt I would
get going into a township.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.660
Once I said a warm
hello to people,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.160
I got a warm hello back.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.820
I asked that community was
there any way I could help,

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.200
and they said to me-- this
was 15 years ago-- that they

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.560
had a number of school-leavers
who had qualified for college

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.970
but didn't have the means
financially to get to college.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.750
And that was the beginning of my
connection with this township.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.200
I ended up sponsoring a number
of students through college.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.130
And a short time afterwards we
were still on the same holiday,

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.650
so it had to have been
in the first three weeks,

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.390
I met the community
leaders and I asked what

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.690
was the situation with housing.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.890
This community of 12,000
people on 24 acres

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.670
had built a total of six houses
in the previous 12 years.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.030
So the sum total of
effort of 12,000 people

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.130
was one house every two years.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.940
And I asked to
meet the community,

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.050
and the following day I was
brought back and put on top

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.200
of a number of wooden pallets.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.320
And I found myself speaking
to a few hundred local people.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.437
And I said to them that
if they were willing,

00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:50.770
I was willing to work with--
if they were willing for me

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.920
to work with them, then I
was willing to try and see

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.630
could we improve the
housing situation.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.520
So we launched a
housing program,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.040
and I committed to building
450 houses over three years.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.600
And I was still on a holiday.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.570
And soon afterwards,
I found myself

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.530
in a rented car with a
wheelbarrow in the boot of it

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.800
and looking at how we were
going to start this project.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.620
I spent a couple of
months planning it.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.650
And shortly after we started
building the houses, maybe

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.890
two weeks afterwards
the police arrived

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.420
into the township
looking for me,

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.420
and word had got around Cape
Town-- it was now on the radio

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.190
that this guy on a holiday
had started building houses

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.769
in one of the townships, and
the police said to me, look,

00:04:38.769 --> 00:04:40.310
we understand what
you're doing here.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.010
You're big hearted,
well-meaning,

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.660
but you're going
to get killed here.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.920
You're not going to live
more than two weeks.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.090
The gangs are going
to kill you, and look,

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.360
you can't come in with no
experience as a foreigner

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.270
and just help.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.100
You just won't last.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.990
So I went back to
our rented house

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.120
and weighed up that
for a somber evening,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.790
and maybe it's the stubbornness
of being an entrepreneur,

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.714
but I said to
Nicola, my partner,

00:05:06.714 --> 00:05:08.630
that well, look, I've
said I'm going to do it,

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.940
so I'm just going
to do it regardless,

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.100
and hopefully things
will work out OK.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.050
And after a short time
building the houses,

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.570
it really dawned on me that this
is an experience that everybody

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.840
should have in your
lifetime, maybe

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.840
not to make as big of a
life changes as I have made.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.070
But what if people
could just decide

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.080
to give six or seven days of
your life helping poor people?

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.180
Wouldn't that be amazing?

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.010
Even if we went back to
our own lives afterwards.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.760
So I announced a volunteer
trip, and the first year I

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.160
aimed to get 150 people.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.750
And maybe half of them I
personally twisted their arms,

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.600
and I did a couple
of radio interviews.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.520
But 150 people signed up,
and the second year we

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.620
were thinking what would we do.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.700
And we said, look, why don't we
just try and double our target.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.110
So we doubled it, and then
we doubled it and doubled it

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.460
and doubled it, and five or
six years later our trips

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.300
had gone from 150
to 300, 700, 1,400.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:16.480
And by 2008, over 3,000 people
applied to come on our trip.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.330
I decided to host all
of our trips on one week

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.580
every year instead of doing
maybe 20 little trips.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.120
In 2008, we had almost
2,000-- over 2,000 people

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.820
took off from the
London airports here.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.760
We had to charter our
own jumbo jets for the--

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.290
we couldn't get
enough seats on planes

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.430
to bring them all
down to Cape Town.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.430
And on one day I
stood at the airport,

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.630
I wanted to shake hands
with every person who

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.510
was decent enough
to come and help

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.080
the mission that I had started
that now became our mission.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:56.100
And over 19 hours I shook hands
with over 2,000 volunteers.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.020
Our charity within five years
became the largest housing

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.070
producer on the
continent of Africa,

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:08.800
and all fueled through a spirit
of collective volunteerism.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.160
Maeve mentioned Nelson Mandela.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.740
And I was very privileged--

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.740
I'm not sure of the exact
date, but within a year or two

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:20.350
I got a phone call
through somebody

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.480
that Mr. Mandela
would like to meet me.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.860
And he was really fascinated
how so many people

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.240
from this part of
the world would

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.430
come and volunteer to help
people they had never met.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.820
And he really was full of such
admiration and appreciation

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.330
for the efforts that all
of our volunteers had made.

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.230
So when we look at our
housing program now,

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.600
our official figure is 125,000.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.460
But we are probably
closer to 200,000 people

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.070
are living in houses built out
of the toil and sweat of people

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.940
same as I see here
in front of me today.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.270
Three-quarters of
all of our volunteers

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.440
have no specific
building trade skill.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.600
They just have big
hearts and a desire

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:11.830
to enrich their own lives and
make a difference in the world.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:17.800
In 2007, USA-- or maybe it was
2006 I met the United States

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.690
government, and USA
applauded the efficiency

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.130
of our housing charity.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:27.160
They said to me they thought we
were the world's most efficient

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.950
housing charity, but
they said they wouldn't

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:35.320
be able to help us unless
Congress voted to assist us,

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.909
that on a technical
position on their structure

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:42.380
they weren't allowed to give
money for permanent dwellings,

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:44.020
even though they
said they could spend

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:49.940
$25,000 on a tent in Kosovo,
but a permanent structure

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.640
was just a technicality.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.760
And two years later,
one of the first pieces

00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.940
of legislation passed by
the Obama administration

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.920
was a law in Congress directing
US aid to support the Mellon

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.435
Township Initiative.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:16.990
We've achieved great
impact in South Africa.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:20.190
And when we first started,
the national housing subsidy

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:24.280
per house per family
was 1,000 US dollars,

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.270
and the Mellon
organization started

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:30.930
to build a house for $10,000,
a really good-quality structure

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.100
that would in time
go up in value

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.610
and be an asset to a poor
family to build a better

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.060
life from a quality house.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.230
Within seven or eight years,
the South African budget

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:50.280
had increased almost 1,000%,
and now throughout South Africa

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.210
it is effectively
the Niall Mellon

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:55.430
house that is built
throughout the entire country.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.720
The house that is now in the
South African National Housing

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.110
Program is effectively a
copy of the Mellon house

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.470
that we started to build.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:08.830
Three years ago we
looked at ourselves,

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.080
and we were at a crossroads.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.810
And we said, well, do we
take a path in the back,

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.790
and do we recognize we've done
something special in housing

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:20.060
and call it a day and go
back to our ordinary lives,

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.070
or do we try and
build on the magic

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:26.180
of collective volunteerism and
do something in another space

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.300
where a lot of help is needed?

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.030
And we decided we would
get into education.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.920
It's probably singularly
the biggest single space

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.620
on the planet where people
in poverty and developing

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.920
countries need help.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.060
And we decided as
a strategy that we

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.110
would spend a couple of years
slowly learning about education

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:51.100
to try and find the sweet spots,
the special spaces that if we

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:53.290
could get help from
talented people,

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:55.590
that we really could
make potentially

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.490
a global impact with
our education program.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:03.070
I set a personal mission
to go and visit 100 schools

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.580
and to sit with the parents,
the teachers, the school

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:08.300
principals, the
governing boards,

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:13.650
and ask thousands of questions
and try and just spot the gap

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:17.820
where maybe help could--

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:22.910
large-scale intervention with
a twist on the existing program

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.390
might lead to
something very special.

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:27.910
So we've started a
couple of initiatives.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.420
Firstly, we need
help from people

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.020
to help us build
good quality schools.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.430
If you're not in a classroom
that's dry from the rain

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:40.840
and safe and secure,
children can't study

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.680
to the best of their capacity.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.580
So the first thing we do
in the Mellon organization

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.690
is make sure we built
a structure that's

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.540
fit for purpose.

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.130
The second part we
do afterwards is

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.320
we try and train the
teachers up to a standard

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.240
to achieve a much
better performance.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.000
So we looked around some
of the schools in townships

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.420
throughout South Africa for
exceptional school principals

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:10.770
who had achieved results as good
as any top school in the world

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:11.740
anywhere.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.680
And one of the first
people we recruited

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.870
was a school principal who
went into a secondary school

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:21.230
of 1,500 pupils and
a pass rate of 27%.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:25.045
In one year, he got it to
82% percent and in two years

00:12:25.045 --> 00:12:25.545
to 96%.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.020
We were really privileged
that he joined our team,

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.220
and talented people,
as you people know,

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.750
find other talented people.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:38.260
And from that small base,
we recruited the beginning

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.610
of our education team.

00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:44.630
We looked at South Africa, which
deserves an awful lot of credit

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:45.910
for what she has achieved.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.680
It's very easy to
look at the things

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.560
that South Africa is not
doing maybe as well as she

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.960
should, but overall--

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.080
and I've learned a lot about
South Africa in the last 15

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:56.860
years.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.950
I would be an enormous--

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:02.970
an enormous fan of everything
South Africa has achieved.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.260
She's 23 years old
as a democracy.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.380
She's putting in more
money into education

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.870
than any other developing
country in the world.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:17.120
She's putting in over 6
and 1/2% of her entire GDP

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.670
into education, and that
compares to European countries

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.780
at approximately 4 and 1/2%.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.450
So she's putting in
between 1/3 to 50%

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:29.150
more than European countries
are putting into education.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:33.100
But she has inherited an
enormous backlog of problems.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.110
Many South African teachers who
specialize in English, maths,

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:40.560
and literacy under the
old apartheid regime

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.420
were never trained in the
subjects that they're teaching,

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:48.300
and we frequently meet teachers
who for 25 or 30 years in a row

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:52.110
have never achieved a pass
rate in maths of over 5%

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:53.800
in their subject.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.480
But South Africa's trying to
embrace everybody and move

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.612
forward, and we've--

00:14:00.612 --> 00:14:03.160
we have a new process
beginning where

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.350
we've asked South Africa to
take some of the money she's

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:09.470
spending on teachers,
some of the money

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:13.630
that they spend on the remaining
parts of a school budget,

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:16.050
and give that to an
organization like Mellon

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.520
where we can run some
schools ourselves,

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.970
which hopefully will become
real starship examples of what

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:26.670
can be achieved with a less--

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:32.280
a less maybe-- less inherited
approach to school management.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:35.530
So we have now taken over the
management of a few schools

00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:38.760
that the Mellon
organization are running,

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.935
and in less than 12 months the
difference in the performance

00:14:41.935 --> 00:14:44.120
of our schools is staggering.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.600
We've achieved an
improvement of almost 50%

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.330
in our first 12 months in
our first couple of schools.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.790
But we have much,
much further to go,

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.950
and we won't be able to get
there without help from people

00:14:57.950 --> 00:15:00.150
like you listening
to me today who

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:04.970
have the knowledge and the
mindset to help us to scale up.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.860
One of the areas that we are
really interested in doing

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.770
is capitalizing on
the human goodwill

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:14.240
that we have experienced
over the past 15 years.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.390
Everywhere we go
throughout the world people

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.300
are full of love and goodwill.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.330
We've had over 22,000
volunteers, which is remarkable

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:28.000
considering that 50% of them
came from the UK and Ireland,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.190
and each of those people raised
between four and 6,000 pounds

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:33.570
to come with us.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.170
And together we
changed the landscape

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.390
of a country of 50
million people on housing.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:43.880
And we need your help today
to do this on education.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.780
So the area that we
are looking at now

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:51.780
is how innovation and e-learning
can accelerate our program.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.770
And what we see as
a major gap that--

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.410
now, maybe you guys will find
it, where we haven't seen it.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:01.180
Maybe somebody is doing it,
but we haven't seen it so far.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:06.580
And that is connecting retired
or active school teachers

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:09.150
in developed countries with--

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.760
and mentoring
teacher-to-teacher,

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.850
body-to-body, volunteering
teaching program

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:17.600
with teachers in
developing countries.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.370
If I put this into context,
in the United States

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:24.390
we have approximately 3
and 1/2 million teachers.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.310
Here in the UK we have
approximately half a

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.100
million teachers.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:33.000
In the United States,
75,000 teachers

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.800
retire every year and
proportionately similar figures

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.450
in the UK.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:45.100
If we get one hour a week
from 2% of the teaching

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.250
community in the United
States or the United Kingdom,

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.850
that will immediately impact
in a transformational way

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:56.130
four million children
in South Africa.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:58.900
So to improve the lives
of four million children,

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:03.070
we just need one hour
a week through 2%

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:07.790
of the teaching community in
the United States and the UK.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.040
And how do we do this?

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.760
We do it through technology,
and the biggest deficit areas

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.520
in education in South Africa
are literacy, mathematics,

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.405
and language.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:26.810
37% of children in South Africa
who've been in school for six

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:30.018
years cannot read.

00:17:30.018 --> 00:17:35.850
37% cannot read after being
in school for six years.

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:39.010
Now, how little time
would it take not just--

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:40.910
I'm talking today
about teachers,

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:43.480
but imagine if it was just
people like yourselves

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.810
and ourselves who are trained
up in a little bit of literacy

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:47.820
coaching.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.700
There's so many skilled
literacy programs

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.630
where amateur people like
ourselves can actually

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:57.280
sit and read a book
over the internet

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.480
using technology to a child
or a pupil at the other end,

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:06.010
and that child's education is
going to change dramatically.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.020
What I learned
through volunteerism

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:14.460
was the impact of large-scale
collective volunteerism.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.280
In South Africa
initially there was

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.410
a curiosity, about
150 volunteers coming,

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.700
a bit more interested,
300 the following year,

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.580
a lot more at 700, and
then when 1,400 came

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.480
on one go, an enormous impact.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:33.100
And then when over 2,000
came into a city of a couple

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.520
of million people in Cape
Town-- in the evening times,

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.584
it's a first-world country where
the people you meet on the trip

00:18:39.584 --> 00:18:41.750
that-- during the day when
you're working with them,

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.583
you're go out to
restaurants in the evening.

00:18:43.583 --> 00:18:47.420
So all the taxi drivers
are meeting our volunteers,

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.080
and the city gets
an enormous boost

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.010
at the end of such a week.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:56.510
We use our one week
every year to leverage

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:01.390
inspirational goodwill for
the incumbent government

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:02.410
in South Africa.

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:06.430
So we invite ministers
and leading politicians.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:11.140
And for most of the time people
are critical of politicians,

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.630
and maybe in some
cases deserve it

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:17.330
but not in all cases, that I
see the sincerity and integrity

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.920
of a lot of people working in
the South African structure.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.950
And maybe what our trip does is
just send a message once a year

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.640
that there are many of
us around the world who

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.010
care about the
effort you are making

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:33.260
to improve the lives
of your people.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:38.900
On the last occasion that I was
ever to meet Nelson Mandela,

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.440
I had the cheek to go
to him and tell him

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.430
I wasn't coming to
see him anymore.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.340
And he posed for a
few moments, and I

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:51.449
thought had I overstepped
my mark here, me telling him

00:19:51.449 --> 00:19:53.240
I wasn't going to come
and see him anymore.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.510
But I meant it in a nice way,
that he was an elderly man,

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:59.420
advancing years, and
I felt he should just

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.750
be left for some special
time in his remaining

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.060
years with his family.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:07.710
And I said to him that
maybe not one of us

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:10.640
could fill your footsteps,
but together there

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.660
are many thousands
of us who can.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.080
And I said to
Mandela that you can

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.500
rely on me as one
of your lieutenants

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.920
to continue the journey
that I've started,

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.150
inspired by people like
you and other great South

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:25.990
African leaders.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:30.220
And when we parted, Mandela
reached across the table

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:34.730
and held my hand and said
that I should never forget,

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:37.400
that everything is
possible through the power

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.640
of the collective
effort of people.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.170
And the Google-- the Google
business-- the Google journey

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.790
is extraordinary.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.500
In the history of the
world, has there ever

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.840
been companies like
Google that have

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.350
been able to have had and
achieve such a global impact

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.420
on all of our lives.

00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:01.530
We are living in a very
uncertain and turbulent time

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:02.220
in the world.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.430
You all know what's happening
between the United States

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.690
and North Korea and
what's happening in Syria.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:11.840
And I think there have been
very few moments in history

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:16.580
when large-scale volunteerism
has been as important as it

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.240
is now to balance the
great progress we've

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.450
made in the world.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:24.730
What better message we can
send to struggling nations

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:27.140
than large-scale
volunteering trips

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:31.310
that serve to inspire and
deliver greater progress

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.020
in those countries.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:36.990
So we have two requests of
you today that some of you

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:40.066
might consider coming out
on our volunteering trip.

00:21:40.066 --> 00:21:41.690
Debs is going to talk
a little bit more

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:44.860
about that in a few
moments, and it's

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.340
one week out of your lives.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:51.090
But I can truly say to you it's
a week the memories of which

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.770
will never ever leave you.

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:57.210
It is so humbling and special
to meet some of the poorest

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:59.530
citizens on our
planet and to hear

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.630
their dreams and their
ambitions and help

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:07.370
improve the chances of those
dreams becoming fulfilled.

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:10.380
We need help then on
the technical side.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:14.300
We are a very small charity
who's achieved great impact.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.720
But now we're a new charity
starting in education.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.450
We need your help to promote
Mellon Educate to help

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:25.130
us promote volunteerism and
recruit more volunteers.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:28.550
What if-- instead of
2,000 volunteers coming,

00:22:28.550 --> 00:22:30.890
what if over the next
two or three years

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:35.200
we have a moment with
5,000 volunteers arriving

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.500
in South Africa?

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:40.050
What would be the ripple
effect of such a positive trip

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:41.210
like that?

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:45.450
On the innovation
and technology side,

00:22:45.450 --> 00:22:50.080
imagine how a large-scale
internet-based volunteering

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.920
program could affect the
lives of millions and millions

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.320
of children so easily.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.980
And one hour a
week is all we need

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.070
from people in developed
countries and particularly

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:05.940
teachers initially
to benefit children.

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:11.390
And so I'm going to leave you
with one last story of my times

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:17.670
with Mandela, which perhaps
this story will demonstrate what

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:21.690
Mandela meant to the world, and
in a way what South Africa's

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:24.270
success means certainly
for Africa, if not

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:26.080
for the whole planet.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.830
One time I was with Mr.
Mandela and another friend,

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:34.370
and I was asked to
meet this young guy.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:39.300
And Mandela said, now you
tell Niall your story.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.220
And this guy said to me,
well, I was a young boy of--

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.330
I can't remember exactly.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:46.240
I'll pitch to this,
I'll be slightly wrong.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.800
But approximately
12 years of age when

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.410
the war broke out in Rwanda.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:55.910
And I can't remember if it
was on the Hutu or Tutsi side,

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.960
but the other side
came into his house.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:02.800
And in front of him, they killed
his parents and all of his five

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.750
or six brothers and sisters.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.810
And this young boy
went down to the elder

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:12.020
in his village terrified,
and said, what do I do?

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.450
They've said they're going
to come back for me tomorrow.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.210
And the elder said-- it
was just when Mandela

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:19.800
had been made president.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.050
And the elder said, if you
can get to South Africa,

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:24.460
you'll be safe.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.920
Mandela has just
been made president.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.310
And you have to get
to South Africa.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:34.320
And that little boy gathered
his underpants and I think two

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.200
T-shirts and a little
bag, and he walked--

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.430
or probably got a train--

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.270
train journey or hitched
posts along the way,

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:47.270
but he made it over
3,000 miles simply

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:51.730
on the inspiration of what
Mandela could do for him.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:54.640
And Mandela's
legacy has been one

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.540
of embracing everybody
at the same time

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.890
as trying to help
his own country.

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.220
South Africa has
never been given

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.810
enough credit for the
fact that she has kept

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:08.660
her borders open to refugees.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:13.200
Several million people have
found a home in South Africa

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:18.860
in the 23 years of the new
democracy in South Africa.

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:22.150
And it is vital to the
continent of Africa

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:25.650
that we help South Africa
to achieve true success

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:27.410
as quickly as possible.

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:30.890
And the ripple effect of that
will reach an entire continent.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:34.130
So I hope I'll see some
of you in South Africa,

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:36.030
and maybe some of
you might have ideas.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.210
Together maybe we
could potentially

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:41.480
form a Mellon Educate Google
team on the innovation

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:45.490
side that might be able to
help some dinosaurs like myself

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:50.290
to find a better way to quickly
get through that innovation

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:53.500
opportunity and create
a platform that will--

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:58.180
that will give an opportunity
for teachers to help

00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.840
our children in South Africa.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:01.750
Thank you very much.

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.600
[APPLAUSE]
