[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.120
LOUISE GRAY: Thank you for
taking up your lunch hour this.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.270
So I wanted to start with how
many people in the audience

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.010
are vegetarian?

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.720
A couple.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.582
Is anyone in the audience vegan?

00:00:20.582 --> 00:00:22.780
AUDIENCE: I'm almost
a vegan-arian.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.620
LOUISE GRAY: Yeah, yeah,
I did that as well.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.790
I found it really tough.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.530
Anyway, OK, great.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.780
And who thinks they ought
to be vegan or vegetarian,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.590
but you can't resist
when they have something

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.070
nice in the restaurant
or occasionally if you

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.230
go to your granny
for Sunday roast,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.820
you sort of are slightly
British about it?

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.700
Is anyone?

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.630
Yeah.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.040
So that was me.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.090
I was working as an environment
correspondent on the "Daily

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.320
Telegraph" newspaper.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.040
So I was interviewing climate
change scientists all the time

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.510
and writing about
climate change.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.510
And I knew that
emissions from livestock

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.870
make up more than all the
transport in the world put

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.150
together.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.860
And I knew that one of the
easiest things I could do

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.760
was to give up eating meat.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.260
I also knew all
the other threats.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.410
I don't know if any of you
have seen "Cowspiracy,"

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.090
but obviously, growing an
animal takes more water.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.234
You might clear forests.

00:01:25.234 --> 00:01:26.900
There's all the fossil
fuels and growing

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.330
the feed for the animal.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.520
And at the far end
of the scale, you

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.870
can talk about it driving
species extinctions, ocean

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.690
dead zones.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.840
And again, I thought, well,
the easiest thing I could do

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.000
was go vegetarian.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.120
But I'm a farmer's daughter.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.570
And I go home, and I
try to be a vegetarian.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.670
And my granny or
my dad would say,

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.700
well, this is venison
from the hill, you know?

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.590
These animals are
eating all the trees.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.840
What's wrong with eating this?

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.284
Or it's free-range cattle.

00:01:59.284 --> 00:02:00.950
You can see them out
in the field there.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.900
They don't look miserable to me.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.560
So I thought, OK, I am going
to do something quite extreme.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.789
I'm going to only eat
animals I kill myself.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.880
So I'm getting a
little ahead of myself.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.530
These are all the other
benefits of agriculture.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.240
I thought obviously I could
see, from my own family--

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.344
farming families who make their
money out of raising meat.

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:26.510
But they also sustain the
countryside when you think

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.780
about drystone walls and what
you see when you go on holidays

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.360
to the countryside--
carbon storage,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.350
past delays are actually just as
good as storing carbon as rain

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.430
forests--

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.500
waste-- if animals are being
killed, why not eat them?

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.030
So I decided to be an
ethical carnivore, which

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.510
is, to me, to only eat animals
I killed myself, because then I

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.670
thought I can truly justify it.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.000
So I started quite slowly,
because honestly, it

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.870
was a bit of a scary idea.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.400
And I went oyster shucking.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.400
I don't know how many
of you eat oysters.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.300
But they grow all around
the British coast.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.590
And they're actually quite
a sustainable meat to eat,

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.029
because when oysters feed,
they're filtering the water.

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:19.070
And a lot of the oysters
around the British coast

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.330
are an invasive species.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.640
So we want to get
rid of them anyway.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.280
So that was quite an easy start.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.490
In fact, I guess quite a few
of you been to California.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.730
And there are people there who
call themselves ostrovegans.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.730
So they only eat
mussels and oysters,

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.690
because they think that
they don't feel pain,

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.900
because they don't have
the nerve endings for it.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.150
And by farming them,
you're actually

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.330
improving the environment.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.600
So it's the one meat
that they'll eat--

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.420
only in California, I think.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.920
And then there was
fishing as well.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.160
And fishing was where
I really started

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.540
to think about my connection
to the environment,

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.420
because you have to
stand on a river bank

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.550
or go out to sea
for a long time.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.980
And it really
forces you to think

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.530
about what's happening in
the environment around you.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.670
You have to choose a fly.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.060
You have to be very quiet.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.310
You have to understand
what the fish are feeding

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.340
at on in that time of year.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.279
So it started me thinking
about my connection

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.730
as a sort of hunter gatherer.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:24.560
But of course, I also
had to be realistic,

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.726
because that's not how I'm
supposed to get our fish.

00:04:26.726 --> 00:04:27.890
We get it from the seas.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.980
And there's a wonderful book
called "The End of the Line,"

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.970
which I read.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.550
And I went out on
a fishing boat.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.290
And it's quite a brutal
industry, fishing.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.810
The animals usually
die in the hold.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.310
And it's also having a real
impact on the environment.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.760
I'm sure many of you know
the statistics from dredging.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.970
So I tried to think about
are there sustainable

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:53.787
ways to eat fish?

00:04:53.787 --> 00:04:55.370
And one of the biggest
things I found,

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.530
having gone to fish markets,
is we only five species,

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.650
which is ridiculous, and
lots of those species

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.450
are actually under threat.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.140
Cod off our own coast are
still not a healthy population,

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.760
because we so overfished them.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.250
So why not try--

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.350
I'm sure Ben knows all
the different species,

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.560
but coley and different species.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.910
So that was an ethical
way I felt around fishing.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.230
Another option is farmed
fish, which takes the pressure

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.170
off wild fish.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:27.910
So I went to a salmon farm,
and salmon farming really

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.450
caused a lot of
damage in the past.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.450
Sea life live on the salmon.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.600
And that passes to
the wild population.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.030
And they said wild fish from
other places around the world--

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.610
may see anchovies
from places like Peru.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.570
And that has an impact on
ocean ecosystems there.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.510
It is something I
think is improving.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.330
And when I went to
visit those places,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.090
I genuinely found people
in the West Islands

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.830
of Scotland, who said that
it was providing employment

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.900
in really remote areas.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.990
But they could do so much
to improve how it's done

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.880
and close circulation.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.740
So the sewage from the fish
have been going into the oceans.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.790
And I'd urge you to look
at it with wild fish--

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:18.830
Marine Stewardship.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.910
Council.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.321
But then now there's an
Aquaculture Stewardship

00:06:23.321 --> 00:06:23.820
Council.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.440
So hopefully, if we put
pressure on the organizations,

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.960
we can get sustainable
farm fish as well.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.584
But it's not
straightforward-- nothing is.

00:06:32.584 --> 00:06:34.020
So that was all quite easy.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.440
But I had to move onto
other animals to eat.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.420
And the first thing
I shot was a rabbit.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.470
And that was quite
upsetting, because you

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.940
have to take responsibility.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.010
And I never really
got over that,

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.510
but that was a lot
of the motivation

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.400
in writing the book in
that when you eat animals,

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.880
an animal dies.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.270
And taking that on
really upset me.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.850
I cried.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.940
The gamekeeper I was with cried.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.820
And that's really
where the book begins.

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.930
But the big question is,
why did I carry on doing it?

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.690
But I looked at the people
like the gamekeeper I was with,

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.500
who go out and shoot
animals to eat themselves.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.692
And they had a much
greater understanding

00:07:18.692 --> 00:07:20.900
of the countryside than many
conservationists I knew.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.483
And I wanted to learn
from them, and I

00:07:22.483 --> 00:07:24.020
wanted to continue the journey.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.010
So I did.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.120
And I got a little
bit better at it.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.690
So I learned to
shoot with a rifle

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.320
and to do it as cleanly and
quickly as I possibly could.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.926
I ate squirrel, which is
a good example of where--

00:07:38.926 --> 00:07:40.550
they're being controlled
anyway to help

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.960
the red squirrel
population come back.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.150
So I fed my girlfriends
squirrel satay,

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.630
and they enjoyed it very much.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:52.400
And shotgun shooting is
the other type of shooting.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.260
It's different from
using a rifle--

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.730
very challenging.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.710
I did shoot a pheasant.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.450
Obviously, in Britain, that
has different implications,

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:06.560
because it's very mixed up
with landownership and class.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.980
People only traditionally
do it who have the money

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.270
and live in the countryside.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.190
And it kind of exposed me.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.841
But I wanted to go
into that, because I

00:08:15.841 --> 00:08:17.090
think it's really interesting.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.050
And two-thirds of our
farmland is managed

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:21.560
for game birds in this country.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.520
So what effect is that
having on the countryside?

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.790
And my argument is there
are good and bad shoots.

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.990
So let's talk about
it openly rather

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.540
than saying they're all bad.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.340
And I like to eat
pheasant I'm afraid.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.630
But the best way to eat
pheasant is roadkill.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.900
And there's lots
of them on the road

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.130
at certain times of the year.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:47.210
So I also learned how to
identify roadkill safely,

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:47.870
which is--

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.072
people often ask me about
the legal implications,

00:08:50.072 --> 00:08:51.530
and you have to
take responsibility

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:52.488
for yourselves, people.

00:08:52.488 --> 00:08:55.610
But you can do it.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:09:00.260
And the ultimate thing I killed
was a stag with my father.

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.720
And that was quite
an emotional journey,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.890
because my dad
hunted all his life.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.470
It was something my brother
has done, but I've never done.

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:13.670
And I had come to a realization
of why I was doing it,

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.760
because I had to question was
I doing this to impress my dad.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.075
But by the time I
got to that stage,

00:09:20.075 --> 00:09:21.700
I was doing it for
myself, because only

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.866
you can take responsibility.

00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:26.050
You have to be in control of
yourself and what you're doing.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.980
And that was an
amazing experience.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.252
It really taught me
a lot and gave me

00:09:33.252 --> 00:09:34.460
great respect for the animal.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.620
And it took me quite
a long time to eat it

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.030
with all my friends and family.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:41.930
I tended to share
all the meat I ate.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.050
But all this is
very nice talking

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.410
about going out and hunting
and fishing and something

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:52.100
that requires a lot
of time and energy.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.690
You could argue
it's something you

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:55.191
need to be quite
privileged, but you

00:09:55.191 --> 00:09:57.648
can do it-- anyone can do it
if you put the time and energy

00:09:57.648 --> 00:09:58.200
into it.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.140
But most of us are eating
meat that's obviously farmed.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:01.681
And I wanted to look
at that as well,

00:10:01.681 --> 00:10:04.250
because that's where most
of the environmental impact

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.300
is of course.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.630
And in Britain, we eat 1
billion farm animals a year.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.940
So I wanted to find
out how they're raised.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.820
Chickens was a good start,
because in this country, that's

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.150
what we're eating the most of.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.330
Compared to the '50s where
you might have it once a week,

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:22.330
we're now eating chicken
three times a week

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:26.320
and 2.2 million chickens a day.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.207
But have you ever seen any
chickens in the countryside?

00:10:29.207 --> 00:10:30.790
Where are these
chickens being raised?

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:35.530
So I went to a chicken
farm and saw them indoors.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:40.180
They usually are raised,
tens of thousands, in a barn.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.810
And they are gassed
when they slaughtered.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:45.940
And the big realization
with chickens

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:53.710
is they're being raised on
such a scale it's too dense.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.937
The animals can't
move around easily.

00:10:56.937 --> 00:10:59.020
They've been so bred to
have big breasts that they

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.989
collapse on their legs.

00:11:00.989 --> 00:11:02.780
But there are very
small things you can do.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.717
I looked at RSPCA
Assured chickens.

00:11:04.717 --> 00:11:06.550
And they're still
indoors, but at least they

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.040
have daylight and
room to roam around.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.220
So there are things that
you can do quite easily.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:17.230
That's me in a chicken farm.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:18.365
I also looked at pigs.

00:11:18.365 --> 00:11:20.740
I went to Denmark, which is
where we get most of our pork

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.185
from in this country.

00:11:22.185 --> 00:11:23.560
And again, it was
very intensive,

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.310
and I found pigs more
difficult, because I

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.220
would argue that
chickens indoors

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.519
can be quite happy, but pigs--

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:31.060
when you see pigs
outdoors, they just

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.590
love to root in the ground,
and I like to see that,

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.910
and that's for my pork
to come from that.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.585
But in Denmark, they do
it on a massive scale,

00:11:40.585 --> 00:11:42.835
and they have a slaughter
house with glass walls where

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:46.860
you can see it happening,
which is quite interesting.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.450
I would argue that it doesn't
tell you the whole story.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.820
But it's quite an
interesting insight

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.900
into how other cultures
are more open about where

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.189
their meat comes from.

00:11:56.189 --> 00:11:57.730
And I went into
abbatoirs, of course,

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.360
because that was a big
question I was trying to ask--

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.310
where does our meat come from?

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.240
And, again, I found it
very upsetting initially.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.790
But I wanted to continue
to try and understand,

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.010
because the people who
were doing it I felt

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.150
deserved my respect.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.691
I think if you are
going to eat meat,

00:12:14.691 --> 00:12:17.110
you should respect the people
that do it on your behalf

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.320
or not eat meat at all.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.770
And I also went and
visited a lot of farmers.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.310
And these people weren't
earning a lot of money

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.820
and raising really
good meat, you know?

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.220
This is a man
called Roley Pusey,

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:38.230
and he's raising sheep
on National Trust land.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.710
And it's on the
Sussex Downlands.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.400
And there are flowers
and birds that

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:48.260
survive in that farmland
as it's managed.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:50.590
And a consequence of
that is the sheep.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:55.460
So why not eat them and
keep that cycle going?

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.730
So that's the other reason
I continued to do it,

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:59.140
because I respected
those farmers

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.200
and wanted to understand their
business, not dismiss them.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.600
And I did some home slaughter as
well, which was pretty intense.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.180
And I learned about butchery.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.070
I was following everything
all the way through.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:17.182
So again, having said all that,
people's first question is,

00:13:17.182 --> 00:13:18.640
well, that's all
very well, but how

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.040
do I judge where
my meat comes from?

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.440
And there are labels
you can look out for.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.580
I'm always quite cautious,
because labels can change.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.290
And I think you
can't rely on that.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:30.740
It's probably something
that Google talk about a lot

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.290
is you can't rely
on a corporation

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:33.700
to make your decisions for you.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.380
It's about your
education, which is

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.050
what I'm trying to
do through my book is

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.540
to give you all the information
so you can make the best

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.500
decisions.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.260
But there's definitely
a few that I've already

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.050
mentioned MSC fish, but
RSPCA Assured, which

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.570
is just a little
bit more expensive,

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:53.740
but ensures better welfare,
and of course, organic.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.110
And there's a new one
called Pasture Fed, which

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:58.230
means they've been kept
outdoors and only fed

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.080
on pasture, which is a new one.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.350
And it's pretty good.

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:03.500
Or just eat less.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.450
Or don't be evil.

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:07.690
I was thinking of
the Google tag line,

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.270
because I kind of think
if you are concerned

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.280
about the environment,
eating less meat is

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.320
just one of the easiest
things you can do.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.409
And a lot of the charities
have written reports on that.

00:14:19.409 --> 00:14:20.950
And I think they
keep it quite quiet,

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:24.340
because they don't want to seem
like they're lecturing people.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.750
But it is a fact.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.860
It really helps reduce
your carbon footprint.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.510
And also, it's good
for your health.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:35.710
Too much red meat
is bad for you.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:39.710
And I actually ate much less
meat than the average person.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:42.010
People think the
ethical carnivore

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:43.120
must be eating most meat.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:46.450
But actually, compared
to most people,

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:51.130
I ate a lot less
meat doing it myself.

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.650
And I tried out all
the alternatives,

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:54.830
including insects.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.190
I'll pass them
around in a minute.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.470
But there are other
in-vitro meats

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:03.810
where they're growing meat from
stem cells, which freaks me out

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.220
personally.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:05.990
It's a bit weird.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:10.540
But lots of vegans
welcome it and say they

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:15.230
would eat burgers from
meat grown in a test tube--

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:17.140
and plant protein,
which is something

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.950
that's huge in Silicon Valley--

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:21.790
well, Google, I know,
are looking into it,

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:26.420
but also I think
some from Twitter--

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.540
Impossible Foods-- Beyond Meat.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:32.140
And they're all trying to find
plant-based alternatives, which

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:36.460
I think is likely
to be the future.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:42.350
So I do think that we will be
eating less meat in the future.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:43.850
And I think the
ethical carnivore

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.210
is about the
philosophical side of it

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:50.410
that people don't often consider
that eating animals obviously

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:51.740
has an impact.

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.270
The animals are raised
and killed on our behalf.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:56.270
So I hope it gives people
a better understanding

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:57.610
of that side of it.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:01.460
And I'll pass on some insects,
and we'll do some questions.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.980
Thank you.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.110
SPEAKER: Thank you very much.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.092
So I've got a few
questions initially.

00:16:07.092 --> 00:16:07.800
LOUISE GRAY: Yes.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.383
I'll sit here.

00:16:08.383 --> 00:16:10.780
SPEAKER: There's
more awareness now

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.370
around how animals are
kept, as you touched on,

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.530
and the environmental
impact of eating meat.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.670
So as a result, people are
turning to a vegan diet.

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.290
What do you think
the implications

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.421
would be if the whole
population went vegan?

00:16:22.421 --> 00:16:24.670
Do you think it's a sustainable
way of life for humans

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:25.730
and for the environment?

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.730
LOUISE GRAY: Well, there
have been studies done,

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.430
I looked into that.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.926
And there was one done--

00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:35.800
it was published in the
"National Proceedings

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.320
of Science" last year.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.880
And it found that
it would reduce--

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.660
if everyone went vegan, it would
reduce carbon emissions by half

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.700
compared to--

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:49.830
compared to 2005 by 2050.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.160
But I personally don't
think that's realistic.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.522
And it's certainly not
in the short term anyway.

00:16:55.522 --> 00:16:56.980
And there's been
other studies that

00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.690
found that if just a third--

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:04.000
if people ate less
meat, then it would have

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.380
a similar impact over time.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.160
And if you think about it, if
you asked everyone to go vegan,

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.020
I think you'd have quite a small
percentage of the population.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.561
But if asked people
to eat less meat,

00:17:13.561 --> 00:17:18.250
I think you're talking the
majority of the population

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:19.030
in the future.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.710
And that could have
a much bigger impact.

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:25.810
And I do think you'd
lose a lot, because a lot

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:29.125
of our agriculture is
based on animal inputs,

00:17:29.125 --> 00:17:32.050
and you think about pigs,
they give the waste.

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.580
We feed them waste.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.485
And we have lots of
cultural associations

00:17:36.485 --> 00:17:38.860
with the meat, which I wouldn't
necessarily want to lose.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:40.950
So I think less
meat is a better one

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:42.540
than just everyone going vegan.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.539
SPEAKER: You have the
Sunday roast, for example.

00:17:44.539 --> 00:17:46.292
LOUISE GRAY: Yeah, yeah.

00:17:46.292 --> 00:17:48.250
SPEAKER: Of all the meat
substitutes available,

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:49.780
and those in the
pipeline, again,

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.060
that you touched on,
which ones do you think

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:55.040
will be the most popular,
and the ones most adopted

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.930
by the population, and then
the most sustainable as well?

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.430
LOUISE GRAY: I think
plant proteins,

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:06.100
because a lot of our
lifestyles now-- we

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.420
demand a lot of processed meat.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.330
But I think people are really
uncomfortable with cheap meat.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.780
And that's processed
meat, and I think

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:20.290
that alternatives like
Beyond Meat chicken strips

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.240
and things like that
are really growing.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.060
And I that's the thing
that will really take off

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:28.090
in the future, because the
technology is improving

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:31.537
to make it taste better.

00:18:31.537 --> 00:18:33.370
And in terms of
sustainability, people often

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:37.540
argue that's still soy
protein and stuff like that.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.550
But those companies--
I think the people who

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.830
are buying those
things are demanding

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.680
that it comes from a
sustainable source.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.810
And it's still more sustainable
than feeding the soy

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:47.530
to animals.

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:50.560
So I think that we'll see a
great growth in that area.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.470
SPEAKER: What do you see people
eating in five years' time?

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:54.970
What do you think
the challenges are

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:56.720
going to be around
re-education the public

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.542
so they change
their eating habits?

00:18:58.542 --> 00:19:00.250
LOUISE GRAY: Eating
Less and better meat,

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.770
because I am not the only
one talking about it--

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.500
like Jamie Oliver, Hugh
Fearnly-Whittingstall-- really

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.290
powerful celebrity chefs.

00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:11.060
I think the big challenge is
time, because people don't--

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.870
I can talk about, hey, why
don't you go to a butcher

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:16.630
and try a new cut of
meat or try offal?

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:20.750
But that's a lot of work
for people with busy lives.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.740
So I think it's about
putting the time and possibly

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:26.480
the money towards those
better cuts of meat.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.370
And that is important, because
the farmers that I talked about

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.280
in my talk are relying
on people to carry

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.280
on buying that red meat.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.310
And that's reducing as
well as processed meat.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:38.287
And I don't think we should--

00:19:38.287 --> 00:19:40.120
sometimes it's a
statistics about you people

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.190
eating less meat--

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.000
it's because they're just eating
less from butchers and stuff.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.620
And I think if people are
going to eat meat, that's

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.360
the kind of stuff
they should get

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.800
is from farmers and butchers.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.630
And the other
challenge is gender.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.590
As you can see from
the audience here,

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.930
women are quite interested
in it, and men aren't.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:01.940
And I was talking about-- in
the book I dismiss that and say,

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.270
hey, it doesn't mean
you're less macho.

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.270
And I thought about
it, and I thought

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:09.520
if you go to a
barbecue in London

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.380
and a guy comes along
with veggie burgers,

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.630
no one would raise an eyebrow.

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:16.600
But a lot of places in
Britain they would be pasted.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.450
So I think that that
needs questioning,

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:21.499
because that's a
little bit ridiculous,

00:20:21.499 --> 00:20:24.040
because a lot of guys love meat,
and it makes them feel good.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.540
But it doesn't make
them more macho.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:26.830
That's ridiculous.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.214
So we probably need
to challenge that.

00:20:29.214 --> 00:20:30.880
And the other thing,
in five-years time,

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:33.170
I think we maybe see
a little bit of a--

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:35.310
just I was thinking
about how things go.

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:38.610
You generally go in cycles,
and clean eating and veganism

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:40.490
is so popular now.

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:44.190
But I feel like it'll
maybe settle down

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:48.310
into incorporating some of
those habits into how we eat

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:52.850
rather than saying people
should go vegan and eat clean,

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.160
because I don't think that
works for a lot of people.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.520
But I think a lot of
messages from that movement

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.890
will come into
everyday eating more.

00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.890
So it would be easier
to eat less meat

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:05.685
and still have a good diet.

00:21:05.685 --> 00:21:06.310
SPEAKER: Great.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:07.150
Thank you so much.

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:08.150
LOUISE GRAY: Not at all.

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.186
SPEAKER: Does anyone
have any other questions?

00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:11.062
Wonderful.

00:21:11.062 --> 00:21:12.280
AUDIENCE: I have three.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:12.865
LOUISE GRAY: OK, cool.

00:21:12.865 --> 00:21:14.198
SPEAKER: Want to take the stool?

00:21:14.198 --> 00:21:16.114
AUDIENCE: Of course
I'll take the stool.

00:21:16.114 --> 00:21:17.100
LOUISE GRAY: Hi.

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.640
AUDIENCE: Hello, friends,
how are you today?

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:20.944
Thank you for coming to Google.

00:21:20.944 --> 00:21:21.610
LOUISE GRAY: Hi.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:22.990
AUDIENCE: It's
lovely having you.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:24.580
What was the weirdest
thing you ate

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.990
to your standards of weirdness?

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:30.060
LOUISE GRAY: Oh, OK, loads
of really weird things.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.060
So the squirrel was quite
weird and the insects.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:39.310
But I caught a fresh cod and I
ate the egg sacs, which is roe,

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:40.395
and it was amazing.

00:21:40.395 --> 00:21:41.770
It was the best
thing I've eaten,

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:43.410
because it's like caviar.

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:46.330
That is quite weird
to have fresh cod roe.

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:51.720
And I ate the stag
hot in a stew, which

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.800
was really delicious,
and the liver,

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.830
and the kidneys,
which aren't so nice.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.580
And that was-- yeah,
that was [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:00.080
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned the stag.

00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:00.640
LOUISE GRAY: Yeah

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.514
AUDIENCE: And you say
you went with your dad.

00:22:02.514 --> 00:22:03.734
Who actually killed the stag?

00:22:03.734 --> 00:22:04.400
You or your dad?

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.410
LOUISE GRAY: Me.

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:05.910
Of course.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:07.284
AUDIENCE: I'm
sorry to be creepy.

00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:08.842
How did you kill the stag?

00:22:08.842 --> 00:22:11.206
LOUISE GRAY: With a rifle.

00:22:11.206 --> 00:22:13.080
Yeah, but read the book
for the full details.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.040
AUDIENCE: It's fine.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:20.297
LOUISE GRAY: Yeah, but
cleanly with a powerful rifle.

00:22:20.297 --> 00:22:21.880
AUDIENCE: Where in
London do you think

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.850
is a place that we can
find the fish that are

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.170
outside of those five species?

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:27.686
Because actually, I'm not--

00:22:27.686 --> 00:22:29.060
LOUISE GRAY:
Billingsgate Market.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:30.380
AUDIENCE: But in Billingsgate
Market will they educate me?

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.330
LOUISE GRAY: At 5 o'
clock in the morning.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:31.780
AUDIENCE: Because I'm not like--

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.080
I go in-- show me a fish.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:33.360
LOUISE GRAY: Yeah,

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:33.850
AUDIENCE: They'll show
me the most expensive

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:36.520
LOUISE GRAY: You'll have to be
up at 5 o'clock in the morning.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.978
But if you go down
to Billingsgate,

00:22:37.978 --> 00:22:41.590
you will see tens of species of
fish, and you'll just be like--

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.600
I had no idea these existed.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.970
And it doesn't smell
of fish either,

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.480
because it's all so fresh--

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.140
well, not too badly--

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:51.580
less than you think it would be.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.050
And it's mind blowing.

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:57.326
You don't know what a
haddock or a cod looks like.

00:22:57.326 --> 00:22:59.200
Well, I didn't until I
went to a fish market,

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.312
and then you see hake,
and ling, and monkfish,

00:23:03.312 --> 00:23:08.020
and like on that picture,
the ugliest, strangest fish.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:13.100
So it's quite amazing and quite
joyful to see the variety.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:18.562
And then there are restaurants
which do cook those fish.

00:23:18.562 --> 00:23:19.539
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:19.539 --> 00:23:21.580
LOUISE GRAY: I can't I
can't think of one, sorry.

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:22.539
I don't live in London.

00:23:22.539 --> 00:23:23.705
AUDIENCE: You're a novelist.

00:23:23.705 --> 00:23:24.430
That's fine.

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:25.840
LOUISE GRAY: Yeah.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.070
AUDIENCE: And last but not
least, if one is too hard,

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:29.080
you can give me three.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:33.250
What are you three or your
favorite food in the world?

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:35.222
LOUISE GRAY: Raspberries.

00:23:35.222 --> 00:23:36.430
AUDIENCE: I like that answer.

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:37.520
LOUISE GRAY: But you want meat?

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:37.920
AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:38.750
It's your favorite food.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:39.900
LOUISE GRAY: Yeah, raspberries.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.410
AUDIENCE: Raspberries?

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:42.743
So you die tomorrow, and you
want a bowl of raspberries?

00:23:42.743 --> 00:23:44.450
LOUISE GRAY: Yeah.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:45.230
AUDIENCE: Nice.

00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.570
There's some in the
entrance, by the way.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:47.320
LOUISE GRAY: Good.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:47.860
Good.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.276
My nephews and nieces
always ask me that question.

00:23:51.276 --> 00:23:53.920
SPEAKER: Any other questions?

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:58.480
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm
just curious how

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.040
are you continuing with it now.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.560
LOUISE GRAY: Yeah, lots of
people ask that question.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:07.246
I said at the end of the
book I'm stopping it now

00:24:07.246 --> 00:24:08.620
and largely because
I want people

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.900
to be able to pick up
a book in 10 years time

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.810
and it still be
genuine, you know?

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:16.450
So I wanted to do something
that was sustainable for me.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:20.147
So I definitely eat
less meat than when

00:24:20.147 --> 00:24:21.730
I started the whole
project, because I

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:25.390
question it a lot more.

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:29.971
But now, actually, the further
I go, that does recede,

00:24:29.971 --> 00:24:32.470
and you do think about it less,
which is interesting itself,

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:33.617
because that's how--

00:24:33.617 --> 00:24:35.950
I think you have to be honest--
that's how humans think,

00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:36.370
you know?

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:37.810
You can watch a video
and be really concerned

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:38.476
about something.

00:24:38.476 --> 00:24:41.710
And then six months later
when you're eating a burger,

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:43.240
you don't really think about it.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.860
And I do that as well.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.400
So it's receding.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.320
But I eat less meat.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:56.020
And I am continuing to learn
about shooting, and fishing,

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.670
and doing it myself,
because I never

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:59.350
wanted to do it as a one off.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.870
I wanted to learn
those skills, and that

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:03.150
takes longer than 18 months.

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:06.670
So I'm still doing that, but
not a huge amount, because it

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:09.770
takes a lot of money and time.

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:13.240
And I'm also trying to explore
things like different fish

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:19.090
species and different cuts of
meat, because I'm quite greedy,

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:20.425
and I really enjoy that.

00:25:20.425 --> 00:25:22.780
So yeah, so I'm what I call--

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.415
I'm trying to be an
ethical carnivore.

00:25:24.415 --> 00:25:25.530
What I call an
ethical carnivore.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:26.030
Yeah.

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.490
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering what your farming

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:33.590
family thought of the book?

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:34.000
Have they read it?

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:34.680
LOUISE GRAY: They love it, yeah.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.500
AUDIENCE: Have they changed
their eating habits?

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:37.291
Or are they still--

00:25:37.291 --> 00:25:39.930
LOUISE GRAY: It's
really interesting.

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:41.541
Sometimes it makes
me kind of cringe

00:25:41.541 --> 00:25:43.290
when people are like,
don't worry, Louise,

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:45.750
it's not like processed
chicken or something.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:50.370
And it kind of makes
me cringe, because I

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:52.749
find it difficult to tell
other people what to eat.

00:25:52.749 --> 00:25:54.540
Even though the book
is about what you eat,

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.000
I'm just telling my story,
because otherwise, you

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.960
feel great--

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.040
you feel a bit didactic
and finger wagging.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.140
But really positive--
I thought they

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.710
might feel like I was attacking
them, because a lot of them

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:09.390
raise meat.

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:12.120
But they were actually really
open minded and welcomed it,

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:15.540
because a lot of meat in
Britain is really high quality.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:19.680
And it would help farmers
to talk about the quality

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.260
and why it should be
appreciated and paid more,

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:24.120
because in this
country, we struggle

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:29.780
to compete with processed
meat from abroad anyway.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:34.257
So yeah, they loved it,
which was very nice.

00:26:34.257 --> 00:26:36.590
AUDIENCE: Is there anything
you said, I won't eat this--

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:38.190
I will not kill x?

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:38.940
LOUISE GRAY: Yeah.

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:43.670
Lots of people ask, hey, did
you eat a badger, or a fox,

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:44.940
or something weird like that?

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.605
And I was like, no,
why would I do that?

00:26:47.605 --> 00:26:50.580
Or I didn't do the
squirrel was unusual.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:54.620
But it was quite tasty,
and it was accessible.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:58.200
But I wasn't going to
push exotic or weird meats

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.060
for the sake of it.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:00.900
And I really am not
interested in that,

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:05.220
and I'm not really
interested in--

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:06.690
like if I travel
to other countries

00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:08.760
where there are meats,
which in our country

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.100
we'd find weird
like dog or horse.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.540
I really don't--

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.910
I feel like I understand
cultural taboos,

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:15.930
and I feel them.

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:17.170
And that's fine.

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:18.710
I don't need to cross them.

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:21.179
So yeah, I have no interest
in doing that much.

00:27:21.179 --> 00:27:23.220
AUDIENCE: Firstly, I think
when the news came out

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.350
you were coming to see
us, I was so excited.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.690
I said to a couple people,
I was like, oh, my god.

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.160
But this really
resonates with me,

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.472
because I went
vegetarian two years ago.

00:27:31.472 --> 00:27:33.180
And this was the
principle that I usually

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.350
take as well, which is I believe
that obviously people just eat

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.850
meat.

00:27:36.850 --> 00:27:38.700
They just get it in
a cellophane packet.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.370
They don't even tie it
back to an animal diet.

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:42.930
So I wanted to
actually follow that,

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:45.564
which is I will only eat
meat that I'll kill myself.

00:27:45.564 --> 00:27:46.980
But I love animals
so much, I will

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:49.165
cry at a cartoon animal dying.

00:27:49.165 --> 00:27:51.410
But obviously, I haven't
used meat, because I simply

00:27:51.410 --> 00:27:53.010
can't kill an animal.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:56.580
How do you see the
most effective way

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.370
of getting the message
across to the masses?

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:01.860
Have you successfully
transferred

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.350
or changed any of
your friends' mindsets

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:07.830
without maybe overstepping
boundaries of scaring

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:08.750
the hell out of them?

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:09.560
LOUISE GRAY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.020
AUDIENCE: Sat them down and made
them watch slaughter videos.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.540
And I have lost some
friends over that.

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.498
And I realize that's the
wrong way of doing it.

00:28:14.498 --> 00:28:16.860
So yeah, how would you think
is the most effective way

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.030
to spread the message?

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:21.270
LOUISE GRAY: It is interesting--
the reaction to this book.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:24.600
I thought I'd get a lot
of pushback from vegans--

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.200
people would be upset by it--
but actually, not that much.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.674
And I've actually had sometimes
more aggressive people

00:28:30.674 --> 00:28:32.590
who really love meat,
and do not want to know,

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:34.770
and want me to shut up.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:39.150
So it's surprising
who you can annoy.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:44.040
I think it has to
be really gradual.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:48.090
If can talk about nudge
theory and make it positive.

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:50.210
So if you say to people
you can't eat stuff,

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.040
then they shut down.

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.590
And if you say you have
to vegetarian or vegan,

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:57.120
then I think they
just shut down.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.060
But I think if you tell
them like, oh, my god,

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:03.960
have you tried this
amazing new food that

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.090
happens to be a plant protein?

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:08.376
Or have you ever tried offal?

00:29:08.376 --> 00:29:10.000
Or have you tried
meeting your butcher?

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.512
So I think through a series of
positive messages rather than--

00:29:14.512 --> 00:29:15.990
AUDIENCE: Scare tactics.

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:17.130
LOUISE GRAY: Scare tactics.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:19.756
But so much of what you said was
interesting, because I'd say--

00:29:19.756 --> 00:29:21.713
a lot of people say you
should only eat animals

00:29:21.713 --> 00:29:23.250
if you've killed them yourself.

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:24.690
But I would argue
lots of people--

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:25.740
that would be too much.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:31.360
Like you, and that's unrealistic
and ridiculous anyway.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:33.540
And I felt like, I'm
not sure I'd necessarily

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.340
wanted to do that.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.950
But I just felt
role as a writer.

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:40.080
And I had an opportunity
to explore a subject

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.760
so people didn't have to.

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:48.940
SPEAKER: Does anyone
have anymore questions?

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:49.440
Wonderful.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.820
Thank you all so
much for coming.

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.020
LOUISE GRAY: Thanks so much.

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.170
[APPLAUSE]
