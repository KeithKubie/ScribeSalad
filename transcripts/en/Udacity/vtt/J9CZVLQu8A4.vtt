00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is 25.2.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The line of 25.2 + 0.67x = y.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This line over here is linear regression to the data.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Pictorially, this is the line just like this.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It might be hard to see as my shift of units, this is really 50 and this is 120.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
When you work this out, this line hits the y axis at 25.2,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and it's steepness when it goes one step right, it goes 0.67 steps up vertically,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
which is off the line.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We just did the following: we inspected a data sample with two dimensions,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and we saw it had massive outliers.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We removed the outliers using a very context-dependent method of just thresholding.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We calculated some basic statistics, such as the mean, the standard deviation, and the covariance.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Then we came to the meat of the unit.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We computed the correlation and the regression,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and those two things were the primary result of the step,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but they would not have been possible without the initial steps of cleaning up the data.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I hope we got those right.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
If you did, you are a very capable statistician at this point.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This is a very typical question that arises in statistics

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and getting it correct means you have a fairly deep understanding of something

00:01:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
really nontrivial that comes up in statistics. Congratulations.
