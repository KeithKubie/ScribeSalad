&gt;&gt;Hello, I'm Pekka Puska President of World
Heart Federation. The reason why I'm here

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:13.550
at the World Economic Forum in Davos is at
health, in general, and employee health especially

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:20.240
is becoming very important for world and also
for world business leaders. And that is especially

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.470
true for today's economic situation. Heart
disease and stroke is number one killer in

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.019
the world. Every third death in the world,
more than every two seconds somebody dies

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.410
in fact somewhere in the world. At about 80%
of that is already in the developing world

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.600
mainly wrecking it's people. So at this World
Economic Forum in Davos, World Heart Federation

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.690
we call on world's business leaders to continue
and in fact to increase the investment in

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.610
health in general, to work together with health
leaders and particularly invest in the health

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.140
of the workers. It makes economic sense and
it makes humanitarian sense.Thank you.
