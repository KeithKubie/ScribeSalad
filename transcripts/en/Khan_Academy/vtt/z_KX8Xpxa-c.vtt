00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.502
- [Voiceover] The figure
above shows a string

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:05.038
with one end attached to an oscillator

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:07.607
and the other end
attached to a block there.

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:08.708
There's our block.

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:11.745
The string passes over a
massless pulley that turns

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:13.079
with negligible friction.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.081
There's our massless pulley that turns

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.722
with negligible friction.

00:00:16.722 --> 00:00:20.887
Four such strings, A, B, C,
and D are set up side-by-side

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:23.757
as shown in the figure
in the diagram below.

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:26.559
So this is a top view,
you can see oscillator.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.995
This is a top view of the
oscillator string pulley

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:31.798
mass system, and we have four of them.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:34.601
Each oscillator is adjusted
to vibrate the string

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.903
at its fundamental frequency f.

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:38.905
So let's think about what
it, I'll keep reading

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:41.908
then we'll think about what
fundamental frequency means.

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:45.345
The distance between each
oscillator and the pulley L

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:46.346
is the same.

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:48.681
So the length between the
oscillator and the pulley

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:52.519
is the same, and the mass
of each block is the same.

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.355
So the mass is what's providing
the tension in the string.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.957
However, the fundamental
frequency of each string

00:00:57.957 --> 00:00:59.092
is different.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:01.094
So let's just first of all think about

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:03.096
what the fundamental frequency is,

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.098
and then let's think about
what makes them different.

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:06.299
So the fundamental frequency,

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.301
one way you could think about it is

00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:10.970
it's the lowest frequency
that is going to produce

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.592
a standing wave in your string.

00:01:13.592 --> 00:01:16.702
So it's the frequency that
produces a standing wave

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:18.522
that looks like this.

00:01:18.522 --> 00:01:23.522
It's a standing wave where the
string is half a wavelength.

00:01:25.923 --> 00:01:27.487
I guess there's two
ways to think about it.

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.489
It's the lowest frequency we could produce

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:31.491
the standing wave, or it's
the frequency at which

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:34.627
you're producing the
wave, the standing wave,

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:37.330
with the longest wavelength.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.332
So the string at the fundamental frequency

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:41.334
is just going to go to, is gonna vibrate

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:43.436
between those two positions.

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:47.795
And you see here that the wavelength here

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:49.404
is twice the length of the string.

00:01:49.404 --> 00:01:50.935
And if you want to see
that a little bit clearer,

00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:53.105
if I were to continue with this wave,

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:55.064
I would have to go another
length of the string

00:01:55.064 --> 00:01:58.918
in order to complete one wavelength.

00:01:58.918 --> 00:01:59.957
Or another way to think about it,

00:01:59.957 --> 00:02:02.922
you're going up, down, and
then you're going down back.

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:05.925
It's reflecting back off of this end here.

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:09.229
And as we mentioned, essentially
what the mass is doing

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.866
is providing the tension, the
force of gravity on this mass

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:15.869
is providing the tension in this string.

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:18.638
So the oscillators is vibrating
at the right frequency

00:02:18.638 --> 00:02:22.308
to produce this, the lowest
frequency where you can produce

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.664
this standing wave.

00:02:24.664 --> 00:02:28.114
So let's answer the questions
now, and we have four

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:31.551
of this set up and they all
have different frequencies.

00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:35.154
The equation for the velocity
v of a wave on a string

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:38.491
is v is equal to the
square root of the tension

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:41.294
of the string divided by
the mass of the string

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:43.296
divided by the length of the string,

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:45.298
where F sub T is tension of the string

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:48.167
and m divided by L is
the mass per unit length,

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:50.169
linear mass density of the string.

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.533
And hopefully this makes sense.

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:54.340
It makes sense that it's
going to be that if,

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.043
if the tension increases, that
your velocity will increase,

00:02:57.043 --> 00:02:59.712
the tension, you could think
of the atoms of the string

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:02.248
of how much they're pulling on each other.

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:05.697
And so if there's higher tension, well,

00:03:05.697 --> 00:03:07.139
they're going to be able
to move each other better,

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.216
or I guess you could say
accelerate each other better

00:03:09.216 --> 00:03:13.026
as the wave goes through the string.

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.324
And also make sense that
the larger the mass,

00:03:15.324 --> 00:03:17.033
if you hold everything else equal,

00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:18.586
that you're gonna have a slower velocity.

00:03:18.586 --> 00:03:22.004
Mass, you could view it

00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:24.054
as a measure of inertia,
it's how hard it is

00:03:24.054 --> 00:03:25.538
to accelerate something.

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:28.941
So if the string itself,
especially the mass

00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:33.268
per unit length, if there's a
lot of mass per unit length,

00:03:33.268 --> 00:03:34.910
actually, let me circle
that because that's actually

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.401
the more interesting thing.

00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:39.337
If there's a lot of mass per unit length,

00:03:39.337 --> 00:03:41.654
it makes sense that for a
given amount of the string,

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:44.757
it's gonna be harder to
accelerate it back and forth

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:45.992
as you vibrate it.

00:03:45.992 --> 00:03:50.129
And so this part right over
here would be inversely related

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.300
to the velocity.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.395
It's not proportional though.

00:03:52.395 --> 00:03:54.067
You have this square root here,

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.708
but they're definitely,

00:03:55.708 --> 00:03:58.237
if the linear mass density increases,

00:03:58.237 --> 00:04:00.239
then you're gonna have a slower velocity.

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.809
And if your tension increases,
you're going to have

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:03.810
a higher velocity.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.446
So hopefully this makes
some intuitive sense.

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:08.548
And they ask, what is the
difference about the four string

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:11.217
shown above that would
result in having different

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:13.119
fundamental frequencies?

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:15.421
Explain how you arrive at your answer.

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.423
And then part b is
student graphs frequency

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:20.994
is a function of the inverse
of the linear mass density.

00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:22.729
Will the graph be linear?

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.864
Explain how you arrived at your answer.

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:27.266
All right, let's answer each of these.

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:31.738
So a, part a, what is different
about the four strings

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:33.973
because they all have different
fundamental frequencies?

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:36.909
So the fundamental frequency,

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.079
let's just go back to
what we know about waves,

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:44.283
that the velocity of a wave
is equal to the frequency

00:04:44.283 --> 00:04:48.187
times the wavelength of the wave.

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:51.257
Or you could say, you could
divide both sides by lambda,

00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:53.259
you could say that the frequency of a wave

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.764
is equal to the velocity
over the velocity over

00:04:57.764 --> 00:04:58.998
the wavelength.

00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:02.114
So if we're talking about
the fundamental frequency,

00:05:02.114 --> 00:05:04.937
if we're talking about
the fundamental frequency,

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:07.696
funda, let me just,

00:05:07.696 --> 00:05:09.809
let me write frequency and
then let me write fundamental

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:11.144
real small here.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:14.514
Fundamental, the fundamental frequency,

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:17.917
is going to be the velocity of our waves

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:21.054
divided by the wavelength is
going to be twice the length

00:05:21.054 --> 00:05:24.524
of our string, divided by two L.

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:27.527
And if you look at the
expression that they gave us

00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:30.463
for the velocity of
the wave on the string,

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:32.765
well, this is going to be equal to

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:36.836
the square root of the
tension in the string

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:41.836
divided by, divided by
the linear mass density.

00:05:42.241 --> 00:05:44.243
Divided by the linear mass density.

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:47.780
And all of that is going to be over two L.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.949
Now all of them have different
fundamental frequencies,

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:51.951
but let's think about
what's different over here.

00:05:51.951 --> 00:05:54.587
They all have the same tension.

00:05:54.587 --> 00:05:56.689
They all have the same tension.

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:57.824
How do I know that?

00:05:57.824 --> 00:05:59.826
Well, what's causing the
tension is the masses

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:01.797
hanging over the pulleys.

00:06:01.797 --> 00:06:03.616
So the weight of those masses.

00:06:03.616 --> 00:06:05.535
So that's all going to be
the same for all of them,

00:06:05.535 --> 00:06:07.833
and they all have the same length.

00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:10.193
They all have the same length.

00:06:10.193 --> 00:06:12.004
So these are all the same.

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:13.973
So the only way that you're
going to have different

00:06:13.973 --> 00:06:18.010
fundamental frequencies is
if you have different masses.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.679
So different masses.

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:22.415
So that has to be different.

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:24.650
Different.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.220
So to answer their question,

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.455
the strings must have different mass,

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:32.091
well, they would have different
linear mass densities,

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:33.181
but since they're all the same length,

00:06:33.181 --> 00:06:35.035
they would also have different masses.

00:06:35.035 --> 00:06:37.163
So let me write this down.

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:41.467
Strings, strings must

00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:45.316
have different,

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:49.610
different masses

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:53.379
and mass densities,

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:56.135
and mass densities,

00:06:57.383 --> 00:06:59.786
densities, since

00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:05.400
all other variables

00:07:07.293 --> 00:07:10.241
driving, driving

00:07:12.064 --> 00:07:14.400
fundamental frequency are the same,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.371
fundamental frequency

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.342
are the same,

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:27.280
are the same.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.745
All right, let's tackle part b now.

00:07:30.883 --> 00:07:33.820
A student graphs frequency as a function

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.256
of the inverse of linear mass density.

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:39.458
Will the graph be linear?

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:41.928
Explain how you arrived at your answer.

00:07:41.928 --> 00:07:44.063
So student graphs frequency.

00:07:44.063 --> 00:07:45.965
Let me underline this.

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:48.835
They're graphing frequency as a function

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:51.871
of linear mass density.

00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:54.073
So we actually can write this down.

00:07:54.073 --> 00:07:56.242
If we wanted to write frequency

00:07:56.242 --> 00:07:58.611
as a function of linear mass densities,

00:07:58.611 --> 00:08:01.914
so we could write as a
function of m over L,

00:08:01.914 --> 00:08:04.016
well, this is going to be equal to,

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:05.451
is going to be equal to,

00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:07.653
we could rewrite this expression,

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:09.655
actually, we could just
leave it like this.

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:12.225
This is the same thing as one over two L

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:15.661
times the square root of the tension

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:19.866
divided by the linear mass density.

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:21.868
Or you can do this as being equal to,

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:25.371
you could say this is a square root of

00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:28.007
the tension over two L,

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:30.009
and I'm putting all of
this separate because

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:32.477
we're doing it as a function
of our linear mass density.

00:08:32.477 --> 00:08:36.716
So we can assume that all of
this is going to be a constant.

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:39.751
And then times the square root

00:08:39.751 --> 00:08:43.990
of one over the linear mass density.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.928
So if you're plotting, if
you're plotting frequency

00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:51.397
as a function of this,

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:53.933
it's not going to be,
the graph is definitely

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:56.168
not going to be linear.

00:08:56.168 --> 00:08:58.404
You see here, one, I have
the reciprocal of it,

00:08:58.404 --> 00:09:00.439
and then I take the square root of it.

00:09:00.439 --> 00:09:04.482
So let me write this down.

00:09:07.273 --> 00:09:12.273
This f or graph of f of two L,

00:09:12.396 --> 00:09:13.382
definitely not linear.

00:09:13.382 --> 00:09:15.012
Let me write it that way.

00:09:15.012 --> 00:09:19.428
F of m over L graph,

00:09:21.869 --> 00:09:25.833
definitely, definitely

00:09:26.784 --> 00:09:28.967
not linear.

00:09:30.355 --> 00:09:32.709
And you could point out
that it has a reciprocal

00:09:32.709 --> 00:09:34.033
and it's a square root.

00:09:34.033 --> 00:09:38.678
Involves, involves square root

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:42.048
and inverse,

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:45.351
or I could say and
reciprocal of the variable.

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:49.165
And reciprocal, reciprocal

00:09:50.525 --> 00:09:52.858
of the linear mass density

00:09:52.858 --> 00:09:54.260
of m over L.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:55.561
So definitely not linear.

00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:58.364
All right, let's tackle part c.

00:09:58.364 --> 00:10:01.634
The frequency of the oscillator
connected to string D

00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:04.236
is changed so that the string vibrates

00:10:04.236 --> 00:10:06.405
in its second harmonic.

00:10:06.405 --> 00:10:09.075
On the side view of string D below,

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:11.677
mark and label the points
on the string that have

00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:14.113
the greatest average vertical speed.

00:10:14.113 --> 00:10:16.115
So one way to think about
the fundamental frequency,

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:17.116
that's our first harmonic.

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:19.118
So if they're talking
about the first harmonic

00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:22.788
and the string is what I showed before,

00:10:22.788 --> 00:10:26.928
that's the lowest frequency
that produces a standing wave

00:10:26.928 --> 00:10:29.228
or it's the frequency
that produces the largest

00:10:29.228 --> 00:10:30.546
standing wave, I guess
you could say the one

00:10:30.546 --> 00:10:31.774
with the largest wavelength.

00:10:31.774 --> 00:10:33.168
And if it was a first harmonic,

00:10:33.168 --> 00:10:35.091
the part of the string that moves the most

00:10:35.091 --> 00:10:36.737
is going to be that center.

00:10:36.737 --> 00:10:39.538
But our second harmonic is
the next highest frequency

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:41.807
that produces a standing wave,

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:44.143
and that's going to be
a situation in which

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:46.746
the wave, instead of having
a wavelength twice the length

00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:48.109
of the string, it's
gonna have a wavelength

00:10:48.109 --> 00:10:49.988
equal to the length of the string.

00:10:49.988 --> 00:10:53.285
So now, it's going to look like this.

00:10:53.285 --> 00:10:56.657
So it's going to vibrate between this,

00:10:56.657 --> 00:10:59.125
actually, let me draw it a
little bit neater than that.

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:02.288
It's going to vibrate between,

00:11:03.429 --> 00:11:05.180
between this.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.335
And so

00:11:10.325 --> 00:11:13.636
it's gonna vibrate between that and this.

00:11:13.636 --> 00:11:15.508
And this right over here.

00:11:16.742 --> 00:11:19.578
So when you see this, this version of it,

00:11:19.578 --> 00:11:21.580
where now that we have
half the wavelength,

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:25.120
the wavelength is exactly
the wavelength of,

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.652
it's actually L this time,

00:11:26.652 --> 00:11:30.314
the part that moves the most is here.

00:11:30.314 --> 00:11:31.701
So that's going to move the most.

00:11:31.701 --> 00:11:33.259
And here.

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:35.056
I didn't draw it perfectly.

00:11:35.056 --> 00:11:37.930
But one way to think
about it, it's exactly 1/4

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.732
and 3/4 of the way.

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:42.134
Exactly halfway is not
going to move as much,

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:44.336
is not gonna move because
it's a standing wave now

00:11:44.336 --> 00:11:46.338
or it's gonna move very imperceptibly.

00:11:46.338 --> 00:11:49.208
These two places are where
you're gonna move the most

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:53.145
at the first, or sorry,
at the second harmonic.

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:56.816
The second harmonic being
the next highest frequency

00:11:56.816 --> 00:11:59.982
that produces a standing wave again.
