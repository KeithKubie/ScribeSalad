00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:02.210
Hey, Matt?

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.250
&gt;&gt; What's up?

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.540
&gt;&gt; So I've been looking through this genome,

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.210
and I'm looking for a single gene that

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.650
affects some of the complex traits. Like, I

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.890
don't know, depression, or intelligence, maybe even schizophrenia.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:15.860
&gt;&gt; Well Lauren, although we learned in the last lesson that there are

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.230
traits that can be influenced or

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.720
even completely controlled by changes in indvidual

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.320
genes. Most traits don't work like that and in fact I think it's

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.520
time that we turned out focus to

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.200
understanding the genetic basis for complex traits.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.090
While some traits, like the ones we talked about

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.710
in the last lesson, can be explained by the alteration

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.430
of a single gene, most traits are actually complex. You

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.880
have over 20,000 genes in your genome and they're all

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.000
working together. Your environment matters, too. What you eat, where

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.110
you live, your daily activities. And most of the traits

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.280
that you mentioned, Lauren, are actually complex and influenced by

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.430
both genetic and environmental factors. So for us to understand

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.080
how both these sides contribute to a trait, we'll have

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.550
to come up with some unique tools. We're going to jump

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.340
right in in just a second with the trait that

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.000
affects people all over the world. Risk for breast cancer.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.850
&gt;&gt; Also, don't forget about your concept map. I want you

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.620
to print this out and fill out the blanks as we

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.290
go along. And as always, you'll have a chance to see

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.570
what you learned from this at the end of the lesson.
