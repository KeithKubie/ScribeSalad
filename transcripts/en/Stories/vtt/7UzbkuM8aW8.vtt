00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.260
NARRATOR: Here is something
you don't see every day.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.840
A long, jagged crack
splitting the ocean in two.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.775
Well, at least that's
what it looks like.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.700
In truth, the ocean
isn't breaking in half,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.110
and, OK, that's
not even the ocean.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.790
Lake Baikal is the world's
largest freshwater lake,

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.490
and considered by many to
be the deepest, oldest,

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.500
and clearest lake in the world.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.040
But it's also a wild place,
one that can be very dangerous.

00:00:45.777 --> 00:00:47.610
ALEXEY TROFIMOV: --
from small to big chips.

00:01:06.647 --> 00:01:08.480
NARRATOR: And that's
what Alexander captured

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.960
in this picture-- a
distinct crack cutting

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.070
through Lake Baikal's
frozen waters, made possible

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.920
by the region's harsh
conditions, strong winds,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.240
heavy snow, and
ever-shifting ice,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.707
and that brutal environment
is exactly why he hired a team

00:01:22.707 --> 00:01:24.165
to help him navigate
those dangers.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.430
To Alexander and many like
him, the journey and the risk

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.810
is half the fun.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.310
There is something
more satisfying

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.120
about skipping the easy
or safe place to travel.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.680
To go past the
crowds and tourists,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.320
to go a little bit further.

00:02:16.192 --> 00:02:18.150
If you liked this episode,
be sure to check out

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.640
this one on another peculiar
place-- a prison island

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.040
off the coast of Florida.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.350
MAN: Access to the island
can only done by sea plane

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.315
or by boat.

00:02:26.315 --> 00:02:29.190
Our plane was not equipped
for landing on the water,

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.546
so I enjoyed an afternoon of
picture-taking from the air.

00:02:32.546 --> 00:02:34.670
NARRATOR: And as always,
don't forget to subscribe.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.503
Thanks for watching.
