1
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.020
So this is game theory,
economics one 59,
if you're here for art history,

2
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.230
you're either in the wrong room or stay anyway.
Maybe this is the right room,

3
00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:14.820
but this is game theory.
Okay?
Uh,
you should have for handouts,

4
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:16.260
everyone should have for handouts.

5
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.420
That is a legal release for multiple minutes.
Uh,
about the videoing.

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.000
There is a syllabus which is approved in his syllabus.

7
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:29.001
It's also online and there are two games labeled game one and game two.

8
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.480
Can I get you all to look at game one and start thinking about it?

9
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:37.040
And while you're thinking about it,
I'm hoping you can multitask or bets.
Oh,

10
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.290
I'll describe a bit about the class and we'll get a bit of admin under our
belts.

11
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.110
But please try and look at somebody not looking at because they are using it as

12
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:46.890
a fan here.
All right,
so you look,
look at game one and fill out that form for me.

13
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.280
Okay.
So while you're filling that out,

14
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.370
let me tell you a little bit about what we're going to be doing here.

15
00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:54.690
So what is game theory?

16
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.730
Game Theory is a method of studying strategic situations.
Okay,

17
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:01.860
so what's a strategic situation?
Well,

18
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:05.610
let's start off with what's not as strategic strategic situation in your

19
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:06.211
economics,

20
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:09.780
your intro economics class and one 15 or one 10 you saw some pretty good

21
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:12.090
examples of situations that were not strategic.

22
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.870
You saw firms working in perfect competition,
right?

23
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:18.240
Firms in perfect competition are price taker.

24
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.720
They don't particularly have to worry about the actions of their competitors,

25
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.620
right?

26
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.130
You also firms that will monopolists and monopolies don't have any competitors

27
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:28.260
to worry about.
So that's not a particular strategic situation.

28
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.190
They're not price takers,
but they take the demand curve,
right?

29
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:35.400
Is this looking familiar for some of you who can remember doing one 15 last year

30
00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:37.470
or maybe two years ago?
For some of you?
All right.

31
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.200
Everything in between is strategic.

32
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.430
So everything that constitutes in perfect competition is,
is a strategic setting.

33
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.800
Think about the motor industry,
the motorcar industry.

34
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.940
Ford has to worry about what GM is doing and what Toyota is doing.

35
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.060
And but for the moment at least what Christ was doing with perhaps not for long.

36
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.051
All right?
All right.

37
00:01:55.051 --> 00:01:59.040
So there's a small number of firms that actions affect each other.
All right,

38
00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:01.800
so for literal definition of what strategic means,

39
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.860
it's a setting where the outcomes that that affect you depend on actions,

40
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:11.540
not just on your own actions but on actions of others.
All right.

41
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.170
As much as I'm going to say for preview right now,

42
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:15.630
we're going to come back and see plenty of this over the course of the next

43
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:18.820
semester.
So what I want to do is get on it to where we are,

44
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.530
where the supplies are.

45
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.120
Obviously it applies in economics but it also applies in politics and in fact

46
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.390
this class will count as a political science class if you're a political science

47
00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:31.400
majors are going to check with the Dus in political science,
right?

48
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.880
It counted game theory is very important in law these days,

49
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.730
so for those of you for the half of you are going to end up in law school.

50
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.720
This is pretty good training.

51
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.880
Game Theory is also used in biology and towards the middle of the semester we're

52
00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:48.270
actually going to see some examples of game theory as applied to evolution.

53
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.850
And Not surprisingly,
game theory is a applies to sport.
All right,

54
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.270
so let's talk a little bit of Admin.

55
00:02:57.271 --> 00:02:58.620
How are you doing on a filling out those games?

56
00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:01.960
Everyone mount mentioned to multitask.
Again,
game one,
keep racing.

57
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.250
I want to get some admin out of the way and I want to start by getting out of

58
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:07.780
the way.
What is obviously the elephant in the room.

59
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:11.920
And some of you will have noticed that there's a camera crew here.
Okay.

60
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.100
So I,
as some of you probably know,

61
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.440
a Yale is undergoing a,

62
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.700
an open education project and they're videoing several clauses.

63
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.740
And the idea of this is to make educational materials available beyond the walls

64
00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:31.000
of Yale.
In fact,
on the web internationally.
So people in places,

65
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:33.940
maybe places in the u s or places miles away,
maybe in,
in,

66
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:38.470
in Timbuktu or whatever,
who had it difficult to get educational materials,

67
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.390
uh,
uh,
from a local university or whatever can watch certain lectures from Yale.

68
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:47.860
On the web.
All right.
Some of you would have been in classes that do that before.

69
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.280
What's going to be different about this class is that you're going to be

70
00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:54.760
participating in it,
right?
The way we teach this class is going to play games.

71
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.120
We're going to have discussions,
we're going to talk among among the class,

72
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.640
and you're going to be learning from each other,
right?

73
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:05.050
And I want you to help people watching at home to be able to learn too.

74
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.760
And that means you're going to be on film at very least on Mike.
All right?

75
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:14.590
So how's that gonna work around the room are three TA's holding Mike's,

76
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:17.830
I mean show you where they are.
One here,
one here and one here.

77
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:19.660
When I asked for classroom discussions,

78
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.930
I'm going to have one of the TA's go to you with a microphone.
Uh,

79
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.700
much like in know Donahue or something.
Okay?
All right?

80
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.370
And at certain times you're going to be seen on film,

81
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:33.310
so the camera is actually going to come around and point in your direction.

82
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.900
Now I really want this to happen.

83
00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:38.260
I had to argue for this to happen because I really feel that this class isn't

84
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:40.720
about me.
I'm,
you know,
I'm part of the clause obviously,

85
00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:44.470
but it's about you teaching each other and and participating.
Right?

86
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:45.304
But there's a catch.

87
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.700
The catch is that that means you have to sign that legal release form.

88
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.250
So you'll see that you have in front of you a legal release form.

89
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:52.084
You have to assign it.

90
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.510
And what that says is that we can use you being shown in class.

91
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.470
Think of this as a bad hair day release form,
right?

92
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:03.190
You can't sue Yale later if you had a bad hair day.
Right?

93
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.830
For those of you who are on the run from the FBI,

94
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.610
your visa's run out or you're sitting next to your ex girlfriend,

95
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.170
now would be a good time to put a paper bag over your head.
All right.

96
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.670
Now just to get used to the idea a,
in every class we're going to have a,

97
00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:21.390
I think the same two people.
So Judas,
the camera man,

98
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.450
when you all wave to do this is to wait.
Yeah,
right,
right.
Okay.
Okay.

99
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.300
And where is our audio guy?
This is where it is.
Right?

100
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:31.510
And I will try to remember not to include June ways in the classroom
discussions,

101
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.820
but you should be aware that they're there.
All right.

102
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.160
Is this is making you nervous?
If it's any consolation,

103
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.920
it's making me very nervous.
Okay.
So all right.

104
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.680
We'll try and make this class work as smoothly as we can,

105
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.080
allowing for this extra thing.
And let me say,

106
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.500
no one's making any money off this bitch.
I'm hoping these guys are being paid,

107
00:05:47.501 --> 00:05:49.150
but me and the TA's are not being paid.

108
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.640
This is the aim of this is I think as a good aim.

109
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.330
It's an educational project and I'm hoping you'll help us with it.
All right.

110
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.403
The one difference is,

111
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.810
is going to mean is that at times I might hold some of the discussions for the

112
00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:02.930
class coming down into this part of the,
uh,
of the,

113
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.280
of the room here to make it a little easier,
uh,
for Jude.
All right.

114
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:08.610
How are we doing now and filling out this form?

115
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.540
Does everyone filled in their strategy for the first game?
Not yet.

116
00:06:13.541 --> 00:06:15.250
Okay.
So let's go and doing a bit more admin.

117
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.840
The thing you mostly of Caravan I'm guessing is the grades.
All right,

118
00:06:19.841 --> 00:06:23.920
so how has the gray you're going to work for this plus 30% of the class will be

119
00:06:23.921 --> 00:06:28.921
on problem sets that didn't have the grade 30% on the midterm and 40% on the

120
00:06:29.291 --> 00:06:29.691
final,

121
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:34.691
so 30 30 40 the mid term will be held in class on October 17 that is also on

122
00:06:36.731 --> 00:06:39.670
your syllabus.
Doughnut.
Please don't anybody tell me late.

123
00:06:39.671 --> 00:06:42.890
You know anytime after today you didn't know when the midterm wasn't there.

124
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:45.160
Your for you,
it clashes with 17 different things.

125
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.450
The mid term is on October 17th is a Wednesday in class.

126
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.450
All right.
The problem sets,

127
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.660
there will be a roughly 10 problems sets and I'll talk about them more later on

128
00:06:58.181 --> 00:07:01.060
when I hand them out.
The first one,
we'll go out on Monday,

129
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.060
but it'll do a 10 days later.
Roughly speaking,

130
00:07:04.061 --> 00:07:07.300
there'll be every week the grade distribution.
All right,

131
00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:10.150
so this is the rough grade division.
Roughly speaking,

132
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.700
a sick that the class are going to end up with A's.

133
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.550
A stick is going to end up with a minus a stick cause they gonna end up with B

134
00:07:15.551 --> 00:07:18.100
plus a take is gonna end up with be a sticker again,

135
00:07:18.101 --> 00:07:21.310
not with B minus and the remaining sick.
If I added that up right,

136
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.430
I'm going to end up with what I guess we're now calling the presidential great.

137
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.200
Is that right?
That's not literally true.

138
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.300
I'm going to squeeze it a bit.
I'm going to cover it.
A bed.

139
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.270
So actually a slightly fewer Vanna sixth,

140
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.780
we'll get straight A's and fewer than a six.
We'll get uh,
you know,

141
00:07:37.781 --> 00:07:41.930
seasoned below.
We'll squeeze the middle to make the,
make them be more bees.
Uh,

142
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.340
one thing I can guarantee you from past experience in this class is that the

143
00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:48.850
median grade will be a B plus at the median.

144
00:07:48.851 --> 00:07:51.870
We'll hit fall somewhere in the B pluses.
All right.

145
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.610
Now just as for wanting for people who forgotten what a median is,

146
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.030
that means half of you,
not,
not approximately half.

147
00:07:58.031 --> 00:08:02.110
It means exactly half of you will be getting something like B plus and below and

148
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.760
a half.
We think something might be passing the off.

149
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:05.323
<v 1>Okay.</v>

150
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.910
<v 0>Now how are you doing and filling in the forms.
Everyone filled it in yet.</v>

151
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:13.770
Surely must be pretty close to getting up on Phil then.
All right,
so,
uh,

152
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:18.150
last things to talk about before you actually collect them in textbooks that are

153
00:08:18.151 --> 00:08:22.530
textbooks for this class,
the main textbook is this one doctor's book,

154
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.980
strategy and Games.
If you want a slightly tougher book,

155
00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.420
more rigorous book,
Try Joel Watson's book strategies.

156
00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.420
Both of those books are available at the bookstore.
All right,

157
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.710
but I want to warn everybody ahead of time.
I will not be following the textbook.

158
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.380
I regard these books as safety nets.

159
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.500
If you don't understand something that happened in class,

160
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.300
you want to reinforce an idea that came up in class,

161
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.360
then you should read the relevant chapters in the book and the syllabus will

162
00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:52.620
tell you which chapters to read for each class or each week in the class,
right?

163
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:56.850
But I will win.
I will not be following these books religiously at all.
In fact,

164
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.550
that just there as backup.
In addition,

165
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.750
I strongly recommend people read thinking strategically.

166
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.500
This is a good bedtime reading to any stuff from insomnia.

167
00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.810
It's very good bedtime reading and his upper ms on it.
This it's a good book.

168
00:09:12.811 --> 00:09:13.440
And what's more,

169
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.880
there's going to be a new edition of this book this year and northern have

170
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.400
allowed us to get advanced copies of it.
So if you don't buy this book this week,

171
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.970
I may be able to make the advanced copy of the new edition available for some of

172
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:28.600
you next week.
And I'm not taking a cut of that either,
right there,
isn't it?

173
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:33.360
There's no money changing hands then.
Alright,
sections on the syllabus signup.

174
00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:36.660
Oh sorry.
On the website.
Sign up as usual.
Put yourself down on the wait list.

175
00:09:36.661 --> 00:09:39.210
If you don't get to the section you want,
you probably will get into the section.

176
00:09:39.211 --> 00:09:40.590
You won't once we're done.
All right,

177
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:43.440
now in must be done with the forms we've done with the forms.
All right,

178
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.760
so why don't we send the TA's with or without Mike's up and down the aisles and

179
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.870
collected your game.
Number one,
not,
not getting number two,
just game number one.

180
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.750
Just when we're doing that.
I think the reputation of this class,

181
00:10:08.751 --> 00:10:11.740
I think if you look at the cost evaluations online or whatever,

182
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.860
is that this class is reasonably hard but reasonably fun.

183
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.360
Alright,
so I,
I'm hoping that's what rotation in the plastic is.
All right.

184
00:10:20.361 --> 00:10:22.850
So you shouldn't,
if you think this course is gonna be,
is gonna be easy?

185
00:10:22.851 --> 00:10:25.700
I think it isn't actually an easy class.
It's actually got a card class,

186
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.090
but I think I can guarantee it's going to be a fun class.
Now,

187
00:10:29.091 --> 00:10:32.780
one reason it's a fun class is the Nice thing about teaching Game Theory,

188
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.460
quieting down folks,

189
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:38.330
when I think that teaching game theory is you get to play games and that's

190
00:10:38.331 --> 00:10:39.830
exactly what we've just been doing now.

191
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.820
This is our first game and we're going to play games throughout the course

192
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.120
sometimes several times a week,
sometimes just once a week.

193
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.160
We've got all these things then everyone handed the men,

194
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:04.403
<v 2>right?</v>

195
00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.410
<v 0>So I need to get those counted.
Has anyone taken the Yale accounting tasks?</v>

196
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:16.210
No one wants to.
No one has aspirations to at one person has.
I'll have a ta dude.

197
00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:20.390
It's all right.
Levitated so w,
uh,
Kai,
can you count those for me?
Is that right?

198
00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:26.050
Let me read out the game you've just played.
Game One,

199
00:11:26.051 --> 00:11:28.150
a simple grade scheme for the class.

200
00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:32.080
Read the following carefully without showing your neighbor what you're doing.

201
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:36.780
Put it in the box below either the letter alpha,
all the latter.
Bita,

202
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.160
think of this as a great bid.

203
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:44.940
I will randomly pair your phone with another form and neither you nor your power

204
00:11:45.491 --> 00:11:47.290
will ever know with whom you are pad.

205
00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.310
Here's how the grades may be assigned for the class or they won't be what we can

206
00:11:51.311 --> 00:11:55.180
pretend.
If you put Alpha and your [inaudible] Bita,

207
00:11:55.210 --> 00:12:00.130
then you will get an a and your pants or see if you and your pad both but Alpha,

208
00:12:00.131 --> 00:12:03.380
you're both get B minus.
If you put bita and no parents Alpha,

209
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.470
you'll get a c in your parent at an a.
And if you interrupt pat both put pizza,

210
00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:11.290
then you'll both get B plus.
All right,
so that's the thing you just filled in.

211
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.060
Now before we talk about this,

212
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.520
let's just collect this information in a more useful ways.

213
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.590
I'm going to remove this for now.

214
00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:19.813
<v 2>Okay.</v>

215
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.310
<v 0>All right.
We'll discuss this in a second,</v>

216
00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:27.990
but why don't we actually record what the game is that we're playing first.

217
00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:29.713
<v 2>Okay,</v>

218
00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.930
<v 0>so this is our grade gain and what am I going to do?</v>

219
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:41.820
Since it's kind of hard to absorb all the information by reading a paragraph of

220
00:12:41.821 --> 00:12:45.450
text,
I'm going to make a table to record the information.
Okay?

221
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.070
So I'm gonna do is I'm going to put me here and my path,

222
00:12:50.071 --> 00:12:53.690
the person I'm randomly paired with yet,
and Alpha and Beta,

223
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:58.440
which are the choices I'm going to make here and on the columns,
Alpha and Beta,

224
00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.850
the choices my parents making.

225
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:04.320
And in this table I'm going to put my grades.

226
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:10.230
All right?
So my grades,
if I,
if we both put alpha is B minus,

227
00:13:10.231 --> 00:13:13.140
if we both put Bitsa was B plus,

228
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.840
if I put Alpha and she put a Beazer,

229
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.490
I got an a and if I put beets are and she put an Alpha,
I got to see,

230
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:25.970
is that correct?
That's more or less,
right.
Okay.
While we're here,

231
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.870
why don't we do the same for my path?
Brian,

232
00:13:29.871 --> 00:13:34.370
so this is my grades and the left hand table,
but now

233
00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:40.590
let's look at what my panel of date,
all my power gap.

234
00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:44.663
<v 2>Okay,</v>

235
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:48.590
<v 0>so I should warn people sitting at the bank that my handwriting is pretty bad.</v>

236
00:13:48.591 --> 00:13:49.820
That's one reason for moving forward.

237
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.910
The other thing I should apologize for this state at this stage of the class is

238
00:13:52.911 --> 00:13:55.580
my accent.
I will try and improve the handwriting.

239
00:13:55.581 --> 00:13:57.320
There's not much I can do about the accident at this stage.

240
00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.620
All right,
so once again,
if we both put alpha,

241
00:14:03.621 --> 00:14:06.350
that may pair gets a B minus and we both put Bita,

242
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:09.050
then we both get a B plus it kind of pat gets a B.
Plus.

243
00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:13.100
If I put Alpha and my path puts bita,

244
00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:17.960
then she gets a c and if I put Bita and she puts alpha,
then she gets an a,

245
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.010
right?

246
00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.990
It's why not have all the information that was on the sheet of paper that you

247
00:14:21.991 --> 00:14:26.220
just handed in.
All right.
Now there's another way of organizing this,

248
00:14:26.221 --> 00:14:27.800
that standard in Game Theory,

249
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:29.810
so we might as well get used to it now on the first day,

250
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:33.140
rather than drawing two different tables like this,

251
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:38.320
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to take the second table and super impose it on

252
00:14:38.691 --> 00:14:41.840
top of the first people.
Okay,
so let me do that and you'll see what I mean.

253
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.890
Am I'm going to do is draw a larger table.

254
00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:50.750
The same basic structure.
I'm choosing Alpha and Beta on the rose.

255
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.910
My pair is choosing Alpha and Beta on the columns,

256
00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:01.100
but now I'm going to put both grades in.
So the easy ones on the diagonal,

257
00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.460
you both get B minus.
If we both choose Alpha,

258
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:10.730
we both get B plus if we both choose beats at all,
right?

259
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:14.150
But if I choose Alpha on my patch,
she his pizza,

260
00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:19.360
I get an a and she gets a c and if I choose pizza and she chooses Alpha,

261
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.150
then it's me.
You get to the sea and it's her who gets Yay.

262
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.380
All right,
so is what I did here.

263
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:32.270
The first grade corresponds to the row player me in this case,

264
00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:36.230
how am the second grade?
Each box corresponds to the column player.

265
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:37.460
My pair in this case.

266
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.300
So this is a nice six things way of recording what was in the previous two

267
00:15:41.301 --> 00:15:44.020
tables.
All right.
And this is an outcome matrix.

268
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.280
This tells us everything that was in the game.

269
00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:54.240
It's an outcome matrix.
All right?
Okay.

270
00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:58.470
So now it seems a good time to start talking about what people did.
So,
uh,

271
00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:03.030
let's just have a show of hands.
How many of you uh,
chose Alpha?

272
00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.730
Leave your hands up so that you can catch that.

273
00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:08.880
So just two people can see at home.
Okay.
All right.

274
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.320
And how many of you shows Bita Nice,
far more out in a day?

275
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.980
Can they be wave your hands to be?
It is.
Okay.
All right.
There's a to here.
Okay.

276
00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:19.230
So it looks like a lot of,
well,
we're going to find out.
We're going to count,

277
00:16:19.231 --> 00:16:20.700
but a lot more alphas and Betas.

278
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.640
Let me try and find out some reasons why people chose.

279
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:28.070
Let me have the Alphas up again.
Uh,
so,
uh,
the,
the,

280
00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:32.620
the woman who's in red here,
can we get a mic to the,
yeah.

281
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:36.720
Okay.
We asked you are you,
you're not on the run from the FBI.
We can ask you why,

282
00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.540
why?
Okay.
So you just alpha,
right?
So why did you choose alpha?

283
00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.453
<v 2>Okay.</v>

284
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.620
<v 0>Oh,
are you,
so,
so you wrote out these squares,</v>

285
00:16:51.621 --> 00:16:54.200
you realize that your partner was going to do and responded to that.

286
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.490
And the other reasons for choosing Alpha around the room to take,
we can,

287
00:16:57.491 --> 00:16:58.760
can we get the,
the,
the woman in here?

288
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:04.140
I don't to be intimidated by these microphones that just Mike's,
yeah,

289
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:11.930
<v 2>regardless of what my partner chose,
I think there'd be better outcomes</v>

290
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.690
<v 0>since using.
All right,
so,
so let me ask you to names the second.</v>

291
00:17:14.691 --> 00:17:19.310
So your name was Courtney and your name was clarity's.

292
00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:23.840
So slightly different reasons.
Same choice.
Alpha Clara,
Lisa's reason.

293
00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.010
But apparently you stay,
she said,
no matter what the other person does,

294
00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:30.830
she reckon she'd get to get a better grade if she chose Alpha.

295
00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:33.620
So hold that thought a second.
We'll come back to,
is it Clairol?
Clairol East,

296
00:17:33.621 --> 00:17:35.150
is that right?
I'll come back to clarity in a second.

297
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.330
Let's talk to the beat as a second.
Let me just emphasize at this stage,

298
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.730
there are no wrong answers.
Later on in the class,

299
00:17:40.731 --> 00:17:42.050
they'll become questions would have wrong answers.

300
00:17:42.051 --> 00:17:44.870
Right now there's no wrong answers.
All right.
There may be bad reasons,

301
00:17:44.871 --> 00:17:47.060
but there's no wrong answers.
So that's of the beat is up again.
Let's,

302
00:17:47.061 --> 00:17:52.010
let's do the bts.
Oh,
come on.
It was a be the right here.
You were beaten,

303
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:56.860
right?
You've backed off the beater.
Okay.
Uh,
so how can I get a mic into a pizza?

304
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.820
Is that sticking this isle a bit?
Is that a pizza right there you are.

305
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.700
You'd be the right.
That was a can.
Can I get the,
are in here?

306
00:18:02.701 --> 00:18:05.310
Who the beat in here?
Can we get,
can we get the mic in there?

307
00:18:05.311 --> 00:18:08.670
That possible in here?
He can leave your hand up.
So yeah,
we go.
Let me go.

308
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.460
Just point towards,
that's fine.
That's fine.
Just,
just,
just to speak into it.

309
00:18:11.461 --> 00:18:13.980
That's fine.
Yeah,
go ahead.

310
00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:18.340
I personally don't like swings that much and it's the beamline is fee plus
range.

311
00:18:18.341 --> 00:18:22.490
So I'd much rather prefer that to a swing from a to c.

312
00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:27.240
Oh,
that's right.
So you're saying you're saying it compresses the writing?

313
00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:29.080
I'm not sure it does compress the right ended.
I mean,

314
00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.480
I mean if you shows a Alpha,
uh,
you're,

315
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:36.790
you're swinging from a to B minus of bring from BDO treason from B pass to see.

316
00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:40.420
I mean there's a similar kind of ranges,
but it's,
it's certainly reasons,

317
00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:45.410
other reasons for choosing.
Yeah.
The guy in blue it here.
Yup.
Yup.

318
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.650
Yeah.
Good.
That's,
I just don't,
don't hold the mic.
Just let the point.
Well,

319
00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.640
I guess I thought we could be more collusive and kind of work together,

320
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.450
but I guess not.
Um,
so,
uh,

321
00:18:56.451 --> 00:18:59.650
I chose Beta is that just shows me back on,

322
00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.490
I missed the answer is to stand up just here.
Yep.
Sorry,
say it again.
Sure.

323
00:19:04.491 --> 00:19:08.920
My name is Travis.
Uh,
I thought we could work together,
but I guess not.
All right.

324
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:10.010
All right,
good.
Good.

325
00:19:10.011 --> 00:19:14.680
If you had chosen bed and we would all look pretty good buses,
but it's not,
okay.

326
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:17.200
So,
so Travis,
he's giving us a different reason,
right?

327
00:19:17.201 --> 00:19:19.960
He's saying he's saying that maybe,

328
00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:23.860
maybe some of you in the room might actually care about each other's grades,

329
00:19:23.861 --> 00:19:26.560
right?
I mean,
you all know each other in class,
you will go to the same college.

330
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:31.240
For example,
if we,
uh,
if we played this game,
uh,
up in,
uh,

331
00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.650
up in the business school MBA students here today want to say,
right?
We were,

332
00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.270
we played this game up on the business school.

333
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.240
I think it's quite lately we're going to get a lot of Alphas chosen,
right?

334
00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.240
But if we played this game up in that,
say,
the divinity school,

335
00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:49.270
all right.
Guessing that.
I'm guessing that Travis,

336
00:19:49.271 --> 00:19:51.750
his answer is reflecting what you guys are running it.

337
00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.050
If you played in the divinity school,

338
00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.920
you might think that people in divinity school might care about other people's

339
00:19:56.921 --> 00:19:59.590
grades,
right?
There might be ethical reasons,
perfectly good,

340
00:19:59.591 --> 00:20:02.380
sensible ethical reasons for choosing Peter in this game.

341
00:20:02.381 --> 00:20:03.570
Might be other reasons as well.
But that's,

342
00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.640
that's the reason to focus on and perhaps the,

343
00:20:06.641 --> 00:20:09.520
the lesson I want to draw out of this is that right now,

344
00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.650
this is not a game right now.

345
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.760
We have action strategists we want to take and we know what the outcomes are,

346
00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:18.970
but we're missing something that will make this,
again,
what are we missing here?

347
00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:22.090
We're missing objectives were missing.

348
00:20:22.091 --> 00:20:25.270
Payoffs are missing what people care about.
All right?

349
00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:29.590
So we can't really start analyzing a game until we know what people care about.

350
00:20:29.591 --> 00:20:32.650
And do we know what the payoffs are?
And let's,
let's just say something now,

351
00:20:32.651 --> 00:20:35.290
which I'll probably forget to say it any other,
any other moments of the class,

352
00:20:35.291 --> 00:20:37.030
but today it's relevant,
right?

353
00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:42.210
Game Theory me professors at Yale cannot tell you what your payoff should be.

354
00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:45.310
They should not care.
We can't,

355
00:20:45.311 --> 00:20:49.600
I can't tell you in a useful what it is that you should meet your goals in life

356
00:20:49.601 --> 00:20:53.230
should be or whatever,
right?
That's not what came through is the powers.
However,

357
00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.620
once we know what your pay payoffs I want,
we know what your goals are,

358
00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.080
perhaps we can gain three can help you get there.

359
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:00.743
<v 2>All right,</v>

360
00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.170
<v 0>so we've had two different kinds of payoffs mentioned here.</v>

361
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:09.000
We had the kind of payoff where we care about our own grade and Travis has

362
00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:11.730
mentioned the kind of pay off when you might care about other people's grades.

363
00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:15.690
And what we're gonna do today is ally as this game under both those possible

364
00:21:15.691 --> 00:21:16.524
payoffs.

365
00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:19.470
<v 2>Just start that off.</v>

366
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:24.190
<v 0>Let's put up some possible payoffs for the game.</v>

367
00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:25.753
<v 2>Okay?</v>

368
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.810
<v 0>And I promise we'll come back and look at some other pay off later.
We'll,
we'll,</v>

369
00:21:32.811 --> 00:21:34.560
we'll revisit the divinity school later.

370
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.570
All right,
so here,

371
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:44.590
once again is our same matrix with me in my path choosing actions,

372
00:21:44.871 --> 00:21:49.430
Alpha and Beta.
But this time I'm going to put numbers in here

373
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.470
and some of you will recognize these numbers,

374
00:21:54.471 --> 00:21:57.890
but that's not really relevant for now.
All right,

375
00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:02.660
so what's the idea here with the first idea is that these numbers represent you,

376
00:22:02.661 --> 00:22:06.620
tiles or utilities that they represent.
What this,

377
00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.400
what these people are trying to maximize what they're trying to achieve that

378
00:22:10.401 --> 00:22:13.730
goals.
All right.
Did,
the idea is to just be,

379
00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:18.790
just compare this to the outcome matrix is for the person who's me here.

380
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:23.370
Ac yields a pay off.
Uh,

381
00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:27.650
it's an HD has this box.
So AC yields a payoff of three,

382
00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.370
whereas B minus B minus,

383
00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:33.050
<v 2>yeah.</v>

384
00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:36.320
<v 0>Eels a payoff of zero and so on.</v>

385
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:37.950
<v 2>All right.</v>

386
00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.530
<v 0>So what's the interpretation is the first interpretation,</v>

387
00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.680
which the knack for interpretation that a lot of you jumped to straight away.

388
00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:45.670
These are people,

389
00:22:45.671 --> 00:22:50.050
people with these payoffs are people who only care about their own grades.

390
00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:54.310
They prefer an a to a B.
Plus they prefer a B plus two B minus,

391
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.230
and they'd put a B minus to a c.
Right.
I'm happy about that.

392
00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.180
All the grades in order,

393
00:22:58.181 --> 00:23:00.790
otherwise it's going to ruin my curve at the end of the year.
All right.

394
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.730
All right.
So these people only care about their own grades.

395
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:08.430
<v 2>I only care</v>

396
00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.430
about that owner.

397
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.520
<v 0>Great.
What do we call people who only care about their own grades?</v>

398
00:23:18.521 --> 00:23:19.690
What's a good technical term for them?

399
00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:21.443
<v 2>Awesome.</v>

400
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:24.540
<v 0>In England,
I think we refer to these guys,</v>

401
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.960
those technical or not as an evil gates,

402
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:34.800
how many these are not,
you're not perhaps the most moral people in the universe.

403
00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.670
All right,
so now we're gonna ask a different question.

404
00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:42.390
Suppose whether he's actually a powerful and not pretend they are for now.

405
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:46.970
All right.
Suppose he's your payoffs.
Now we can ask not what did you do,

406
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.380
but what should you do?

407
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:51.050
Now we have payoffs that can really switch the question to a naughty question.

408
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:55.690
What should you do?
And let's come back to,
uh,
to it,
a Clara lease.

409
00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.190
What was parolees before?
And let's get the mic on you again.

410
00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:02.600
So just explain what you did and why.
Again,
why chose Alpha?
Yes,

411
00:24:02.601 --> 00:24:06.680
I'm setting up a second.
Okay.
That's okay.
All right.
Usually you shoot al fine.

412
00:24:06.681 --> 00:24:08.720
I'm just doing this.
But roughly your payoff more or less,
right?

413
00:24:08.721 --> 00:24:09.740
You were caring about your grades.

414
00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:13.850
<v 3>Yeah.
Why did they choose alpha?
I'm sorry.
Why did you choose often?</v>

415
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.340
Just repeat what you said before.
Because I thought the paps,

416
00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:22.120
the two different paths that I could have gotten were highest.
If I chose Alpha.

417
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:23.260
Good.
Good.

418
00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:27.010
<v 0>So what clarity is,
is saying it's important idea is the,
isn't it?</v>

419
00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:28.810
Tell me if I'm paraphrasing you incorrectly,

420
00:24:28.811 --> 00:24:32.440
but I think this is more or less what you're saying is no matter what the other

421
00:24:32.441 --> 00:24:34.570
person does,
no matter what the pair does,

422
00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.680
she obtains a higher payoff by choosing Alpha.

423
00:24:38.681 --> 00:24:43.520
Lets us see that if the pair of shoes is Alpha and uh,

424
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.940
she chooses Alpha,
then she gets zero.

425
00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:50.020
If the pat chooses Alpha and she chose Bita,
she gets minus one.

426
00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.380
Zero is bigger than minus one.
All right?

427
00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:57.880
If the pair of shoes is Beta and if she chooses alpha,
she gets three meters,

428
00:24:57.881 --> 00:25:01.540
she gets one and three is bigger than one.
So in both cases,

429
00:25:01.541 --> 00:25:03.280
no matter what the other person does,

430
00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:07.780
she receives a higher payoff from choosing Alpha.
So she should choose alpha.

431
00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.140
Why does everyone follow that roadmap,
that line of reasoning?

432
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.060
That's a stronger line of reasoning.

433
00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.160
The reasoning we had earlier so that I won't,

434
00:25:15.161 --> 00:25:18.130
I've never immediately forgotten the name of in the red shirt,
uh,

435
00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:22.600
whose name was Courtney.
Courtney also gave a reason for choosing Alpha.

436
00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:25.210
And there was a perfectly good reason for the alpha.
Nothing wrong with it,

437
00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.640
but notice that this reasons that a stronger isn't,

438
00:25:27.641 --> 00:25:30.610
it kind of implies your reason.
All right.
All right,

439
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.890
so let's get some definitions down here.

440
00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.670
<v 1>Okay.
I think I can fit it in here.
Let's try and fit it in here.</v>

441
00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.390
Definition
we say

442
00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.740
that my strategy

443
00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:53.140
<v 0>I'll fuck strictly dominates.</v>

444
00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.193
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

445
00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:57.850
<v 0>strictly dominates.</v>

446
00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:01.163
<v 1>Okay.</v>

447
00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:02.640
<v 0>My strategy be side</v>

448
00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.200
if my pay off

449
00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.620
from alpha.

450
00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.073
<v 1>Okay.</v>

451
00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.240
<v 0>Is strictly</v>

452
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:23.270
<v 1>great,
sir.
Van Vat</v>

453
00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:29.770
from visa and this is the key part of the definition regardless

454
00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:38.540
of what others
do,

455
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.430
<v 0>of what others do.
Just read that back.
We stayed the,</v>

456
00:26:44.431 --> 00:26:47.900
my strategy Alpha strictly dominates my strategy be set.

457
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:52.800
If my payoff from Alpha is strictly greater than that from Bita,

458
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.660
regardless of what others do.

459
00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:59.550
Now it's by no means might main aim in this class to teach you target.
All right,

460
00:26:59.551 --> 00:27:02.820
but a few bits of jargon I'm going to be helpful in in allowing the conversation

461
00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:06.050
to move forward and this is certainly one evil gets is maybe one too,

462
00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:06.923
but this is certainly one.

463
00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:08.493
<v 1>All right,</v>

464
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.370
<v 0>let's draw some lessons from this and actually sweet.</v>

465
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:15.710
So you can still read that and you bring it down and clean this board.

466
00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:18.673
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

467
00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:21.680
<v 0>So the first lesson of the class and this to be lots of lessons,</v>

468
00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:29.540
there's a lesson that emerges is immediately from the definition of a dominant,

469
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.270
all of a domination strategy.
And it's this.

470
00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:39.660
<v 1>So less than one of the course is do not play</v>

471
00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.160
a strictly

472
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:53.510
dominated
strategy.

473
00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:01.810
<v 0>All right?
So with apologist,
a strong can wait.
This is the passive form.
Okay.</v>

474
00:28:01.811 --> 00:28:06.610
There's Dominique,
ted passive voice.
Do not play a strictly dominated

475
00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:10.060
<v 1>strategy.
Why?</v>

476
00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.690
Want to tell me why?
Yeah,
I'll going to get this guy.
Yeah,
yeah.
Stand up.

477
00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:21.430
Yep is right.
Yes.
Yup.
You guys.

478
00:28:21.431 --> 00:28:22.530
Everyone's going to pick this,

479
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:25.600
the dominant outcome and then everyone's going to get the worst result.

480
00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:27.190
The collectively work.

481
00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.840
<v 0>Hello.
Shut up.
That's a possible answer.</v>

482
00:28:29.841 --> 00:28:32.330
I'm looking for something more direct here.
So w we,

483
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.220
we looked at the definition of strictly domination strategy.

484
00:28:34.221 --> 00:28:37.920
I'm saying never play one.
What's a possible reason for that?
Let's,
let's,
uh,

485
00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:42.620
can we get the,
the woman there,
you always lose.

486
00:28:42.621 --> 00:28:45.710
While I know this isn't about winning and losing.
What else can we have?

487
00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.660
Can we get this,
this guy in the pink down here?

488
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:49.860
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

489
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:54.240
<v 0>well the payoffs Haloa the payoffs are lower.
Okay,
so,
so here's a,</v>

490
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.820
here's an abbreviated version of that and that's perhaps a little bit,

491
00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.740
it's not supported previous tables not long ago.

492
00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:03.860
The reason I don't want to play a strictly dominated strategy is by if instead I

493
00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:08.370
play the strategy that dominates it.
I do better on every case.

494
00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.040
All right.

495
00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.870
The reason I never wanted to play a strictly dominate Ted strategy is if instead

496
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:17.240
they pay the strategy that dominates it.
Whatever anyone else does,

497
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:18.380
I'm doing better than I would've done.

498
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.393
<v 1>All right,</v>

499
00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.790
<v 0>well that's a pretty convincing argument.</v>

500
00:29:22.791 --> 00:29:24.200
That sounds like a convincing arguments.

501
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:28.460
It sounds like too obvious even to worth be worth stating in class.
All right,

502
00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.210
so let me now try and shake your faith a little bit in this,
in this answer.

503
00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:37.800
<v 1>All right.
Somebody who's wanted by the FBI,
right.
Okay.</v>

504
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:41.140
So,
okay,

505
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:45.830
<v 0>how about the following argument?
Look at the payoff matrix again.</v>

506
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:50.930
And I suppose I reasoned this follows.
Suppose I reasoned and say,
if we,
if we,

507
00:29:50.931 --> 00:29:55.850
me and my pack both reason this way and choose alpha,
then we'll both get zero.

508
00:29:56.450 --> 00:30:00.830
But if we both reasoned a different way and shows Beta,
then we'll both get one.

509
00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.620
So I should choose B to one's bigger than zero.
I should choose Peta.

510
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:06.760
What's wrong with that argument?

511
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:10.700
Malaga must be wrong because it goes against the lesson or the class and the

512
00:30:10.701 --> 00:30:12.590
lesson for the class.
The Gospel,
right.
They're not wrong ever.

513
00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:15.140
So what's wrong with that argument?
What's wrong with that argument?
Yeah,

514
00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:18.480
<v 1>yeah.
That's good.
Just,
just,
just,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Good.</v>

515
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:22.800
<v 0>Well,
because you have to be able to agree.
You have to go to speak to them,</v>

516
00:30:22.801 --> 00:30:25.800
but we aren't allowed to show our partners what we wrote.
All right.

517
00:30:25.801 --> 00:30:29.520
So it involves some notion of agreeing in Baltimore notion of grieving.

518
00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:32.670
So certainly part of the problem here with the reasoning,

519
00:30:32.671 --> 00:30:36.120
I just gave you the reasoning that said I should choose Bita because if we both

520
00:30:36.121 --> 00:30:40.290
reason the same way we both do better that way involves some kind of magical

521
00:30:40.291 --> 00:30:41.040
reasoning.

522
00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.360
It's as if I'm arguing that if I reasoned this way and reason myself to choose

523
00:30:45.361 --> 00:30:49.470
and pizza somehow,
I'm going to make the rest of you reasoned the same way too.

524
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.510
It's like I've got ESP or I'm some character out of a,
uh,
do you hold the x men?

525
00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:57.180
Is that what it's called?
The ECZEMA?
Right.
Right now,
in fact,

526
00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:59.650
it's become a surprise to you.
I'm not,
I don't have ESPN,

527
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.760
not a character out of the expanded.

528
00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:04.530
So you can't actually see brain waves emanating from my head and my reasoning

529
00:31:04.531 --> 00:31:09.450
doesn't affect your reasoning.
Right?
So if I did reason that way and chose Beta,

530
00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.850
I'm not going to affect your choice one way or the other.

531
00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:14.440
Why doesn't the first thing that's wrong with that reasoning,

532
00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.790
what else is wrong with that reasoning?

533
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:20.050
<v 1>Yeah,
that guy down here.
Yeah.
Well,</v>

534
00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:23.300
<v 0>the second that you choose B to then someone's going,</v>

535
00:31:23.301 --> 00:31:25.920
it's in someone's best interest to take advantage of you all right.

536
00:31:25.921 --> 00:31:26.850
Just wasn't taken devotion me.

537
00:31:26.851 --> 00:31:29.450
But even more than that even stronger organ though.
That's true.

538
00:31:29.451 --> 00:31:32.390
But even a strong growing it.
Well,
how about this?
Even if I could,

539
00:31:32.391 --> 00:31:35.720
even if I was that guy in the x men or the Matrix or whoever it was who could

540
00:31:35.721 --> 00:31:38.000
reason his way into making people do things.

541
00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:40.490
Even if I could make everyone in the room,

542
00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.390
she was [inaudible] by the force of my brainwaves.
What should I then do?

543
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:47.240
I should choose alpha.
These are my pay offs.

544
00:31:47.241 --> 00:31:50.210
I should go ahead and choose alpha cause I that way I ended up getting three.

545
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.780
All right,
so it's,
there's two things wrong with the argument.

546
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:58.280
One does this magical reasoning aspect.
My reasoning is controlling your actions.

547
00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:02.330
That doesn't happen in the real world and to even if that was the case,

548
00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:03.980
I do better to myself.
Choose out.

549
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:05.970
<v 1>All right,</v>

550
00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:10.403
so

551
00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:11.371
<v 0>nevertheless,</v>

552
00:32:11.371 --> 00:32:14.160
there's an element of truth and what I just say that it's the fact there's an

553
00:32:14.161 --> 00:32:17.760
element of truth in it that makes it very,
you know,
it seems like a good,

554
00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.490
a good argument.
The element of truth is this.

555
00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.630
It is true that by both choosing Alpha,

556
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.850
we both ended up with B minuses.

557
00:32:26.851 --> 00:32:30.780
We both it with payoffs of zero rather than pay offs of one.

558
00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:33.670
It is true that by both choosing,

559
00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:37.370
by both following this lesson and not choosing the dominated strategy

560
00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:41.720
[inaudible] we ended up with zero.
Zero that were bad.

561
00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.650
All right?
That's probably the second lesson of the class.

562
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:53.250
So less than two
I'm just guessing,
probably wouldn't with spacing.

563
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:56.360
And it wasn't the first third of a century of thought in economics that said the

564
00:32:56.361 --> 00:33:01.360
opposite.
So rational choice,
in this case,

565
00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.110
people not choosing a dominated strategy,
people choosing a dominant strategy.

566
00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:10.290
Rational choice can lead to outcomes that what Americans call lists.

567
00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.390
Let's talk.
Let's talk.
All right?

568
00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.780
If you want a more technical term for that,

569
00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:26.200
and you remember this from echo from economics one 15 can lead to the outcome

570
00:33:26.201 --> 00:33:28.060
for the inefficiencies that Burrito and efficient,

571
00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.890
but the sock we'll do for today,
right?

572
00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:34.000
Rational choice by rational players can lead to bad outcomes.

573
00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:38.620
Okay,
so this is a famous example for this reason.

574
00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:40.960
It's a good illustration of this point.
It's a famous example.

575
00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:45.670
What's the name of this example?
Somebody.
This is called prisoner's dilemma.

576
00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:47.860
How many of you have heard of the prisoner's dilemma before?

577
00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:51.070
They must use 2115 why is it called the prisoner's dilemma?

578
00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.600
Yeah,
so the guy here in orange,
that's okay.
Let's just do it.

579
00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:58.520
You can just point to you.
That's fine.

580
00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:03.580
I think it's whether or not the prisoners cooperate in the sentence they have

581
00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.770
and if the kind of read out the other person and they could have less bright red

582
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:11.840
out,
then Dave like ended up losing large scale.
Good,
good turn.

583
00:34:11.841 --> 00:34:16.841
The Standard story you've got these two crooks are two accused crux and they're

584
00:34:17.061 --> 00:34:19.880
in separate cells and they're being interviewed separately,

585
00:34:19.881 --> 00:34:23.690
kept apart and they're both told that if neither of them routes the other guy

586
00:34:23.691 --> 00:34:28.160
out,
they'll go to jail for to say a year.
If they both write each other out,

587
00:34:28.161 --> 00:34:29.420
they'll end up in jail for two years.

588
00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.240
But if you wrap the other guy out and he doesn't write you out,

589
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:37.430
then you will go home free and he'll go to jail for five years and you put that

590
00:34:37.431 --> 00:34:38.060
all down.

591
00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:41.060
You're pretty quickly see that regardless where the other guy rats you out or

592
00:34:41.061 --> 00:34:44.480
not,
you're better off ratting him out.
All right.
Now,

593
00:34:44.481 --> 00:34:48.460
if you haven't ever seen that prisoner's dilemma,
you can see it,
uh,

594
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:52.130
pretty much every night,
uh,
on a show called Lauren order.

595
00:34:52.131 --> 00:34:56.480
How many of you have seen Lauren order?
All right.
If you haven't seen Lauren Oda,

596
00:34:56.510 --> 00:35:00.730
the way to see Lauren order is to go to a random TV sets at a random time and

597
00:35:00.731 --> 00:35:01.730
turn of a random channel.

598
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.180
There's,
this happens in every single episode.

599
00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.820
So much so that if any of you actually,
I mean,
this might not be true at yeah.

600
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:12.010
If any of you or the TV guys,

601
00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.810
if any of you know the guy who writes the plots for this,

602
00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:16.500
have him come to the class,
I guess,

603
00:35:16.501 --> 00:35:19.080
see the video now and we can get some better plot lines in there,
right?

604
00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:23.600
All right.
But of course,
that's not the only example.
The grade game.

605
00:35:23.601 --> 00:35:25.000
And this is not the only example.

606
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:27.350
There are lots of examples of prisoner's dilemma is out there.

607
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:29.900
Let's try and find some other ones.
All right.

608
00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:33.260
So how many of you have roommates in your,
in your college?
Let me go roommates.

609
00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:37.620
Most of you have roommates,
right?
Right.
So,
uh,
I'm now,

610
00:35:37.621 --> 00:35:40.590
but I won't make you show your hands cause it's pretty embarrassing.

611
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.280
But what is the state of your dorm rooms,

612
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:46.170
your shared dorm rooms at the end of the semester or the end of the school year?

613
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.010
All right,
so I'm just guessing,

614
00:35:49.011 --> 00:35:51.690
I haven't been in a few of these things over the years that by the end of the

615
00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:53.310
semester,
I said by the end of the school year,

616
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:57.870
the state of the average Yale Dorm Room is quite disgusting.
All right.

617
00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.820
Why is this?
Why is it disgusting?
Why is it disgusting?

618
00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:04.620
It's disgusting cause people don't tidy up right then and clean out those bits

619
00:36:04.621 --> 00:36:07.950
of pizza and bits of chewed bread and she eats.
But why don't they tidy up?

620
00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:10.320
What is just work it out.

621
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.750
What would you like to happen if you're sharing a dorm room,

622
00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:16.290
you'd like to have the other guy tidy up,
right?
Right.

623
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:19.740
The best thing for you is to have the other k tidy up and the worst thing for

624
00:36:19.741 --> 00:36:23.070
you is to tidy up for the other guy.
But now work it out.

625
00:36:23.071 --> 00:36:26.550
It's a prisoner's dilemma.
If the other guy doesn't tidy up,

626
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.070
you're best off not turning up either cause the last thing you want is to be

627
00:36:29.071 --> 00:36:31.770
tightening up the other guy.
And if the other guy does tidy up,
hey,

628
00:36:31.771 --> 00:36:32.790
the rooms clean,
who cares?

629
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:36.720
Either way you're not going to tidy up and you end up with a typical Yale Room.

630
00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:40.110
Am I being in or your dorm room is all perfect.
This may be agenda thing,

631
00:36:40.111 --> 00:36:41.900
but we're not going to go there.
All right.

632
00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.120
So there are lots of prisoner's dilemma is out there and I'm gonna get out.

633
00:36:45.121 --> 00:36:48.670
Any other examples?
Other examples?

634
00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.960
I didn't quite hear that.
Sorry.
It's trying to get a mic on it.

635
00:36:53.961 --> 00:36:54.794
You can really hear it

636
00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:01.780
paying up and a lot of money,
Huh?
Okay.

637
00:37:01.781 --> 00:37:04.300
And divorce and divorce struggles.
Okay.
Okay.
That's okay.

638
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:08.290
You're too young to worry about such things,
but never mind.
Never mind.
Yeah.
Okay.

639
00:37:08.291 --> 00:37:10.760
That's a good example cause all right.
Hiring lawyers,
link getting,

640
00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:13.900
bring in big guns.
What about in economics example

641
00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.370
at firms who are competing in prices,
right.

642
00:37:18.371 --> 00:37:22.510
Both firms have an incentive to undercut the other firm driving down profits for

643
00:37:22.511 --> 00:37:23.400
both.
Right?

644
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:26.560
The last thing you want to have the other firm undercut you and they're going to

645
00:37:26.561 --> 00:37:28.750
push prices down.
That's good for us to consumers,

646
00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:33.610
but bad for the firm pad industry profit.
What remedies do we see?

647
00:37:33.611 --> 00:37:36.130
We will,
we'll come back to this later on in the class,
but let's have a preview.

648
00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:39.730
So what remedies do we see in society for prisoners?
Dilemmas?

649
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:42.030
What kind of remedies we see?
Let me try and get,
uh,

650
00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:45.160
get the guy here and he's right in front in front of your collusion,

651
00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:51.280
collusion,
collusion.
Okay.
So firms could collude.
All right.
So,

652
00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:54.590
uh,
what,
what prevents them from colluding prevention,

653
00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:59.500
including one thing they could do?
Presumably if they could write a contract,

654
00:37:59.501 --> 00:38:00.610
these firms,
they could say,

655
00:38:00.611 --> 00:38:03.070
I won't lower my prices if you don't lower your prices.

656
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.190
And they could put this contract in with the precis lawyer who's taking a day

657
00:38:06.191 --> 00:38:08.380
off from the divorce court and that will secure that.

658
00:38:08.381 --> 00:38:11.530
They wouldn't say lower prices on each other.
Is that right?
All right.

659
00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:16.500
So why wouldn't that work?
Why wouldn't writing a contract here work?

660
00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:21.780
Right?
It's against the law,
right?
Legal contract.
It's an illegal contract.

661
00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.070
All right.
What about you with your roommates?

662
00:38:24.071 --> 00:38:25.840
How many of you have a written contract?

663
00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:28.960
No stuck with a magnet on the fridge telling you you're posting when you're

664
00:38:28.961 --> 00:38:32.200
supposed to tidy up.
Very few of you,
right?
Why?

665
00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.700
Why do you manage to get some cooperation between you and your roommates?

666
00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:39.190
Even without us,
even without a written contract,

667
00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:40.613
<v 1>not legally.</v>

668
00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.720
<v 0>Well,
I'd probably is legally enforceable.
Actually.
This guys,</v>

669
00:38:43.721 --> 00:38:45.040
it's not even pretty easily enforceable.

670
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:48.150
You probably could have a written contract about tidying up.
Yeah.
The,
the,
the,

671
00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.780
the woman in the,
in here yet repetition.
You do it over and over.
Yeah,
so maybe,

672
00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:55.300
maybe even among your roommates,

673
00:38:55.301 --> 00:38:59.830
maybe you don't need a contract because you can manage to achieve the same ends

674
00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:03.070
by the fact that you're going to be interacting with the same person over and

675
00:39:03.071 --> 00:39:04.390
over again during your time at Yale.

676
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:09.310
So we'll come back and revisit the idea that repeating an interaction may be may

677
00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:11.110
allow you to attain cooperation,

678
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:13.120
but we're not going to come back to that till after the midterm.

679
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:16.150
That's way down the road.
But we'll get there.
All right.
Now,

680
00:39:16.151 --> 00:39:19.030
one person earlier on had mentioned something about communication.

681
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:22.200
I think it was only the front,
right?
So that's the thing about this.

682
00:39:22.201 --> 00:39:23.530
The second is communication.

683
00:39:23.531 --> 00:39:27.340
The problem here is that it's the reason people behave badly in this l babby

684
00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:29.560
people choose Alpha in this game here.

685
00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:32.740
Is it the fact that they can't communicate?
That's where I suppose you could,

686
00:39:32.741 --> 00:39:34.930
I suppose you'd be able to talk beforehand as oppose.

687
00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:38.830
The woman whose name was Mary,
had been to talk to the person next door,

688
00:39:38.831 --> 00:39:41.860
who's name is Erica,
and they'd said,
you know,

689
00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:45.060
supposedly were going to be paired together.
I'll choose beater,
a few shoes,

690
00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:46.780
pizza without work.

691
00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:50.540
<v 1>Why wouldn't that work?
Yep.</v>

692
00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:54.490
<v 0>There's no enforcement.
There's no enforcement.
Right?</v>

693
00:39:54.491 --> 00:39:58.200
So it isn't a failure of communication per se,
right?

694
00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:02.160
A contract is more than communication.
A contracts is communication with teeth,

695
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.510
right?
It actually changes the payoffs.
So I could communicate with allies,

696
00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:08.310
I'm agreements,
but back home,

697
00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.460
I'm going to go and go ahead and choose Alpha anyway,

698
00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:13.230
all the better if he's choosing Peter.
All right.

699
00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:15.930
So we'll come back and talk about more of these things as the course goes on.

700
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:18.330
But I've just come back to the two.
We forgot that.

701
00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:21.720
So the collusion case and the case back in law and order with the,

702
00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.910
with the prisoners and the salary,
how do they enforce that contract?

703
00:40:24.911 --> 00:40:25.321
So when they do it,

704
00:40:25.321 --> 00:40:28.050
always rat each other's out and some of manage managed to collude.

705
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:30.270
How do they manage to enforce those contracts?

706
00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.690
<v 1>There was agreement.
How are they enforced?
Yep.</v>

707
00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:38.080
<v 0>The Cooper,
they trust each other that well.
If you trust a crook,
that's not,
yeah.</v>

708
00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:41.540
What,
what else could it be?
And the guy,
the guy here again,
the big yeah.

709
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.830
Is your sum game.
Well,
but this is the game,
right?
So here's the games.

710
00:40:45.831 --> 00:40:49.520
We'll come a little bit to pet the way they value.
All right,
good.
Good.

711
00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:53.120
The payoffs may be different.
A different,
I have something simpler in mind.

712
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:56.480
How it's,
suppose they have a written contract or even an unwritten contract.

713
00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:00.710
What enforces the contract for colluding firms or crux in jail?

714
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:04.123
<v 1>Yep.</v>

715
00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:09.070
<v 0>Free and five years when the other guy gets out,
he might run into a situation.</v>

716
00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:13.630
Yeah,
so a short version of that is it's a different kind of contract.

717
00:41:13.631 --> 00:41:17.640
If you rat someone out in jail,
someone puts a contract out on you.
All right.

718
00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:20.380
All right.
Tony Soprano enforces those contracts.

719
00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.860
That's the purpose of Tony Soprano is the purpose of the map.

720
00:41:22.861 --> 00:41:26.920
Yet the reason the mafia thrives in countries where it's hard to write legal

721
00:41:26.921 --> 00:41:28.410
contracts at say some new,

722
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.990
some new parts of the former Soviet Union or some parts of Africa.

723
00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:35.570
The reason the mafia thrives in those environments is that it substitutes for

724
00:41:35.571 --> 00:41:40.490
the law and enforces both legal and illegal contracts.
All right,

725
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:45.080
so I promised a while ago now that we were going to come back and look at this

726
00:41:45.081 --> 00:41:49.940
game under some other possible payoffs,
so let,
no,
I was under a contract,

727
00:41:49.941 --> 00:41:52.520
but let's come back and fulfill that promise anyway,

728
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:56.390
so we're going to revisit,
if not the divinity school,

729
00:41:56.450 --> 00:42:00.350
at least in people who have more morality than my friends up in the business

730
00:42:00.351 --> 00:42:01.184
school.

731
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:09.020
We're going to ask for the same grade game we played at the,
at the beginning.

732
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.410
What would happen if players' payoffs look different?

733
00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:17.893
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

734
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:22.640
<v 0>so these are possible payoffs to all right.
And I'll give these a name.</v>

735
00:42:22.641 --> 00:42:25.700
We called the other guy's evil gates.
So we'll get,

736
00:42:25.701 --> 00:42:30.050
we'll call these guys indignant angels.

737
00:42:30.051 --> 00:42:33.380
I can never spell indignant.
Is that roughly right?
But look right.

738
00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:37.280
I think it's right.
The ligament,
isn't it indignant?
Alright.
Indignant angels.

739
00:42:37.281 --> 00:42:40.040
We'll see why in a second.
So here are their payoffs.

740
00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:50.650
And once again,
the basic structure,
the game hasn't changed.

741
00:42:50.651 --> 00:42:52.890
It's still I'm choosing Alfin pizza.

742
00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:56.830
My Paris choosing our firm be set and the grades are the same as they were

743
00:42:56.831 --> 00:43:00.340
before.
They're hidden by that board.
But you saw them before.
All right,

744
00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:03.940
but this time the payoffs are as follows.
On the lead diagonal,

745
00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:07.960
we still have zero,
zero and one one but now the grades here,

746
00:43:07.961 --> 00:43:12.430
a minus one and Mike at the pay offs are minus one and minus three on here.

747
00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.170
Then minus three and minus one.

748
00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:18.870
I watched the idea here is on the only other possible pals is just an idea.

749
00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:23.950
Suppose I get an a and my pad gets a c,

750
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:28.210
then sure I get that initial payoff of three.

751
00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:32.380
But unfortunately I can't sleep at night and I'm feeling so guilty.
Right?

752
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:32.741
I have some,

753
00:43:32.741 --> 00:43:36.220
I have some kind of moral conscience and after I subtracted off my guilt

754
00:43:36.221 --> 00:43:39.910
feelings,
I ended up at minus one.
So think of this as guilt,

755
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:45.160
some notion of morality.
Alright,
how conversely,

756
00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.280
if I chose a beach or my patches an Alpha,

757
00:43:48.281 --> 00:43:52.710
so I end up with a c and she ends up with an a,
then you know,

758
00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:56.530
I have a bad time explaining to my parents where I got a c in this class and I

759
00:43:56.531 --> 00:43:59.770
have to say about how I'm going to be president anyway.
But then in addition,

760
00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:03.220
I feel indignation against this person.
It isn't just that I got to see,

761
00:44:03.221 --> 00:44:05.800
I got to see because she made me get a see.
All right,

762
00:44:05.801 --> 00:44:09.700
so that moral indignation takes us down to minus three.

763
00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:13.403
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

764
00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:14.381
<v 0>All right.
So again,
I'm not,</v>

765
00:44:14.381 --> 00:44:16.210
I'm not claiming these are the only other possible payoffs,

766
00:44:16.211 --> 00:44:17.680
but just another possible look at,

767
00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:20.543
<v 2>okay,</v>

768
00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:24.570
<v 0>so I suppose these were the payoffs in the game.
Might again,</v>

769
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:28.080
suspend disbelief for a second and imagine that these actually are your payoffs.

770
00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:31.080
And let me ask you what you would have done in this case.

771
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:34.230
Think about it a second,
right?
And write it down.

772
00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.360
Write down what you're going to do on the corner of your notepad.

773
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:38.400
Just write down at Al for ob.
So what you're going to do here,

774
00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.010
and not all writing the guy in the Indian shed hasn't,
right?

775
00:44:42.011 --> 00:44:45.950
You've gotta be writing group in England yet?
Sure it's your neighbor

776
00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:49.510
that's have a show of hands.
Again,
I want to keep,

777
00:44:49.511 --> 00:44:51.840
keep your hands up so that a Jew can see it now.

778
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:56.640
So how many of you chose Alpha in this case?
Raise your hands.

779
00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:59.620
Going to be shy.
Raise your hands.
How many of beads or in this case,

780
00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:04.140
how many people abstained,
not allowed to have saying,
let's try it again.

781
00:45:04.141 --> 00:45:07.800
Alpha Alpha in this case,
no extensions here.
Beat her in this case.

782
00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:13.280
So we'll roughly split in the room.
Often Room.
Someone who chose Alpha again,

783
00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.690
rose the Alphas again.
All right everybody get this guy here.
Uh,
ally,

784
00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:20.100
can we get this guy here?
So what,
why did you choose alpha?
Uh,

785
00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:22.260
you minimize your losses.

786
00:45:22.261 --> 00:45:26.520
You'd get zero or negative one instead of negative three or one.
All right,
so,

787
00:45:26.521 --> 00:45:29.590
so this gentleman saying strategy.
So reits are the,

788
00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:34.260
did this disturbance saying a good reason for choosing how for this game is it's

789
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:38.790
less risky,
right?
The worst case scenario is less bad.
And again,
all right,

790
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.690
what about somebody who should speed a lot of your shows?
Peter [inaudible].

791
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:45.910
Show of hands on the beaches again.
Let me see the Beatles again.
So,
uh,
again,

792
00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:48.940
raise your hands,
raise your hands.
Can we get,
can we get the woman here?

793
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:52.920
Can we ask her why she chose Peter?
Um,
because if you choose Alpha,

794
00:45:52.921 --> 00:45:57.090
the best case scenarios,
you get zero.
Good.
That's a good counter argument.

795
00:45:57.091 --> 00:46:01.320
So the gentleman here was looking at the worst case scenario and the woman here

796
00:46:01.321 --> 00:46:04.930
was to get the best case scenario.
The best case scenario here.
Looks like,
uh,

797
00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:08.400
getting a one here.
All right.
Now that's also a different question.

798
00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:11.430
Is one of the strategies dominated in this game?

799
00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:15.190
No.
Neither strategist dominated.

800
00:46:15.191 --> 00:46:20.191
It's just check if my pair choose is Alpha than my choosing Alpha yield zero

801
00:46:20.681 --> 00:46:22.900
bita minus three.
So alpha would be better,

802
00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:27.820
but if my patches is bita than Alpha yields minus one pizza yields one,

803
00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:29.860
in this case,
Peter would be better.
All right,

804
00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:33.730
so I'll throw in this case it's better against Alpha and Beta has got a better

805
00:46:33.731 --> 00:46:37.490
against pizza,
but neither dominate each other.
Alright,

806
00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:40.970
so here's a game where it's,
we just changed the pay off.

807
00:46:40.971 --> 00:46:43.160
We have the same basic structure,
the same outcomes,

808
00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:47.000
but we're managing people cared about different things or we end up with a very

809
00:46:47.001 --> 00:46:48.890
different answer.
In the first game,

810
00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:52.630
it was kind of clear that we should choose alpha and here it's not a tall,

811
00:46:52.631 --> 00:46:55.610
clear what we can do,
what we should do,
right?
In fact,

812
00:46:55.611 --> 00:46:58.790
this kind of game has a name and we'll revisit it later on this semester.

813
00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:02.930
This kind of game is called a coordination problem.

814
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:10.230
Well,
we'll talk about coordination problems later on,

815
00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:13.480
but the main lesson I want to get out of this,
but today is the simplest.

816
00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:18.000
It's the lesson that payoffs matter.
All right?
We changed the payoffs,

817
00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:22.380
we change what people cared about and we get a very different game with a very

818
00:47:22.381 --> 00:47:26.610
different outcome.
All right?
So there's a,
the basic lesson is

819
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.220
the payoff's matter,
but let me say it a different way.

820
00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.400
So without giving away my age too much,
well guess we'll actually,

821
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:38.740
when I was a kid growing up in England,
there was this guy,
there's a,

822
00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:43.140
there was a pop star and flighty post punk pop star called Joe Jackson and none

823
00:47:43.141 --> 00:47:43.781
of y'all have heard of it.

824
00:47:43.781 --> 00:47:47.490
Cause all about 10 years old and my fault and Joe Jackson had this song and

825
00:47:47.491 --> 00:47:51.840
which had the lyric I something like you can't get what you want and less,

826
00:47:51.841 --> 00:47:54.600
you know what you want,
right?
You can't get your account,

827
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:56.310
get what you wanted us to know.
You know what you want.

828
00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:59.910
And as a statement of logic,
that's false,
right?

829
00:47:59.911 --> 00:48:02.550
It could be that what you want just drops into your lap without you knowing

830
00:48:02.551 --> 00:48:06.150
about it.
All right?
But at the same as a strategy,
it's a pretty good idea.

831
00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.340
It's a good idea to try and figure out what your goals are,

832
00:48:08.341 --> 00:48:11.880
what you're trying to achieve before you go ahead and analyze the game.

833
00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:15.410
<v 1>All right,
so payoffs matter.</v>

834
00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:18.440
Let's put it in his version.

835
00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:25.760
You can't guess
what do you want

836
00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:31.250
till
you know

837
00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:34.753
what you want.

838
00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:42.990
<v 0>Be Honest.
How many of you have heard of Joe Jackson?
Oh,
it makes me feel old.</v>

839
00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:44.070
Oh Man.
Okay.

840
00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:49.620
It goes down every year.
All right,

841
00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:54.830
so so far we've looked at this game as played by people who are evil goods and

842
00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:00.900
we've lived with this game as played by people who are indignant angels.

843
00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:03.450
But we can do something more interesting.

844
00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:07.920
We can imagine playing this game on a sort of mix and match.

845
00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:11.640
For example,
imagine this shouldn't be hard for most of you.

846
00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:14.430
Imagine that you are an evil gets,

847
00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:19.770
but you knew that the person you're playing against isn't indignant.

848
00:49:19.771 --> 00:49:24.360
Angel might say,
again,
imagine that you know you're an evil gates,

849
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:27.780
but you know that the person you're playing against or with isn't indignant

850
00:49:27.781 --> 00:49:28.614
angel.

851
00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:33.300
<v 1>What should you do in that case?
What should they be doing?</v>

852
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:38.930
<v 0>Who thinks you should choose alpha?
In that case,
it's half pound the room.
Again,</v>

853
00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:43.250
we can keep your hands up so,
so as you can see here,
all right,

854
00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:46.220
who thinks she's out?
Who they should choose?
Beats are in that case.

855
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.990
Who's abstaining here?
I'm going to abstain in this class.
It's complete.
No.
No.

856
00:49:50.991 --> 00:49:53.930
Okay.
So we'll allow some extensions on the first day,
but not beyond today.

857
00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:58.130
Let's have a look.
Let's analyze this combined game.

858
00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:01.320
<v 1>All right.
So what does this game look like?</v>

859
00:50:03.300 --> 00:50:08.300
It's an evil gates versus

860
00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:12.840
and indignant angel.

861
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:17.063
<v 0>All right,
add it.</v>

862
00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:22.100
We can put the payoff matrix together by combining the matrices we had before.

863
00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:26.850
So in this case,
this is me as always.
This is my,

864
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:30.910
the column player.
Okay?

865
00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:34.810
My payoffs are going to be what?
My payoff is going to the evil.
Get payoffs.

866
00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.760
So they come from the matrix up there.

867
00:50:37.090 --> 00:50:38.950
So if I'm gonna have to help me reading it off there,

868
00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:44.130
that's a zero three a minus one and a one.

869
00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:46.793
All right.

870
00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:52.260
My opponent or my partners pay offs come from the Indigo Angel May Matrix.

871
00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:57.400
So they come from here.
There is zero,
a minus three,

872
00:50:57.910 --> 00:51:02.350
a minus one and the one they want to see how I constructed that sort of just to

873
00:51:02.351 --> 00:51:06.310
remind you again,
the first payoff is the role players pay off.

874
00:51:06.311 --> 00:51:10.900
In this case the evil gets high and the second payoff is the column players pay

875
00:51:10.901 --> 00:51:14.400
off.
In this case the indignant angel.
Hi,

876
00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:15.910
well now we've set it up as a matrix.

877
00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:20.410
Let's try again that question I asked before.
Suppose your the role player here,

878
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:23.740
you're the evil get.
Those are your payoffs.
You're playing against them,

879
00:51:23.741 --> 00:51:28.010
the angel,
what would you do?
Right?
So once again,

880
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:30.280
no attention at this time.
Who would choose alpha?

881
00:51:30.281 --> 00:51:33.040
Let's have a show of hands again.
Keep your hands up a second.

882
00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:35.470
And who would choose beats that.

883
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:39.910
I have very few beaters but most of the album I'll find I think is the right

884
00:51:39.911 --> 00:51:44.320
answer here.
But why?
Why?
Why is Alpha the right answer here?

885
00:51:44.321 --> 00:51:47.860
So yeah.
Can we get,
can we get this guy here?
Yeah,
it's the dominant strategy.

886
00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:50.770
Good.
Good.
Actually,
nothing has changed from the game.

887
00:51:50.771 --> 00:51:54.250
We started with the fact they changed the other guy's payoffs didn't matter
here.

888
00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:59.230
Alpha was dominant before it dominated.
Beat it before and it still dominates.

889
00:51:59.231 --> 00:52:04.110
Peter.
Let's just check.
If my opponent chooses alpha and I choose Alpha,

890
00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.680
I get zero pizza.
I get minus one.

891
00:52:05.681 --> 00:52:09.460
So Alpha would be better if my opponent chooses bita and I choose Alpha,

892
00:52:09.461 --> 00:52:12.730
I get three beach,
I get one.
Once again,
Alpha's better.

893
00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:16.150
So as before Alpha does better than pizza for me,

894
00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.960
regardless of what the other person does.
Alpha dominates.
Bita,

895
00:52:20.290 --> 00:52:25.090
what was the first lesson of the class?
What was the first lesson of the class?

896
00:52:25.091 --> 00:52:27.700
Writing out please.
Right,
right.

897
00:52:27.701 --> 00:52:31.990
So you should all have been choosing in this game.
You all should be using your,

898
00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:34.720
you all should have chosen alpha.
All right,
so the one person didn't,

899
00:52:34.721 --> 00:52:36.700
we'll let him offer today.
Okay.
Okay.

900
00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:39.910
So how far dominate speeds in here.

901
00:52:42.670 --> 00:52:43.503
<v 2>Okay.</v>

902
00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.540
<v 0>All right,
let's flip things around.</v>

903
00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:49.173
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

904
00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:53.310
<v 0>right.
I suppose now harder to imagine,
but it's try it.</v>

905
00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:56.350
Suppose now that you are an indignant angel

906
00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:01.470
and you're playing against the new new this,

907
00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:03.420
you're playing against an evil again.

908
00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.690
Great.
You're in a demon angel,

909
00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:12.700
so you have the pay offs that are still there and you're playing against the

910
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:14.090
evil gate,
which is the power we covered up,

911
00:53:14.091 --> 00:53:17.270
but we'll reproduce them that's produced that Matrix.
By the way,

912
00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:20.360
this has been the sound like a wrestling match.
I don't mean it to,

913
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:22.730
let's try here.

914
00:53:22.731 --> 00:53:27.731
Alpha Beta Alpha Pizza pass me.

915
00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:32.550
All right,
so my pay off this time are the indigo angel.

916
00:53:32.551 --> 00:53:37.551
Payoffs are minus zero minus one minus three and one and my opponents pay offs

917
00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:46.450
are,
what would it be my pals before they come from the other matrix as a show,

918
00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:50.760
right?
They come from this matrix so there can be zero minus one three one

919
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:56.970
zero minus one three one.
Okay to be,

920
00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:02.180
I think the second payoff from that Matrix and made it the second payoff in this

921
00:54:04.441 --> 00:54:06.810
matrix.
Okay,
everyone.
See how I did that?
Once again,

922
00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:10.970
the role player is the first pay off and the column player is the other.

923
00:54:12.730 --> 00:54:16.470
All right.
What should you do in this case?
You're the indignant angel.

924
00:54:16.471 --> 00:54:19.230
You're playing games is evil gates.
What should you do?

925
00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:21.660
Write down in your notepad what you do.
Show it to your neighbors.

926
00:54:21.661 --> 00:54:24.990
You can't cheat,
you can't cheat,
but you'll be shamed.

927
00:54:24.991 --> 00:54:28.530
Shame in front your neighbor
and uh,

928
00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.980
raise your hands.
All that juicy it.
Raise your hand.

929
00:54:31.981 --> 00:54:34.260
Keep them up if you chose Alpha now.

930
00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:41.820
And how about if you shows beaten now?
So why don't you beat as mostly Alphas?

931
00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:45.810
Well,
let's see it.
Let's reason this through a second.
This Alpha,

932
00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:50.250
does my Alpha dominate my bita?
No.
In fact,

933
00:54:50.251 --> 00:54:53.530
Alpha doesn't dominate.
Be Deaf for me.
It hasn't only been,
it might.
If,

934
00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:58.320
if my pair of shoes is Alpha,
then Alpha gets me zero Beta minus three.

935
00:54:58.321 --> 00:54:59.690
So Alpha does better.
But if my patch,

936
00:54:59.691 --> 00:55:03.780
who's his beats that then I'll forget to me minus one beat against me.
One.

937
00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.570
In this case,
Peter is better at better.
So once again,
as we saw before,

938
00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:09.270
Alpha is better against Alpha beaters.
Get better against Peta.

939
00:55:09.271 --> 00:55:12.990
There's no dominance going on here.
Nevertheless,

940
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:17.670
at least 90% of you chose Alpha here,
and that's the right answer.
Why?

941
00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:21.240
Why should you choose Alpha here?
Somebody who we met.

942
00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:25.070
Who can we get the guy with the beard here?
Yeah.
Wait,

943
00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:26.220
wait for the Mike [inaudible].
Great.

944
00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:29.830
We'd acknowledge that Alpha is a dominant strategy from my apartment,

945
00:55:29.831 --> 00:55:33.960
so we must choose based upon or knowing that my part is going to choose alpha.

946
00:55:34.110 --> 00:55:38.940
Good,
good,
good.
And your name is Henry.
So Henry saying,
sure,

947
00:55:38.970 --> 00:55:43.680
I don't have a domination strategy.
My Alpha doesn't dominate my beta.

948
00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:49.020
But look at my opponents.
My opponents Alpha dominates Herbie to,

949
00:55:49.021 --> 00:55:54.021
if I choose Alpha and she chooses Alpha to get zero [inaudible],

950
00:55:54.330 --> 00:55:58.170
she gets minus one.
Alpha is better if I choose bita.

951
00:55:58.230 --> 00:56:01.760
If she's Alpha actually gets three B.
So one against,
again,

952
00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:06.390
Alpha is better for my opponents.
Alpha Dominates Bita.
So by,

953
00:56:06.391 --> 00:56:10.650
by thinking about my opponent,
I putting myself on my opponents shoes,

954
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:15.390
I realize that she has a dominant strategy alpha,

955
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:17.190
she's going to choose alpha.

956
00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:21.990
And my best response against Alpha is to choose alpha myself.
All right,

957
00:56:21.991 --> 00:56:22.890
so here

958
00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:29.970
this time my Alpha does not dominate.

959
00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:34.753
<v 1>Fisa</v>

960
00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:38.180
<v 0>bought my peers.</v>

961
00:56:40.110 --> 00:56:40.550
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

962
00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:45.550
<v 0>my peers just choice of Alpha Dominique's her choice I possible slice of pizza,</v>

963
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:50.860
so she will shoes.

964
00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:57.640
She will choose our flat and once I know that she's going to choose Alpha,

965
00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:01.290
it's clear that I should choose Alpha and get zero rather than Bita and get

966
00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:02.163
minus three

967
00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:04.933
<v 1>so I</v>

968
00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:11.020
should choose Alpha Olsen.
All right.

969
00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:15.660
<v 0>Okay,
so now we've seen four different combinations.</v>

970
00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:19.800
We've seen a case where an evil gate was playing an evil get when endemic nature

971
00:57:19.801 --> 00:57:22.540
will find it and did an angel and we've seen both the flips of those that you

972
00:57:22.541 --> 00:57:27.180
will get the angel and they didn't win against evil.
Get.
Why are we doing this?

973
00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:30.180
Because there's an important lesson here.
What's the lesson here?

974
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:35.670
The lesson is comes from this game that a great way to analyze game,

975
00:57:35.671 --> 00:57:38.760
a great way to get used to the idea of strategic thinking.

976
00:57:38.761 --> 00:57:43.761
Perhaps even the essence of strategic thinking is the ability to put yourself in

977
00:57:44.221 --> 00:57:45.930
someone else's shoes,

978
00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:50.520
figure out what their payoffs are and trying to figure out what they're going to

979
00:57:50.521 --> 00:57:54.060
do.
All right,
so the big lesson of this game is,

980
00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:56.110
<v 1>okay,</v>

981
00:57:56.110 --> 00:57:57.910
<v 0>I forgot what number we're up to.
I guess there's best in for,</v>

982
00:57:57.911 --> 00:57:59.950
I think less than four is

983
00:58:03.370 --> 00:58:04.360
<v 1>put yourself</v>

984
00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:09.160
in others shoes

985
00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:13.113
and

986
00:58:14.170 --> 00:58:16.510
<v 0>try to figure out,</v>

987
00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:21.630
<v 1>okay,</v>

988
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:22.680
<v 0>what they will do.</v>

989
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:28.103
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

990
00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:31.490
<v 0>and then the sentence,
this is the first difficult lesson of the class.</v>

991
00:58:31.700 --> 00:58:34.790
It's easy to spot when a strategy is dominant,
more or less.

992
00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:38.210
It's pretty easy to write,
to figure out.
You have to know about your own payoffs,

993
00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:42.710
but the hard thing in life is getting you to come out of your own selves a bet

994
00:58:43.010 --> 00:58:45.200
rising.
It's quote,
not all about you.

995
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:48.170
You've got to put yourself in other people's shoes different on what they care

996
00:58:48.171 --> 00:58:50.210
about and what they're going to try and do.

997
00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:55.370
So you can respond well to that right now.
While we're here,

998
00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:59.060
let's just mention the things we get more complicated in a world where I don't

999
00:58:59.061 --> 00:59:01.520
actually know the payoffs of my opponent.

1000
00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:06.320
It's much easier to figure out my own payoffs than to figure out my opponent's

1001
00:59:06.321 --> 00:59:07.610
payoffs,
right?

1002
00:59:07.611 --> 00:59:10.580
I might not know what that I'm playing someone who isn't evil gates or an

1003
00:59:10.581 --> 00:59:11.414
indignant angel.

1004
00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:14.300
So I'm going to have to figure out what the odds are of that in doing this

1005
00:59:14.301 --> 00:59:14.960
exercise.

1006
00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:18.170
And I guess that's what we're going to come back to that idea to way at the end

1007
00:59:18.171 --> 00:59:20.970
of the class,
that's getting a bit ahead of ourselves,
but we'll get there.

1008
00:59:23.550 --> 00:59:24.960
No,
turns out that this game,

1009
00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:28.230
this prisoner's dilemma with the Alphas and pieces or essentially the same game

1010
00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:31.740
has been played many,
many,
many times in experiments.
Alright?

1011
00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:33.510
So out there in the real world,

1012
00:59:33.511 --> 00:59:36.060
I think we can do this yet out there in the real world,

1013
00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:37.800
when they do these experiments,

1014
00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:44.820
they find out that roughly 70% of people choose alpha and roughly 30%

1015
00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:52.173
<v 1>choose pizza,</v>

1016
00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:58.460
<v 0>roughly almost a third shoe speeder.
And what do we think is going on?</v>

1017
00:59:58.880 --> 00:59:59.220
Why I,

1018
00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:03.680
so that's a third of the people who seem to be choosing a dominator strategy or

1019
01:00:03.681 --> 01:00:07.070
is it,
what's going on there?
Why?
Why do you think,

1020
01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.340
why do you think that 30% of people are choosing

1021
01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:14.890
<v 1>I choosing pizza?
Anybody who can,</v>

1022
01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:16.190
can we catch this guy here?

1023
01:00:17.550 --> 01:00:20.430
<v 4>They might be motivated by the fact that every,</v>

1024
01:00:20.431 --> 01:00:23.940
every person who chooses beat a raises the a B average.

1025
01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:27.230
<v 0>It could be moral people.
They could be one possibility.</v>

1026
01:00:27.231 --> 01:00:31.610
Is this 30% of people in the real world and choose pizza?
I just deiced people.

1027
01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:33.350
All right.
What else could it be?

1028
01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.490
<v 4>I know this might be changing the game a little bit,</v>

1029
01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:42.570
but if you ever expected to play the same game with the partner,
all right,

1030
01:00:42.571 --> 01:00:45.030
so they have more.
They could be thinking they're going to play again,

1031
01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:47.910
like long run payoffs are greater if you choose Beta every time.

1032
01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:50.200
So they could be that.
They think this is actually the,
the

1033
01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.950
<v 0>just at the experimental,
they think this is a multi shot game,</v>

1034
01:00:52.951 --> 01:00:57.360
not a one shot game.
Good.
What else could it be?
What's the simplest explanation?

1035
01:00:57.361 --> 01:01:00.240
What's the other obvious explanation?
Just don't understand.

1036
01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:02.360
They could just be stupid,
right?
It could be,
right,
right,
right.

1037
01:01:02.361 --> 01:01:05.160
We're not to say that in costly.
Right,
right,
right.
Let's be honest here.

1038
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:08.370
When we say experiments in the real world and game theory or the ones you read

1039
01:01:08.371 --> 01:01:11.900
about in the New York Times,
the real world when it comes to experiments,
uh,

1040
01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:16.320
on in economics really means undergraduates at the University of Arizona.

1041
01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:20.670
All these,
I mean,
I'm not making that up.
We just does.
They all are.

1042
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:24.630
But I don't know anything about any of you from Arizona.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

1043
01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:28.650
I don't know whether the average Undergrad at the University of Arizona just has

1044
01:01:28.651 --> 01:01:32.190
a sunny personality or whether they spend too long in the sun.

1045
01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:35.210
I just don't know what to do this.
Right.
Right.

1046
01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:39.530
We call re distinguished from this.
All right.
How about at Yale?
What do,

1047
01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:42.240
what's our numbers here?
How about in this class?

1048
01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.670
You don't do you a Mike here at your colleague here?

1049
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:46.400
<v 1>Yeah,
38</v>

1050
01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.710
<v 0>so two 38 yeah.</v>

1051
01:01:51.711 --> 01:01:54.910
All this is Yale versus 36.

1052
01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:58.660
So even even at my level of arithmetic,
that's a lot less than 30% right?

1053
01:01:58.661 --> 01:02:02.880
That's more like less than 15% no,
it's about 15% I guess.
Alright.
Alright.

1054
01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:03.641
So two 30,

1055
01:02:03.641 --> 01:02:08.300
six to 38 shows Alpha and 36 chose Beta.

1056
01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:11.770
Now there's a,
there's one more lesson in this class and there's going to be,

1057
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:13.360
there's gonna be a whole lot,
but this isn't end of the class.

1058
01:02:13.361 --> 01:02:14.470
But one more lesson to take home.

1059
01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:19.620
You guys are going to be playing games among each other today and until whatever

1060
01:02:19.621 --> 01:02:22.530
it is,
December 7th,
whatever it is,
the end of the end of,
uh,
at the end of term.

1061
01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:26.260
Alright?
So look around each other.
You may get to know each other a bets,
right?

1062
01:02:26.330 --> 01:02:28.770
And what did we learn today about you guys?

1063
01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.430
The lesson here,

1064
01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:37.950
lesson five is Yale students.

1065
01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:44.400
Ah,
evil,
right?

1066
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:47.820
Be Aware of that when you're playing games.
All right,

1067
01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:50.940
I want to play one more game today are in the remaining minutes.

1068
01:02:50.941 --> 01:02:52.190
It doesn't matter if we finish earlier,

1069
01:02:52.191 --> 01:02:54.000
but I wanna try and get this game at least started.

1070
01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:56.280
So do you all have game number two in front of you?

1071
01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.700
I want just to look at this real reading that over I can.

1072
01:02:59.701 --> 01:03:02.700
I also make sure you've all got your legal forms and you you're going to sign.

1073
01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:05.490
Don't walk away with are legal forms you,
we need to get those connected in.

1074
01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.560
So at the end of talking about this game,

1075
01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:11.340
I'm going to collect in both the second game and for the class and also the

1076
01:03:11.341 --> 01:03:12.660
legal form,
right?

1077
01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:16.080
If you don't have a legal form or if you've lost it or something,
it's online.

1078
01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:20.130
All right.
It's online.
All right,
let's have a look at that second game.

1079
01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:21.413
I'll read it out for you.

1080
01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:31.000
Game to pick a number.
Everyone got this?
Anyone not got this?
I haven't got it

1081
01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.800
without showing your neighbor what you're doing.

1082
01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:40.010
Put in the box below a whole number between one and a hundred whole number.

1083
01:03:40.431 --> 01:03:45.330
He 100 integer.
We will calculate the average number chosen in the class.

1084
01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:50.660
The winner in this game is the person whose number is closest to two thirds

1085
01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:54.720
times the average in the class.
Again,

1086
01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:59.840
the winner is the person whose number is closest to two thirds times the average

1087
01:04:01.051 --> 01:04:02.010
number in the class.

1088
01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:07.670
And the winner will win $5 minus the difference in pennies between her choice

1089
01:04:08.821 --> 01:04:13.140
and that two thirds of the average.
I'm just,
once you've understood this,

1090
01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:15.000
let me do an example on the board.

1091
01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:21.060
Got One more board.
That's good.

1092
01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:24.900
So managing two or three people in the class

1093
01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:31.810
and imagine that they chose 25 five and 60 all right,

1094
01:04:34.911 --> 01:04:39.390
so 25 plus five plus 60 is 90 people from,

1095
01:04:39.391 --> 01:04:42.770
feel free to correct my reference because it's often wrong.
90 right?

1096
01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:47.860
And 92 thirds of 92 thirds of 92 thirds of,

1097
01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:53.440
whoops,
whoops.
Uh,
what do we need to start again?

1098
01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:57.020
I need to divide it by three to get the average,
right.
So the average,

1099
01:04:57.170 --> 01:05:01.850
the average is 30 thank you.
Somebody shutting out,

1100
01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:06.440
right?
So total is 90 the average is 30 am I right so far?
All right,

1101
01:05:06.441 --> 01:05:08.270
so two thirds of the average,

1102
01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:15.120
two thirds of the average is 20.
I'm looking desperately the ta,

1103
01:05:15.121 --> 01:05:17.320
is that right?
Okay.
All right.

1104
01:05:17.321 --> 01:05:21.010
So the average is 30 and two thirds of the averages.
20.
All right.

1105
01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:23.440
So who's the winner?
Which,
which number would have,
would,
would've won here?

1106
01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:29.470
25 would have won 25 would've been the closest.
And what would they have one?

1107
01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:34.770
They'd have won five bucks minus 5 cents for a total of four 95

1108
01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:42.970
right now to make this interesting.
Let's play this for real.

1109
01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:47.350
So this course relies on me having brought some money and be able to do this

1110
01:05:47.351 --> 01:05:48.640
without dislodging the microphone.

1111
01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:51.340
<v 1>All right,</v>

1112
01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:54.860
<v 0>so I'm gonna see if I have,
sorry about that.</v>

1113
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:57.310
I'm going to see if I have enough money to do this class room.

1114
01:05:57.410 --> 01:06:00.410
When we play this game in the,
uh,
in the old days,

1115
01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:03.260
during the.com boom with the MBA students,

1116
01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:07.850
you have to put 50 bucks on the table to get them interested.
Graduate Students,

1117
01:06:07.851 --> 01:06:11.840
5 cents.
Do it.
Okay,
so this is a,

1118
01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:15.890
that some bloke with a bid on this one?
Yeah,
this is okay.
This is Lincoln.

1119
01:06:15.891 --> 01:06:19.160
Apparently Lincoln apparently.
Who Knew Lincoln.
Okay.
All right,

1120
01:06:19.161 --> 01:06:23.480
so this is a $5 note and I'm going to put it,
sorry about that again.

1121
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:26.450
I'm going to put it in an envelope.
I'm not cheating anybody,
right?

1122
01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:32.960
I'm not in the no magic tricks here and that you're going to be a prize for

1123
01:06:32.961 --> 01:06:37.130
this,
for this game,
and we better give this to someone we trust.

1124
01:06:37.940 --> 01:06:38.271
All right,

1125
01:06:38.271 --> 01:06:43.271
so prize for one 59 who do you guys trust?

1126
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:47.210
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1127
01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:48.620
<v 0>the camera guy.
Okay.
Jude,</v>

1128
01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:51.940
we know Jews is going to be that next week or I'm getting it to Jude.

1129
01:06:51.941 --> 01:06:55.190
He can come see this on camera.
People at home,
but I'm giving it to Jude.
Okay.

1130
01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.670
I'm going to put it here and Judah.
Judah justice,

1131
01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.500
therefore shop next week with the prize.
Okay.
All right.

1132
01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.080
I think we should give it to the guy at the back.
Who is the moral guy?

1133
01:07:03.081 --> 01:07:05.810
Who is our moral guidance about?
What is it?
All right.
Wait,
wait,
nevermind.

1134
01:07:05.811 --> 01:07:08.330
I get it.
We'll give it to you.
We know g is going to be here.
All right.

1135
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:11.030
Has everyone put a number down?
Any questions your questions?
Yes.

1136
01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:14.210
Just shout them out to me.
We only have one $5 bill.

1137
01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.830
Does that to be one unique winter and if so,

1138
01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:18.260
how is that determined if we have multiple people who will?

1139
01:07:18.590 --> 01:07:21.290
That's a good question.
If there's multiple winners we'll divide it,

1140
01:07:21.291 --> 01:07:24.320
but we'll make sure everyone that has a positive wedding.
Okay.
Good question.

1141
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:27.960
Given the number of people in the room then maybe multiple rentals.

1142
01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:32.030
I except that I,
that possibility has everyone written down a number now?
Alright,

1143
01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:35.900
so hand your numbers to the end of the road.
Don't go yet.

1144
01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:40.490
And you know what I'm saying?
The row before you go,
I want five things from you.

1145
01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:45.590
All right.
I want to know the five lessons from this class,
right?
Tell him,

1146
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:48.230
tell me what you learned.
What were the five lessons?

1147
01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.320
Without looking at your notes,
what were the five lessons?
Anybody worth?

1148
01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:53.150
Shout out one of the lessons.
Yes.
Madam,

1149
01:07:54.830 --> 01:07:58.570
don't play a strictly dominated strategy.
Anything else?
Anything else?
Yes.

1150
01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:04.340
Yale students who evil to lessons down.
Three to go.
The guy over here.

1151
01:08:04.341 --> 01:08:08.390
Yep.
Rational choice can lead rational choices,

1152
01:08:08.391 --> 01:08:11.980
can lead to bad outcomes.
We put it more graphically before,
but that's fine.
Too.

1153
01:08:11.981 --> 01:08:12.920
More outcome,
more.

1154
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:18.000
Put yourself in other people's shoes and I'm missing one.

1155
01:08:18.001 --> 01:08:20.510
I'm not going to do what I'm missing now.
Ah,

1156
01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.510
you can't get your wall that you could,

1157
01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.470
but it's a good idea to figure out what you want.

1158
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:27.500
We'll try and get what you want.
Five things you learned today,

1159
01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:31.400
hand in your numbers and the legal forms,
and I'll see you on Monday.
