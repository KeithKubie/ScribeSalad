00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.969
So, that's just a little bit on some
initial video processing where you have

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:04.460
a static camera moving object.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.350
I'll show you something
else that's kind of cool.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.410
What if you have a static scene?

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.570
So, the right?

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.490
But your video is generated
by a moving camera.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.410
Right?
What sort of

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.420
interesting analysis might you do there?

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.020
Remember, we talked about
when we talked about stereo,

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.010
we talked about motion parallax and
disparity.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.980
The disparity is inversely
proportional to depth.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.984
So, the farther something is, the less
disparity it has, the closer it is,

00:00:26.984 --> 00:00:29.070
the more it moves as I move.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.000
So, and you probably thought of that
as motion parallax in other contexts.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.800
So, if I have cameras that are moving,
looking at a scene,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.440
I could pull out the separate objects
by just looking at the relative motion.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.540
So, faster relative motion
means objects are closer to me.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.040
All right?

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.697
This was first done in what
was called epipolar plane,

00:00:50.697 --> 00:00:52.940
epipolar plane image analysis, or

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.740
just EPI image analysis, that was done
by actually Bolles, Baker and Marimont.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.435
Bob Bolles who his,
his friend and some, by the way,

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:02.091
it's the same Bolles from RANSAC.

00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:05.160
So, he's got his name against
couple of pretty cool algorithms.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.320
So, here's a cute image that was taken.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.390
This was back in the days when you used
to draw images because we couldn't

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.510
actually get computers to make them.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.490
So, the idea was,
what if you have a camera that's

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.600
looking sideways and you can extend
this to looking arbitrary ways but

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.790
it's easy to think
about looking sideways.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.326
And here is some point on
what it looks to me to be, I,

00:01:25.326 --> 00:01:28.340
I don't know if it's a taxi cab or
a police car.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.020
And the idea is that this point, of
course, as this camera moves this way,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.110
this point will move across the image.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.030
The rate at which that point
will move across the image is,

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.220
depends upon how far away it is, right?

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.170
So, a point that's here
will move faster, and

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.090
a point that's out here in infinity,
will move slower.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.980
So, if you go to their original paper,
you'll see pictures that look like this.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.640
This is an indoor scene, and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.630
what you can see is that the camera
is moving just a little bit this way.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.250
Right?
because here,

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.900
you can see this thing is
occluding that thing there.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.822
But then, as the camera moves,
I can now see through there.

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:02.880
All right?

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.190
So as the camera's moving to the left,

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.750
this object is essentially
moving to the right.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.830
So, you can take all of those images and
you can stack them up and

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.630
here they stack them.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.290
This is x.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.890
This is y.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.530
So, this is the first image that we saw.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.305
And this is time.

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:19.980
Okay?

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.050
Now, this little edge here.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.700
You know what that is?

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.961
That's the right most column
at each of the times.

00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:31.004
Now, this might just look
like another picture to you,

00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:33.851
and it is, because if you
look over here, this right

00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:37.970
most column is just as the camera moves,
it's just sweeping across here.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.840
So, we just pull out each of those
columns, you'll get another picture.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.890
And so, that's what you're seeing here,
that's what this side is,

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.930
it's the right most column.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.750
But what's really cool about
this volume, remember,

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.890
we took videos of volume of data?

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.940
Is I can slice that volume of data,
right?

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.190
And so, suppose, we just take
a look at a cut through there.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.180
So, that would be,
that's what this would be here.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.180
And you see that image there, okay?

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.980
And you'll notice, and we're going to
do this more specifically in a minute,

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.790
that I get these streaks and
these streaks are at different slopes.
