00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this question, we'll introduce OAEP, which is Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
OAEP is a padding scheme for use with RSA.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It provides stronger assurances than the PKCS#1 scheme.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In OAEP, we use two functions--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
G, which is a hash function outputting g bits,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and H, which is another hash function outputting h bits.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We also have r, a random nonce of g bits.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We then take our message m and append to it 0's

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
such that the length of m' is g.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We then calculate x by concatenating two parts,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
First part is our message XORed with the output of the hash of r.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The second part is r XORed with the hash of the first part.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We then encrypt x using RSA and send off our message.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
For this assignment, you've been given a ciphertext, which was encrypted

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
using OAEP and RSA, using the given encrypt function.

00:00:51.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Your task is to decrypt the ciphertext and put your answer into the plaintext variable.
