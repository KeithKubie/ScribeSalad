00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.020
In the last video we learned
a little bit about what an

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.510
income statement would look
like for a very kind of

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.820
vanilla company that
sells widgets.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.730
And in this video what I want
to do is close the loop and

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.780
see how this relates to what we
talked about in the first

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.370
video, in terms of
price per share.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.630
And we'll talk about earnings
per share in this case.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.160
And then also how the income
statement relates to the

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.700
balance sheet.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.350
And I said I would do it in
the last video, but then I

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.020
realized I was running
out of time.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.580
And just as a bit of a quick
review, and you probably just

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.370
watched that video.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.430
But just in case you didn't,
revenue was literally the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.230
widgets that I sold.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.620
Let's say this was for 2008.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.110
I sold $3 million worth
of widgets.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.410
Cost of goods sold, well that's
just the cost of the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.190
goods sold.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.090
So let's say I sold 3 million
widgets for $1.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.970
To produce those 3 million
widgets for $1, it cost me

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.690
maybe $0.30 a widget,
or $0.33 a widget.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.590
And so I had a total expense or
total cost of goods sold of

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.710
$1 million.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.640
And so the profit from just
selling those-- say in that

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.470
case that I just made up-- $3
million worth of widgets was

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.670
$2 million.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.730
But I have other expenses.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.060
I can't just put that
in my pocket.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.730
I had marketing, sales, general
and administrative.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.250
And then I was left
with $1 million.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.370
And that's how much operating
profit my

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.180
widget company has produced.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.260
But I'm not done yet.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.020
We learned in the last
video I didn't

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.340
own the company outright.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.290
I had some debt.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.620
In this case, $5 million
worth of debt.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.770
So I have to pay some interest.
There was 10%

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.950
interest. So you take
the interest out.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.340
You're left with $500,000
of pre-tax income.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.720
And of course you have to
pay the government.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.840
And we can debate on whether
we're paying them too much or

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.320
too little.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.100
But they're providing me defense
so that other foreign

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.260
countries can't come and
bomb my factories.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.550
And they're providing,
hopefully, an educated

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.510
workforce for me.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.250
And nice roads and
infrastructure and

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.810
electricity.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.330
So who knows?

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.590
So that's what I'm paying
for, arguably.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.890
And so I'm left with net
income of $350,000.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.190
And when people talk about
earnings of a company, this is

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.370
what they're talking about.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.000
Net income is also earnings.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.450
So when someone says, Google
made $4 billion this past

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.900
quarter-- and quarter just means
a quarter of a year, a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.220
three month period.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.760
And they normally are literally
March, June,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.510
September and December.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.240
So every fourth of the year.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.960
They're literally saying,
Google made $3

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.825
billion in net income.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.000
We talked in the first video
when we started this series

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.670
about how different
companies have

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.740
different numbers of shares.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.700
So let's make up a number of
shares for this company.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.930
So let's say this company has--
let me do it in mauve--

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.090
so this company's shares,
let's say it

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.845
has 1 million shares.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.460
So you've probably heard not
only the term earnings, you've

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.260
probably also heard the term
earnings per share.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.890
So what they do is they just
take your earnings number and

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.860
you divide by the number
of shares.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.870
And you have earnings
per share.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.810
Or EPS.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.230
Sometime people just say EPS for
this company in 2008 was,

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.670
and in this case you take
$350,000, your total earnings,

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.630
divided by the total number
of shares you

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.940
have. And that's what?

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:33.800
That's $0.35 per share of EPS.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.640
Before I go into price to
earnings and all that, I want

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.450
to connect the dots between the
income statement and the

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.090
balance sheet.

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.760
So in this period,
I made $350,000.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.300
So the way you can think about
what an income statement is,

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.390
is it tells you what
happens between

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.100
balance sheet snapshots.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:05.660
So let's say on 12/31/2007,
the balance sheet for the

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.215
company would have
looked like this.

00:04:07.215 --> 00:04:08.470
Let me just draw it.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.850
I won't use the square tool.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:16.374
So it had $10 million
of assets.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:26.140
It had $5 million of debt.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.140
You can kind of view this as the
liabilities of which debt

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.750
is one of them.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.620
Let's just say it's all of it.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.960
So $5 million of liabilities.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.990
So the shareholders' equity,
or you could almost say the

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.600
book value of the equity of the
company, is $5 million.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.060
$5 million equity.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.080
And just to kind of tie it a
little bit with what we did in

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.930
the first video, if we have a
million shares, the book value

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.330
of the equity is $5 million,
so if we say the book value

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.020
per share is just going to be
this number divided by the

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.690
million shares I have. So
$5 million divided by

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.710
1 million is $5.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.640
This is the book value
for a share.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.430
Remember, there's a difference
between book

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.080
value and market value.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.330
The stock of this company at
12/31/2007, it could have been

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.700
trading at $10, at $7, at $1.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.410
That would have been the
market value per share.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.500
This is the book value.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.770
And the book value is
essentially saying, OK, if you

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.700
take the book value of the
assets-- and I talked about

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.670
this a little bit in the last
video-- but if you say, oh,

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.590
well we paid $10 million, and
this is how much value there.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.890
And I'll go into more detail
into how you value

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:43.750
these types of things.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.190
And you take out the
liabilities, this is what the

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.280
assets are worth according
to the accountants.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.270
The market value could
be very different.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.790
But fair enough.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.620
I don't want to delve
too much into that.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:00.430
But now, over this period of
time, over 2008, 2008 happens.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.030
So the rest of 2008 happens.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.270
And we're left at the end of,
let's say 1/1/2009, or we

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.200
could say 12/31/2008.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.190
It doesn't matter.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.885
Give or take a day.

00:06:10.885 --> 00:06:12.210
It's a holiday anyway.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.930
We have a new balance sheet.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.330
But what happened here?

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.760
Over the course of the year,
we earned some money.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.620
And I won't go too complicated
into cash and accrual

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.310
accounting and all
that right now.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.420
We will get into that
eventually.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.750
But I just want to give you the
gist of what's happening.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.550
Is that we made $350,000
in this year.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.410
So our assets will have
increased by $350,000.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.340
It could have increased
by $350,000 of cash.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.310
It might have been increased
by just other people saying

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.160
they owe us $350,000.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.740
Those are accounts
receivables.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.790
I'll make a whole video,
probably a whole series of

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.080
videos, on accounts
receivables.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.790
It's an asset that says, someone
owes me that money.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.930
But any way you think about
it, our assets will have

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.130
increased by this amount
of money over the

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.350
course of the year.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.590
So now, our new balance
sheet at the end of

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.595
2008-- so 2008 happened.

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:11.020
Let me draw 2008.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.240
2008 happens.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.700
At the end of which, our assets
would have grown a

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.860
little bit.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:27.130
Our assets are now
at $10,350,000.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.700
So I'll put this in thousands.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.080
This is $10,350 thousands.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.000
So that's the same thing
as $10.35 million.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.610
And let's see.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.400
All we did was, we paid
the interest on the

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.440
debt in this example.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.680
We just paid interest. And
just so you know, most

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.240
corporate debt actually
works that way.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.725
We'll talk later about
amortization schedules and how

00:07:45.725 --> 00:07:46.650
can you pay down the debt.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.710
But unlike mortgages, a lot of
corporate debt, they just pay

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.930
the interest. So we still have
the same amount of debt.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:56.330
We didn't pay down any of the
principal of the debt.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.930
So we still have $5
million of debt.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.650
And what's left over
for the equity?

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:04.680
Well all of our earnings,
since our

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.100
debt stayed the same.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.000
All of our earnings actually
fall down straight to equity.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.780
So we have $5,350,000
of equity.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.080
So the way I think about it,
and probably the way you

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.600
should think about it, is the
earnings of a company-- in

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.150
this case, we have $350,000
for the year,

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.500
or $0.35 per share.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.200
They essentially tell you what
happened from one balance

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.690
sheet to another.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:38.380
So the amount that this number
grows by, the amount that our

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.240
equity grows by, is earnings.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.655
So this is $350,000
of earnings.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.010
And there's something I might
want to touch on.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.630
Because in the last video I
talked a little bit about

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.400
return on asset, where we just
took the operating profit, and

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.750
we divide that by the assets.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:00.150
We had a 10% return on assets.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.880
And you might say, oh, well why
shouldn't the assets grow

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.760
by that amount?

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.080
And the reason they didn't grow
by that amount is because

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.300
we actually ended up having to
pay taxes on some of that.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.970
Even if we had no debt, we would
still have to pay taxes.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:12.480
This line would have
disappeared.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.370
So sometimes when people talk
about return on asset-- which

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.530
I did in that last video-- it
might be interesting to say,

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.280
is that the pre-tax or the
post-tax return on asset.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:23.650
In this example that I did in
the previous video, it was the

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.140
pre-tax return on asset.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:27.390
But fair enough.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.750
Balance sheets are just
snapshots in time.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:33.290
They're kind of like
your bank account.

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:35.820
How much are you worth
at any one moment?

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.710
And income statements tell you
how do you get from one

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:41.200
balance sheet to the
next balance sheet?

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.190
And we'll learn later the cash
flow statement essentially

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.680
reconciles the income statement
with what happens

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.350
with your actual cash account,
or how things actually move

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:51.440
within the balance sheet.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.470
And we'll do that later on.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.910
But anyway, we started off in
this video talking about oh,

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:57.930
what's cheap?

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.650
What's expensive?

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:02.400
So the question is, how do you
determine that if you can't

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:07.180
just go by the actual dollar
price of-- my baby is crying.

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:09.320
I should probably run to that.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.010
Let me do that right now.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:11.350
I realize I'm already
at 10 minutes.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.250
I'll see you in the
next video.
