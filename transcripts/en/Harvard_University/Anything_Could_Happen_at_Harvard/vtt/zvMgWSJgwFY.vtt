[ Jeremy Narrating ] I was born
the middle child of Asian immigrants.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.967
I’ve always loved playing the drums.

00:00:10.967 --> 00:00:13.367
I was an editor of my high school newspaper.

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:17.800
And I got a summer internship
working for a senator.

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.633
Academics have always been
important to me.

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:25.600
I graduated from Harvard
with a major in economics...

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:27.200
and a minor in sociology.

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:32.333
Harvard’s an amazing place
that let me explore everything...

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.367
and the place where I learned
I could become anything:

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:41.067
an economist, a politician...

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.633
or even a professional basketball player.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.833
My name is Jeremy,
and I’m class of 2010.
