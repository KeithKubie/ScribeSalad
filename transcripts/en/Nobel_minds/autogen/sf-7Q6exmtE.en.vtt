sawdust no goblins you are a member of
 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.619
sawdust no goblins you are a member of
the Nobel Committee in chemistry and we

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:14.629
the Nobel Committee in chemistry and we
 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.900
the Nobel Committee in chemistry and we
have talked to them Nobel laureates just

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910
have talked to them Nobel laureates just
 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.749
have talked to them Nobel laureates just
for half an hour ago just before the

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:19.759
for half an hour ago just before the
 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:23.550
for half an hour ago just before the
press conference what was your reaction

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560
press conference what was your reaction
 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.710
press conference what was your reaction
they were both very happy they were

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720
they were both very happy they were
 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.870
they were both very happy they were
happy and very pleased and I think they

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880
happy and very pleased and I think they
 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.760
happy and very pleased and I think they
share our excitement of this year's

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770
share our excitement of this year's
 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.490
share our excitement of this year's
prize it's a very good price do you

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500
prize it's a very good price do you
 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.270
prize it's a very good price do you
think they expected the prize I think

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280
think they expected the prize I think
 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.160
think they expected the prize I think
they it's there is a very difficult

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170
they it's there is a very difficult
 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.410
they it's there is a very difficult
question because there are so many great

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420
question because there are so many great
 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.020
question because there are so many great
discoveries made every year and during

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030
discoveries made every year and during
 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.720
discoveries made every year and during
many years but I'm pretty sure they know

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730
many years but I'm pretty sure they know
 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.610
many years but I'm pretty sure they know
that this or this is something big and

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620
that this or this is something big and
 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.970
that this or this is something big and
these are very important discoveries

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980
these are very important discoveries
 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.430
these are very important discoveries
brian kobilka was actually a graduate

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440
brian kobilka was actually a graduate
 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.099
brian kobilka was actually a graduate
student of Robert Lefkowitz as I

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109
student of Robert Lefkowitz as I
 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.910
student of Robert Lefkowitz as I
understand for some time ago was it in

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920
understand for some time ago was it in
 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.910
understand for some time ago was it in
the 80s yeah well as far as I know he

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920
the 80s yeah well as far as I know he
 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.310
the 80s yeah well as far as I know he
was a postdoctoral fellow with Robert

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320
was a postdoctoral fellow with Robert
 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.980
was a postdoctoral fellow with Robert
Lefkowitz and it was actually the two of

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990
Lefkowitz and it was actually the two of
 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.020
Lefkowitz and it was actually the two of
them together that cloned the gene and

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030
them together that cloned the gene and
 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.120
them together that cloned the gene and
sequence the beta-adrenergic receptor

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130
sequence the beta-adrenergic receptor
 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.350
sequence the beta-adrenergic receptor
and found the homology we were dobson

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360
and found the homology we were dobson
 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.780
and found the homology we were dobson
they had actually as they mentioned a

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790
they had actually as they mentioned a
 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.690
they had actually as they mentioned a
real Eureka moment in their life yeah it

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700
real Eureka moment in their life yeah it
 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.730
real Eureka moment in their life yeah it
was known at the time that there were

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740
was known at the time that there were
 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.859
was known at the time that there were
several receptors and it was known that

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869
several receptors and it was known that
 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.649
several receptors and it was known that
they all signal on the inside of the

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659
they all signal on the inside of the
 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.350
they all signal on the inside of the
cell using g proteins that has been

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360
cell using g proteins that has been
 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.039
cell using g proteins that has been
awarded before we were nobel prize but

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049
awarded before we were nobel prize but
 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.959
awarded before we were nobel prize but
they didn't know that the receptors or

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969
they didn't know that the receptors or
 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:42.429
they didn't know that the receptors or
that all the different receptors were

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439
that all the different receptors were
 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.370
that all the different receptors were
looking the same and when they got the

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380
looking the same and when they got the
 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.109
looking the same and when they got the
amino acid sequence of the beta

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119
amino acid sequence of the beta
 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.510
amino acid sequence of the beta
adrenergic receptors and so the homology

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520
adrenergic receptors and so the homology
 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.429
adrenergic receptors and so the homology
will be put off him they immediately

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439
will be put off him they immediately
 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.980
will be put off him they immediately
understood that also the receptors in

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990
understood that also the receptors in
 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.630
understood that also the receptors in
the membrane are built in the same way

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640
the membrane are built in the same way
 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.789
the membrane are built in the same way
and function in the same way and that

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799
and function in the same way and that
 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.010
and function in the same way and that
was a definitely real surprise in the

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020
was a definitely real surprise in the
 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.490
was a definitely real surprise in the
wake up moment and even if the receptors

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500
wake up moment and even if the receptors
 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.880
wake up moment and even if the receptors
were known before nobody realized that

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890
were known before nobody realized that
 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.639
were known before nobody realized that
are just the same no and it may be

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649
are just the same no and it may be
 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.650
are just the same no and it may be
difficult to understand that today when

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660
difficult to understand that today when
 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.840
difficult to understand that today when
we are so familiar with structural and

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850
we are so familiar with structural and
 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.320
we are so familiar with structural and
functional

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330
functional
 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.360
functional
homologies but we have to remember this

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370
homologies but we have to remember this
 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.080
homologies but we have to remember this
was baked back in the 1980s and not so

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090
was baked back in the 1980s and not so
 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.510
was baked back in the 1980s and not so
many protein families were discovered

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520
many protein families were discovered
 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.440
many protein families were discovered
this way so this is what was the hard

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450
this way so this is what was the hard
 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.130
this way so this is what was the hard
part of it yet the hard part a day to

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140
part of it yet the hard part a day to
 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.920
part of it yet the hard part a day to
obtain the sequence was a very was the

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930
obtain the sequence was a very was the
 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.140
obtain the sequence was a very was the
result of many years almost a decade's

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150
result of many years almost a decade's
 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.690
result of many years almost a decade's
hard work to extractive receptors and

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700
hard work to extractive receptors and
 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.820
hard work to extractive receptors and
get enough material to be able to

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830
get enough material to be able to
 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.730
get enough material to be able to
sequence it so this is kind of

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740
sequence it so this is kind of
 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.790
sequence it so this is kind of
laboratory world yes many of the

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800
laboratory world yes many of the
 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.830
laboratory world yes many of the
discoveries behind his prize or hard

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840
discoveries behind his prize or hard
 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.020
discoveries behind his prize or hard
laboratory works over many many years

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030
laboratory works over many many years
 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.120
laboratory works over many many years
not giving up even if it takes two or

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130
not giving up even if it takes two or
 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.980
not giving up even if it takes two or
three decades now they both receive the

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990
three decades now they both receive the
 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.910
three decades now they both receive the
Nobel Prize how important is it do you

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920
Nobel Prize how important is it do you
 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.720
Nobel Prize how important is it do you
think to be in a laboratory of a future

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730
think to be in a laboratory of a future
 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.949
think to be in a laboratory of a future
Nobel Prize winner I don't know if

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959
Nobel Prize winner I don't know if
 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.330
Nobel Prize winner I don't know if
that's important because how can you

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340
that's important because how can you
 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.980
that's important because how can you
tell and how can you know I think it's

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990
tell and how can you know I think it's
 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.199
tell and how can you know I think it's
important to be in a good laboratory

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209
important to be in a good laboratory
 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.540
important to be in a good laboratory
where there are great ideas and where

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550
where there are great ideas and where
 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.270
where there are great ideas and where
there is passion for science and where

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280
there is passion for science and where
 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.460
there is passion for science and where
there is persistence not giving up and

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470
there is persistence not giving up and
 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.870
there is persistence not giving up and
if you really want to achieve something

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880
if you really want to achieve something
 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.360
if you really want to achieve something
that you keep on going and don't give up

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370
that you keep on going and don't give up
 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.690
that you keep on going and don't give up
even if it takes two decades so the main

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700
even if it takes two decades so the main
 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.449
even if it takes two decades so the main
characteristics of the Nobel laureate is

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459
characteristics of the Nobel laureate is
 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.910
characteristics of the Nobel laureate is
not to give up even if you don't get

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920
not to give up even if you don't get
 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.340
not to give up even if you don't get
what you want yeah not to give up and

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350
what you want yeah not to give up and
 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.070
what you want yeah not to give up and
also to be very very smart you don't sit

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080
also to be very very smart you don't sit
 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.600
also to be very very smart you don't sit
around wait for 10 years to find a

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610
around wait for 10 years to find a
 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.100
around wait for 10 years to find a
solution they work hard at the bench and

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110
solution they work hard at the bench and
 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.020
solution they work hard at the bench and
they come up with smart solutions so

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030
they come up with smart solutions so
 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.180
they come up with smart solutions so
they gradually move forward and closer

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190
they gradually move forward and closer
 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.600
they gradually move forward and closer
and closer to the goal this is also a

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610
and closer to the goal this is also a
 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.960
and closer to the goal this is also a
little puzzling before because the

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970
little puzzling before because the
 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.590
little puzzling before because the
pharmaceutical drugs existed before the

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600
pharmaceutical drugs existed before the
 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.800
pharmaceutical drugs existed before the
receptors were known to chemists or to

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810
receptors were known to chemists or to
 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.670
receptors were known to chemists or to
medical doctors as beta blockers for

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680
medical doctors as beta blockers for
 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.460
medical doctors as beta blockers for
example they have been around for much

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470
example they have been around for much
 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.710
example they have been around for much
longer time than the science of the

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720
longer time than the science of the
 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.260
longer time than the science of the
receptors has been developed
