00:00:00.391 --> 00:00:05.731
 We would like to express the face of the entire rectangle below as a triple. 

00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:08.169
 Here we have a rectangle divided by 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:10.979
 these three smaller rectangles. 

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:12.983
 We see that for each of these three rectangles 

00:00:12.983 --> 00:00:15.167
 the height is 4 units, 

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:17.260
 and the width is expressed by x, 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.360
 or at least the first two widths contain x. 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.233
 The last rectangle has a width of 2. 

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.727
 What is the face of the entire rectangle? 

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:29.550
 I recommend that you pause the video and think about it. 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.802
 What is the face of this blue rectangle? 

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:33.400
 It looks like a square, but let's call it a rectangle, 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.920
 since all squares are rectangles. 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.255
 The face is the height in width. 

00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:41.540
 The face here is the height, which is 4, 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.987
 on the width x2. 

00:00:46.987 --> 00:00:51.143
 And to this we want to add the face of this rectangle, 

00:00:51.143 --> 00:00:54.394
 I guess we can say salmon-colored, 

00:00:54.394 --> 00:00:58.283
 as it is the height 4 on the width 3x. 

00:00:58.283 --> 00:01:02.320
 We can say 4 by 3x, 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.457
 but how much is 4 by 3x? 

00:01:05.457 --> 00:01:07.570
 Well this is 12x. 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.980
 We have 3x four times, 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.180
 so it's 12x. 

00:01:12.191 --> 00:01:15.279
 12x is the face of this salmon-colored rectangle. 

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:17.949
 Finally, the face of this green rectangle, 

00:01:17.949 --> 00:01:19.318
 we can actually find it right, 

00:01:19.318 --> 00:01:21.455
 because we should not express it through a variable. 

00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:24.265
 Its height is 4 and its width is 2, 

00:01:24.265 --> 00:01:28.020
 so the face will be 4 by 2 or 8. 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.300
 And we're ready.
