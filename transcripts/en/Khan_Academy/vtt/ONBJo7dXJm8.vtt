00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.680
Let's see if we can develop some
intuition as to why the

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.640
equilibrium constant equation
looks the way it does.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.420
Just as review, this is it:
equilibrium constant.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.920
It would be the concentration
of our molecule Y raised to

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.380
its coefficient power or, if
we're thinking in moles,

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.330
raised to the number of moles.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.580
If we think of these as kind
of the mole ratios, or the

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.600
molar ratios-- or we could
just view them as the

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.250
molecular ratios, either way--
times the concentration of our

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.320
molecule Z.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.052
Now, we're not doing
some calculus here.

00:00:35.052 --> 00:00:39.615
d is just the number of moles we
need of Z for every c moles

00:00:39.615 --> 00:00:41.940
of Y, b moles of X,
and a moles of V.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.900
So it's Z to the d power divided
by the concentration

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.760
of V to the a power and
X to the b power.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.760
So it's a nice, little, clean
equation, but why does

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.930
it look this way?

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.670
And I actually made a video
earlier today where I started

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.390
exploring this with
natural logs.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.300
And I think I got someplace,
but that one

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.170
started to break down.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.910
And I think I've come up with a
much simpler reason why this

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:08.420
looks this way.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.450
So I've deleted that video, and
I think I've come up with

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.250
a much more intuitive one that
explains more of why this

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.870
works and actually some of the
other things we're going to

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.490
learn about the equilibrium
constants in future videos.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.590
So what makes a reaction
happen?

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.370
Or what does equilibrium mean?

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.540
It means the rate at which the
forward reaction is happening.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:39.670
So that means that the rate of
this happening, of V plus X

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.540
turning into Y plus Z--
I can't forget the

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.380
coefficients-- is going to be
equal to the reverse reaction,

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.000
is equal to the rate of
the reverse reaction.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.860
So our c moles of Y plus d moles
of Z turning and going

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.140
the other way, turning
into the V and the X

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.830
with certain ratios.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.210
It doesn't mean necessarily that
the concentrations are

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.220
the same, because we could
have one where we end up

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.140
heavily favoring the
forward reaction.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.800
Where we end up with much higher
concentrations of Y and

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.170
Z, or we might heavily favor the
backwards reactions where

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.900
we have more V and X.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.680
But when we're in equilibrium,
we're saying that our

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.810
concentrations have reached a
stability point, which implies

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.720
that the rate of going in this
direction is equal to the rate

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.570
going into that direction.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.530
So let's just think a little
bit about what drives these

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.530
rates, what drives these
rates of reactions.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.070
In order for this forward
reaction to happen that I drew

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.240
in purple, what needs
to happen?

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.740
We have to have a molecules
of V roughly.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.470
And let's say in any volume of
space, we have to have some V

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.780
molecules, and preferably a
V molecules, being in the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.030
vicinity of b X molecules.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.700
So there's got to be b of these
X molecules, and they

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.350
have to be in the right
configuration and in the right

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.130
place and kind of close
enough in order for

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.560
the reaction to happen.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.160
So the reaction is really going
to be driven by, if you

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.190
think about it, the probability
of finding a V

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.300
molecules and b molecules all
within close enough confines

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.450
that they can actually react.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.470
So you could say that the rate
is going to be driven by--

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.550
maybe it's going to
be proportional.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.060
Let's say it's just equal to--
let's say some constant that

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.820
takes into account things like
temperature and how the

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.310
molecules are actually
configured.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.480
Because it's not dependent
just on them being there.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.600
You have to have worry about
their kinetic energies.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.800
You have to worry about their
shape, because some shapes are

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.120
going to be more conducive
to reaction than others.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.310
So let's just let that be taken
into account with a K.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.870
And we're talking about the
forward reaction, right?

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.810
So in order for the forward
reaction to happen, let's call

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.250
that K plus for the
forward reaction.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.960
We have to have a molecules of
V there and b molecules of X.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.410
So what's the probability of
having a molecules of X?

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.870
Or what's a rough approximation
of the

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.660
probability?

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.910
Well, the concentration.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.190
Let's think about
this a second.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.250
When we write the concentration
of the molecule

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.010
V, which I think when I did this
was the blue one right

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.230
here, what is that given in?

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.370
That is given in moles
per liter.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.540
Moles is just a number, so this
tells us, look, in any

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.560
given volume, roughly how
many of the molecules do

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.670
you expect to find?

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.570
That's what concentration is.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.060
So if I wanted to figure out the
probability of finding a

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.240
of these molecules, because
that's how many I need, I need

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.970
to multiply this by
itself a times,

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:51.860
because I need a of them.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.860
The probability of having just
one molecule in just some

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.260
small fraction, you would just
use the concentration once.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.400
But you're going to use it a
times, because you want a of

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.600
those molecules there, right?

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.860
You could look at it like what's
the probability of

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.810
having five heads?

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.190
Well you would multiply
the probability of

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.180
one head five times.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.220
So the forward reaction
probability is going to be the

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.740
concentration of V to the a
power, and, of course, that's

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.610
not enough to have the
reaction happen.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:27.160
You also need to have b of
the X molecules there.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.530
So you have the concentration
of X to the b power.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.690
And I want to make sure
you understand this.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.000
My claim is that this is
approximation-- or actually

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.690
it's a pretty good way of
calculating-- the probability.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.420
So let me write it this way.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.770
The rate is equal to some
constant that takes into

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.310
account the temperature and the
molecular configurations

00:05:53.310 --> 00:06:06.680
times the probability of having
a V molecules and b X

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.690
molecules in a sufficiently
small area

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.320
all at the same time.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.280
And the best way to approximate
that is with their

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.970
concentration.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.620
Obviously, the higher the
concentration, the higher the

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.800
moles per liter, the more likely
you're going to find

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.140
that many of molecules in kind
of that little small space

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.880
that you care about, and
the temperature and the

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.740
configuration are going
to matter more.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.700
But if you use the concentration
as the

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.000
probability of a-- let
me switch colors.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:48.710
If the probability of having a V
molecule in some volume-- if

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.800
we assume that the solution
is homogeneous, that the V

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.720
molecules are roughly evenly
distributed, it's going to

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.210
be-- this isn't even
an approximation.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.540
It's going to be the
concentration of the V

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:05.650
molecules times the volume under
which we care about.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:12.890
If we want the probability of
a, where a is a number, it

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:24.390
could be five V molecules, a V's
in some volume, it's the

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.545
probability of finding
this a times.

00:07:27.545 --> 00:07:30.430
So it's going to be equal to--
and this is just from the

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.790
probability concepts that
we learned in the whole

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:36.250
probability playlist.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:39.520
So if you want to have five
heads in a row, it's 1/2 to

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.170
the fifth power.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:44.970
If you want to have V molecules
there, five of them

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:47.750
at the same time in some volume,
or a of them, it's

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.020
going to be V to the a power
times the volume.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:57.600
If you also care about the
probability so you want all of

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:07.052
that, so a V's and b X's in some
volume, then you're going

00:08:07.052 --> 00:08:08.380
to have to multiply all
of them together.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.910
So it's going to be equal to the
concentration of V to the

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:15.720
a power times the concentration
of X to the b

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.800
power times the volume.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.900
So the probability of finding
the right number of V

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.480
particles and X particles in the
right place in some volume

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.870
is going to be proportional
to exactly this.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.780
And we're saying that the
reaction rate, the forward

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:37.360
reaction rate, is also
proportional to this thing.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.020
So that's where we get the
forward reaction rate.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.000
So the rate forward is equal to
the concentration of our V

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.060
molecules to the a power times
the concentration of our X

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.160
molecules to the b power.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.990
Now, if we want to find the
reverse rate, so this is the

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.750
rate forward.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:03.580
If we want to find the rate of
the reverse reaction, let's

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.840
say that that's equal to some
other constant-- let's call

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:10.440
that K-minus-- the same
exact logic holds.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.140
We're just going in this
direction now.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.250
If we look at our original
one, we're

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.150
going in that direction.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.060
So for this reaction, we
do the same thing.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.620
We literally just do different
letters, so the reverse

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:25.890
reaction is just going to be
the concentration of the Y

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.700
molecule to the c power, because
we need c of them

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:32.580
there roughly at the same time,
times the concentration

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.510
of the Z molecule
to the d power.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.270
Now, just at the beginning of
the video, we said that

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.740
equilibrium is when these
rates equal each other.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.750
I wrote it down right here.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.230
So if the reverse rate is equal
to some constant times

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:49.830
this, and the forward rate is
equal to some constant times

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.470
that, then we reach equilibrium
when these two are

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:53.490
equal to each other.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:55.060
Let me clear up some
space here.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.320
Let me clear this up, too.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.840
So when are they going to
be equal to each other?

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.930
When the forward rate-- the
forward rate is this.

00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:08.390
That's our forward constant,
which took into account a

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:11.450
whole bunch of temperature and
molecular structure and all of

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:14.590
that-- times the concentration
of our V

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.610
molecule to the a power.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.200
You can kind of view that as
what's the probability of

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.490
finding in a certain volume--
and that certain volume can be

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.360
factored into that K factor
as well-- but what's the

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.960
probability of finding
V things, a V

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.250
molecules in some volume.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:34.330
And it's the concentration
of V to the a power times

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:36.690
concentration of X to the V
power-- that's the forward

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.650
reaction-- and that has to equal
the reverse reactions.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:45.000
So K-minus times the
concentration of Y to the c

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.320
power times the concentration
of Z to the d power.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:56.050
Now, if we divide both sides
by-- let me erase more space.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.520
Nope, not with that.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.710
All right.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:03.900
So let's divide both sides by
K-minus and both sides by

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:14.790
this, so you get K-plus over
K-minus is equal to that, is

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:21.310
equal to Y to the c
times Z to the d.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:28.960
All of that over that-- V to the
a times the concentration

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.310
of X to the V.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.690
Let me put this in magenta just
so you know that this was

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.090
this K-minus right here.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.580
And then, these are just two
arbitrary constants, so we

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.650
could just replace them
and call them

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:41.190
the equilibrium constant.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.840
And we're there where
we need to be.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.590
We're at the formula for the
equilibrium constant.

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:50.240
Now, I know this was really hand
wavy, but I want you to

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.620
at least get the sense that this
doesn't come from out of

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.900
the blue, and there is-- at
least I think there is--

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.020
there's an intuition here.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:01.510
These are really calculating the
probabilities of finding--

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.120
this is the forward reaction
rate probabilities

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.580
proportional to this.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.640
Because the more V concentration
you have, the

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.390
more likely you're
able to find it.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:14.360
Although if you need more of
those particles around, you're

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.990
going to have to multiply that
concentration by each other,

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.070
because the probability's
going to get lower.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.060
Because you need more of them
together in order for the

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:21.880
reaction to happen.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.590
Same thing for everything
there.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:27.460
But all this is derived from is
that the forward reaction

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.770
should be equal to
some constant

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.900
times the reverse reaction.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.890
Or actually, their rates should
be equal, but then when

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:35.530
you actually calculate the
probability, you'll have a

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:36.550
constant in there.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.630
Anyway, hopefully, I didn't
confuse you, but I just wanted

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.520
to give you that this isn't
just some random equation.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.360
It really does, I think, come
from the reality that the

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.510
higher the concentration you
have, the more the probability

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.050
you have of the actual
molecules

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:52.100
bumping into each other.
