00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.380
- [Instructor] What we have here

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.160
are two different visualizations
of a country's output

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.210
at different points in time.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.070
You might recognize here on the left

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.970
we have our production possibilities
curve for this country.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.530
And it's a very simple country

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.630
that either produces forks and/or spoons.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.420
So if it could produce
all forks efficiently

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.670
it would be right here, that many forks.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.030
If it could produce all spoons efficiently

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.000
it would be right here.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.900
And all the combinations
of forks and spoons

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.440
that it would produce
efficiently at its potential,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.540
well that's what defines

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.980
this production possibilities curve.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.120
On the right here we have this country's

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.830
real GDP versus time.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.130
And so you could view
their real GDP as some way

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.130
of computing their aggregate
production of spoons and forks.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.460
Now we know that real economies

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.130
do a lot more than just produce two goods.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.890
They produce millions
of goods and services,

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.660
but then you would need a graph

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.280
that would have millions of dimensions

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.780
which is very hard for most
of our brains to understand.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.690
But what we have here is,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.810
thinking about three different scenarios

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.227
at three different times for this country.

00:01:07.227 --> 00:01:10.150
Now we're gonna connect the
dots between the visualization

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.140
on the left, the production
possibilities curve,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.490
and the visualization on the right.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.120
And we're also gonna think
about other economic indicators

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.990
other than real GDP and
how those might play out.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.760
So let's start off at time
T sub one right over here.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.410
From what we know of
production possibility curves,

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.380
what is going on in the economy?

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.440
Pause this video and
try to think about that.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.550
Well we know that if you're

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.550
on your production possibilities curve,

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.770
you're operating at your potential.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.440
But here we have a situation

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.940
where we are operating
beyond our potential.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.470
This is not a sustainable situation.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.610
This is a situation where

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.370
some people would argue
the economy is overheating.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.110
This is like if on your personal life

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.670
if you're pulling all nighters
in order to study for a test,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.340
that is not a sustainable situation.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.240
But at T sub one when you're
operating above your potential,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.850
it is associated with low unemployment

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.160
and many would argue
unsustainably low unemployment.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.480
And because there's so
much demand for labor,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.380
There's so much demand for utilization

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.350
of other resources that that
could increase price pressure.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.563
So it's also associated
with higher inflation.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.050
Now what would time T sub one,

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.810
what could that be on this graph here?

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:32.900
Well I already depicted it.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.900
It could be this point right over here,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.190
where our real GDP is above
this horizontal red line

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.100
which you could view as our potential GDP,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.010
our full employment GDP,
our full employment output.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.830
And so this shows that we
have a positive output gap

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.560
just as when we're above or beyond our PPC

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.380
that is also a positive output gap.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.220
Now sometimes we associate
this positive output gap

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.290
being performing beyond the potential

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.980
as being associated with an
expansion versus a recession.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.340
And it is indeed the
case that this T sub one

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.410
is happening during an expansion.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.600
An expansion is a situation
where the GDP is growing.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.640
So this is an expansion here.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.766
And then if we go from the
next trough to the next peak,

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:21.840
this is an expansion here.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.400
And the opposite of an
expansion is a recession,

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.960
so this is a recession where we're going

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.850
from a peak to a trough.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.130
And if we go from the next
peak to the next trough

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.880
that also would be a recession.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.000
So this positive output gap

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.240
is happening during an expansion.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.400
But you could have a situation
where you're right here

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.430
where you have a positive output gap,

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.070
where you're operating
beyond your potential,

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.080
but the economy has started to shrink.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.760
So it's not always the case.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.020
Even though positive
output gaps get associated

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.110
with expansions, it's not
always during an expansion.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.250
But anyway, let's move forward in time.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.480
Let's say for various reasons
our economy slows down a bit

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.670
and we go to time T sub two.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.750
Now we are actually
operating at potential.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.560
We are at our productions
possibility curve.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.660
And so at what point could
that be on this graph?

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.340
Well we have it depicted
right here at time T sub two.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.610
The country is operating
exactly at its potential.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.040
The country is operating
efficiently in a sustainable way.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.070
And then we go to time T sub three.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.930
So at time T sub three it's clear

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.610
that we have a negative output gap

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.410
and you can see it over here as well.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.720
We have a negative output gap.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.830
And if you think about
the economic indicators

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.230
other than real GDP
what will they be doing?

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.170
This is a situation where an economy

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.810
is operating below full employment

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.100
where the unemployment
rate could be elevated,

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.110
or it's typically elevated

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.040
when you have this negative output gap.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.390
And because both the labor
and oftentimes other resources

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.040
aren't being fully utilized,

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.800
there might not be a
lot of price pressure.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.190
So in this situation
inflation would be lower.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.090
And in extreme cases you could
even have negative inflation,

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.153
which we would call deflation.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.440
Now associated with all of these ideas

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.430
is the idea of economic growth.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.000
So in everyday language when people talk

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.760
about economic growth,

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.660
they're usually talking about expansions.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.140
They're talking about situations
where real GDP is growing.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.470
But economists, when they talk

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.880
about economic growth do not mean that.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.970
To an economist, economic growth

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.960
is when the potential
of an economy increases.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.500
And we know that the only
way that the potential

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.040
of an economy increases
is if they all of a sudden

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.780
have more factors of
production, better resources,

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.340
better technology, the
population has increased.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.870
So economic growth would be associated

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.060
with pushing out the actual PPC.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.420
So this would, if you saw
now they had more technology

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.740
or more people now,

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.050
so now that would push out the PBC.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.950
And economic growth, for
example, if this red line,

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.820
which is the country's potential,

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.200
were to increase like this,
that would be economic growth.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.060
The actual real GDP at any given time

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.370
would likely cycle around that.
