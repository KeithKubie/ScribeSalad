00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
It’s 2015, I always thought the world look
like the jetsons right now with flying cars

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.069
and clean energy?

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.170
While we’re still waiting on a flying car,
clean energy, especially solar, has come a

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.799
long away.

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.359
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.810
We’ve talked about solar power here on DNews
before a lot. To see how solar power works

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.210
check out this episode right here. But just
a quick recap, solar panels are made of photovoltaic

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.200
cells. These cells convert sunlight into energy
by using photons from the sun to knock loose

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.880
electrons. These cells are typically made
up of a silicon wafer sandwich. One wafer

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.059
is positively charged, the other negative,
this creates an electric field. Phosphorus

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.460
is added to top the layer to increase the
amount of electrons there and boron makes

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.940
the bottom more positive. Photons from the
sun knock an electron out of that electrical

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.890
field and then the cell has some other parts
that use that electron as energy.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.960
That’s the basics. Solar panels aren’t
a new technology, they’ve been around for

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.510
over a hundred years. The first “solar cell”
was patented in 1888. But since then, it’s

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.750
kind of been slow going. Almost 90 years later
RCA Laboratories come out with the silicon

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.040
version of a solar cell… but it only had
an efficiency of 1.1% Basically that means

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.060
for the amount of energy going into a solar
cell from the sun, only 1.1% of that is converted

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.759
into usable electricity.

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.990
And research into solar technology is like
I said, slow going. One researcher said gains

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.790
of 0.2 percent are the norm and gains of 1
percent are seen as significant breakthroughs.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.780
Since the 70s efficiency has only increased
from 1.1% to around 20% for most conventional

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.590
models. In comparison traditional forms of
electricity from fossil fuels are only at

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.649
about 40% efficient.

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.880
But even the US Government wants to do better.
Over a decade ago the DARPA initiative put

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.320
out a request for 50% efficiency in solar
panels. So far, research has come close. In

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.829
2007 researchers from the University of Delaware
announced they created a cell with 42.8 percent

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.320
efficiency up from 40%, which in this field
was a huge deal. Their solar panel gained

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.830
in efficiency by separating sunlight into
three different energy bins of high, medium

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.819
and low, and directs them onto cells of various
light-sensitive materials to cover the solar

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.750
spectrum. And in late 2014 Australian researchers
announce a 40% efficient panel in the journal

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.050
Progress in Photovoltaics. It boosted efficiency
by including another filter to capture more

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.620
bandwidths of light that are usually wasted
by other models. But it’s still not the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.580
typical model you’d see on homes. Most conventional
panels only reach an efficiency of about 20%.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.690
But maybe the future doesn’t even lie with
silicon. Research into a different material

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.810
called perovskite has taken off over the past
few years. Perovskite is a naturally occurring

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.459
mineral with a crystalline structure made
out of calcium and titanium. But it’s really

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.209
easy to synthesize in a lab out of a organic-inorganic
hybrid of lead or tin halide that's mixed

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.500
with organic groups like methylammonium.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.620
The crystalline structure makes it especially
good for solar applications. But one of the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.159
most exciting things about this new type of
solar cell is how far it’s come in such

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.640
a short time. Perovskite research seems to
be moving at very brisk pace compared to silicon.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:19.640
In only six years it jumped from 3.8% efficiency
in 2009 to a certified 20.1% in 2015, which

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.940
is on par with conventional silicon panels.
So maybe they could reach DARPA’s goal in

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.870
no time. One materials scientist I spoke with,
Daniel Dryden said “their insane rate of

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.540
improvement is definitely worth paying attention
to as more than just the newest fad.”.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.549
While perovskite panels aren’t on the market
yet, some start ups promise they’ll have

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.110
some ready to go by 2017. So it’s definitely
something to keep an eye on.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.310
One of the other great features of perovskite
that gets researchers excited is how cheap

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.950
it is to make. Which could benefit those in
rural areas without access to traditional

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:51.959
electricity.

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.310
Be sure to check out our other episode on
Seeker Stories, where we discovered how constant

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:17.220
blackouts and a lack of electricity in general
impacts daily life in Tanzania.
