00:00:06.777 --> 00:00:07.360
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.010
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.740
We've been talking
in lecture about

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.840
various different applications
of definite integrals.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.450
And one of them has been that
we can use definite integrals

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.426
to find areas of regions
that previously we

00:00:20.426 --> 00:00:21.550
wouldn't have been able to.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.020
So, one simple
example of that is

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.120
that we can use a
definite integral

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.850
to find the area of a region
bounded between two curves.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.320
So I have an example of
such a question right here.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.000
So the question is to compute
the area of the region that's

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.780
bounded between the curves
y equals x cubed and y

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.930
equals 3x minus 2.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.140
So one thing you'll notice
is I haven't given you

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.940
endpoints for this region.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.880
So I've just given you
the bound and curves.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.755
So one thing you're
going to have to do right

00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:51.580
at the beginning is to figure
out what this looks like

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.040
and what region you're going
to be integrating over.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.330
What interval you're going
to be integrating over.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.556
So, this is a kind
of tricky one.

00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:01.430
Why don't you pause the
video, think about it

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.810
for a few minutes, try
and work it out yourself,

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.393
and you can come back and we can
try and work it out together.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.250
All right, welcome back.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.060
So hopefully you've
had some luck

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.880
figuring out what this
situation looks like

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.870
and then computing the integral.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.280
So let's talk about
it for a minute.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.020
So we have these two curves.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.970
And so somewhere-- I'm asking
about the region bounded

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.130
by them-- so what I'm
telling you is somewhere

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.290
these curves intercept and they
surround some bounded region.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.860
And so I'm asking for what
the area of that region is.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.990
So in order to
figure that out, we

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.700
should figure out where
these curves intercept.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.780
So to find the,
in other words, we

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.300
need to find the endpoints of
the interval over which we're

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.150
going to integrate.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.490
So in order to that,
we have to solve

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.235
for where we have the
intersection between y equals x

00:02:00.235 --> 00:02:02.430
cubed and y equals 3x minus 2.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.860
So we have to
solve the equation.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:14.990
So we need to solve the equation
x cubed equals 3x minus 2.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.230
Or x cubed minus
3x plus 2 equals 0.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.900
So this a polynomial equation.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.150
It's not quadratic, right?

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.610
It's a cubic equation.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.580
So that means it's hard
to solve in general.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.970
Luckily in this case,
it's-- there are some--

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.550
there's a root we can
recognize fairly easily.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.740
Which is, it's
pretty-- you know,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.460
one thing you can always do is
check small positive integers

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.200
or use the rational
root theorem,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.720
if you remember that
from high school math.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.460
So in this case, if
you check x equals 1,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.240
it's fairly easy to
see that x equals

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.230
1 is a root of this equation.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.710
So in other words, we can
factor the left-hand side.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.870
We can divide out a
factor of x minus 1.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.410
OK, and so now we have
to do long division

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.070
or synthetic division, whatever
kind of division you want,

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.670
to divide through here.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:14.830
So we get x squared minus--
so we've got a-- nope, I lied.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.570
Plus x minus 2 after you divide.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.941
How's that look?

00:03:22.941 --> 00:03:23.982
We can just double check.

00:03:23.982 --> 00:03:28.180
You know, we get an x cubed
minus x squared plus x squared

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.580
minus 2x minus x plus 2.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:32.302
OK.

00:03:32.302 --> 00:03:33.760
So that adds up to
the right thing.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.650
So we either have
that 1 is a root

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.050
or that x squared you
know, rather for the places

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.140
where these intersect,
we have either x equals 1

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.540
or x squared plus
x minus 2 equals 0.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.490
And now here you can,
you know, again factor

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.820
or use the quadratic
equation or what have you.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.245
And you can see so we have that
this actually fully factors

00:03:58.245 --> 00:04:03.520
as x minus 1 squared
times x plus 2 equals 0.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:10.960
Which means that we
have intersections

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.440
when either x minus 1 is
0 or when x plus 2 is 0.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:23.446
So intersections at x equals
1 and x equals minus 2.

00:04:23.446 --> 00:04:25.650
All right.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.404
So you can take that information
and you can, you know,

00:04:28.404 --> 00:04:30.820
put it together and you can
make a nice picture like this.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.945
Or, I suppose, you could
have made the nice picture

00:04:32.945 --> 00:04:34.990
before you had that information.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.910
And so we see that we've got
this line, y equals 3x minus 2

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:39.790
here.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.907
And we have the curve
y equals x cubed.

00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:43.490
And they have two
intersection points.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.070
They intersect once down
at x equals minus 2,

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.280
y equals minus 8.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.790
And they intersect again
up at the point (1, 1).

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.280
And they're actually
tangent there.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.300
So x cubed, the curve y equals
x cubed stays above the line

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.230
at this point.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.620
So one way you can read
that off is here you

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.513
had a double root at
minus 1, if you like.

00:05:03.513 --> 00:05:12.670
But, OK, so then, the region in
question is this region here.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.410
So it's a region bounded
between those two curves

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.290
that we're trying to
compute the area of.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.219
So now that we
have the endpoints

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:22.885
this isn't such a
tricky problem at all.

00:05:22.885 --> 00:05:23.385
Right?

00:05:23.385 --> 00:05:25.900
so we've got the endpoints
and we know-- now

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.997
that we've drawn this picture--
we know which curve is on top

00:05:28.997 --> 00:05:30.205
and which curve is on bottom.

00:05:30.205 --> 00:05:31.070
Right?

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.090
So the height, when we imagine
cutting this region into lots

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.370
of little rectangles or
approximate rectangles,

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.450
the height is going to be
x cubed minus 3x minus 2.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.100
Minus the quantity 3x minus 2.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.610
Right?

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.860
The x cubed is on top and
3x minus 2 is on the bottom.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.820
So the area is equal
to the integral.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.970
OK, and now we know where we
have to integrate from and to.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.200
So we're integrating from
x equals minus 2 to 1

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.030
to get this whole region of
x cubed minus the quantity

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.712
3x minus 2 dx.

00:06:10.712 --> 00:06:12.090
OK?

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.610
Because the y equals x
cubed is the top curve.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.430
And y equals 3x minus
2 is the bottom curve.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.555
So this is the height of those
rectangles, which is positive.

00:06:21.555 --> 00:06:26.610
OK, and so now, OK, well now
this is pretty straightforward.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.160
We're integrating a
polynomial at this point.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.530
So this is the integral.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.950
Well, OK, so
integrating x cubed,

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.760
that gives me x to
the fourth over 4.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:44.540
Integrating minus 3x gives
me minus 3x squared over 2.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.660
And integrating plus
2 gives me plus 2x.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.030
Between x equals minus 2 and 1.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.350
So OK, so now I just
do this difference.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:04.790
So this is equal to 1/4
minus 3/2 plus 2 minus-- OK,

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:09.090
now I put in minus 2 I get 2
to the fourth-- sorry-- minus 2

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.970
to the fourth is 16, over
4, so that's minus 4.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:19.020
OK, minus 3 times 4 over 2 is 6.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:24.359
And then plus 2 times
minus 2 is minus 4 again.

00:07:24.359 --> 00:07:26.150
OK, and now we've just
got some arithmetic.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.600
So this all becomes a plus 6.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.700
And I have to add
everything together.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.090
So that's something like, well
I've got a denominator of 4,

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.390
so it's, yeah.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.750
All right, so there's a
secret I should tell you.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.760
Which is that mathematicians
are not actually very

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.540
good at arithmetic, usually.

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:55.520
So this is minus 6/4
plus 2 plus 6, so plus 8.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:03.160
So this is 8 minus 5/4,
which is 6 and 3/4.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.150
OK, that's 6 plus 3/4.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:07.800
So 6 and 3/4.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.460
This was just arithmetic.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.420
Here was the calculus part.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:15.650
And, in fact, you know, one
feature of a problem like this

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.390
is that you have a fair
amount of work sometimes

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:21.322
to see the picture of
what you're working with.

00:08:21.322 --> 00:08:23.530
Then the integration here
was pretty straightforward.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:24.630
Right?

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:26.820
This was a fairly easy
integral to compute.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.850
If you're, say, better at
fraction arithmetic than I am,

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.050
at least.

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.250
So, there you go.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.150
So, we had this region.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.884
So we found, actually the
endpoints of the interval.

00:08:39.884 --> 00:08:42.550
We found which was the top curve
and which was the bottom curve.

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:44.350
And that led us right
down this integral.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:45.725
And then that
integral was fairly

00:08:45.725 --> 00:08:48.080
easy to compute
from that point out.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.710
And then we ended up with
this as our final area.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.099
So I'll end there.
