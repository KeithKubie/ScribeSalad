00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.500
SPEAKER: We are super excited to
bring Trisha Ocona Francis back

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.600
to Google to speak
with you guys.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.010
She may be a familiar
face to some of you.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.370
She actually came and did
a really, really great talk

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.180
at Google last year,
which was so popular

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.880
and got so many rave reviews
that we had to have her back.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.160
So we're super excited to
have her back again today.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.930
For some of you guys
that may not yet

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.444
be familiar with Trisha,
I'll tell you guys

00:00:25.444 --> 00:00:26.610
just a little bit about her.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.580
So she is the CEO of
realestateOCONA LLC.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.070
And she's super active
in her community.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.900
She's quickly become
a o-to resource

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.750
that many community
members seek out

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.450
when looking for advice
about real estate

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.270
because she has such
great expertise.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.360
She's won and been recognized
by top awards such as NY1 news

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.760
NYer of the Week, 2012
Extraordinary Women

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.540
of Brooklyn, and 2014
Rising Star of Brooklyn.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.480
Also, outside the
walls of her own firm,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.300
she's also super active
and wears many hats.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.360
Trisha also sits on the board
of the New York State Department

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.349
of Real Estate.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.830
She's an instructor at Medgar
Evers College, a real estate

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.060
blogger for the Huffington
Post business section,

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.020
and she's appeared on top
radio and news publications,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.240
including Hot 97 Street Soldiers
with Lisa Evers and ABC7's Here

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.920
and Now with Sandra Bookman.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.120
So we're super excited
to have her here.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.234
She's going to share some
stuff that she prepared

00:01:25.234 --> 00:01:26.400
to talk with you guys about.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.820
We're going to try to
leave about 10 minutes

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.940
at the end for questions.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.210
So you guys feel free to
think through anything

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.418
that you're going to ask her.

00:01:33.418 --> 00:01:35.260
And we can leave time
for that at the end.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.250
And without further ado,
I'll pass it on to Trisha.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.916
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS:
Thank you so much.

00:01:38.916 --> 00:01:42.890
Thank you to you and
[INAUDIBLE] Davidson,

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.280
Terrence Copney for putting
this together for me.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.360
I really appreciate it.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.044
Thank you for having me back.

00:01:50.044 --> 00:01:53.590
I know last time we came and
we spoke about real estate

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.750
and how important it is.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.420
And now I'm here to
talk about foreclosures.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.910
Many of you may
not know, but there

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.860
are 30,000 people facing
foreclosure, unfortunately,

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.280
in New York City.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.220
And that's 30,000
people who possibly

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.720
can be losing their home.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.400
But when there's negative,
there's also positive.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.660
How can we take advantage of
those people who have to sell,

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.550
those people who are
going into the auctions.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.434
How can we purchase those
homes at great prices.

00:02:27.434 --> 00:02:29.100
And that's what I'm
here to talk about--

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.830
how can we get into
investment, how

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.100
do you get into
foreclosure investment

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.270
and avoid foreclosure yourself,
or get that really good deal.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.660
That's a question that
I'm asked so often.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.177
And that's what I'm
here to help you with.

00:02:43.177 --> 00:02:44.760
Now, I know we already
went into this.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.150
So I'm not going to
go further into it.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.900
But I just wanted
to let you know

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.940
that, in addition to teaching
real estate at Medger Evers

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.455
College, I do have my own
real estate brokerage firm.

00:02:56.455 --> 00:03:00.390
I'm located downtown
Brooklyn in Cadman Plaza.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.760
I'm actually on the 12th floor.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.020
Hillary Clinton campaign's
office is on the 11th floor.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.810
And just because I'm in
Brooklyn doesn't mean

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.740
I do Brooklyn, just Brooklyn.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.980
I also do New Jersey.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.850
I do a whole lot of
the Tri-State area.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.980
And I sit on the New York
State Real Estate Board

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.820
where I'm appointed by the
governor and the speaker.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.900
And I'm one of the five
brokers in the whole state

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.990
of New York that
helps make the rules

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.870
and regulations that real
estate agents have to follow.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.060
So between sitting on this
board where we meet four times

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.617
a year in Albany to discuss
the rules and teaching,

00:03:35.617 --> 00:03:37.700
there's a lot of insight
that I have that I'm here

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.220
to share it with you.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.710
Now, why do I do this?

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.940
I put my information
out there because I

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.720
know 30,000 people in
foreclosure, we want to invest.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.347
We have money.

00:03:49.347 --> 00:03:50.930
Real estate is
something that's always

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.420
been around which we'll go to.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.210
How do I invest in real estate
and get most for my money

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.380
and actually come
into the game of it?

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.500
So I just enjoy helping people
achieve their real estate

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.200
goals.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.940
That's basically what it is.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.300
Many of you want to
get into it and want

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.590
to know, how do I get started,
where do I put my money.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.700
You have to understand that real
estate is the number one asset.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.390
Everybody wants to get into it.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.274
And everything is real estate.

00:04:20.274 --> 00:04:21.940
That's the first part
I want to get into

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.350
is for you to look
at it and say, wow,

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.980
every single thing
is real estate.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.080
This building that we are in
is a piece of real estate.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.540
Right?

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.510
The parking lot, the school
building, courthouses,

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.780
houses that you live
in, it's real estate.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.380
And real estate has
always been around.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.730
So sometimes you put
money-- I have money

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.310
in the stock market as well.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.990
But real estate is something
that has always been around

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.480
and will always be around.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.910
So how do we jump in?

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.390
How do we be a part of it?

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.850
How do we take
part of the action,

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.660
especially with so many
foreclosures happening?

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.110
If you look at this,
in the year 2020,

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.490
which product do you
think will hold its value

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.760
or appreciate for somebody
who buys it today?

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:08.492
Is it a car?

00:05:08.492 --> 00:05:09.200
Is it a building?

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.580
Or is it sneakers?

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.100
Absolutely the building.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.362
So we invest into the building.

00:05:16.362 --> 00:05:19.480
On my block where
I live in Brooklyn,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.820
there are people who bought
their home for $30,000.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.960
We can buy homes
with $30,000 cash.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.780
And now, these buildings
are going for over $400,000,

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.170
sometimes half a million dollars
from buying it for $30,000.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.310
So why aren't we
jumping into this?

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.572
OK, so what are we
going to learn today?

00:05:41.572 --> 00:05:43.030
The first thing I
want to teach you

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.030
is to establish an
agency relationship

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.280
with the proper professionals.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.150
You want to build a
team when you're going

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.610
to buy a foreclosure homes.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.240
You can't jump into it.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.530
You have to have a lawyer.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.680
You have to have a real estate
agent, broker, professional who

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.900
is working for your side.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.556
So how do you get that
agency to make sure

00:06:02.556 --> 00:06:03.930
that that professional
is working

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.100
for you and not the other side?

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.571
You also have to want
to be ready to buy.

00:06:09.571 --> 00:06:10.070
Right?

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.490
How do we prepare ourselves
to buy foreclosures?

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.717
Be ready to negotiate.

00:06:15.717 --> 00:06:17.300
Just because it's a
foreclosure, we're

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.820
going to understand what does
a foreclosure really mean.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.500
You have to be ready
to negotiate this deal

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.440
and not just take
what they give you

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.470
and understand what you want.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.600
You have to know the rules
and how to play by them.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.190
OK?

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.090
Just because someone
says it's a foreclosure,

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.430
you have to understand
the city, the state rules,

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.320
the federal rules,
and understand

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.140
that what I'm getting into is
what I'm getting into and not

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.460
listening to just
everything people tell you.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.330
That's the problem.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.560
Like I said, I sit on this
the board and I teach it.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.050
So sometimes people
even come to me

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.730
when I'm working for someone
who's looking to purchase,

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.617
and I say, that's not the rule.

00:06:52.617 --> 00:06:54.700
I'm not going to be here
to get myself in trouble.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.640
I want to buy, and
I want to buy right.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.140
OK?

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:00.070
Also, beware of
your expectations.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.150
Sometimes, people
have expectations

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.350
that are far beyond
what is realistic.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.850
Right?

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.680
They'll come in, and
they'll say, hey, I

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.330
have heard silly, silly stuff.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.600
I have $10,000 and I want a five
bedroom house with a four car

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.520
garage.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.820
And I'm like, not
always what it is.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.550
OK?

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.310
And also limit your risk.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.290
When you jump into foreclosures
and real estate buying,

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.460
you want to be careful.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.490
You're putting in
a lot of money.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.070
You're putting in a lot of
money to buy these homes.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.160
And you have to make sure
that you're analyzing it right

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.590
or you have a professional who
is able to analyze it right,

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.150
identify what's right,
and evaluate the property.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:45.360
Just because the property
is going for $10,000

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.850
doesn't mean that this
is the right property.

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.471
You also want to look at
what's going on in the area.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:51.970
Right?

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:53.260
What's happening?

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.860
We could all understand
that the Barclay Center that

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.780
came into downtown Brooklyn,
if you bought property

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.720
in that area, your
money went up.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.480
So you want to know what's
going on in that area that's

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.530
going to increase it.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.190
And know your endgame.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.130
Just because you're
buying a property--

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.070
some people buy a property
like I said, $10,000.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.310
Oh, I have a great
property for $10,000.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.170
That doesn't mean
it's a great property.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.460
What are you going to do
when you get this property?

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.600
What is your goal?

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.470
And we'll talk about
some of those things.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.680
In a foreclosure, what is
often considered the hardest

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.390
consequence for a homeowner?

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.659
Now, you may say to yourself,
Trisha, I'm here to buy.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.850
I'm not the homeowner
going in foreclosure.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.201
Well, you have to
understand this

00:08:38.201 --> 00:08:39.909
because when you're
buying a foreclosure,

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:42.690
you want to know what
happened to that property.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:45.560
That's something that
I do all the time.

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.660
When I'm helping a purchaser
purchase a property,

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.430
I'm researching that property.

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.540
I want to know why did they
lose that property, what's

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.440
happening, because I want to
make sure none of that happens

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.470
to me or their issues don't fall
back on this property with me.

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:02.210
So in a foreclosure,
what is often

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:06.300
considered the hardest
consequence for a homeowner?

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.260
Damage of their credit,
deficiency judgment,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.560
or losing their home.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.226
Well, we're going to think about
that and come back to it later.

00:09:13.226 --> 00:09:16.580
And excuse me if I sit down
for just a little while.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.580
We're going to go over a
few of the terminology.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.000
Deficiency judgment--
anybody knows

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.040
what that means when it
comes to real estate?

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.740
Well, let me explain to you
what deficiency judgment is.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:38.460
If you purchased a home and you
take out a loan for $500,000

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.520
and then you cannot
pay that loan--

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.790
a homeowner takes out
a loan for $500,000.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.230
They cannot pay that loan.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:49.870
And they go delinquent
in their loan.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.346
And they say, you know what?

00:09:51.346 --> 00:09:52.970
I have to sell this
house now because I

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.190
can't afford this home anymore.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.880
The market of that property
may have gone down.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.420
Maybe they bought
that house overpriced,

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.360
or maybe the condition of
the home has gone down.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.590
So sometimes, when you're
getting foreclosures,

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.110
the condition of the home
is not always the best

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.110
because if someone is unable
to pay their mortgage loan,

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.630
then they probably could
not upkeep the house.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.240
So maybe the roof went bad,
maybe the plumbing, maybe

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.230
the electrical.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.080
So the value went down.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.850
So even though they have a
loan on this home for $500,000,

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.590
the house is now worth $400,000.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.800
So no one is going to buy
this home for the $500,000.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.900
They're going to buy it for
the $400,000 that it's worth.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:40.020
Well, they sell this home
for $400,000 in agreement

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.500
with the bank.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.010
What do you think
happens to that $100,000?

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:48.460
Well, what happens is it can
turn to a deficiency judgment

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:51.870
where this homeowner is
owed that money later.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:56.370
And it's turned into a
judgment against them.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:57.010
May not.

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.720
They can negotiate it sometimes.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:02.510
But sometimes, they owe
this money later on.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.230
And now you, as the
purchaser of this home,

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.910
you may not think
that's your problem.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:08.600
But you may want
to think about it.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.820
This is something I
always tell purchasers.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.080
You want to think about
it because you don't want

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.730
any law-- I'm not an attorney.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:17.070
But you don't want any
lawsuits to come back later

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.070
where they say, I didn't
know I was going to get

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.300
this deficiency judgment.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.664
I want my house back, or
I want you to pay for it.

00:11:23.664 --> 00:11:25.080
So this is something
that you want

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.885
to talk about with
the professional

00:11:26.885 --> 00:11:29.350
that you're working
with, with your attorney,

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:33.810
with your broker to make
sure all of that is handled.

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:38.970
An acceleration clause
or an alienation clause--

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.020
when someone takes out
a loan and a mortgage,

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.690
a lot of times people say, I
am going to take a mortgage.

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:47.190
Right?

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.760
And you know, this terminology
that I go through with you,

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.520
if I ever speak to
you individually,

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.820
I like to educate people
first because I'm an educator.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.620
I teach real estate
at the college.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.170
And I take people
through the steps.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.950
I truly believe
that more you know,

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:03.060
the better it is for you
to purchase your house.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.770
A lot of real estate
brokers don't like

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.660
to teach you this information.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.110
They want you to go in blindly.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.200
Well, that's why we have 30,000
people facing foreclosure.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.210
But if you understand
this before you purchase,

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:18.200
you'll be a better buyer
when you buy your home.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.880
When you buy a home, if
you take out a loan--

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.390
some people buy cash.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.090
Some people use a loan.

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:27.000
If you take out a loan and
you're getting a mortgage,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.210
you are not getting a mortgage.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:31.090
You are giving a mortgage.

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:34.010
That's the terminology
that really irritates me

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:37.920
because you're not
getting a mortgage,

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.910
you're giving a mortgage because
the definition of "mortgage"

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:42.440
is collateral.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.050
You're giving the
bank permission,

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:49.390
as a voluntary lien, that
if I do not pay my loan,

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.280
if I default, I'm
giving you permission

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.270
to take my house back.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:59.520
That's why you are the one
giving the bank the mortgage.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.030
But when you go-- if anyone
here owns a home, when

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.640
you buy a house
and you're sitting

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:08.600
at the closing, how big are
those papers you have to sign?

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.440
Like this thick, right?

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.270
You're signing and
signing and signing.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:14.440
And you're not even
reading those papers.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.860
Well, within those papers,
in those mortgage papers,

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:21.080
there is something called
an acceleration clause.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.400
An acceleration
cause is something

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:28.000
that allows a bank
to go to court

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.770
and take back the house
if you don't follow.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:35.770
The most common way for a
bank to foreclose on you

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.210
is not paying.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:38.530
But that's not the only way.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.613
A lot of people don't know
that's not the only way

00:13:40.613 --> 00:13:42.250
that a bank can
foreclose in your house

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.070
and accelerate the clause.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:48.720
If you don't pay your taxes,
you've defaulted on the loan.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.760
If you don't upkeep the house,
you've defaulted on the loan.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.320
If you've changed or
altered the house,

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.720
you've defaulted on the loan.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.400
Because think about it.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.670
If you buy a house and
it's a three bedroom

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.290
and you change it
into a two bedroom,

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.570
you've defaulted on
the loan because you've

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.640
changed the house without
the bank's approval.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.900
You may have gone to the
county and gotten approval

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:13.860
from the county.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.340
But you have not asked
the bank permission

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.890
because the resale
on a three bedroom

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:21.480
is a lot higher than a
resale of a two bedroom.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.020
So you've changed the value.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.250
So by not asking the
bank's permission,

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:30.190
you have triggered the
acceleration clause.

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:34.600
Another cause on it,
not paying your taxes.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.130
But there's an
alienation clause.

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.360
Sometimes, you have people who
are in trouble with the IRS

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.550
or child support
or whatever reason.

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:46.020
And they want to get their name
off that title, off the deed.

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:48.320
And they will take their
name off the title.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.500
They will sign it over
to a cousin or a daughter

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:56.760
or a sister or a brother and
remove their name off the deed.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.760
But their name is still
on the mortgage papers.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.940
You have alienated
yourself off that property.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:07.420
And that is a reason for the
bank to foreclose on you.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.150
You have recourse or
non-recourse loans,

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.850
when you personally
guarantee these loans

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.070
and they can come for you.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:17.000
You have mortgage
assignments, where

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.370
you can assign the
mortgage to someone else.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:22.300
And then you have
right to redemption.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.569
New York State does not
have right to redemption.

00:15:24.569 --> 00:15:25.610
Every state is different.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.820
And I can go personally
with you in that state.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.330
You have to know
also where you're

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.300
buying a property
because if you are

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:35.560
a homeowner-- in some
states, when you foreclose,

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.810
I know people who are in
foreclosure for five years.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.500
And that's because the
bank is so backlogged

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.250
and the court system is so
backlogged that they haven't

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:48.800
been able to get to this person,
this homeowner yet, to actually

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.250
lose the home,
whereas some states,

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.370
you go into foreclosure,
two months later,

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.260
you've lost your home.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:57.910
Well, right to
redemption just says,

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:59.990
once you are at the
auction and they

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:05.510
hit the auction and the house
is gone, you can't get it back.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.590
In some states, they give
the homeowner a couple days

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.250
after to come back and
get the house back.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:14.180
Maybe they've borrowed the
money, won the lottery,

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:15.230
or whatever the case is.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:17.550
They can get the house back.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:19.216
So these are just
a few terminologies

00:16:19.216 --> 00:16:20.840
that I think that
anyone who is looking

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.310
to invest in foreclosures should
understand because you have

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:28.127
to understand, this person
was buying the house before,

00:16:28.127 --> 00:16:29.210
who owned the home before.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:34.770
And now they're losing the
and when you're taking it.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.246
OK, what is foreclosure?

00:16:36.246 --> 00:16:37.542
This is a lot of information.

00:16:37.542 --> 00:16:39.125
So I'm trying to get
through all of it

00:16:39.125 --> 00:16:42.530
because I really want to get
to the meat and potatoes.

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:46.620
There is a huge difference
between foreclosure

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:47.850
and pre-foreclosure.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.520
People come to me all
the time-- Trisha,

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.050
I want to buy a foreclosure.

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.170
Well, guess what?

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:57.560
If a homeowner is behind
on their mortgage payments,

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.450
you can't get that
home from them

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.760
unless they're
willing to sell it.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.390
Until someone actually loses
their home in the auction,

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:08.829
you can't just take
their home from them.

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:13.250
They have to be willing to work
with you and sell it to you.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:16.210
So there's a huge difference
between foreclosures

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:17.780
and pre-foreclosures.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.960
Someone who has
missed their payments,

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.980
they can be in pre-foreclosure.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.730
Someone who has totally
lost their home to a bank

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:27.530
and has not paid
it and the bank has

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:30.900
gone through the court system,
that is a foreclosed home.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:40.040
What does foreclosure
look like today?

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.420
I remember, when I
started real estate--

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:44.630
I started real
estate 16 years ago.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:48.340
Foreclosures were homes
that were boarded up.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:49.930
Right?

00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:54.064
They were just the grass and
weeds were growing outside.

00:17:54.064 --> 00:17:56.230
This is basically what
foreclosures looked like when

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:57.590
I started real estate.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:58.290
Not anymore.

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:00.930
With 30,000 people
in foreclosure,

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:04.490
you're looking at foreclosures
that are looking like this.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:08.840
You have sometimes
15-unit buildings,

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.260
regular houses with pools.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.200
You're hearing
celebrities are losing

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.230
their mansions to foreclosures.

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:18.020
So you can pick up
some pretty nice houses

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:21.490
for a much lower prices
that are foreclosures

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:22.730
and that look great.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:32.830
You have shopping centers, malls
that are going to foreclosures.

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.310
Now, let's just go through
quickly the process

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:36.290
of foreclosure.

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.370
When you own a home--
because we still

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.770
want to get into the
mindset of this homeowner

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.250
because if we're buying this
home from this homeowner,

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.910
we have to understand
what are we

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:49.290
getting into before we put
our money into this home.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:54.960
When you have a house, your
mortgage is due on the first.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.290
They give you a
15-day grace period.

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.400
For all of those who
do not own a home,

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.460
your home is due on the first.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:06.110
By the 15th, if it's not
paid, it's considered late.

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.960
By the 30th, just
like a credit card,

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:13.090
that's when you will have it
reported to your credit bureau

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:16.340
that you've missed your payment.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:21.010
After-- it could be anywhere
between 90 days and five

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:24.430
months, the lender can
start a lawsuit with you.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.220
And it's called a lis
pendens because by then, you

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:29.060
have defaulted on your
mortgage payments.

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.560
And they're going
to come after you.

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.780
The owner has to give
a response as to why.

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.770
The owner has time
to make the payments.

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:42.410
The court goes through
their decision.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.200
The owner sometimes
can appeal it.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.910
But at that point,
if it doesn't work,

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.605
then the court goes
for an auction.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:54.760
We're in Manhattan.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.740
In all five boroughs
in New York City,

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:01.940
there is an auction every
single week in a courthouse.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:05.540
In Brooklyn, it's
on Adams Street.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.320
They have a website for it.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.690
What you can do is you
can look up the homes that

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:11.860
are going through auction.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.610
When I first started
real estate 16 years ago,

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:17.690
there was about three homes
being auctioned a week.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:21.650
Now, there's about 30 homes
being auctioned a week.

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:24.750
These are homes where they
have gone through the process,

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:25.980
the court system.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.540
And now, they're being lost.

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.080
And they're being auctioned
off in the courthouse.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:36.300
If someone is buying the
homes in the auction,

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.460
the buyer goes to
the auction and bids.

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.650
They have to put down
a deposit and come back

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:45.580
within a certain amount of
time to pay for the difference.

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.500
The problem with the
auction, a lot of the houses

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.520
are underwater.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.620
They're upside down, which means
that they're worth $400,000

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:58.020
but the mortgage
balance is $500,000.

00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:00.750
You may not want to buy
a home in that situation.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.860
Plus, they tack
on attorney fees.

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.200
So sometimes, the auction
is maybe not always

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.834
the best place to go.

00:21:06.834 --> 00:21:08.000
But it's good to experience.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.330
Sometimes, you can get it.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:12.690
You just have to
research the homes.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:13.190
OK?

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:15.800
Some states, we have
a right to redemption.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:20.120
OK, now, once the home
is not sold at auction,

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.540
it goes back to the bank.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.930
The bank then takes it as
an REO, Real Estate Owned.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:30.950
That's when the bank
takes that property.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.200
They do an appraisal
on the property.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.590
And they prepare it to sell.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:36.930
If a homeowner is
living in that home,

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:38.250
they will evict the homeowner.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:40.970
The homeowner no
longer owns that home.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:44.980
If it's a multi-family property,
the homeowner no longer

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.160
has a right to collect rent
because they no longer own

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.580
that property.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.840
Now, you as an investor
can purchase that property

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:55.800
through the bank.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:59.920
And they're not selling it for
what the homeowner owed for it.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:03.240
They're selling it now
for a reduced price

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.140
because they've done
an appraisal on it,

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.850
they've spoken to
their investors that

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:11.190
owned that note on that home,
and now, they're selling it.

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:14.110
So you would get in contact
with a mortgage broker

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:18.520
to see that home and
to purchase that home.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.930
If that home is not
sold through an REO,

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.530
it can become an HUD home.

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:25.100
There is a HUD key.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:26.150
I have a HUD key.

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:29.390
The HUD key is a master
key that opens up every HUD

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:33.060
home in the whole country.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.800
And you can see that home.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.620
And you can bid on that home.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.140
Now, some homes are
for first-time buyers.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.690
Some homes are for a nonprofits.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:42.017
Some homes are for investors.

00:22:42.017 --> 00:22:43.100
Some homes are for anyone.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.910
They will categorize that.

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:47.960
You have to keep in mind that
sometimes these homes need

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.180
work.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.710
So you have to go in
there and assess the work.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.887
Remember, I told you
about building your team?

00:22:54.887 --> 00:22:56.470
You want to have a
real estate broker.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:57.678
You want to have an attorney.

00:22:57.678 --> 00:22:59.700
You more than likely
want to have someone

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:04.190
who's a contractor that
can help you go in there

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:05.470
and do some of the work.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.281
Sometimes, the house
just needs appliances.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.750
OK?

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:15.680
So I have a friend who
just purchased two homes,

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:16.740
not in this state.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:23.410
He paid $25,000 for each home.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:25.340
He got a loan on the home.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.910
The loan was $150 a month.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:32.035
The rental income
is $800 a month.

00:23:32.035 --> 00:23:33.160
And what is he going to do?

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.493
He's going to rent the home out.

00:23:34.493 --> 00:23:36.730
All the home needs
is appliances.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:39.204
And that is passive
income every single month.

00:23:39.204 --> 00:23:40.120
And he has a property.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:50.390
What are other options
for the homeowner

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:51.850
for them not to lose their home?

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:54.620
Why do I go through this even
though you want to invest?

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.430
Because when you speak
to these homeowners

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:58.940
or you speak to the
broker, you want

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.370
to know what
happened to the home.

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:02.000
Why did they lose the home?

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.550
There are many options.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:06.000
There is something
called a short sale.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.880
There is a deed in lieu.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.729
Deed in lieu is basically
where you are foreclosing--

00:24:11.729 --> 00:24:12.520
you're a homeowner.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.020
And you're foreclosing
on this home.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.050
You can't afford
this home anymore.

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:17.830
You turn to the
bank, and you say,

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:21.500
I would like to give
you the home back.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.550
They also call it
giving back the keys.

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:25.740
And some people,
very silly, will

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.107
put the keys in an envelope
and mail it to the bank.

00:24:28.107 --> 00:24:29.190
It doesn't work like that.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.950
You call the bank.

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:31.010
They would do that.

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:33.570
You call the bank, and you
negotiate with the bank

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.510
and say, hey, I want to
give back this house.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:36.910
I can't afford it.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:38.970
And the bank will
draft the papers.

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:43.740
And then you you will sign
the deed back over to them.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:47.050
It's very rare for banks to
do that because banks are not

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:48.080
in the house business.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.920
They're in the money business.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:53.010
They don't want to keep a house
because just think about it.

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:54.860
That boarded up
house that you see

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:59.270
when you go home, that's
a liability to someone.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:04.090
When a house is boarded
up, you have the risk

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:07.960
of having prostitution in there,
crime in there, drugs in there,

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.420
murders in there.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.290
The pipes can freeze.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:12.970
Who's sweeping the leaves?

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:14.450
Who's shoveling the snow?

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:16.490
The bank rather has
the homeowner in there

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.820
until they can sell it.

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:22.180
So they don't really like
to do the deed and lieus.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.700
A homeowner can sell a home.

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.910
If they know they're
facing foreclosure

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.590
and are unable to
make their payments,

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:29.900
they can sell their home.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.780
I have sold many homes of people
who are facing foreclosure.

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.370
And we sold it just in time.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:42.380
The advantage as an investor
is if the broker is selling

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:44.820
a home that is
facing foreclosure,

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:48.440
you can get it
cheaper, possibly,

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.120
than what they would
normally sell it

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.800
for because the clock is
ticking with them before there's

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.170
an auction.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:58.720
So if the person owes
$400,000 on his house

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.180
and this house is
worth $600,000,

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:06.320
they can't probably get $600,000
if the clock is ticking.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.850
Maybe you can give
them $550,000.

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:09.970
Maybe you can give them
$500,000 because they

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:11.530
have to do it in a quick sale.

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:14.950
Not always, but
sometimes they can.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:16.960
Sometimes, the
homeowner can refinance.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.702
But that's a little
tough as well

00:26:18.702 --> 00:26:20.160
because if they
miss payments, then

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.460
that means they've already
damaged their credit.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:26.940
So a bank may not
refinance with them.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.870
But the other thing that
I want you to hear about

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:33.200
is short sales.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:36.330
I'm sure many of you have
heard of short sales and said,

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:38.850
hmm, short sales may
be the way for me

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.740
to get into a foreclosed home.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.890
Well, basically, a
short sale-- the example

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:52.710
I gave you before, a homeowner
owes $500,000 on their house.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:54.720
But the market and
condition of their property

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.120
says it's only worth
about $400,000.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.410
So they put this house on
the market for $500,000

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:01.630
because they owe $500,000.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.980
Maybe they put it for
$550,000 because there's

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.770
fees they have to pay.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:06.840
It's not getting sold.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.049
No one's buying it.

00:27:08.049 --> 00:27:10.340
Who's going to buy a house
for $550,000 when it's worth

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:11.680
$400,000.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.800
So what they do is
they bring it down.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:17.950
And they're getting
offers now at $400,000.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:20.610
But, hey, remember that
deficiency judgment.

00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:22.490
They can't sell the
house for $400,000

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:25.780
when they owe $550,000 on it.

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.840
So what they're doing is they're
going to do a short sale where

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.980
they're asking the
bank if they can

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:36.190
take $400,000 for this house.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:39.970
Please, I know I
borrowed $500,000.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:41.700
I know it's up to $550,000 now.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.230
But I can only get $400,000.

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:45.330
Can you take it?

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:49.370
And a lot of times,
the bank will say yes

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:52.120
because the bank just
wants to get that cash.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.839
Sometimes write it off,
and get it off their books.

00:27:55.839 --> 00:27:57.880
Remember, I told you, you
gotta play by the rules

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.390
and understand the rules.

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:04.600
The homeowner cannot
get any money.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:10.660
So the homeowner is basically
selling this house for nothing.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.730
Why would a homeowner do it?

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:15.330
The headache of
the house, they're

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:17.130
getting it off their credit.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.190
They're getting
rid of this house.

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:21.120
They're not getting those
phone calls anymore.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.120
They're just selling it.

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:25.880
But if the bank had
to lose $150,000,

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:28.100
the homeowner
can't get anything.

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:33.670
Also, the homeowner could never
live in that house ever again.

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:35.160
Listen, they lost the home.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.570
You're the new purchaser.

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:38.158
You can't rent
that home to them.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:46.120
And that homeowner could never
own that house ever again.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.790
And they're signing
papers that says

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.500
they're not going to do that.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.000
Why?

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.740
Because if they do, it can
look like mortgage fraud.

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.680
It can look like they
set it up, defaulted,

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.180
had someone buy the
house just so they

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:00.420
can get this house for cheaper.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.780
But a short sale
is a very, very,

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:06.590
very popular because there
are a lot of people, 30,000,

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:09.550
who are in foreclosure who
cannot afford their homes.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:11.620
And they need to get out.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:16.150
And the value of their home is
way lower than what they owe.

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:18.680
And a short sale is the
best option for them,

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:20.530
just to get out of the home.

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:21.860
And that's how you do it.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:26.560
However, as investors, in
purchasing foreclosures,

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.150
I just advise you
to be very careful.

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.790
Work with someone who
is very knowledgeable.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:35.920
Not all homeowners want to
be people who short sale.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.860
Some homeowners are going
to try and try and try, just

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:40.680
like with a loan modification.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:44.040
A loan modification is a program
that President Obama started

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.010
called the Making Home
Affordable program,

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:50.520
where if someone is
behind on their mortgage,

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.290
you can contact
the bank for help.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:56.880
And you have to send in
pay stubs and tax returns

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.210
and letters and telling
them why you fell behind

00:30:00.210 --> 00:30:01.650
and what is your action plan.

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:06.500
Some people are in foreclosure
because they had a divorce

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:10.030
or that have hospital bills,
or they lost their job.

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.330
And now, they are doing better.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:13.450
And now, they want to catch up.

00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:16.280
So they would apply
for a loan modification

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:23.000
requesting their mortgage loan
revamped, where they're either

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.660
asking for a lower monthly
payment that's manageable,

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:32.240
a lower interest rate, or taking
off some of the loan owed.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.940
A lot of times, when that
doesn't work for them,

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.210
their next resort is
to do a short sale.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:43.510
OK, in foreclosure, what is
often considered the hardest

00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:45.420
consequence for the homeowner?

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.590
Damaging their credit,
deficiency judgment,

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:49.240
or losing their home?

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.910
Now, the answer is-- oh, sorry.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:53.890
I can't go back.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:56.390
The answer is a
deficiency judgment

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:58.480
because yes, they
lose their home.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.290
But sometimes, they
can get a new home.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:04.210
I know a couple who lost a home.

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:05.940
The wife wasn't
paying the mortgage.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.600
The husband didn't know.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.760
But I guess the
brighter side of it

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.370
was the mortgage was only
in the husband's name.

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:15.660
So now, the wife is going
to go get her own loan.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.720
And they're going
to buy a new home.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.600
Damaging your
credit-- many people

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.330
have damaged their credit and
have paid off those credit card

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:26.450
bills and redeemed
themselves and came back.

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:28.350
But a deficiency
judgement, just imagine

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:32.390
that if you owe $100,000
and you lost this house

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:36.150
and you don't have
this house anymore.

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:38.810
Now, you have the judgment
that's going to stick with you.

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:41.220
And you go get another job
and you fix your credit.

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:44.020
And then you have this judgment
on you that is sticking to you

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:45.410
that you have to pay off.

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:47.320
So that can be pretty bad.

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.750
We just went
through short sales.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.240
Oh, excuse my typo.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:56.480
The seller's agent-- I want to
talk about the seller's agent

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:59.667
that sometimes, as
investors-- which

00:31:59.667 --> 00:32:01.500
I'm talking to you as
real estate investors.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.510
As a buyer, you have to
understand that the seller may

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:10.510
have an agent working for them.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:16.460
And I always use this example
like when the police say,

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:19.105
anything you say or do can
and will be held against you.

00:32:19.105 --> 00:32:22.120
You want to be very careful when
you're purchasing an investment

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:26.209
property and the person has
an agent working for them

00:32:26.209 --> 00:32:27.500
because you have to understand.

00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:29.960
Real estate is very
difficult. I teach it.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.480
It's a whole different language.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.250
And if you don't
understand the language,

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:36.320
you can say something that
can hurt your negotiation.

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.270
So once they have
an agent, you want

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:41.930
to make sure you have an
agent too from the beginning

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:45.510
because that agent is
going to represent you.

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:49.420
That agent is going to be able
to talk the language for you.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.690
I remember walking in with
one of my clients last year.

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:54.620
And I'm showing a house.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:57.760
And the agent is
talking to my client.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.330
And I turn to the agent,
and I said, please

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:02.170
do not talk to my client.

00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:03.370
And he said, whoa, whoa.

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:04.620
You mean I can't say anything?

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.910
I said, no, absolutely not.

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:08.630
So he turned
around, and he says,

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:11.630
can you please tell your
client that the bathroom is

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:12.340
to the left?

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:16.180
And I said, the
bathroom is to the left.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:19.010
And it seems ridiculous.

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:20.730
But you don't really
understand that when

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:24.400
you're purchasing real estate,
especially investment property,

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:28.610
the slightest thing you say
can hurt your negotiation,

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:30.790
absolutely hurt
your negotiation.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:34.020
I remember showing a
house-- and I probably

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.740
gave this same example
last time I was here.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:41.400
And the sellers had an agent.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.360
But the agent never
came to the showing.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:45.026
Silly, silly, agent.

00:33:45.026 --> 00:33:48.200
And the lady, a
sweet old couple,

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.160
showing us around the house.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.170
But while she's showing
me around the house,

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:54.650
she's complaining
about her knees.

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:56.165
Oh, my knees, my knees.

00:33:56.165 --> 00:33:58.420
I can't go up these steps.

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:01.080
What did she basically tell us?

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:06.010
That she was very desperate to
sell this house, that any price

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.870
we give her, she will take,
because she can not take

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:11.250
going up and down these steps.

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:14.440
Now, her agent failed her
because her agent should

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:18.860
have came to the house, told
her and husband to sit down,

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.429
and he showed that house.

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:23.360
And we would have never
known why she was selling

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.570
or what her issues were
or how desperate she

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:28.020
was to sell this house.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:32.389
So you have to remember,
as investors, as buyers,

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:37.320
the seller has a broker
representing them.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.815
And they're going
to say anything.

00:34:38.815 --> 00:34:41.190
And they're going to pull--
the slightest thing that they

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:46.250
say to you, believe it or not,
is to pull information from you

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:49.420
to get you to pay more money.

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.969
And the buyer's client,
you have to make sure

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:55.350
that you are represented.

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:57.250
Like I said, it
is very difficult.

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.860
I'm researching real
estate every single day.

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:00.700
I know what's up.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.050
I now what's down.

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:03.240
I know the rules.

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.620
So you want to make sure
you're dealing with someone.

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:09.000
If you go into a courtroom,
the plaintiff has an attorney.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.810
The defendant has an attorney.

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:13.460
You don't want to open your
mouth unless you're represented

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:16.670
because you don't know
all the legal terminology

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:17.520
they can be using.

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.590
And it's the same thing.

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:25.760
OK, you have to know your needs
and your wants as an investor.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.600
You're all sitting
here right now.

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.870
I have some money.

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:30.850
I have credit.

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:33.470
I want to purchase some
real estate as investment.

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:35.870
I want to purchase some
foreclosures as an investment.

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:38.870
Well, what kind of foreclosures
do you want to buy?

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:40.010
What are your needs?

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:41.340
What are your wants?

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:44.160
How far do you want to travel?

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.840
Do you want to have
a property manager

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:49.600
or do you want to go collect
the rent every day yourself?

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:52.070
Do you want to buy this
house and live in it one day?

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:53.880
Or do you want to just
flip it and have it

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.270
just as an investment?

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:58.771
You have to understand what
your needs and your wants are.

00:35:58.771 --> 00:36:00.270
And that's something
that you should

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:02.500
sit down with your
broker and go through,

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.080
how much capital you have.

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.750
How much money do
you want to spend?

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:09.440
You may have $200,000
sitting in your bank account,

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:12.430
but you don't want to
spend all that money.

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:14.260
You want to do some
of it in credit.

00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:17.480
So those are the things
that you have to go through.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:18.200
right?

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:21.290
You have to make sure if you
do going through a lender,

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:23.220
go through your
lender right away.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.210
Talk with your lender.

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:26.130
Get your approval.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.050
Money talks.

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:27.550
Right?

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:29.900
You could probably get a
cheaper deal if you used cash,

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.484
but you may not want
to use your cash.

00:36:31.484 --> 00:36:33.649
And I'm trying to go a
little bit faster because I'm

00:36:33.649 --> 00:36:34.750
looking at the time.

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:37.985
And I want to make sure
I get all your questions.

00:36:37.985 --> 00:36:40.480
How to profit over real estate.

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.200
There's three ways
that you can profit.

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.920
So when you buy foreclosures
as an investment-- remember,

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.470
I spoke to you earlier
about your endgame?

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:50.424
You want to know
what your endgame is.

00:36:50.424 --> 00:36:51.590
You're buying this property.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:53.022
You don't want to
just sit there.

00:36:53.022 --> 00:36:54.480
You want to make
sure you're making

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.070
money off of this property.

00:36:56.070 --> 00:37:00.260
So you can do appreciation,
cash flow, and flipping.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:03.320
Those of us who watch
those house shells on TV,

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.572
they talk about flipping.

00:37:04.572 --> 00:37:05.780
They talk about these things.

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:08.270
Well, really, what are they?

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:11.540
OK, you see this person,
this home right here.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:14.280
In 1930, somebody needed it.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:20.630
1970, look at the value of how
it increased all these years.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:22.310
Now, let's talk
about appreciation.

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:24.260
I'll move it over a little bit.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:32.638
In 90 years, they bought this
house in 1920, for $35,000.

00:37:32.638 --> 00:37:35.890
90 years later, $265,000.

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:38.250
Now, you may say, I'm not
going to be here for 90 years.

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:41.940
I'm just showing you how
the value of the property

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.520
has increased.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:47.530
So you purchase a foreclosure
below market value,

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:49.770
this is what's going
to happen to you.

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:51.350
You also have flipping.

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:52.460
What is flipping?

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:56.160
You buy low, you sell high.

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.800
Remember, I told
you about your team.

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.910
Maybe you know someone who
does a little contracting.

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:04.910
Maybe on your day off, you
don't mind going in there

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:07.920
and painting the house and
fixing it up a little bit

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:08.900
yourself.

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.240
Look at this house that
they bought before.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:13.300
They purchased it for $150,000.

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:16.030
They put $50,000
worth of repairs.

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:20.270
Their total acquisition
for it was $200,000.

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:21.290
And what did they do?

00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:23.240
They sold it for $275,000.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:29.130
$75,000 profit, just like that.

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:30.610
And this was a foreclosure.

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:33.830
Or this was a short sale
that someone couldn't buy.

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:35.320
Now, here's the thing.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.820
Here's why you may
be able to compete.

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:41.720
Depending on how much cash you
have or the type of loan you

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.790
have, the regular
first-time home buyer

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:47.160
could not buy this home.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.380
So that's beating out
some of your competition.

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.400
And you say, well,
Trisha, you just

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:51.860
told me I could
probably get a loan

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.680
to buy some of
these foreclosures.

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.990
Yes, you can.

00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:57.440
But you will need to put
down a little bit more cash,

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.810
whereas a first-time home
buyer who has a family

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:05.606
and is purchasing these homes,
the amount of money, as low

00:39:05.606 --> 00:39:07.230
as they're putting
down, they would not

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:09.440
be able to buy this home.

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.070
OK?

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:12.550
Also, cash flow.

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.800
Remember, this is one of the
foreclosures that we saw.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.940
Believe it or not,
there are buildings

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:20.330
that have this many units
that are facing foreclosure.

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:23.230
So you purchase this home.

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:26.040
And you're looking at
cash flow every month.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.820
So you didn't flip
it for that $75,000.

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:30.841
But you're collecting
rental income.

00:39:30.841 --> 00:39:32.340
You may turn around
and say, well, I

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.420
don't want to ring
anyone's bell for rent.

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:36.650
That's a property
manager for you.

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:39.180
A property manager will be
the one to shovel the snow

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:41.850
and take out the trash
and collect the rent.

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:43.642
And they just send you
a check every month.

00:39:43.642 --> 00:39:45.975
And at the end of the day,
you still have that building.

00:39:45.975 --> 00:39:47.640
So when you want to
sell that building,

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.950
you can still make money
off of the appreciation

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:51.140
of that building.

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.830
And this is stuff, like I
said, I can individually

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:55.190
talk to you further about.

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:58.630
How do you increase the
value in this foreclosure?

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:02.780
You take this property that was
losing money, that had nothing,

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:03.980
and what do you do?

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:07.020
Maybe you put a laundromat
in the basement.

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:09.670
Maybe you put a storage
unit in the basement.

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:12.160
You can take your basement
and put storage units

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:16.520
where people can store
winter clothes in the summer.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.710
They can store their bikes.

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:23.370
They can store Christmas
trees until they need it.

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:24.860
You can make money off of there.

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.070
Cellphone towers on the top.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:31.820
If it's a corner building,
you can put billboards.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.430
If you have parking
spaces-- these are all ways

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:37.290
that you can increase the
value of this home that

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:40.020
was foreclosing not too long
ago, that you picked up,

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.040
and the homeowner couldn't
afford it anymore.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.690
And you were able to pick it up.

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:44.690
And then you calculate--

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:47.231
And this is something that we
have to go through, I told you,

00:40:47.231 --> 00:40:48.670
where you have to analyze it.

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:51.800
What is the income that you're
getting on the property?

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.712
What are the expenses you're
getting on the property,

00:40:54.712 --> 00:40:56.170
that you're paying
on the property?

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:58.380
What is your mortgage,
if you have a mortgage?

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:01.940
What are the taxes that
maintenance this insurance, OK?

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:08.750
You're netting $15,000 monthly
on this building, $180,000

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:09.740
yearly.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.540
That's some people's salary.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:14.260
And that's how much money
you're making on this property

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.760
that you picked up
next to nothing.

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.950
OK, what can you do next?

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:22.710
Attend classes, seminars,
workshops, lectures,

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:25.680
stay around like-minded
people, find a mentor,

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.330
learn the real estate market.

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:31.170
Where is there going to
be the next hot market?

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:33.090
I've predicted
quite a few markets

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:35.150
that we're going
to be coming up.

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:37.370
And they did,
especially, like I said,

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:40.630
I have agents who work
in all five boroughs,

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:42.650
and I'm licensed in a
couple other states.

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:46.930
But being born and
raised in Brooklyn,

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:50.660
there are neighborhoods
that I predicted before.

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:53.760
Williamsburg, I predicted
before it happened.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.460
Redhook, I predicted
before it happened.

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.250
East New York, I predicted
was going to happen just

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:01.780
by looking at the markets,
understanding community,

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:04.610
and what's happening with
the mayor and the city.

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:08.010
You can understand where
you need to invest next.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:10.430
Stay up to date on real
estate regulations and what's

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:11.800
going on.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.620
You should have a real estate
professional helping you.

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:16.620
But you should also
understand these things.

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:19.510
And make sure you read.

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:20.290
OK?

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:25.410
This is my contact information
that if you need to get me,

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:28.850
if you have any other questions,
if you're interested in going

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:30.730
into foreclosure
investment and you

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:34.330
want to know more information
on it, we can do that.

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:35.880
With 10 minutes
left, I would like

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:39.230
to open it up for questions,
anything anyone may have.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.330
AUDIENCE: Hi, Trisha.

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:46.400
Thank you are coming.

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.780
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: Thank you.

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:51.180
AUDIENCE: My question is-- so
I have a couple of questions.

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:57.580
One is I didn't quite get what
was the downside of getting

00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:58.430
foreclosed.

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:02.780
Was that second
one on the slide?

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.290
What exactly that meant.

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:08.620
And then, when you are
predicting-- so usually,

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:12.470
when we go buy houses and when
I bought a house in Astoria,

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:17.260
it was like we had to
line up with other buyers

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:20.050
and we only got two
minutes to see the place.

00:43:20.050 --> 00:43:23.810
And we got to, from
our agent, the Haight,

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:26.230
the offers are
already piling up.

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:28.737
And sometimes even they
would call us and tell us,

00:43:28.737 --> 00:43:29.820
the Haight's already sold.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:30.730
Don't come.

00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:35.960
So it was pretty diverse and
much like a seller's market,

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:39.560
they used to say,
especially in that area.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.934
Very different if you go
deeper, like in Long Island.

00:43:41.934 --> 00:43:43.100
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: Right.

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.330
AUDIENCE: So, yeah,
in those cases,

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:47.680
it's more like hey,
how do you outbid

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.790
and the strategy
completely changes.

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:53.010
Even though they're
retiring, they just

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:55.550
want to get rid of the
house, the sellers,

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:58.700
it's so much lopsided, I found.

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.840
I'm not sure how the
negotiation strategy

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:03.755
work when you have only two
minutes to see the house.

00:44:03.755 --> 00:44:06.130
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: What
was your first question again?

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:08.338
AUDIENCE: My first question
was, what was the biggest

00:44:08.338 --> 00:44:10.150
downside of getting foreclosed?

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:11.480
It was on your slide.

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:12.660
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS:
Deficiency judgment.

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:13.055
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:44:13.055 --> 00:44:14.460
What exactly do
you mean by that.

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:16.626
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: So
deficiency judgment, again,

00:44:16.626 --> 00:44:19.520
is basically you have
a loan for $500,000,

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:23.360
but now, you can't
carry this home anymore.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.300
And the house is worth $400,000.

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:31.760
So you sell the house, do
a short sale for $400,000.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.230
But you still owe $100,000.

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:35.980
The bank is not going
to let you off scott

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:37.320
free with that $100,000.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.950
So what they would do is they
would turn it into a judgment.

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:41.750
The bad part about
having the judgment

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:43.330
is now that this
judgment is sticking

00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:47.500
with you-- the homeowner,
not you as the investor,

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:48.450
but the homeowner.

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:51.620
But it all goes based on
how the home is negotiated.

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:53.750
All banks won't give
a deficiency judgment.

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:54.850
It's how it's negotiated.

00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:57.990
But you, as the investor, if
you're purchasing this home

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:00.660
from this homeowner through
a short sale or whatever,

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:02.830
you want to know
that they have that

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:05.350
and make sure that they
understand that they have that

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:07.014
because I truly
believe that there's

00:45:07.014 --> 00:45:09.430
going to be a lot of people
who are going to file lawsuits

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:12.640
later on because the homeowner
just didn't know that they had

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.650
this judgment.

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:14.970
So now, they get a new job.

00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:16.080
They fix their credit.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.390
They start out fresh.

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:19.660
But they don't realize
that this judgment is still

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:20.800
attached to them.

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.560
So that, I think,
is a big downfall.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.710
AUDIENCE: So they still
have to pay the 100k?

00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:28.620
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS:
Yeah, and before, they

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:31.210
had to pay taxes
on the $100,000.

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:31.919
They lifted that.

00:45:31.919 --> 00:45:33.626
And now, they're trying
to bring it back.

00:45:33.626 --> 00:45:35.429
So yeah, absolutely,
that'll be a judgement

00:45:35.429 --> 00:45:36.470
that'll be stuck to them.

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:40.630
But the bank looks at
their overall portfolio

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:42.360
because if they
own another house,

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.902
that may be more of
a reason why they

00:45:43.902 --> 00:45:45.568
put that judgement
on them, because they

00:45:45.568 --> 00:45:46.740
know that they can get it.

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:49.160
But if this person really
doesn't have anything,

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.810
they may not necessarily
put that deficiency judgment

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:52.440
on them.

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:55.940
As far as the other part,
two minutes to see a home,

00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:58.850
I don't see how
that is possible.

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:03.770
I think it all goes back to who
is representing you as a buyer.

00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:04.360
Right?

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.740
Whoever represents, and that
person who's representing you,

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:10.440
they have this thing
called all OCAR,

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.950
their fiduciary responsibility.

00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:14.200
So if I'm representing
you, I'm obedient.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.000
I'm loyal.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.830
I have disclosure
confidentiality.

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:20.200
I'm fighting for you.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:21.790
So the same way I
walk into that place

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:24.200
and tell the other people
they can't speak to you

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:28.600
is the same way I will
demand that we have more time

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.470
to see this property.

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:33.570
So it's all based on
who's representing you.

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:36.100
If I'm representing you,
I'm not out for my pocket.

00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.480
I'm out for yours.

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.890
So that's very important.

00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:41.430
Know who you're working with.

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.935
Thank you.

00:46:41.935 --> 00:46:42.900
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.070
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: Yes.

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:48.580
AUDIENCE: Hi, you mentioned
foreclosed houses at auction.

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:53.060
If you want to buy a house
at auction, but using

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:56.800
a loan from a bank, do you have
to get that loan ahead of time

00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:00.140
before the auction so you
can put down the deposit

00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:01.127
or pay for the home?

00:47:01.127 --> 00:47:02.710
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS:
So the process--

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:04.490
you don't actually get the loan.

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:06.430
A loan is based
on having a house.

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:10.860
So part of a loan is on you.

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.210
But the actual loan
is based on the house.

00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:15.240
So they're not going
to completely give you

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.950
the loan until you
have the house.

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:19.810
What you have to get
is a prequalification.

00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:21.430
So you're going to bank.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:26.080
And you're saying, hey, I want
to know how much am I qualified

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.080
to borrow.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.960
And they're going to
base it on your credit,

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.650
your income, your history.

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:33.920
And they're going to turn
to you and say, OK, we'll

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:35.960
give you a loan for $600,000.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:37.940
So that's money to
play around with.

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:41.060
You have up to $600,000
to do what you want.

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:46.410
Having that piece of paper is
to go to start shopping now.

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:47.850
So that's what you would need.

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:51.100
Now, once you find that house,
then you come back to them

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:52.760
and say, hey, I
found this house.

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:54.510
And now, they're going
to check that house

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:59.600
to make sure that house
matches what they will give you

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:00.967
the money for.

00:48:00.967 --> 00:48:01.800
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.015
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: Thank you.

00:48:03.015 --> 00:48:03.890
AUDIENCE: Hi, Trisha.

00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:05.110
Thanks for coming.

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:07.170
So a few years ago
and also last year,

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:10.790
I tried to buy an investment
property in New York City.

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:12.619
And it was very
difficult because me

00:48:12.619 --> 00:48:14.160
and a million other
people are trying

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.710
to buy the same property.

00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:19.800
So it seemed easier to buy
property outside of New York,

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:23.500
like in Maryland or like those
lower areas or North Carolina

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:26.770
because it was easier
to get cash flow.

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:31.330
So in the whole of New York,
what types of properties

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:32.990
do you think are the
best for cash flow

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:37.630
or are the best for selling
later-- investment for cash

00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:39.070
flow for selling them later.

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:44.790
And I'm including a commercial
buildings and parking lots.

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:47.199
Which do you think tend to
be better for cash flow?

00:48:47.199 --> 00:48:49.740
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: Parking
lots, when I teach real estate,

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:52.950
they say parking lots
is considered dead money

00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:57.240
because you're basically paying
taxes on a piece of land.

00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:02.095
So buying a multi-unit property.

00:49:02.095 --> 00:49:04.790
When you do an investment
for cash flow-- remember,

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:07.430
I told you appreciation,
cash flow, and flipping.

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:11.502
A one-family is good for
flipping because you're

00:49:11.502 --> 00:49:12.960
buying it low and
you're selling it

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:17.180
to someone who wants to be
an end user, own and occupy.

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:21.470
For cash flow, you want
a two-family and up.

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:23.281
You could even do a
commercial property.

00:49:23.281 --> 00:49:25.780
Just remember that when you're
buying a commercial property,

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:28.210
if you're taking out a loan,
you have to put a bigger

00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:30.320
down payment on the property.

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:32.130
Now, how do you beat
out negotiation?

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:35.710
Beating out negotiation
is one, cash is king.

00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:40.080
So if you do have cash,
you out beat the person

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:41.442
who does have a loan.

00:49:41.442 --> 00:49:42.900
That doesn't mean
you can't get it.

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:45.070
You can get a foreclosure
or an investment property

00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:45.940
with a loan.

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:47.770
But if there's a
lot of competition,

00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:49.900
the people with the
cash are going to win.

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:51.240
Why are they going to win?

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:56.870
Because it's more
guaranteed that it will go.

00:49:56.870 --> 00:50:00.010
Two, it's faster.

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:01.510
So that's how they're
looking at it.

00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:04.370
The bank and the broker is
looking at the speed of it.

00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:07.890
And three, if there is
something wrong, too much

00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:10.180
wrong with the house, then
the bank may not give you

00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:14.780
the loan because remember, it's
an investment for the bank too.

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:16.430
So if they're giving
you this money,

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:19.500
they want to make sure that
they're putting their money

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:22.340
into something that is OK.

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:24.780
If it has too many
issues, they want.

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:28.320
So I would say two-family in up.

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:32.020
A commercial is also OK because
you can rent out the store.

00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:35.040
You can rent out the
apartments on top.

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:37.130
But you want to go
into neighborhoods

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:41.890
that are not developed
yet, but they're coming.

00:50:41.890 --> 00:50:42.770
They're coming.

00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:45.930
And when you see them, you have
to jump into them before they

00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:47.070
become that neighborhood.

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:49.520
Like I said, East
New York in Brooklyn,

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.377
I predicted it was
coming a long time ago

00:50:52.377 --> 00:50:54.210
because if you know
East New York, if anyone

00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:58.020
is from Brooklyn, it has
the C Line and the A Line.

00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:02.430
That's a straight train
line from East New York

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:03.800
straight to Manhattan.

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:06.540
Right, where I live in
Brooklyn, is a two-fare zone.

00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:09.520
I got to jump on a bus, then
another bus, to the train,

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:13.280
just to get to the train,
whereas seeing the A right

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:14.970
there at your corner straight.

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:17.644
Another thing is East New
York has a lot of land left.

00:51:17.644 --> 00:51:19.060
It's one of the
only neighborhoods

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:20.640
that had a lot of land.

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.090
The reason why I
knew it was going

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:24.260
to be the next neighborhood
is because I started

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.300
watching what they were doing.

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:31.610
They started planting
trees on the service lanes.

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:32.970
Now why you say, trees?

00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:34.690
What does that have
to do with anything?

00:51:34.690 --> 00:51:37.650
What does a nice, pretty
neighborhood look like?

00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:39.590
A tree-lined block.

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:41.810
Now, the homes in
East New York, there

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:43.150
were a lot of foreclosures.

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:45.080
There were homes
going really cheap.

00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:48.090
That's where I was
telling my clients,

00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:49.850
this is where you need to buy.

00:51:49.850 --> 00:51:52.830
Sure enough, that's the
neighborhood that's booming.

00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:57.090
So anyone who did actually
buy in that neighborhood when

00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:59.980
I was predicting it,
their dollar is going

00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:01.147
to be very, very strong now.

00:52:01.147 --> 00:52:02.396
So that's what you want to do.

00:52:02.396 --> 00:52:03.920
You want to get
into a neighborhood

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:06.387
before it becomes the
next neighborhood.

00:52:06.387 --> 00:52:07.220
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:08.553
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: Thank you.

00:52:11.419 --> 00:52:11.960
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:14.740
Thanks for speaking
with us today.

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:16.540
Speaking of up and
coming neighborhoods,

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:19.750
do you have any
recommendations in the five

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:22.320
boroughs, Jersey
City, just this area?

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:27.160
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: Yeah,
Jersey City is becoming hot.

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:31.210
I know in the Bronx, the
Grand Concourse over there

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:34.730
is becoming pretty
hot over there.

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:37.790
You want to look
at neighborhoods

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:42.090
that have a lot of land.

00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:44.510
That's one that you
want to look at, or have

00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:46.150
a lot of warehousing.

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:49.130
You also want to check
this New York City

00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:53.030
Department of Planning to
see where they're rezoning.

00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:55.650
Where are they rezoning?

00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:57.530
And the city zoners,
you can actually

00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:00.180
sit down with the city
zoners and talk to them.

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.790
Another thing is you
want to look at--

00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:04.507
and they're not
paying me, so I'm not

00:53:04.507 --> 00:53:05.590
going to name their names.

00:53:05.590 --> 00:53:13.210
But you want to look at some
of the chain stores, the coffee

00:53:13.210 --> 00:53:15.490
shops, the restaurants.

00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:16.950
Where are they going?

00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:19.010
Because when you see
where they're going,

00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:20.900
that means that they've
done their research

00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:22.210
on that neighborhood.

00:53:22.210 --> 00:53:25.310
So if you see them popping
up in certain areas,

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:27.690
those are areas you want to
be able to come in and buy

00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:29.780
a house around.

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:35.890
Schools are a very good place to
buy around because-- colleges,

00:53:35.890 --> 00:53:39.040
I mean, because when
the colleges are there,

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:43.289
a lot of times, people stay,
the graduates stay in that area.

00:53:43.289 --> 00:53:44.080
So those are areas.

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:48.750
But also, a lot of times--
this mayor hasn't done it.

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:51.780
But I know Mayor
Bloomberg did it.

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:57.720
He put out plans of where
he's going to revitalize

00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.290
those neighborhoods.

00:53:59.290 --> 00:54:02.030
Also, if you find a
neighborhood that you're really

00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:06.980
attracted to, go to their
local community board and sit.

00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:08.920
They're free and they're
open to the public.

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:10.337
And you don't have
to be a member.

00:54:10.337 --> 00:54:12.378
You don't even have to
live in that neighborhood.

00:54:12.378 --> 00:54:14.090
You can just go to
their community board.

00:54:14.090 --> 00:54:16.970
And you can hear
about what they're

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:19.730
planning on doing to the
neighborhood, what restaurants

00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:21.260
are coming to that neighborhood.

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:24.770
And those are ways to
be able to tell as well.

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:29.940
They also have the
Public Safety Committee.

00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:31.950
And you can look at
the level of crime

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:35.090
as well because when a
neighborhood is going

00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:39.940
to be revitalized,
they go and they

00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:43.140
make sure that the crime
is actually going down.

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:46.400
So that's and area as well
that you may want to go to.

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:49.820
So it's all about
just analyzing it.

00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:52.440
East New York is still
very low in price.

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:55.300
And the value is
going to come up big.

00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:57.990
So that's something that you
want to just look at as well.

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:02.610
Any other questions?

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:04.710
Well, I want to thank you all.

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:09.090
If you have any other
questions now or later,

00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:10.360
you can always email me.

00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:11.870
You can always call me.

00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:14.720
That is my office number.

00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:19.580
That is my company cell number
that you can call me on.

00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:22.570
You can text that
number as well.

00:55:22.570 --> 00:55:24.287
And if you have any
questions and you're

00:55:24.287 --> 00:55:25.870
interested in investing
or if you just

00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:30.400
want to sit down and go through
what your needs and wants

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.180
as an investor is-- you
may not want to invest now,

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:35.790
but you may want to
invest in two years or so,

00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:40.390
and just want to get a feel of
how can you get on that path.

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:41.290
Thank you.

00:55:41.290 --> 00:55:43.938
[APPLAUSE]
