00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:02.104
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.104 --> 00:00:05.815
is think about how shapes' properties

00:00:05.815 --> 00:00:09.667
might be preserved or not
preserved from dilations

00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:11.378
and so here we have this quadrilateral

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:14.206
and we're going to dilate
it about point P here

00:00:14.206 --> 00:00:17.104
and I have this little Dilation tool.

00:00:17.104 --> 00:00:18.422
So the first question is

00:00:18.422 --> 00:00:21.756
are the coordinates of the
vertices going to be preserved?

00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:24.249
Well, pause the video and
try to think about that.

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:26.165
Let's just try it out experimentally.

00:00:26.165 --> 00:00:29.185
We can see under an
arbitrary dilation here,

00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:30.906
the coordinates are not preserved.

00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:32.577
The point that corresponds to D

00:00:32.577 --> 00:00:34.382
now has a different coordinate.

00:00:34.382 --> 00:00:37.155
The vertices, the vertex
that corresponds to A

00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:38.460
now has different coordinates.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.049
Same thing for B and C.

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:42.372
The corresponding points
after the dilation

00:00:42.372 --> 00:00:46.164
now sit on a different part
of the coordinate plane.

00:00:46.164 --> 00:00:48.030
So in this case, the
coordinates of the vertices

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.988
are not preserved.

00:00:49.988 --> 00:00:53.528
Now, the next question, let
me go back to where we were.

00:00:53.528 --> 00:00:54.694
So the next question,

00:00:54.694 --> 00:00:57.937
the corresponding line
segments after dilation,

00:00:57.937 --> 00:01:00.997
are they sitting on the same line

00:01:00.997 --> 00:01:03.164
and so let me dilate again

00:01:04.094 --> 00:01:07.440
and so you can see if you
consider this point B prime

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.191
'cause it corresponds to point B,

00:01:09.191 --> 00:01:11.837
the segment B prime C prime,

00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:15.170
this does not sit on the same line as BC

00:01:16.278 --> 00:01:18.278
but the segment D prime,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.764
the corresponding line
segment to line segment AD,

00:01:22.764 --> 00:01:24.930
that does sit on the same line

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.131
and if you think about why that is,

00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:30.464
well, if we originally draw a line that,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.308
if we look at the line
that contains segment AD,

00:01:36.308 --> 00:01:40.180
it also goes through point
P and so as we expand out,

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.767
this segment right over here

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:45.926
is going to expand and shift
outward along the same lines

00:01:45.926 --> 00:01:48.938
but that's not going to be
true of these other segments

00:01:48.938 --> 00:01:50.407
because they don't,

00:01:50.407 --> 00:01:53.265
because the point P
does not sit on the line

00:01:53.265 --> 00:01:55.959
that those segments sit on

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:57.838
and so let's just expand it again

00:01:57.838 --> 00:02:00.082
so you see that right over there.

00:02:00.082 --> 00:02:03.424
Now, the next question, are
angle measures preserved?

00:02:03.424 --> 00:02:04.770
Well, it looks like they are

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.626
and this is one of the things

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:07.786
that is true about a dilation

00:02:07.786 --> 00:02:10.150
is that you're going to
preserve angle measures.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.905
This angle is still a right angle.

00:02:11.905 --> 00:02:14.751
This angle here, I guess
you can call it angle,

00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:16.094
the measure of angle B

00:02:16.094 --> 00:02:18.468
is the same as the
measure of angle B prime

00:02:18.468 --> 00:02:21.809
and you can see it with all of
these points right over there

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:22.814
and then the last question.

00:02:22.814 --> 00:02:27.113
Are side lengths, perimeter
and area preserved?

00:02:27.113 --> 00:02:30.175
Well, we can immediately
see as we dilate outwards,

00:02:30.175 --> 00:02:32.913
for example, the segment
corresponding to AD

00:02:32.913 --> 00:02:34.011
has gotten longer.

00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:37.078
In fact, if we dilate
outwards, all of the segments,

00:02:37.078 --> 00:02:39.041
the corresponding segments
are getting larger

00:02:39.041 --> 00:02:40.504
and if they're all getting larger

00:02:40.504 --> 00:02:41.975
then the perimeter's getting larger

00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:43.358
and the area's getting larger.

00:02:43.358 --> 00:02:45.766
Likewise, if we dilate in like this,

00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:47.193
they're all getting smaller.

00:02:47.193 --> 00:02:51.232
So side lengths, perimeter
and area are not preserved.

00:02:51.232 --> 00:02:54.536
Now, let's ask the same
questions with another dilation

00:02:54.536 --> 00:02:55.676
and this is going to be interesting

00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:57.389
because we're going to look at a dilation

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.270
that is centered at one of
the vertices of our shape.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.437
So let me scroll down here

00:03:04.775 --> 00:03:07.913
and so I have the same tool again

00:03:07.913 --> 00:03:10.484
and now here we have a
triangle, triangle ABC

00:03:10.484 --> 00:03:13.906
and we're gonna dilate about point C.

00:03:13.906 --> 00:03:16.359
So first of all, do we think the vertices,

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.625
the coordinates of the vertices
are going to be preserved?

00:03:19.625 --> 00:03:21.414
Let's dilate out.

00:03:21.414 --> 00:03:24.729
Well, you can see point C is preserved.

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:26.526
When it gets mapped after the dilation,

00:03:26.526 --> 00:03:28.484
it sits in the exact same place

00:03:28.484 --> 00:03:32.482
but the things that correspond
to A and B are not preserved.

00:03:32.482 --> 00:03:33.835
You could call this A prime

00:03:33.835 --> 00:03:36.119
and this definitely has
different coordinates than A

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:39.670
and B prime definitely has
different coordinates than B.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.319
Now, what about
corresponding line segments?

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.560
Are they on the same line?

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.887
Well, some of them are
and some of them aren't.

00:03:46.887 --> 00:03:50.016
So for example, when we dilate,

00:03:50.016 --> 00:03:54.460
so let's look at the segment
AC and the segment BC,

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.605
when we dilate, we can see, whoops,

00:03:57.605 --> 00:04:00.226
when we dilate, we can see
the corresponding segments,

00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:04.533
you could call this A prime
C prime or B prime C prime,

00:04:04.533 --> 00:04:06.991
do still sit on that same line

00:04:06.991 --> 00:04:10.622
and that's because the point
that we are dilating about,

00:04:10.622 --> 00:04:13.434
point C, sat on those original segments.

00:04:13.434 --> 00:04:15.845
So we're essentially just lengthening out

00:04:15.845 --> 00:04:18.655
on the point that is not
the center of dilation.

00:04:18.655 --> 00:04:20.490
We're lengthening out away from it

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.857
or if the dilation is going in,

00:04:22.857 --> 00:04:27.099
we would be shortening
along that same line

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:28.612
but some of the segments

00:04:28.612 --> 00:04:30.985
are not overlapping on the same line.

00:04:30.985 --> 00:04:33.432
So for example, A prime B prime

00:04:33.432 --> 00:04:36.682
does not sit along the same line as AB.

00:04:37.796 --> 00:04:39.718
Now, what about the angle measures?

00:04:39.718 --> 00:04:41.346
Well, we already talked about it.

00:04:41.346 --> 00:04:43.882
Angle measures are
preserved under dilations.

00:04:43.882 --> 00:04:47.120
The measure of angle C here,
this is the exact same angle

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.092
and so is the measure of angle
you could call this A prime

00:04:50.092 --> 00:04:52.652
and B prime right over here.

00:04:52.652 --> 00:04:54.978
And then finally, what about side lengths?

00:04:54.978 --> 00:04:58.397
Well, you can clearly see
that when I dilate out,

00:04:58.397 --> 00:05:01.090
my side lengths increase
or if I dilate in,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.677
my side lengths decrease

00:05:02.677 --> 00:05:05.168
and so side lengths are not preserved

00:05:05.168 --> 00:05:06.842
and if side lengths are not preserved

00:05:06.842 --> 00:05:08.597
then the perimeter is not preserved

00:05:08.597 --> 00:05:10.754
and also the area is not preserved.

00:05:10.754 --> 00:05:13.891
You could view area as a
function of the side lengths.

00:05:13.891 --> 00:05:15.115
As we dilate out like this,

00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:17.314
the perimeter grows and so does the area.

00:05:17.314 --> 00:05:18.748
If we dilate in like this,

00:05:18.748 --> 00:05:22.265
the perimeter shrinks
and so does the area.
