question in my mind like how to slavery
even begin and then what does it evolve

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349
even begin and then what does it evolve
 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.860
even begin and then what does it evolve
into its there's never been a day in

not in every society however and that's
 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.030
not in every society however and that's
also kind of important because it's not
