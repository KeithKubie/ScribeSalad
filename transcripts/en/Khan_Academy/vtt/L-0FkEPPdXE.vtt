00:00:00.623 --> 00:00:02.172
Lecturer: Let's do a warm up where we

00:00:02.172 --> 00:00:04.980
figure out the electron configuration

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.622
of Xenon right over here
and then we can use that

00:00:08.622 --> 00:00:10.721
as the basis for starting to explore the

00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:13.851
electron configurations
of F block elements.

00:00:13.851 --> 00:00:15.634
And in particular, we'll try to figure out

00:00:15.634 --> 00:00:19.807
the electron configuration of Neodymium.

00:00:19.807 --> 00:00:21.163
I always have trouble pronouncing these.

00:00:21.163 --> 00:00:24.104
Neodymium I believe is
how it's pronounced.

00:00:24.104 --> 00:00:25.451
So let's first work on Xenon.

00:00:25.451 --> 00:00:27.112
I encourage you to
actually pause the video

00:00:27.112 --> 00:00:28.301
and try to come up with the

00:00:28.301 --> 00:00:32.693
electron configuration
for Xenon on your own.

00:00:33.755 --> 00:00:35.507
So I'm assuming you've had a go at it

00:00:35.507 --> 00:00:36.619
so we can just go through it.

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:40.677
So it's going to be one S two then

00:00:40.677 --> 00:00:42.458
we go to the second period.

00:00:42.458 --> 00:00:47.890
Two S two and then we're
going to the two P subshell.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.112
So one, two, three, four, five, six.

00:00:50.112 --> 00:00:56.620
Two P six then three s two then

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:05.213
three p six then we go four s two

00:01:05.213 --> 00:01:07.714
and now we are in the D block.

00:01:07.714 --> 00:01:09.384
And remember, the D
block, even though we're

00:01:09.384 --> 00:01:11.269
in the fourth period, we're going to

00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:14.524
actually fill in the three D subshell.

00:01:14.524 --> 00:01:16.643
We take the period minus
one, so it's going to be

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:19.628
three D, and to fill it up we have

00:01:19.628 --> 00:01:21.547
one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:25.473
seven, eight, nine, 10, three D 10.

00:01:25.473 --> 00:01:26.878
Then you're back in the P block

00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:28.215
and since you're in the fourth period,

00:01:28.215 --> 00:01:31.680
it's gonna be four P, and once again to

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.948
fill it up, you have six electrons.

00:01:34.948 --> 00:01:38.226
And then we go to the fifth period.

00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:42.553
Five S two and then we're going to go...

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.132
The period is five but
we're in the D block

00:01:45.132 --> 00:01:49.153
so we're going to go back
to the four D subshell.

00:01:49.338 --> 00:01:54.930
Four D 10 and then we come back and Xenon

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.610
perfectly fills out the five P subshell.

00:01:59.888 --> 00:02:03.149
Five P six.

00:02:03.311 --> 00:02:07.480
So that's the electron
configuration of Xenon.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.713
So now let's think about what the

00:02:08.713 --> 00:02:15.397
electron configuration of Neodymium is.

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:16.655
So one thing that you're saying, "Hey,

00:02:16.655 --> 00:02:19.629
"what's going on with this
F block right over here?

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.614
"Just kind of this island of elements."

00:02:22.614 --> 00:02:24.534
And it's really not an island.

00:02:24.534 --> 00:02:26.250
The reason that they put these colors here

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.804
is because the F block actually belongs

00:02:28.804 --> 00:02:31.853
right here and if people had more width on

00:02:31.853 --> 00:02:34.839
pages to display these periodic tables,

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:37.705
they would shove the D and the P blocks

00:02:37.705 --> 00:02:38.973
over to the right and

00:02:38.973 --> 00:02:41.396
stuff the F blocks right over here.

00:02:41.396 --> 00:02:42.473
And we actually did that and I actually

00:02:42.473 --> 00:02:43.489
like to look at it that way because

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.427
it makes it clear it's
not really an island

00:02:45.427 --> 00:02:47.232
and it actually kind of fits

00:02:47.232 --> 00:02:49.885
in the pattern of the periodic table.

00:02:49.885 --> 00:02:51.995
That is right over here.

00:02:52.103 --> 00:02:57.354
This right over here is our F block.

00:02:57.821 --> 00:02:59.627
So that is our...

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.138
This right over here is our f block.

00:03:06.255 --> 00:03:08.880
So given that, lets figure out

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.989
the electron configuration for Neodymium.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:14.729
And I'll give you a hint.

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:18.300
In the D block you go back and back fill

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.534
one subshell below the

00:03:20.534 --> 00:03:23.732
one shell below the period that you're in.

00:03:23.732 --> 00:03:27.570
In the F block you go two,
you go back two shells.

00:03:27.677 --> 00:03:30.910
So here, we're not filling
out the six F subshell,

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.980
not even the five F subshell,
but the four F subshell.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.799
So given that, figure out

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.541
how much more do we have to add.

00:03:39.541 --> 00:03:42.410
How much more do we have to go past Xenon

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.324
in order to get its
electron configuration.

00:03:45.324 --> 00:03:46.582
So I encourage you to pause the video

00:03:46.582 --> 00:03:49.222
and figure that out
right now for Neodymium.

00:03:50.593 --> 00:03:52.100
So I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.634
So Neodymium is going to have the

00:03:55.634 --> 00:03:58.816
electron configuration of Xenon

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:03.811
so Xenon gets us right over.

00:04:03.811 --> 00:04:07.664
It's the highest atomic
number noble gas that

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:11.979
has a smaller atomic
number than Neodymium.

00:04:13.716 --> 00:04:15.137
So we can start with that, which we

00:04:15.137 --> 00:04:17.860
already saw is fairly involved.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.577
And then to that we just add

00:04:19.577 --> 00:04:21.930
the incremental higher energy electrons.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.672
So now we're in the sixth period so

00:04:23.672 --> 00:04:27.802
we're gonna go six S two,
that's that right over there.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.701
That's six S two and now we're filling,

00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:34.348
we're gonna start going into
the F subshell but it's not

00:04:34.348 --> 00:04:37.241
gonna be the sixth
shell, it's gonna go two.

00:04:37.341 --> 00:04:38.962
It's gonna be our period minus two

00:04:38.962 --> 00:04:41.460
so it's gonna be four.

00:04:41.815 --> 00:04:43.597
Let me use a color you can see.

00:04:43.794 --> 00:04:45.128
So this gonna be, we are

00:04:45.128 --> 00:04:47.146
four electrons into that subshell.

00:04:47.146 --> 00:04:53.293
One, two, three, four so
it's gonna be four F four.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.550
So we're in the sixth period but

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.483
since we're in the F block, we're gonna

00:04:56.483 --> 00:04:59.222
go back, fill it to the fourth shell.

00:04:59.222 --> 00:05:00.899
That's the fourth shell right over there.

00:05:00.922 --> 00:05:03.091
And we are one, two, three, four,

00:05:03.091 --> 00:05:05.270
four electrons into it.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.845
And so this is neat shorthand because

00:05:06.845 --> 00:05:09.482
the other way to write
the electron configuration

00:05:09.482 --> 00:05:14.566
of Neodymium would have been to do this.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.576
Would have been to write down
all of this, let me do that.

00:05:20.576 --> 00:05:23.328
To have all of this, let
me copy and paste it.

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:25.431
Actually I think that's going to take

00:05:25.431 --> 00:05:27.218
up too much space, let's see.

00:05:27.218 --> 00:05:28.584
So.

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:33.998
To write all of that, copy and paste.

00:05:35.341 --> 00:05:41.365
To write all of that and then
to add to that the six S two.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.796
Six S two and the four F four.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.907
Four F four and so hopefully you

00:05:49.907 --> 00:05:51.941
appreciate that this is a slightly

00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:54.167
more efficient way to write it.
