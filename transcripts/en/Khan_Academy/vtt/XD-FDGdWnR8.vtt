00:00:00.283 --> 00:00:01.862
- [Voiceover] Let's give
ourselves some practice

00:00:01.862 --> 00:00:03.650
solving equations.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.421
So let's say we had
the equation 1/3 plus A

00:00:08.421 --> 00:00:10.905
is equal to 5/3.

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:13.924
What is the A that makes
this equation true?

00:00:13.924 --> 00:00:17.604
If I had 1/3 plus this
A, what does A need to be

00:00:17.604 --> 00:00:22.604
in order for 1/3 plus
that to be equal to 5/3?

00:00:23.873 --> 00:00:27.135
So there's a bunch of
different ways of doing this,

00:00:27.135 --> 00:00:29.735
and this is one of the fun
things about equations is

00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:32.835
there's no exactly one right way to do it.

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:34.831
But let's think about
what at least I think

00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:36.004
might be the simplest way.

00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:38.105
And before I work through
anything, you should always try to

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.891
pause the video, and do it on your own.

00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:45.891
So what I like to think
about is can I have just my A

00:00:46.313 --> 00:00:47.892
on one side of the equation?

00:00:47.892 --> 00:00:49.536
And since it's already
on the left-hand side,

00:00:49.536 --> 00:00:51.440
let's see if I can keep
it on the left-hand side,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.831
but get rid of this 1/3 somehow.

00:00:53.831 --> 00:00:55.930
Well the easiest was I can
think of getting rid of

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.314
this 1/3 is to subtract
1/3 from the left-hand

00:00:59.314 --> 00:01:00.757
side of the equation.

00:01:00.757 --> 00:01:02.661
Now I can't just do that from the

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:04.298
left-hand side of the equation.

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:06.759
If 1/3 plus A is equal to 5/3,

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.719
and if I just subtract 1/3
from the left-hand side,

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:11.715
then they're not going
to be equal anymore.

00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:13.699
Then this thing is going to be 1/3 less,

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:15.059
which this thing isn't going to change.

00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:16.800
So then this thing on
the left would become

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.321
less than 5/3.

00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:20.862
So in order to hold the
equality, whatever I do on the

00:01:20.862 --> 00:01:23.986
left-hand side I have to do on
the right-hand side as well.

00:01:23.986 --> 00:01:26.819
So I have to subtract 1/3 from both sides.

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:30.313
And if I do that, then
on the left-hand side,

00:01:30.313 --> 00:01:32.391
1/3 minus 1/3, that's the whole reason why

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:35.190
I subtracted 1/3 was
to get rid of the 1/3,

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.190
and I am left with A is
equal to 5/3 minus 1/3,

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.055
5/3 minus 1/3,

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:49.762
minus 1/3, and what is
that going to be equal to?

00:01:49.762 --> 00:01:53.268
I have five of something,
in this case I have 5/3,

00:01:53.268 --> 00:01:55.893
and I'm gonna subtract 1/3.

00:01:55.893 --> 00:01:58.902
So I'm gonna be left with 4/3.

00:01:58.902 --> 00:02:03.902
So I could write A is equal to 4/3.

00:02:05.856 --> 00:02:07.482
And you could check to
make sure that works.

00:02:07.482 --> 00:02:12.482
1/3 plus 4/3 is indeed equal to 5/3.

00:02:12.972 --> 00:02:14.853
Let's do another one of these.

00:02:14.853 --> 00:02:19.853
So let's say that we have
the equation K minus eight

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.920
is equal to 11.8.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.522
So once again I wanna solve for K.

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:29.437
I wanna have just a K
on the left-hand side.

00:02:29.437 --> 00:02:33.477
I don't want this subtracting
this eight right over here.

00:02:33.477 --> 00:02:36.011
So in order to get rid of
this eight, let's add eight

00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:36.795
on the left-hand side.

00:02:36.795 --> 00:02:38.095
And of course, if I do
it on the left-hand side,

00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:40.278
I have to do it on the
right-hand side as well.

00:02:40.278 --> 00:02:42.775
So we're gonna add eight to both sides.

00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:45.524
The left-hand side, you
are substracting eight

00:02:45.524 --> 00:02:46.441
and then you're adding eight.

00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:47.615
That's just going to cancel out,

00:02:47.615 --> 00:02:49.761
and you're just going to be left with K.

00:02:49.761 --> 00:02:53.175
And on the right-hand
side, 11.8 plus eight.

00:02:53.175 --> 00:02:58.175
Well, 11 plus eight is 19,
so it's going to be 19.8.

00:02:58.758 --> 00:03:01.115
And we're done, and once again,
what's neat about equations,

00:03:01.115 --> 00:03:03.413
you can always check to see
if you got the right answer.

00:03:03.413 --> 00:03:07.803
19.8 minus eight is 11.8.

00:03:07.803 --> 00:03:10.542
Let's do another one,
this is too much fun.

00:03:10.542 --> 00:03:15.542
Alright, so let's say that
I had 5/13 is equal to

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:20.259
T minus 6/13.

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:22.362
Alright, this is interesting
'cause now I have my variable

00:03:22.362 --> 00:03:23.878
on the right-hand side.

00:03:23.878 --> 00:03:24.841
But let's just leave it there.

00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:27.545
Let's just see if we can
solve for T by getting rid of

00:03:27.545 --> 00:03:29.263
everything else on the right-hand side.

00:03:29.263 --> 00:03:33.663
And like we've done in the
past, if I'm subtracting 6/13,

00:03:33.663 --> 00:03:35.602
so why don't I just add it?

00:03:35.602 --> 00:03:37.424
Why don't I just add 6/13?

00:03:37.424 --> 00:03:38.776
I can't just do that
on the right-hand side.

00:03:38.776 --> 00:03:41.110
Then the two sides won't be equal anymore,

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.106
so I gotta do it on the
left-hand side if I wanna

00:03:43.106 --> 00:03:45.289
hold the equality.

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:47.007
So what happens?

00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:47.832
So what happens?

00:03:47.832 --> 00:03:50.466
On the left-hand side I have,

00:03:50.466 --> 00:03:52.126
let me give myself a
little bit more space,

00:03:52.126 --> 00:03:56.615
I have 5/13 plus 6/13,

00:03:57.548 --> 00:04:01.880
plus 6/13 are equal to,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.702
are equal to...

00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:06.745
Well, I was subtracting
6/13, now I add 6/13.

00:04:06.745 --> 00:04:09.135
Those are just going to add to zero.

00:04:09.135 --> 00:04:12.943
6/13 minus 6/13 is just
zero, so you're left with T.

00:04:12.943 --> 00:04:14.278
So T is equal to this.

00:04:14.278 --> 00:04:17.401
If I have 5/13 and I add to that 6/13,

00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:19.304
well I'm gonna have 11/13.

00:04:19.304 --> 00:04:24.018
So this is going to be
11/13 is equal to T,

00:04:24.018 --> 00:04:25.319
or I could write that
the other way around.

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:30.319
I could write T is equal to 11/13.
