what the fuck the article

00:00:06.205 --> 00:00:07.640
was trying to say,
but what I heard it saying

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:08.975
was that we were pissing out

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.544
thousands of dollars
of liquid gold.

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.215

- Tonight, I'm gonna
tell the story

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:12.739
of the last time I drank piss.

00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:22.415
Stop me if
you've heard this one.

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:23.749
First, I'm gonna explain

00:01:23.782 --> 00:01:25.451
how I went from
being totally normal

00:01:25.484 --> 00:01:29.555
to the kind of person that has
a story about drinking piss.

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:33.292
Multiple stories.

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:36.963
Okay, so like,
the first time I tried meth...

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:38.631
[audience laughs]

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:42.768
I was 22,
I was at a gig in Montana--

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:48.107
when in Rome--
and I tried it on accident.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.276
I would never purposely
try meth, I'm not a scumbag.

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:53.246
[audience laughs]

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.449
I thought it was coke.

00:01:56.482 --> 00:01:57.817
And I thought it was coke
'cause the guy

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.952
that gave it to me
told me it was coke.

00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:01.654
And what kind of world
are we living in

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:07.960
if you can't trust
a stranger giving you drugs?

00:02:07.993 --> 00:02:11.631
So I do the line, and the back
of my head catches on fire.

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.933
[audience laughs]

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:15.768
And I'm like,
did you just slip me meth?

00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:17.803
Who slips people--
so I yelled at him.

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:22.308
I was like, I don't even think
you roofie right, idiot.

00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:24.010
Supposed to roofie girls
so you can fuck 'em,

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:26.713
not so they can help you
take apart your microwave.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.490
Okay, so this is where
shit gets weird.

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:40.693
Here's the thing,
don't ever try meth.

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:43.062
'Cause it's fuckin' awesome.

00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:47.967
And you won't want to stop.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.535
I did the accidental
roofie meth

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:50.836
and was just addicted to meth

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:54.540
for six years after that.

00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:55.841
Like, ruined my life.

00:02:55.874 --> 00:02:57.410
I was just trying
to do a bump at the club

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:58.878
so I could learn
how to line dance

00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:01.747
or whatever the fuck they do
in Montana.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.149
Now I'm alone in my hotel room,

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:06.852
shaving off my eyebrows
and shit.

00:03:06.885 --> 00:03:08.187
I get back home
to Portland, Oregon.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.156
I quit doing comedy
so I could pursue

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.059
meth full-time.

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:19.832
Really seemed like
that was gonna work out

00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:22.034
better than it did.

00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:27.740
I mean, it probably paid
about the same.

00:03:27.773 --> 00:03:31.277
I see we have comedians
in here tonight.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.213
It was crazy, though,
'cause I was so high.

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:35.748
I was high as shit.

00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:37.583
So I didn't even realize

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:39.218
the gravity
of what was happening.

00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:40.886
I felt like I had
just discovered

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.388
the secret to happiness.

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:43.723
I got home.

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:45.391
I was bragging to my friends
and family

00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:48.060
about my newfound meth habit.

00:03:48.093 --> 00:03:50.730
Fuckin' none of them
were happy for me.

00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:52.298
And then I just
got defensive, like,

00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:55.568
"Well, this is who I am now,
so if you can't handle"--

00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:57.937
whatever fuckin'
Marilyn Monroe quote.

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:05.945
"You can't take me
at my meth-iest,

00:04:05.978 --> 00:04:09.315
you don't deserve me
when my trailer blows up."

00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:14.787
So my parents asked me
to vacate their basement

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.591
before I start selling off
the TVs and shit.

00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:20.660
And I move into
this sketchy meth hostel

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:22.996
with multiple dudes
named Shorty.

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:31.404
And I just go
completely off the rails.

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.773
Here's the thing, though,
when you're high on meth,

00:04:33.806 --> 00:04:36.309
you can justify
any kind of behavior.

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:39.078
You can rationalize, like,
everything just makes sense.

00:04:39.111 --> 00:04:41.447
I think it's 'cause your mind
is so open.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.683
Like, if you watch a video
on the Internet of somebody

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:45.418
vacuuming their front yard
on meth,

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:46.919
you're like, "That is crazy."

00:04:46.952 --> 00:04:50.056
That's 'cause you're only using
6% of your brain.

00:04:55.494 --> 00:04:58.464
If you were firing off
at 98% meth capacity,

00:04:58.497 --> 00:05:02.468
you would be like, "Fuck,
that makes perfect sense!

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:07.973
My yard is filthy!"

00:05:08.006 --> 00:05:09.475
So, still, nothing
seemed amiss to me.

00:05:09.508 --> 00:05:12.011
I'm living with the Shorties,
I've got no job,

00:05:12.044 --> 00:05:15.147
I lost my driver's license,
I lost contact with my family,

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.719
but I was in daily
communication with the aliens.

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:22.188
Blues and grays, it was wild.

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:25.491
My teeth fell out so fast,
it was like how I imagine

00:05:25.524 --> 00:05:29.161
if a witch put a spell on you.

00:05:29.194 --> 00:05:31.464
They just crumble like they're
made of sand and hairspray.

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:35.668
I was just--
[spitting]

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:36.903
Sorry.

00:05:39.104 --> 00:05:40.673
And my whole life
revolved around meth.

00:05:40.706 --> 00:05:42.842
All I cared about was meth,
but I-I was like, yeah,

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:47.012
but like,
I'm only snorting it.

00:05:47.045 --> 00:05:49.048
That's practically
recreational.

00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:51.016
I'm not like an addict
like those guys that smoke it.

00:05:51.049 --> 00:05:54.520
Look at them, they're a mess.

00:05:54.553 --> 00:05:55.654
So when I started smoking it...

00:05:55.687 --> 00:05:57.890
[audience laughs]

00:06:00.225 --> 00:06:02.528
That was a social decis--
I knew, I was like,

00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:04.029
I'm gonna be here for a while,

00:06:04.062 --> 00:06:06.065
and I want to integrate
into my meth community.

00:06:06.098 --> 00:06:07.666
You know what I mean,
I want to, like,

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:08.868
kind of plug in,

00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:10.202
and it was a social thing
for them.

00:06:10.235 --> 00:06:12.037
They would sit around
and smoke meth

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.510
and talk about where they
were gonna steal mail that day.

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:19.712
It was like joining
the tweakers' Elks Lodge,

00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:21.280
you know, so I was like...

00:06:21.313 --> 00:06:23.182
and by that point,
I had been doing it long enough

00:06:23.215 --> 00:06:25.584
to know that as long as
I don't shoot up, I'll be fine.

00:06:25.617 --> 00:06:26.786
Right?

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:29.455
So when I started
shooting up...

00:06:29.488 --> 00:06:30.956
[audience laughs]

00:06:30.989 --> 00:06:32.958
That was a financial decision.

00:06:32.991 --> 00:06:34.693
Because you have to
smoke that shit all day.

00:06:34.726 --> 00:06:35.928
It is not cost effective
at all.

00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:37.229
You can shoot up
once in the morning,

00:06:37.262 --> 00:06:39.064
you're good
for the rest of the day.

00:06:39.097 --> 00:06:40.866
It's probably the most
fiscally responsible decision

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:44.537
I've made as an adult,
if I'm being honest.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.372
But I have super small veins,

00:06:46.405 --> 00:06:48.574
so I had to shoot up
in my neck.

00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:53.746
Yeah, sorry, I'm trying
to ease you guys in here.

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:55.848
It gets way the fuck worse.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.587
Shooting up
in your neck is, um...

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.888
Inconvenient.

00:07:02.921 --> 00:07:05.991
[audience laughs]

00:07:06.024 --> 00:07:08.127
'Cause someone else
has to do that for you.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.129
And the kind of people
that possess the skill set

00:07:10.162 --> 00:07:12.398
to hit you in your jugular...

00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:16.769
Not the kind of people
that are fun to do meth with.

00:07:16.802 --> 00:07:18.471
I was into, like,
making necklaces

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:19.472
and collage art and shit.

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:20.473
They were into, like,

00:07:20.506 --> 00:07:21.474
home invasions

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:23.476
and snuff porn.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.316
So shit gets kind of dark
around this point.

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:32.151
And this is when
I start thinking, like,

00:07:32.184 --> 00:07:34.353
God, there's got
to be a better way.

00:07:34.386 --> 00:07:36.355
Not, like, get sober
or anything fuckin' stupid.

00:07:36.388 --> 00:07:40.025
Just, like, a better way
to do meth.

00:07:40.058 --> 00:07:42.028
So I was Googling it.

00:07:45.297 --> 00:07:47.333
Not enough information
on the subject,

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:49.602
but I came across this article,
and it was talking--

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:51.136
it was, like, "Time" magazine
or something.

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:53.339
It was talking about
the meth epidemic,

00:07:53.372 --> 00:07:54.874
and the reason
that so many people

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:56.642
were switching
from cocaine to meth.

00:07:56.675 --> 00:08:00.145
Apparently, some people
had done this on purpose.

00:08:00.178 --> 00:08:02.147
And according to the article,
the reason is

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.682
because the meth high
lasts so long.

00:08:03.715 --> 00:08:05.451
And according to the article,
that's because your body

00:08:05.484 --> 00:08:09.388
can metabolize coke,
but your body has no idea--

00:08:09.421 --> 00:08:11.223
you do a line,
and then it breaks it down,

00:08:11.256 --> 00:08:12.691
and you're only high until
it starts breaking it down,

00:08:12.724 --> 00:08:14.226
but your body has no idea
what to do with meth.

00:08:14.259 --> 00:08:15.694
That's why you're high so long.

00:08:15.727 --> 00:08:17.363
'Cause it goes in meth,
and comes out meth.

00:08:17.396 --> 00:08:19.031
And you get to stay high
that whole time.

00:08:19.064 --> 00:08:20.566
So I don't really know
what the fuck the article

00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:22.301
was trying to say,
but what I heard it saying

00:08:22.334 --> 00:08:23.636
was that we were pissing out

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:25.538
thousands of dollars
of liquid gold.

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:28.608
[laughter and applause]

00:08:37.716 --> 00:08:40.186
And I was gonna be rich.

00:08:49.127 --> 00:08:51.063
So I originally set out
to find the formula

00:08:51.096 --> 00:08:53.365
for extracting meth
from tweaker piss,

00:08:53.398 --> 00:08:55.668
as I'm collecting buckets
of my friend's urine,

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:58.671
once again, there are
no red flags going off,

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:00.673
no thoughts that perhaps
this is symptomatic

00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:02.942
of my life spiraling
out of my control.

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:04.376
I was proud of myself,
I was like,

00:09:04.409 --> 00:09:08.047
"Wow, I am really thinking
outside the box."

00:09:14.586 --> 00:09:17.590
"This must be what
Steve Jobs feels like."

00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:21.627
So, after about ten days
of trying to do science,

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.129
I was like,
"Meh, chemistry's hard.

00:09:24.162 --> 00:09:26.432
I'm just gonna drink it
from the tap."

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.607
You're so grossed out.
It was my own piss.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.141
Give me some credit--
I wasn't, like,

00:09:36.174 --> 00:09:38.177
ladling it out of the bucket.

00:09:43.015 --> 00:09:45.518
So the first time
I drank meth piss...

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:52.591
I got so high that I went
to the place in "The Matrix"

00:09:52.624 --> 00:09:54.093
where, like,
they plug their heads in

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:57.096
and nobody wears makeup?

00:09:57.129 --> 00:09:59.298
But I went to the real one.

00:09:59.331 --> 00:10:01.100
And I met my higher self.

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:03.602
And I met the higher selves
of, like, my friends and shit,

00:10:03.635 --> 00:10:05.437
and they taught me the true
nature of consciousness

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.239
and the wiring under the board.

00:10:07.272 --> 00:10:09.241
It was the most transcendental
experience I've ever had,

00:10:09.274 --> 00:10:10.776
and I've done a shit ton
of psychedelics,

00:10:10.809 --> 00:10:13.112
in case that's not obvious.

00:10:13.145 --> 00:10:15.114
I spent the whole day
at the Matrix place.

00:10:15.147 --> 00:10:17.082
And when I came down,
I was so transformed

00:10:17.115 --> 00:10:19.084
by this experience
that I was just addicted

00:10:19.117 --> 00:10:22.087
to drinking meth piss.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.523
Here's the thing,
don't ever drink meth piss,

00:10:24.556 --> 00:10:26.291
'cause it's fantastic,
and you won't want

00:10:26.324 --> 00:10:29.629
to do any other drugs.

00:10:31.496 --> 00:10:33.098
I did quit shooting up
that day, though,

00:10:33.131 --> 00:10:34.633
'cause there was, like,
no point, right?

00:10:34.666 --> 00:10:36.802
Started eating meth
with a spoon out of the bag.

00:10:36.835 --> 00:10:39.338
'Cause doing actual meth
just became a technicality

00:10:39.371 --> 00:10:42.508
to manufacturing meth piss.

00:10:48.847 --> 00:10:50.315
I had it down to a science.

00:10:50.348 --> 00:10:52.785
It was the second piss
after you eat the meth

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:54.853
that was the magical nectar.

00:10:54.886 --> 00:10:56.722
I told everyone about it.

00:10:56.755 --> 00:10:58.658
I converted no one.

00:11:02.527 --> 00:11:04.163
I did get voted most likely

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:06.832
to become a bag lady
by my fellow tweakers,

00:11:06.865 --> 00:11:08.534
'cause by that point,
I spent my days

00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:10.135
raging against
the reptilian agenda

00:11:10.168 --> 00:11:12.171
while sippin' on my pizz-urp.

00:11:20.412 --> 00:11:24.416
So the last time
I drank meth piss...

00:11:24.449 --> 00:11:26.251
I'll get to the point--
where I'm walking around

00:11:26.284 --> 00:11:29.221
southeast Portland,
and it was, I had a--

00:11:29.254 --> 00:11:32.324
it was time to harvest,
if you will.

00:11:32.357 --> 00:11:34.259
And I didn't like to do it
in public restrooms

00:11:34.292 --> 00:11:36.429
'cause it was hard
to get a clean catch.

00:11:38.063 --> 00:11:40.265
And the only person that I knew
that lived in that neighborhood

00:11:40.298 --> 00:11:42.534
was my little sister,
and my little sister,

00:11:42.567 --> 00:11:44.203
at this point,
is the only family member

00:11:44.236 --> 00:11:46.205
that I will speak to
because she's the only one

00:11:46.238 --> 00:11:50.676
I can be sure isn't working
for George Bush.

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:52.244
But we are like
complete opposites.

00:11:52.277 --> 00:11:53.545
She is 20 years old.

00:11:53.578 --> 00:11:55.547
She totally has
her shit together.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.716
She has an apartment, job,
car, boyfriend, whatever.

00:11:57.749 --> 00:12:01.120
I'm 27, I--
don't really have to clarify

00:12:01.153 --> 00:12:02.688
that I didn't
have my shit together.

00:12:02.721 --> 00:12:06.925
I was... rolling up
to her house to drink piss.

00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:09.428
She's also embarrassed of me,
which, rightfully so.

00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:14.199
When I knock on her door,
I'm wearing my meth uniform,

00:12:14.232 --> 00:12:16.468
which is a bubblegum-pink
ball gown,

00:12:16.501 --> 00:12:18.570
like, prom dress,
like, puffed out--

00:12:18.603 --> 00:12:21.473
like, you know, with tulle
and satin and shit out to here,

00:12:21.506 --> 00:12:26.445
Skechers,
a stolen FBI windbreaker,

00:12:26.478 --> 00:12:29.948
a Barbie backpack,
and a tiara.

00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:31.884
The tiara was 'cause
I didn't have any teeth left.

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:33.619
You don't have a grill,
you got to wear a tiara

00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:35.621
'cause it draws
the eyes upward.

00:12:43.628 --> 00:12:45.264
She answers the door
and sees that it's me,

00:12:45.297 --> 00:12:47.599
and she's like, ah, um...

00:12:47.632 --> 00:12:51.470
My friends are here,
and they don't get it.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.743
Could you maybe
come back never?

00:12:57.776 --> 00:13:00.145
And I was like, I don't give
a fuck about your friends.

00:13:00.178 --> 00:13:01.780
I just need to
use your bathroom.

00:13:01.813 --> 00:13:03.749
And she was like, oh, my God,
are you gonna shoot up?

00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:05.617
And I was like, no,
I don't shoot up anymore.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.186
I'm living right.

00:13:09.287 --> 00:13:10.789
She says fine,
you have two minutes,

00:13:10.822 --> 00:13:12.958
but I swear to God,
you have to leave after that.

00:13:12.991 --> 00:13:14.626
So I go in there, I waste
my entire two-minute allotment

00:13:14.659 --> 00:13:17.029
just rifling through
her cupboards,

00:13:17.062 --> 00:13:19.298
just trying to find like, some
type of receptacle to piss in.

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:20.799
She doesn't even have
a cup or anything.

00:13:20.832 --> 00:13:22.434
I'm like, what kind of
barbaric-ass

00:13:22.467 --> 00:13:25.637
bathroom operation
you running here?

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:29.474
Finally, the only thing I can
find is her toothbrush holder.

00:13:29.507 --> 00:13:34.446
I know, right?
Get a fucking cup.

00:13:34.479 --> 00:13:36.481
So I knocked the
toothbrushes out of it,

00:13:36.514 --> 00:13:37.783
and it's like
the cheap plastic kind,

00:13:37.816 --> 00:13:39.484
you know what
I'm talking about?

00:13:39.517 --> 00:13:40.619
Comes from Walmart,
comes inside a waste basket

00:13:40.652 --> 00:13:41.820
with, like, a shitty bath mat,

00:13:41.853 --> 00:13:42.988
you know what I'm talking
about?

00:13:43.021 --> 00:13:44.323
And it's got four holes,

00:13:44.356 --> 00:13:45.624
and it looks like
that thing is a lid.

00:13:45.657 --> 00:13:47.159
I always thought
that thing was a lid.

00:13:47.192 --> 00:13:48.493
But trust me, it's not a lid.

00:13:48.526 --> 00:13:49.995
'Cause I am, like,
working the fuck

00:13:50.028 --> 00:13:51.663
out of this goddamn thing,
I can't get it off.

00:13:51.696 --> 00:13:52.865
The tiara's sliding down,
it's at 90 degrees.

00:13:52.898 --> 00:13:54.366
She's banging on the door.

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:55.901
Finally, I take her toothbrush,
and I'm like,

00:13:55.934 --> 00:13:57.569
I'm just going to pop it off
with the toothbrush.

00:13:57.602 --> 00:13:59.171
I snap her toothbrush in half,
and I'm like,

00:13:59.204 --> 00:14:00.672
what the fuck is with
everything in this bathroom?

00:14:00.705 --> 00:14:01.840
I guess I'm just gonna
have to

00:14:01.873 --> 00:14:03.575
friggin' go in, you know?

00:14:03.608 --> 00:14:07.679
So I don't know if you've ever
tried to piss... probably not.

00:14:07.712 --> 00:14:09.715
But it's like that, right,
that thing at the carnival

00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:12.918
where you gotta shoot the water
into the clown's round mouth?

00:14:12.951 --> 00:14:14.987
You know what I mean?

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.655
Only instead of winning
a stuffed animal,

00:14:16.688 --> 00:14:18.891
you get piss on your hands.

00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:22.094
So I get about half of it in
there, I go to throw it back.

00:14:22.127 --> 00:14:27.532
And I see inside of the holes
that there's, like,

00:14:27.565 --> 00:14:30.435
like old toothpaste,
jerky, and dust and shit.

00:14:30.468 --> 00:14:33.772
And I was like, ugh!

00:14:33.805 --> 00:14:35.741
This is gross.

00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:45.050
I can't drink this.

00:14:47.919 --> 00:14:49.554
Without a chaser.

00:14:49.587 --> 00:14:51.056
So I hide it
in her wastebasket.

00:14:51.089 --> 00:14:53.025
And I go out of the bathroom,
she falls in.

00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:56.094
and I'm like, "Whoa, whoa,
whoa, don't go in there.

00:14:56.127 --> 00:14:58.196
"Nothing weird is happening.

00:14:58.229 --> 00:15:00.065
"I just need a Coke,
and then I'm gonna go in there

00:15:00.098 --> 00:15:03.602
"and finish my normal...
thing that I was doing,

00:15:03.635 --> 00:15:05.404
and then I'll be
out of your hair,"

00:15:05.437 --> 00:15:08.640
so I go, I get the Coke.

00:15:08.673 --> 00:15:10.075
Of course,
she scurries in there.

00:15:10.108 --> 00:15:11.643
She finds the broken toothbrush

00:15:11.676 --> 00:15:14.813
and the 8-ball of my piss.

00:15:14.846 --> 00:15:18.283
So when I come back in,
she's just like...

00:15:18.316 --> 00:15:19.885
Over-reacting.

00:15:19.918 --> 00:15:23.455
[audience laughs]

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:27.726
Kicking me out of her house
and shit.

00:15:27.759 --> 00:15:28.927
I'm not really listening,
but then I tune in

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.462
all of a sudden,
and she's like,

00:15:30.495 --> 00:15:31.997
"You're almost 30 years old.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.598
You need to wake up
and get your shit together."

00:15:33.631 --> 00:15:36.302
To which I replied...

00:15:38.436 --> 00:15:40.172
"All right."

00:15:40.205 --> 00:15:43.175
So in five years, I've done
horrible things to get drugs.

00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:44.509
I've been
intermittently homeless.

00:15:44.542 --> 00:15:45.777
I've had Ukrainians
try to kill me,

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:47.446
and I'm addicted
to drinking my piss,

00:15:47.479 --> 00:15:49.147
and apparently,
all I needed this whole time

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:53.485
was someone to suggest that
maybe I don't do this anymore.

00:15:53.518 --> 00:15:56.621
[laughter and applause]

00:15:56.654 --> 00:16:01.626
It was the world's
laziest intervention.

00:16:01.659 --> 00:16:03.795
Even my sister was like,
"Wait, really?"

00:16:03.828 --> 00:16:06.098
And I was like,
"Yeah, well, I mean,

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:11.703
"I can recognize
that this has gotten weird.

00:16:11.736 --> 00:16:14.172
"You're chastising me while
holding a bathroom accessory

00:16:14.205 --> 00:16:16.208
"filled with my urine.

00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:18.710
I could probably use a break."

00:16:18.743 --> 00:16:20.212
And that was it,
I got clean that night.

00:16:20.245 --> 00:16:21.847
That was 12 years ago.

00:16:30.255 --> 00:16:32.324
Well, technically, technically,
it was the next day,

00:16:32.357 --> 00:16:34.726
'cause I totally drank that
pee when she wasn't looking.

00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:36.528
But that was the last time
that I drank piss.

00:16:36.561 --> 00:16:37.629
Thank you very much!
