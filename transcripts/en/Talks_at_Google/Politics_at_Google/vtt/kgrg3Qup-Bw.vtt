[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.090
MURAD AWAWDEH: Good afternoon.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.400
My name is Murad Awawdeh.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.010
I'm the director of political
engagement at the New York

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.927
Immigration Coalition.

00:00:14.927 --> 00:00:17.176
You're probably like, what
is the New York Immigration

00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:18.060
Coalition?

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.760
Well, we're a coalition
of over 200 organizations

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.500
across the state of New York.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.620
We have a member organization
in every single county

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.490
of this state.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.009
The NYIC-- short for the New
York Immigration Coalition--

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.050
fights for immigrant rights
and immigrant justice

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.260
in the state of New York
and across the nation.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.320
We're an umbrella policy
and advocacy organization

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.650
that works with our
memberships to activate

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.810
their bases to ensure
that we are fighting

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.481
for the rights of all immigrants
and refugees in New York.

00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:53.730
I'm going to speak to you
guys a little bit about what

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.627
brought me to this work.

00:00:55.627 --> 00:00:57.960
When I was 10 years old, I
was growing up in a community

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.430
called Sunset Park.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.620
And that's located in
southwest Brooklyn.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.470
My whole family had asthma.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.850
And that, at the time, seemed
like something that was common.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.330
But it was common to only
people in the community who

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.340
also had asthma.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.360
My sister, almost
every single day,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.700
would have a vicious
asthma attack

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.570
and end up waiting on the
floor for an ambulance

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.690
to come to take her to the ER.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.580
And that really spoke to me
in a way where it was like,

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.590
come to think of it,
no one in my family

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.540
who lives elsewhere
has to deal with this.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.370
So I started to look
around my community

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.709
and realized that
my community wasn't

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.750
identical to the communities
to the sides of it--

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.880
Park Slope on one side,
Bay Ridge on the other.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.460
I noticed that we had no trees.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.310
I noticed that we had
an enormous amount

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.150
of trucks on our streets.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.840
I noticed that we had a highway
and multiple power plants.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.180
And shortly after realizing that
there was something inherently

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.000
wrong with the living
environment we were currently

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.530
in, a group of young
people started organizing.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.560
And they started organizing
for environmental justice.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.542
And that didn't start
off as like, yeah, we're

00:02:15.542 --> 00:02:17.250
going to fight for
environmental justice.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.030
It started off as like, why
don't we have clean air?

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.890
Why don't we have clean
air in a community

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.280
that's low-income,
majority immigrant,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.090
and we're all facing
the same issues?

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.580
So shortly after that, we really
started to educate each other

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.500
on what was happening.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.420
A couple of nonprofit
organizations

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.250
started to provide
us with support.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.650
And young people
started to organize.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.480
And the power of organizing
really was a testament within

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.640
my childhood and seeing that
people power was real and that

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.580
it wasn't just something
that you can't--

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.210
I'm a huge math fan.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.210
And sometimes the data doesn't
match up to things that happen.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.840
And as the tech
community and folks

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.360
who are reliant on data and
coding and everything else that

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.540
really doesn't have a
human impact at times,

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.750
it's not measurable.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.400
It's not quantifiable.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.020
So to folks in Google and
to folks within the tech

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.780
community, I think
sometimes we look

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.880
at how the people perspective
actually really does move

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.930
forward in a way which is
not definable by numbers.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.630
And shortly after, a group of
young people that started off

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.520
about 15 to 25 young
people defeated

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.160
a multibillion-dollar
power plant.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.869
Thereafter, they planned a
park on top of a Superfund site

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:53.160
and then fought to get money
from the state to clean up

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.020
that Superfund site.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.240
And then it wasn't
just fighting against,

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.150
but fighting for-- changing
the landscape of what

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.800
the community looked like.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.630
And that's my beginning to
how I got into advocacy.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.480
And I was invited to speak
today at Google to talk

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.030
about how civic engagement--

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.690
and to me, civic
engagement is organizing--

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.410
how you can organize
and participate

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.490
civically to ensure that we are
moving in the right direction

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.660
to protect our communities
from the uncertain times

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.100
that we live in.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:35.250
And those uncertain times
began on November 8, 2016,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.560
when our current
president was elected.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.950
And we believed that
everything he said

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.610
was going to be literal.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.090
We didn't think that he was
just speaking to his masses

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.634
to get them riled
up to vote for him.

00:04:47.634 --> 00:04:49.050
We figured he was
going to do what

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.090
he said he was going to do.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.930
Shortly after, it happened.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.150
Shortly after taking
office, Donald Trump

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.980
signed a number of
different executive orders.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:06.810
The first was to double the size
of Customs and Border Patrol.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.600
The same executive
order was also

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.310
intended to triple immigration
enforcement officers

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:22.630
and build the most inexpensive
and wasteful wall ever.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.300
And when we saw that coming
down the pike, we were like, OK,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.770
well, what we've seen in years
prior-- this was before him--

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.340
is that pretty much
Customs and Border Patrol--

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.040
which we, as New
Yorkers, really don't

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.350
interface with unless
we're flying into JFK

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.270
and we see them at the airport--

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.340
but we tend to
forget that we have

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.870
a northern border at
the top of New York that

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.960
is shared with Canada.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.540
Border Patrol can
operate 100 miles

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.710
within the radius of
the wall, of the border.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.230
And what that means
is-- and any water.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.252
So we have the ocean,
we have rivers.

00:06:03.252 --> 00:06:04.960
Pretty much, the entire
state of New York

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.350
is covered that CBP can
come in and operate under.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.550
And what they do
is, pretty much,

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.510
they have an enormous
amount of power.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:20.304
So if you are driving
from Canada into New York

00:06:20.304 --> 00:06:21.970
and you want to go
back home after going

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.320
to Montreal or Ontario,
you have to stop,

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.690
and they can check you.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.260
And what tends to happen is that
folks who are brown or black

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.050
tend to get stopped
more than others.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.080
Specifically, Muslim
folks tend to get stopped

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:43.690
and cautioned at a
higher rate than others.

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.000
And as an
Arab-American Muslim, I

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.450
think that the reality that
we were in at that point when

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.220
this executive
order was issued was

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.350
that our communities--
and this is

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.150
the broad sense
of "communities,"

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.010
immigrant
communities-- are going

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:01.900
to be faced with an enormous
amount of challenges moving

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.910
forward.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.440
Shortly after that
executive order was passed,

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.220
there were rumors of the Muslim
ban dropping sometime soon.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.470
We had heard that it was
going to happen the same day.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.110
The next day, we heard it
was going to happen that day.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:22.480
And then finally, about
three days later, again, we

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.170
took him by his word, and
he came through on it.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:34.030
So on January 26
at about 4:42 PM,

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.330
Donald Trump signed
an executive order

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.547
banning people from seven
Muslim-majority countries

00:07:41.547 --> 00:07:42.880
from entering the United States.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.820
And what you may have seen may
have seemed beautiful chaos

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.090
that came out of it.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.140
And people felt in their
hearts that it was wrong,

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.790
and they came out
to the airport.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.373
And the New York
Immigration Coalition

00:07:56.373 --> 00:07:57.910
was at the forefront of that.

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:59.514
We knew it was
coming down the pike.

00:07:59.514 --> 00:08:01.180
And we knew that he
was going to fulfill

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.180
his promise to his base.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.440
So we wanted to ensure that
whatever was happening,

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.190
that we were going to
ensure that the most

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.190
impacted voices were going
to be at the front lines

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.920
and make sure that
folks who are impacted

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.230
have some sort of defense.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:21.900
And that defense was
done by lawyers--

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:27.780
precisely, over 1,000 lawyers
who showed up to JFK for free

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:30.810
and fought for the
release of everyone who

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.530
was detained at the airport.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.620
Couple that with the enormous
outpouring of support

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.159
that we had from people
coming out to protest,

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:44.400
the numbers went up as high
as 10,000 people showing up

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.820
that day.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.934
And it was honestly
quite beautiful to see.

00:08:47.934 --> 00:08:50.100
In the morning when we got
there at around 8 o'clock

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.290
in the morning,
there was 10 of us.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.630
Shortly after, it was about 25.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.250
We did a call to
action on social media.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.940
And then media showed up.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.530
And then it went from
two dozen to over 10,000,

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:06.180
to the point where
the entire parking

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.680
lot in terminal 4, the parking
garage, the passenger pick-up

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.940
area was filled to
the brim with people

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:20.640
demanding that those who had
been detained to be released.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.340
Later that evening,
Judge Donnelly

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.550
in the Eastern
District Court finally

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:32.320
issued a temporary
injunction on the Muslim ban,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.160
which was quite remarkable.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.210
Later that evening, we
planned to have a march

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.570
to ensure that New
York's voice was actually

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.620
being heard across the nation,
demanding that this ban is not

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.820
going to stand.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:52.200
And what we did was we
held a march and rally

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.770
that started at Battery
Park, overlooking

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.245
the Statue of Liberty.

00:09:57.245 --> 00:09:58.620
And we thought
originally we were

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.078
going to have about a couple
of thousand people coming out,

00:10:01.078 --> 00:10:04.110
because a lot of folks
went out the night before.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:08.070
But we were amazed that over
30,000 people showed up.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:13.330
And the reality is, is
that there is a cause

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:14.900
and effect to everything.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.040
And what we've been
seeing is that,

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:25.090
as people are becoming more
civically engaged in ensuring

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.480
that their beliefs are not
being challenged in a way

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.960
where you don't feel as
if we are honoring what

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.460
our country was founded to
do, that folks are really

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.960
taking a stand now.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.330
And the stand isn't
just, I'm going

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.030
to send out a quick
Tweet, which is amazing,

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.660
or I'm going to put a Facebook
post up, which is great,

00:10:46.660 --> 00:10:50.230
but showing up and showing
up when it matters.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:55.030
The next thing that our
federal government has done

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.660
is issued an attack
on sanctuary cities

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.360
and threatened to de-fund
cities through the Department

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.650
of Justice.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:03.800
And what does that mean?

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.000
What are sanctuary cities?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.260
Are sanctuary cities
these lawless cities

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.170
where people are
moving forward in life

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.260
and doing whatever they
want with no accountability?

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:15.430
No.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.460
Sanctuary cities means
that cities are not

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:23.110
going to participate and assist
in federal law enforcement

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:32.670
agencies' attempt to detain
people, which is not illegal.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.990
It is pretty much
the Fourth Amendment.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:37.970
And I think that when
people think about it,

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.820
they're like, well,
it may seem odd.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:41.979
But it's not.

00:11:41.979 --> 00:11:43.520
New York City became
a sanctuary city

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:49.400
under not the very
liberal mayor that we

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.500
have now, Mayor de Blasio--

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.770
not our centrist
former mayor, who

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.590
was Mike Bloomberg, who
was pretty pro-immigrant.

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:00.010
It happened under
Rudy Giuliani--

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:04.690
the same man who is Donald
Trump's adviser right now.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.120
So the reason why he did
it was because he wanted

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.340
to ensure that
everyone in the city

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.270
was able to feel comfortable
enough to go to law enforcement

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:14.677
if something happened--

00:12:14.677 --> 00:12:16.510
was comfortable enough
to go to the hospital

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.890
if they were sick--

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.162
was comfortable enough to ensure
that their kids went to school.

00:12:21.162 --> 00:12:23.620
And I think the reality is, is
that the rhetoric that we're

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:27.580
hearing now is,
quite frankly, bull.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.710
So when we're talking
about, how do we

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.710
ensure that our
communities are safe,

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.410
sanctuary cities are
not harboring people

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:40.840
who are doing anything illegal.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.630
Sanctuary cities are ensuring
that everyone has their rights.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:47.500
I think that that's
what it comes down to.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:54.520
So to go back to what else
is happening nationally,

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:59.910
everything that you hear tends
to be that we're law and order,

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:04.240
we're going to ensure that
everyone who's here is fine,

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.700
anyone with status
is OK, we're only

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.790
going after the criminal aliens.

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:16.150
And that rhetoric is actually
really dangerous, because who

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.600
is defined as a criminal alien?

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.720
For instance, green
card holders--

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.810
these are folks who are legally
permanent residents, who

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:29.320
may or may not have had
a run-in or two with law

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.290
enforcement on very
low, minor offenses,

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:35.370
and now they are on
track for removal.

00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:38.850
You also have,
just two weeks ago,

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:42.180
it was announced that a young
person who had received DACA--

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.720
which is Deferred Action
for Childhood Arrivals--

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:52.170
in California actually was
detained and then deported

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.490
within three hours.

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:59.750
DACA is intended to protect
people from deportation.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.840
The United States government
told these young people

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.720
who received DACA,
sign up for DACA.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.510
You will get work authorization,
you will get a Social Security

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:11.150
card number, you
will get everything

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:16.650
you need without
status, but we will not

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:19.470
focus on you to deport you.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:23.880
And obviously, in this
current administration,

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.630
that is not true.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.650
What else are we
seeing nationally?

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:33.400
We're seeing that enforcement
of immigration enforcement

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.650
is happening at a
much higher rate.

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:39.160
And you're seeing that there
is retribution for people who

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.870
are speaking out against this.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:43.510
So in cities in Texas
that are sanctuary cities,

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:47.140
there has been a higher rate
of raids happening there.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.900
There has been higher
enforcement in other cities

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:53.440
that are technically
sanctuary cities.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:57.760
And what we're seeing is that
it's a very vindictive way

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.230
of getting back at folks.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:02.150
They try to teach
people a lesson.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.920
And that's not the country
that we have ever been.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.290
We have a very interesting past.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:11.050
And I think that the future
that we all intended to have

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:14.690
is not the one that we're
on track for right now.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:17.380
So what is the New York
Immigration Coalition doing?

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.660
We're working at
the federal level

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.170
to fight back as hard as we
can against these policies

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:26.950
that Donald Trump is
introducing and signing.

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:29.020
We're also ensuring
that, at the local level

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.380
in our state, that we're
putting together policies that

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:37.150
will harden our state
from these policies

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.900
so that when folks are
trying to access documents

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:45.670
from the state on
who has Medicaid

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.250
or who went to this hospital
or who went to that hospital,

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.490
that there are policies
put in place for that.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:53.809
Recently, we just had a
pretty significant win

00:15:53.809 --> 00:15:55.600
where we worked with
the city and the state

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.590
to ensure that ICE isn't
allowed in schools.

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:03.610
To even think that that was
allowed before where children--

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.140
kindergarten to 12th grade--

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:10.270
are in school and ICE can
walk in, pick up a kid,

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:13.450
is beyond me.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.870
We're working on
ensuring that immigrants

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.930
from across the state have
access to legal services.

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:24.880
There are studies that show
that if an immigrant is

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.170
undocumented, with
documentation, or anything

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:33.350
and has legal representation
during immigration proceedings,

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:37.060
there's a higher rate of
them being able to stay.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:42.560
We're helping those with
status become citizens.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.530
There's been a very
long period of time

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:47.980
where folks who have green
cards are like, I don't really

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:51.940
need citizenship, because I
have my green card, I'm fine.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.930
What we've realized is that
that's not necessarily true.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.430
So we're trying to
ensure that folks

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.514
who are eligible to become
citizens do become citizens.

00:17:01.514 --> 00:17:03.430
And the other thing that
we're doing right now

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.829
is fighting harder than
we've ever fought before

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:11.290
to ensure that services for
immigration are in place

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:13.300
and funded for our newcomers.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:15.186
And what do I mean by that?

00:17:15.186 --> 00:17:16.810
Across the state and
across the nation,

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:21.609
there's always been this fight
for adult literacy education

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:22.480
funding.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.560
And what does that mean?

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.450
That funding would
specifically go out

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:31.210
to educate folks on how to learn
how to read and write English.

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:35.200
And for being a
country that everyone

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.310
loves that folks want to speak
English, we don't fund it.

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.920
We also don't fund
the ability for people

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.705
to get health care or
health care services.

00:17:44.705 --> 00:17:47.080
So we want to ensure that we
can expand the pool of who's

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.110
eligible to get insurance.

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:53.950
We want to ensure that folks
who may have had a run-in that

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:56.920
was a low offense see a lawyer.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.345
And that's not a big ask.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:05.200
And then looking at how
we move the pendulum

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.820
and looking at how we actually
start discussing these issues,

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.835
and we look at the
tech community.

00:18:11.835 --> 00:18:15.370
A lot of these tech companies
were founded and created

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:17.890
by immigrants.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.510
A lot of folks think
that tech just happened.

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:23.630
It doesn't just happen.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:24.832
There are people behind it.

00:18:24.832 --> 00:18:26.290
And I think that
the reality is, is

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:33.190
that we have gotten comfortable
being who we are as just

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:38.110
a person, not realizing where we
came from or where we're going.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.900
And in that, we have to
start challenging ourselves

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:43.750
to be more vocal
about, where are we now

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.070
and how are our communities--
our larger communities,

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:49.300
our tech community,
which will be impacted,

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.990
our home community-- how
will that be impacted?

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.230
And the generations to come,
how will they be impacted?

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:58.840
And what is your
role in doing this?

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.170
And what is your role to
ensure that we're actually

00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:05.950
pushing the pendulum
towards justice and not

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.030
towards injustice?

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.082
So what can you do?

00:19:12.082 --> 00:19:17.630
And I think that that has
been the new big question

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:18.740
of the day.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.390
Everyone asks, what can I do?

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.220
I want to do something,
but I don't really

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.930
feel comfortable
speaking publicly,

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:29.600
or I don't feel comfortable
going and writing an op-ed

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.950
or speaking to my
elected official.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.110
There's a number of
things folks can do.

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:35.690
And the most
important is speaking

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.280
to your elected official--

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.560
your federal officials,
your state officials,

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.140
and your local officials.

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.210
First, you should
know who they are.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:45.680
Second, you should
call them often

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:49.040
with your opinions
and your concerns.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.620
They do take phone calls,
emails, and letters, or even

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.947
a visit, very seriously.

00:19:54.947 --> 00:19:57.530
So if they're hearing from you
and they're hearing that you're

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.510
concerned about the
immigration policies

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:03.350
or you're concerned about
the restriction on H-1B visas

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:09.460
or you're concerned about
your colleague's safety,

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.460
that will go a long way.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:14.830
One thing that
folks tend to forget

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:17.830
is that we almost have an
election every single year.

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:20.280
So last year was the
federal elections.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.910
This year we have city and
municipal, local, regional

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.080
elections.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.990
And one thing people think is
that, my vote doesn't really

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:29.340
count.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.220
And then they point
to Electoral College.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.890
Sometimes I'm like,
OK, well, there

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:41.300
may be some true
criticism there.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.950
But your vote does count.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.160
You count, and it's
an entire process.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.260
You count.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.680
And the reality is, is that the
most important elections are

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.360
the local ones.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.550
And people tend to forget that.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.460
If you live in New York City,
you have city council races,

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:05.120
you have the mayor's race, you
have the public advocates race,

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.920
the city comptroller.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.870
If you live in other
parts of the state,

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:12.901
you have your county executive
and your local legislator

00:21:12.901 --> 00:21:13.400
races.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.191
And across the nation,
you have other races

00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:16.190
happening this year.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:18.440
There are a ton of special
elections happening

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.150
to fill vacancies for
congressional members, which

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:26.510
you will see in South Carolina,
which you have seen in Georgia,

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:30.380
and which you have seen in,
I believe it was Kansas.

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.760
So vote.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.480
If there is one thing
you can do and you just

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:40.430
want to have that one thing
be it, your vote matters.

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:43.010
And your vote matters more
than you actually think.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:46.800
There's races that have been
won by 17 votes in this state--

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.300
17.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.040
It's like that last row.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.515
That last row
decided an election.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.690
Voting is critical, more so
today than it ever was before.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:06.220
Organize.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.650
Organize a community town hall.

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:09.460
Know who your neighbors are.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.695
A lot of folks--

00:22:10.695 --> 00:22:12.820
and I think that this goes
across the board and not

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.340
just in the tech community
or the advocacy community--

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.130
but in general, the
vast majority of people

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:22.030
do not know who their neighbors
are more than "hello,"

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:25.030
"good morning," "good
night," "great seeing you,"

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.440
and that is it.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.180
Know who your neighbors are.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.260
Speak to your neighbors.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.720
See what their issues are,
what their concerns are.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.672
And then organize together.

00:22:33.672 --> 00:22:35.380
Bring together the
rest of your community

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:38.650
to have a town hall or
a community meeting.

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.710
Hold it in your lobby
at your building.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.670
Hold it in front of your house.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:43.840
Hold it at a library--

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.860
anywhere.

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.620
Organize, get to know
each other, fight

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.840
for a shared vision.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.350
That is the only way we
can move forward here.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:54.790
Mobilize.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:59.520
Mobilizing yourself plus family
and friends, or colleagues,

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.970
is going to be critical.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:04.030
There has been a protest or
a rally or a march literally

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:06.347
almost every single week.

00:23:06.347 --> 00:23:07.430
How many have you been to?

00:23:10.334 --> 00:23:12.270
Right?

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:13.170
Go to one.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:16.050
Make that a task of the day.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:18.720
Just go to see what
the rally is about.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.470
Who's doing what?

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:20.750
Why are people here?

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:24.930
Ask folks, what really
brought you out today?

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.460
Get yourself out.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.140
Get out of your comfort zone.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.340
Mobilize.

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.380
This is what is
going to be and what

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:36.470
has been the only way to
actually create change

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.100
under this administration.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.970
You saw that with the
American Affordable Care Act.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.800
You saw that with
the Muslim ban.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.190
You're going to see that
with everything else that's

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:48.850
coming down the pike.

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:52.620
So there's going to be a budget
extender at the federal level.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:57.310
You should look through it,
see what's going to be included

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:00.330
and what's not, and
then really ensure

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.970
that you believe that
your tax dollars are

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:05.070
going to the right places.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.290
Mobilize.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:11.970
Educate-- seek out information
from valid sources.

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:15.060
I can't emphasize
this any more than I

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:17.490
have in the past couple of
months where people are sending

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:19.250
me articles of
things that I said,

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:20.751
which are not things
that I've said.

00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:22.166
I'm like, where
did you hear this?

00:24:22.166 --> 00:24:23.490
There should be a video of it.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:27.660
Look at the video and then look
at the entire clip, not just

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.640
two words of what I've said.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:34.420
I think research and education
is extremely important.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.940
And I think that
we're on a pathway

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:39.330
that alternative facts
have become normalized.

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:41.700
And I think that we just
have to call it what it is.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:42.960
And they're all lies.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.910
So how can you ensure
that you are educating

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:47.340
yourself and your community?

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.020
Research and educate.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.720
Share the information
that you have

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.397
found with your colleagues.

00:24:53.397 --> 00:24:54.480
Share it with your family.

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:55.760
Share it with your friends.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.020
I think educating
yourself and your friends

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.530
is really important.

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:01.530
There are issues that
I'm continuously learning

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:02.975
about within immigration.

00:25:02.975 --> 00:25:04.350
And I think that
that's something

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:08.214
that is upon us all to really do
and to really look into things

00:25:08.214 --> 00:25:09.630
that are going to
impact ourselves

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:13.100
and our families
and our community.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.670
Volunteer.

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.970
You all have an
acquired set of skills.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.730
Use it for good.

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:23.580
Look at a nonprofit that you
really want to volunteer with.

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:26.430
Say, this is what I can do, let
me know if you're interested,

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:29.460
if not, I'll just show up
to whatever you're doing.

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.320
More than likely, they
will respond to you

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.450
and say, thank you,
we would love for you

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.610
to work on this with us.

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:37.740
Nonprofits across the
state and the nation right

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:41.760
now are not really equipped
to respond to the level

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.890
that they have been
responding right now.

00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:49.260
So any assistance in
volunteering your time or not

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.517
is going to be really
important for them

00:25:51.517 --> 00:25:53.850
to be able to become successful
and even more successful

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:56.880
and continue to fight, because
that's what it comes down to.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.620
Because in every
victory, there's

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.990
10 losses before that you
probably don't even know about.

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:04.470
So you just need to ensure
that you're providing yourself

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:07.590
and that you're making yourself
available to these folks.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:09.330
Donate.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.790
I think that you hear
this all the time.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.650
One standard that I like--

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:15.430
not that I'm bragging,
because we are--

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:18.390
is that we're a
Google-approved nonprofit.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.060
And your donation will
be matched by Google.

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.940
So look through-- if you want to
donate to New York Immigration

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.500
Coalition, go for it.

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:26.390
You should.

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:28.404
If not, look for
another nonprofit that's

00:26:28.404 --> 00:26:29.820
doing great work
in your community

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:30.861
that you want to support.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:37.230
And then last but not
least is stay connected.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:42.300
A lot of things happen at a
very rapid pace these days.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:45.240
And social media has become
a really amazing tool

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.790
to ensure that we are
continuously following up

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.601
with each other and making sure
that we know what's happening

00:26:50.601 --> 00:26:52.600
and that we're getting
out the right information

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.200
in the quickest way possible.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.220
So follow us on Twitter.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.690
Follow us on Facebook.

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:00.690
Make sure that you text our
action alert network, which

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.220
is right there.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:07.440
Text NYC to 86-42-37.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.620
That's the right number, yes.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.330
And stay connected.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.850
And I can't emphasize
that more than anything.

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:19.020
I think if you walk away
from here doing one thing

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.610
and texting that number is it,
I think that that is, in itself,

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:24.780
you're on the right
track to starting

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:26.730
to become civically
engaged in a way

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:29.130
that you haven't been before.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:30.960
And showing up,
because showing up

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.500
is probably one of the most
important pieces of this.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:39.570
So with that, I will
take any questions.

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:42.370
I want to thank Google
for having me here today.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:47.819
I think there's microphones
on either side of the stage.

00:27:47.819 --> 00:27:49.110
There's one there and one here.

00:27:58.317 --> 00:27:59.650
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks for coming.

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:01.770
I just had a question
about strategies

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:04.240
for talking to
people who disagree,

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.276
because I think especially
at a place like Google,

00:28:07.276 --> 00:28:09.900
you don't find that many people
who disagree with these things.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:14.310
And I've also been hearing a lot
about how arguing with people

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:15.810
doesn't really
change anyone's mind.

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:19.472
It just makes everyone
more firmly committed

00:28:19.472 --> 00:28:20.680
to what they already believe.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.949
So what have you found
that's effective for having

00:28:23.949 --> 00:28:26.490
constructive conversations with
people who disagree with you?

00:28:29.846 --> 00:28:31.470
MURAD AWAWDEH: That's
a funny question.

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:34.020
I actually had an off-the-record
debate with someone

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:39.390
last week who is completely
against every single viewpoint

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:42.700
and belief that I have.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.200
And it was interesting, because
I prepared for three days

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.960
to ensure that I can
counter every claim she

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.970
has with actual facts.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:54.420
And I was like, that's really
not going to work here.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:57.397
So honestly, I heard her out.

00:28:57.397 --> 00:28:58.980
And I listened to
everything she said.

00:28:58.980 --> 00:28:59.688
And I took notes.

00:28:59.688 --> 00:29:03.670
And I was like, OK,
thank you for letting

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:05.470
me know how you feel.

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:09.160
Now this is what you said,
this is how I heard it,

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.750
and this is what
the actual truth is.

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.950
And we didn't agree
on 100% of everything

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:16.430
I had mentioned to her.

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:18.370
But from that conversation--

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:22.280
I never expected this--
we agreed on five points.

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:26.030
And I was literally floored
by her saying, yeah, of course

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.920
I agree with that.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.230
One was that everyone
deserves to live

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:32.810
with dignity and respect.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:37.460
The other was that
there is consequences

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.200
to people's actions,
but there shouldn't

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.960
be a double punishment
for anything.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.760
And that, in itself,
was a huge deal,

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:47.900
because she's an enormous
anti-immigrant fanatic.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.050
And I'm like, whoa, you
just agreed with something

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:54.620
that you've been going
out and really cheering

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.560
your crowds with.

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:02.870
Making sure that folks have
the right to live not in fear

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:05.300
and making sure that
people who do come here

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:09.350
have opportunity and
pathway for citizenship.

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:13.520
And while we didn't
agree on 100 things,

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.820
we agreed on those five
really critical pillars

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.350
that I think allowed
us to continue

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:20.720
to have the conversation.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:23.122
You're not going to change
anyone's mind in a day.

00:30:23.122 --> 00:30:25.580
You're not going to change
their mind in a week or a month.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:26.990
It takes time.

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:29.660
And I think that folks who
have their set of beliefs

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:32.370
have believed that
for a very long time.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:38.240
So unless they are exposed and
working alongside or hearing

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.090
from other folks and
educating themselves

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:43.850
on the alternative
opinion and not something

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:46.432
that they're reading
on a fake news site,

00:30:46.432 --> 00:30:48.890
I think that that is what's
going to change people's hearts

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:49.390
and minds.

00:30:56.859 --> 00:30:57.400
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.270
I've heard one of the things the
Trump administration has said

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:03.010
is that they're going to punish
sanctuary cities by cutting off

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.520
the federal funds.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.350
I was just wondering
if you know if there's

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:09.764
any strategies being
discussed about that,

00:31:09.764 --> 00:31:10.930
because it's sort of insane.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:15.100
Because last I heard, we send
about $1.20 for every dollar we

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:16.620
get from the government.

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.250
MURAD AWAWDEH: Yeah.

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.340
Not too familiar with that--

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.080
I just know that we do
have an internal strategy.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.270
But our strategy right now is--

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:27.440
what we know is that they
kind of can't do that.

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.230
And if they haven't,
they will be

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:32.200
sued by a couple
different states,

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.330
because what they're
doing is actually

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:35.545
discriminatory in practice.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:42.880
And if you heard of our
Attorney General Sessions

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:50.830
last week's speech saying that
New York City is lawless and is

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:52.630
the most dangerous
it's ever been,

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:55.480
because being a sanctuary
city, last week,

00:31:55.480 --> 00:32:00.550
and you heard the response from
the NYPD, which pretty much can

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:04.450
be its own military
force, really

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:07.817
saying that if it weren't
for being a sanctuary city,

00:32:07.817 --> 00:32:09.150
we would be extremely dangerous.

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:11.410
And because we are
a sanctuary city,

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:15.940
we have the lowest
crime rates ever.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:17.800
I feel like that
side has spoken.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.960
Anyone on this side?

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:20.460
No pressure.

00:32:27.017 --> 00:32:27.600
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.016
I'm an immigrant, but I've
spent my whole adult life here.

00:32:30.016 --> 00:32:36.750
But even so, it feels
strange to tell people

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.750
that were born and
raised here, this

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:42.550
is how you should
run your society

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:45.900
to benefit me, even though,
if I believe in a cosmopolitan

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.250
world and all of that.

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:48.480
Do you have any advice?

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.646
Because it feels weird,
because it feels like you're

00:32:50.646 --> 00:32:51.960
just being a rude house guest.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.630
MURAD AWAWDEH: Yeah.

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:57.520
That's a good point.

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.550
I think it's more so about
talking about your own story.

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:02.270
And that's why I
started off with mine.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:04.770
And I think that folks
tend to forget that we all

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:06.290
came here from somewhere.

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:09.497
It might not have been your
parents, your grandparents,

00:33:09.497 --> 00:33:10.830
or even your great-grandparents.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:12.366
But we all came here.

00:33:12.366 --> 00:33:13.990
None of us are
indigenous to this land,

00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:16.630
unless we're Native American.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:19.710
So my personal story really does
resonate with a lot of people.

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:22.140
I didn't start off with
saying that my family was

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:24.000
first-generation
immigrants here.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.250
The services that were built
by the city and the state

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:28.200
weren't really meant for us.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:30.060
We didn't have access
to it, because we

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:32.580
didn't have translation
services or cultural competency

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.650
within these institutions.

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:38.060
We made it work for ourselves.

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.810
I started off with the
story of my sister,

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:41.351
because it's really
important for me.

00:33:41.351 --> 00:33:44.070
And that was what actually
got me started on this pathway

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:45.840
that I'm on now.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.880
Thankfully, we're
all healthier than we

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.490
were when we were children.

00:33:50.490 --> 00:33:52.980
But I think resonating with
people on a personal level

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:55.680
really does allow
you to help build

00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:00.090
that bridge of a
mutually shared vision,

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:02.660
to ensure that you're
both fighting for--

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:04.950
doesn't have to be
100% the same fight,

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:09.690
but you have shared principles
that you can work together

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:12.179
with and ensure that you're
fighting alongside each other,

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:14.590
for each other.

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:17.309
I think that that's what
people tend to forget.

00:34:17.309 --> 00:34:19.100
AUDIENCE: I want to
build on that question.

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.400
So I'm also an immigrant.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:24.550
But I guess being white, I
don't have some of the issues

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:26.820
that other people
have to deal with.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:30.060
But there is a possibility
if I do any activism

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:34.770
that, since I'm not a citizen,
I would put myself in jeopardy

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:36.239
of being able to stay here.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:39.870
So what are recommendations
for if you want to contribute,

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:41.530
but you don't have
citizen status?

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:43.571
What are things you can
risk, and what are things

00:34:43.571 --> 00:34:45.400
you definitely shouldn't risk?

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.889
MURAD AWAWDEH: So
I think that you

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:50.880
have to have that kind of
conversation with yourself.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:53.969
I'm not an attorney, so I will
not give you any legal advice.

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:56.850
But what I would say is,
what level of activism

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:58.320
are you comfortable with?

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.480
Showing up to protest
is not illegal.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.560
Anyone with status,
without status can do that.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.870
You have the right
to be at a protest.

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:08.600
You have the right
to raise your voice.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.960
You have the right to be
on social media saying,

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.199
what's happening is wrong.

00:35:12.199 --> 00:35:13.740
You have a right to
share your story.

00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:16.350
You have a right to everything
else that a US citizen does,

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:18.660
with the exception of voting.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:22.800
So I think exercising your
rights, as even a visa holder,

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.760
is very important.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.810
But you have to take
care of yourself

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:26.726
and make sure that you're
not putting yourself

00:35:26.726 --> 00:35:28.645
in precarious situations.

00:35:28.645 --> 00:35:30.270
So if you're going
to a protest and you

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.500
know that people are going
to be getting arrested,

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.416
you might not want to
be standing next to them

00:35:33.416 --> 00:35:36.180
when they do whatever they're
going to end up doing.

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:38.180
And that should go
out to everyone.

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:40.230
If you're going to a
protest and there's

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:41.700
going to be civil
disobedience, you

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.740
know that there will
be civil disobedience,

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.320
and you're in kind of
a different situation

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:49.020
where your status may
be in jeopardy, maybe

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:52.230
being around that situation
is not beneficial to you.

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:55.080
But you can always show
up to NYIC's events

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:59.250
where we coordinate
with the right agencies

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:01.451
to ensure that we're
doing everything

00:36:01.451 --> 00:36:03.450
to ensure that everyone
who's there is protected

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:09.372
and not going to have any
issue for participating.

00:36:09.372 --> 00:36:10.080
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:21.440
MURAD AWAWDEH: Hello.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.565
AUDIENCE: I guess this is
kind of a broad question.

00:36:23.565 --> 00:36:28.010
But in general, what do
non-profits need the most?

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:29.540
Is there one thing?

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.290
Is it money, or is it time?

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:32.869
Or is it specific?

00:36:32.869 --> 00:36:34.910
MURAD AWAWDEH: I think
it's a little bit of both.

00:36:34.910 --> 00:36:39.410
So it is, I would say,
more so volunteer time

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:40.530
with acquired skills.

00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.660
So we're always
looking for volunteers.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.080
If you go to our website,
which is on one of the slides,

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:50.000
www.NYIC.org, there is a
volunteer sign-up form,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.750
which is very specific.

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:53.930
So we want to know as
much information of what

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:56.750
you can offer as possible
so that we don't waste

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:59.474
your time asking you
down the road, like, hey,

00:36:59.474 --> 00:37:00.890
do you know how
to do translation,

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:02.420
do you know how to
do graphic design?

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:04.169
Our website looks like
it's going to fall,

00:37:04.169 --> 00:37:07.780
can you help us with fixing
it up on the backend?

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:10.250
So that when you
are participating,

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:14.070
that's actual in-kind donation,
if you think about it.

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:17.241
So what you're doing
is providing nonprofits

00:37:17.241 --> 00:37:18.740
with a resource
that they would have

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:23.000
to eventually pay for if you
don't provide your services.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.150
So I would say the volunteering
part is more important.

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:30.250
But almost equally
important is the donations.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:34.550
A lot of the time, folks tend
to forget that everything costs

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:35.242
money.

00:37:35.242 --> 00:37:37.700
When you want to have a rally,
you have to pay for permits.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.080
You have to pay for sound.

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.460
You have to pay for signs.

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:43.730
You have to pay for water.

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:45.800
If it's cold, you have
to pay for hand warmers.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.090
So you just want to make
sure that you're taking care

00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:48.290
of the people who are coming.

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:49.665
So you want to
make sure that you

00:37:49.665 --> 00:37:53.750
have resources available to
make the purchases you need to.

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:57.425
Also, staff time-- if
you work at a nonprofit

00:37:57.425 --> 00:38:00.740
or you don't, you should
know that, while folks

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:04.520
may think that we get paid
millions of dollars, we do not.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.040
We're humbly paid.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.250
So I think that
providing donations

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:12.750
to help build capacity
of organizations

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:14.880
is extremely important as well.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.350
So I think volunteering
is important,

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:20.335
staying connected, and donating.

00:38:20.335 --> 00:38:21.700
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:22.950
MURAD AWAWDEH: You're welcome.

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:32.076
Any final questions?

00:38:32.076 --> 00:38:32.900
All right.

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:33.880
This has been great.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.180
Thank you again for having me.

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.880
Thank you for coming out.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:39.660
I'll be hanging out in
the back for a few minutes

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.480
if you guys have any questions.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.220
