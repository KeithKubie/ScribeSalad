00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.100
So why worry about touch?

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.890
Touch events are just click
events on a touch screen, right?

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.220
&gt;&gt; No, I don't think they are.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.570
&gt;&gt; Definitely not.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.450
They have different pseudo classes and
different event cycles and

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.230
you need to account for both.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.650
Let me show you what can happen if you
don't account for touch events at all.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.890
This is an example site that use touch.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.340
Which you can find the link
in the instructor notes.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.940
I recommend posing this video and
go play with it for a moment.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.830
Pay attention as I'm dragging
this element, what's going on.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.010
Both in depth tools and
on the element itself.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.120
Another good example is here as you
can see I'm just improving my images.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.046
In this example is taking touch,
mouse, and pointer events.

00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:43.670
Much better.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.030
Well that was fun.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.360
Notice how the UI didn't
quite react to your touch.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.540
First thing first.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.230
You need to account for
the touch pseudo states.
