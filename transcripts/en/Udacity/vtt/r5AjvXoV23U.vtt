00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.082
We saw earlier that Grant wants to employ no more than 15 staff. Now, if we let

00:00:04.082 --> 00:00:08.242
x equal the number of staff, then the inequality that we came up with before for

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:12.284
this would say x is less than or equal to 15. Now my question is whether or not

00:00:12.284 --> 00:00:16.539
this is actually the best way to describe this situation. Think about hiring,

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.823
and whether out of all the real numbers, the only restriction that we should

00:00:20.823 --> 00:00:24.474
place on x is that it's less than or equal to 15. Or, if there's another

00:00:24.474 --> 00:00:28.229
restriction you should place on this. Remember that the unit here is people. So

00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:31.202
keep that in mind. Should we leave this or should we change it?
