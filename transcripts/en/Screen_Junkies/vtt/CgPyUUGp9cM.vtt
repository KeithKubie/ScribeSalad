00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.070
From fanfiction.net user SnowQueensIceDragon

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.650
and the screenwriter who married

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.510
fanfiction.net user SnowQueensIceDragon

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.720
comes another horrifying reminder

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.650
that your aunt probably gets off to this.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.000
Fifty Shades Darker.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You marveled at the first movie's total lack of sex appeal.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.949
Now the steamiest story -- you can buy it at

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.620
Target. It's back, and it's cranking the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.620
naughty down from room temp to ice-cold

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.200
in this two hour movie that only has

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.059
about ten minutes of actual sex in it

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.579
where they scale back the bondage (Ow!) and

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.590
amp up the normal boring couple stuff.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.960
You want a vanilla relationship?

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.359
No! That is not why I wore an overcoat to the

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:51.930
theater.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.340
The big voice guy doesn't want vanilla.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.500
He wants some rocky road!

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.890
Future murder victim Anastasia Steele returns, and

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.719
she's suddenly into all the kinky stuff

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.090
she used to hate for some reason.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.134
Christian: Last time we did this you left.

00:01:05.134 --> 00:01:06.940
Anastasia: Last time was different.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.800
Watch as she spends an entire movie attempting in

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.701
vain to show human emotion.

00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:13.300
Christians: Hides out. We've been fired.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.000
Anastasia: Whoa.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.170
Being stalked by

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.939
almost half a dozen different people

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.560
including... a ghost?

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.000
And expressing her only personality trait:

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.780
a general lack of knowledge about what

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.700
should and shouldn't be put in her butt.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.500
Anastasia: What are butt plugs? You're not putting those in my butt.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.481
Christian: (scoffs) They don't go in your butt.

00:01:34.481 --> 00:01:35.450
Look if you're going to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.280
date a guy with a sex dungeon, you really

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.710
need to get your butt stuff figured out.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.149
If you thought Christian Grey was a

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.440
creep before, you ain't seen nothing yet.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.299
Watch as this walking red flag stalks

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.700
his ex-girlfriend into submission.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.300
Christian: Have dinner with me.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.300
Anastasia: Okay fine. I will have dinner with you.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.680
Steals her financial information.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.750
Anastasia: Why do you have my bank account details?

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.910
Buys the company she works for.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.950
Anastasia: You can't start interfering in my career.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.600
Christian: It's not about that.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.320
Takes her to meet the older

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.016
woman who scarred him for life.

00:02:05.016 --> 00:02:06.679
Anastasia: Why would you take me to meet the woman who

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.000
seduced and abused you?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.690
And basically

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.080
admits that he spanks her because he wants to beat up his dead mom.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.648
Christian: I get off on punishing women-- women who look like you--

00:02:14.648 --> 00:02:15.310
Anastasia: Like your mother.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.800
Seriously. Who actually thinks this movie

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.760
is sexy?

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.489
Anastasia: It's all wrong. All of this is wrong.

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.579
That's exactly what I've been saying!

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.170
But who cares about the plot or characters?

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.750
You're here for the sex, and there's

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.239
definitely some of that in this. Witness

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.799
sex scenes that draw with the

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.450
imagination of a Bible study group.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.850
Featuring two scenes of missionary with

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.459
his pants on. One scene of doggystyle

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.250
with his pants on. An unrated bonus scene

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.549
of doggystyle with his pants on. A shower

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.640
scene with his pants on. And a finale

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.130
where they really push the envelope by

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.430
doing missionary with. His. Pants. Offfff.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.989
The only thing less sexy than these sex

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.609
scenes is how much these two seem like

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:02.989
they actually hate each other in real

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.410
life. I imagine a lot of sex scenes. Ughhh.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.850
That's the look of two people regretting a

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.989
paycheck. Starring: these actual quotes

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.940
from the Fifty Shades Darker book that

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.520
didn't make it into the movie.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.800
(music) This movie's written so lazy right now. The book that it's based on so lazy right now

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.300
(music) I wish somebody would taze me right now. This story's bout as sexy as rabies right now.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.780
At least no one was dumb enough to let that phrase in the movie.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.100
Anastasia: I was being romantic, and then you just go and distract me with your kinky f*ckery.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.960
OH COME ON.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.240
(music) Oh oh, just go, and watch a porno.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.100
Fifty fifty chance I don't make it through the next one.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.570
You know what the most messed up

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.520
thing about Christian Grey is? The framed

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.870
Chronicles of Riddick poster in his

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.400
bedroom. Run, Anastasia, run!

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.380
"I'm Mary

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.700
Poppins y'all."

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.360
"Trash Panda."

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.100
"I'm wearing women's underwear and I like it!"

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.700
"Don't wizz on the electric fence."

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.500
"My name is Oliver Queen, and I the fastest man alive.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.600
After I blew up those time masters I was sent to earth to protect my cousin."
