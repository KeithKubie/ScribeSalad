00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.070 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Well welcome to Between
Two Friends with Smithsonian Library

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.910
of Congress and National Archives
where we ask irreverent questions

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.200
of some of the most powerful
people in cultural heritage.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.500
So thank you.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.810
This is going to be.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.380
Hey come on guys, this
is going to be good.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.140
So first I want to say, I mean
this has been an amazing day.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.730
I hope everyone has enjoyed
themselves at DPLA Fest.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.840
And it's not lost on
me the fest idea.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.800
You know, this is supposed
to be a celebration.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.100
It's supposed to be fun, you know.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.990
This is really a celebration
of our cultural heritage.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.000
And to me it's just
been an absolute honor,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.330
and I'm very grateful to be here.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.760
And I've been thinking
about that through the day.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.360
And to be with so many people
who care so passionately

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.400
about getting this
information out to the world.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.370
You know, it's our
country's history.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.360
And this is our America
at its best to me.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.910
It's not about hate or
exclusion, you know.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.870
It's about how do we
include people in this?

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.320
How do we tell these stories?

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.690
And so I just want to acknowledge
that, that that's kind of the place

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.190 position:56%
where a lot of us come to this from.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.850
And it's great to be
with everyone here.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.590
So, I just wanted to start
with that, a little of it.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.610
And while we're not there yet,
we've got a lot of work to do.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.070
This is what we want to talk about.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.580
And on this panel particularly,
looking at one example.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.520
We'll show you a little
bit about that.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.670
I'm not going into huge
depth but really talk

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.760
about the collaboration behind
it and how DPLA and these kind

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.730
of changing the way
that we work together.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.750
This life after the web or life on
the web is really opening the door

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.970
to collaborative working
environments

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.940
that we wouldn't have even
foreseen 25 years ago or so.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.240
And how we take advantage
of those opportunities.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.120
So, with that, before I say that
I want to talk just a little bit

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.720
about this panel, and everybody
will introduce themselves.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.830
But when I first started
working in cultural heritage,

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.950
about eight years ago or
so, and when I say working

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.680
with cultural heritage,
working in cultural,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.810
that means screen scraping,
downloading, stealing,

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.230
any other way I can get my
hands on cultural heritage data.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.780
And I started to find
that libraries, archives

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.520
and museums were full of
radical ideas and radical people

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.750
who really wanted to make
this work accessible.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.480
Even though I felt like I might
have been doing something,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.090
you know, illegal or something.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.250
Which it turns out I wasn't, okay.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.960
Just so everyone knows.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.310
One of the first things
that happened to me

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.490
when I started realizing that we
were working in bigger collections,

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.890
I came to Washington on vacation,
and Ed Summers was like hey,

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.960
you've got to meet
with Helena Zinkham.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.760
And I felt like I'm going
to the principal's office.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.820
Like I'm in serious trouble now.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.640
We were at the time
working with Civil War data,

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.230
and I went and I met her.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.990
And I kind of explained what we
were doing, taking all this data,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.860
linked open data, how it
might be useful, etcetera.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.350
And she looked at me, as she does,
kind of skeptically, and said,

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.440
well why aren't you
using this data set?

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.340
Right when I thought I was
going to get in trouble

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.920
for taking all these
other data sets.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.930
She started throwing
more data sets at me.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.340
And that's when I realized that
this was something that's really

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.640
gaining momentum.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.720
This is a global movement
where we're trying

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.560
to encourage this kind of work.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.550
And then a few years later
I was happy to meet Pam.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.980
And she was like, well we've
got millions of things.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.530
Why aren't you using
all of these things?

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.930
Let's get this out there.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.230
So it keeps going.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.890
So unfortunately, I just met
Dave a couple of months ago.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.730
I don't even want to know
how much stuff he guys

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.710
at the Smithsonian for us to use.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.270
Because at this point we've
got so much to work from.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.100
So with that, that's my
introduction to these three.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.970
But let's hear from you three.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.590
What, you know, who you are and
what you do, and then we'll go

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.810
and we'll jump into some questions.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.120
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: So I'm Helena
Zinkham here today as Director

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.960
for Collections and Services
at the Library of Congress.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.310
But my roots are in historical
photography, historical pictures.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.000
&gt;&gt; Pamela Wright: Okay,
I'm Pam Wright.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.530
I'm the Chief Innovation
Officer of the National Archives,

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.160
so I'm interested in
access to our holdings.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.430
And in this century,
that means digital.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.560
And so any way that we
can get where people are

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.930
and answer their questions,
give them our records,

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.190
let them see things
that they may never see,

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.290
look for in any other way coming
in the door, I want to do.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.750
So that's what I'm into.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.540
&gt;&gt; David McOwen: I'm the
Digital Media Developer

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.820 position:56%
for Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of American History.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.800
That means I do a lot of web work.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.860
It's a pretty small team, so it
means we do a lot of everything.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:06.060
And it's really about getting
our content out to the people

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.530
who can't physically
come to the building

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.770
with a definite focus on education.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.070
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Great.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.030
I forgot to introduce
myself, I think.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.330
&gt;&gt; Pamela Wright: Oh yeah.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.630
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: I'm Jon Voss,

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.130
the Strategic Partnership
Director at Historypin.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.680
And one of the ways that we all
have gotten together on this,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.770
thanks to the National Archive
just really kicking it off,

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.790
and you can see pictures behind us.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.090
This is an app on the sort

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.770 position:56%
of the National World War I app
that's become really, different ways

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.540
that we can access content
from World War I as we're

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:44.560 position:56%
in the World War I centenary period,
which is 2014, really 2014 and 2020

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.460
when we look at how the social
impacts are from that time period.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:54.030
And this project, just to kind
of give you a little framework,

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.140 position:56%
is we have three real goals on this,
one of which is promoting discovery

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.440
and use of the collections.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.930
And it really started with a focus

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.930
on the National Archives
moving picture images.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.130
They have, you know,
this amazing collection

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.770
of World War I moving images

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.460
which are being preserved
and restored incredibly.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.740
And you'll hear more
about that tomorrow.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.420
Tomorrow morning there's a
panel with the Historypin

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.620
and National Archive teams talking
a little bit more about that.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.470
The other goal is to
enrich these collections.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.560
So what happens if people
are able to discover these

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.030
and then do more with them.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.930
Now that's the next part of it.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.650
And then finally to support the use

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.700
of this content in
local communities.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.770
And once we started to do
this at the National Archives

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.280
and really apply this kind of
design thinking to this approach

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.700
and experiment with that,
we started to realize

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.440
that other institutions could
pretty easily join along with that.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.300
And so that's what we've
opened the door to.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.700
Now we've got National Archives,
Library of Congress, Smithsonian,

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.520
the World War One Centennial
Commission, World War I Museum.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.030
This list could go on and on.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.920
Digital Public Library of America,
the American Association of State

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.720
and Local History, Europeana
and Eurocleos [phonetic].

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.380
So it's become this
huge momentum gathering.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.550
And we'll see a little bit
more again tomorrow morning,

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.850
what this might, I'm not really
going to go into the futures,

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.990
although I am going to flip
through a couple of these.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.690
That it's about user
collections, tag-based enrichments,

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.040
and really seeing this, you
know, it's built for tablets.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.860
Our dev team and Brenda will
talk more about this tomorrow,

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.310
really get into how this
helps bring digital photos

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.070
into a tactile environment,
which is exciting.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.760
So that's kind of just gives
us a little bit of a context

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.780
about how we all started
working together.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.440
And as a potential model for how
this could work across all kinds

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.270
of projects and how
it is already working

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:47.250
across all kinds of projects.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:52.340
So with that, let's get started
with a couple of questions.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.400 position:56%
And I'm going to confess that I told
Helena what question I was going

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.700
to ask her.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.000
So she's got, come on.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.300
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham:
I've got pictures.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.600
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: She's got pictures.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.610
So this is a leading question,
but, you know, because librarians,

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:04.910
they know what's going on.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.900 position:56%
So you have to be able to have them
prepared for what's going to happen.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.770
So one of the, and this
is where it came up from.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:15.290
We were talking about how this
app has this potential to be one

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.680
of the biggest national
collaborative projects

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.770
that you might have been
a part of in a long time.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:21.210
And when we started
to get into that,

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.960
I mean this is someone
who's got amazing experience

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.260
in the library world.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.120
And I'm really interested
for you to kind

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.070
of contextualize this a little bit,
for how collaboration has worked

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:36.420
in the library sector and
across archives and museums,

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.530
you know, in the last few years.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.910
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: So I have
a very short answer for Jon.

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:45.970
Key ingredient for
successful collaboration.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.720
There we go.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.210
Open access.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:55.620
And by that I mean
free access and free

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.680
to reuse the content
of our collections.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.670
That seems to be what
excites people the most,

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.160
but it's also the most
valuable, the most useful,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.030
the most helpful to them.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:08.220
And so when lots of different kinds
of institutions are getting ready

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.900
to collaborate, if the common
cause is built around access,

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.690
but not just the initial
use, the reuse,

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.780
the repackaging of the content.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.270
That's where I think this World War
I mobile app will start taking us

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.600
in more and different directions.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.230
I'm here today as Director
for Collections and Services.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.640
I mentioned already, my roots are
in historical photo collections.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.620 position:56%
So as part of setting the stage, I'm
also here as your library historian.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:40.590
A quick trip into the past
where in the early 1990s,

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.010
the Library of Congress
launched its commitment

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.110
to set the collections free.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.980
And I'm speaking here of
the no known copyright

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.450
restriction collections.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.760 position:56%
I realize DPLA is broader than that.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:58.090
But the days of American
memory when the idea is to,

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:02.380
Jon, okay, thank you Jon.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.940 position:56%
The idea was set the collections
free so that they would be available

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.130
to anyone, any time, anywhere.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:11.420
You didn't have to make
that trip to Washington.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.720
Library without walls.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.420
That's what we called it.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:15.720
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Yeah.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.020
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: But
of course I'm also here

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.800
to represent libraries in general.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.260
And we're master collaborators
in the best sense of that word.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.350
It's actually our life's blood.

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.690
If we don't share our resources,
we aren't going to survive.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.330
We're that low funded.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.060
Same is true of archives
and museums.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.540
But this current slide
just is a reminder

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.650
that there's wonderful
collaborations around acquisitions,

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.350
who's going to collect what.

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.380
Cooperative cataloging,
shared storage facilities,

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.610
and the wonderful of
intra-library loan.

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:49.950
You take that, I want to step
back in history just one more time

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.780
with National Union Catalogs.

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.650
How many of you have heard
of that phrase before?

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.700
Oh a pretty good showing of hands.

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.000
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.570
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: So the photo
on the left, that's a picture

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:07.650
of card catalog distribution
in the Library of Congress.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.800
It's a room in the Jefferson
Building, and from the floor

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.820
to the ceiling, those
are trays of cards.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.990
And staff of, what do you think,
100 people, picking out the cards

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.190 position:56%
and mailing them to other libraries.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:21.490
How's that for sharing?

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:22.790
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: That's amazing.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:25.600
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: Well eventually
from cards, print those citations

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.420
into great tall green volumes.

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.110
Today, and I think this is the
University of San Francisco,

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:36.890 position:56%
we just make Christmas trees out of
the original National Union Catalog.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:40.260
Definitely an out-motive
form of communication.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.560
But the dream is alive.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.960
In fact, heavily pursued.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:48.520
Whether it's American
memory, American Archive

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.420
of Public Broadcasting, historical
American Building survey,

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.150
wonderful grant projects that
let people pool their resources

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.270
into shared spaces
so that it's easier

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:01.290
to find what we all have together.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.160
Build something better
than one alone.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.700
Among the mega collaborations,
there will, of course,

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.700
be the Digital Public
Library of America.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:12.910
There's HathiTrust, Archive Grid,
Biodiversity Heritage Library,

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:18.570
Europeana, World Cap, how could I
forget, the current Union Catalog.

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.260
But I did want to spend just
a few moments on Flickr,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:26.080 position:56%
because I think more key ingredients
will kick out from that, Jon.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.360
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Yeah.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.540
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: So
in 2007 the Library

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.760
of Congress called Flickr up.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.070
We'd sent them some emails,
and they didn't reply.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.200
So we tried the old-fashioned
telephone.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.030
Fortunately George Oats
[phonetic] answered.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.840
And she actually had
a grander vision

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.760
and created the Flickr commons.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.290
In other words, rather than just
lots of different libraries,

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.520
archives and museums
having separate collections,

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.210
poured into the same space.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:54.370
Of course it's pictures.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:56.650
But what's special about it?

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:58.930
You're launching the
collections into a place

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:01.900
where people are looking
for pictures anyway.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:04.850 position:56%
And that means they're going to trip
across them even if they never knew

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.890 position:56%
to look for them in the first place.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:09.150
So it's mega access in my book.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:13.010
But it's also an incredibly
simple framework.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.930
It's low cost, multilingual,

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:20.700
no metadata standard beyond a
unique ID number, maybe a title.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:26.950 position:56%
It let people interact with the user
community however they wanted to.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.210
And great creativity
has been released.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.360
I wanted to encourage you
especially to take a look

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.510
at the National Library of Ireland.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.580
They post maybe two,
three photos a week.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.880
They get between 10 and 30
comments on every picture.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.650
And it's substantive.

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:43.820
Information, context.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:48.070
For the Library of Congress
we've updated 9,000 pictures.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:52.320
We pull them back into our source
catalog and redistribute right back

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.730
out to the World War I
Act, to give one example.

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.160
So to wrap up this like launch pad

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:04.980
for what makes collaboration
work, what did I start with.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.280
Open access.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.360
Free to use and reuse,
a phrase I borrowed

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.280
from my boss who's here today.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.500
I will acknowledge that.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:18.480
But long standing success in
sharing and pooling resources.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.170
Maybe we're getting too many
places to share our resources.

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:24.330
That might become a
hurdle we can talk about.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:28.220
But otherwise, I hope I've set
the scene for success is more

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:33.140
than possible, success is essential
and happening all around us.

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.440
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Great.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.270
I think it's interesting
when you talk about Flickr.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:39.450
And we talked about that a
little bit the other day.

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:43.080
And just this idea that you had,
a really lightweight team trying

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.490
to do something very
simple by getting it out.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.700
And it gives you a way to
connect directly with community

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.040
or build community, as
you mentioned in Ireland.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.340
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: Exactly.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.020
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: And that's a
big piece of it, you know,

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.910
I thought about that as I was lost
in the tunnels beyond, you know,

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.790
underneath the buildings
here, like how much you can do

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.040
by just getting a few
things out there.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.340
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: We frankly
worried about talking to you today.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.340
We're three great big
federal institutions.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.530
We must look richer
than [inaudible].

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:11.620
But the truth is, we
want collaborations

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:15.830
where small institutions, as
well as large, can participate.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.430
And Flickr was a great
example in that.

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:18.780
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Great.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.460
So Pam, to turn to you
on this a little bit.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.450
The National Archives obviously
key to making this app happen.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.430
And part of a much bigger
vision for what you're doing

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.650
at the National Archives when
you talk about sharing content

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.720
on almost unimaginable levels.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:39.450
Tell us a little bit particularly
how this content was selected

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.640
and why this is an
important piece of content.

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.820
But how this also is an example
for future work that might happen

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.760
from National Archives
and other things,

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.710
other ways that you're doing work
from the Archives' perspective.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:53.010
&gt;&gt; Pamela Wright: Great.

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:54.310
Thank you.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.810
So the digitization process

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:01.390
at the National Archives
is a huge focus for us.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:08.350
And we have 12 billion textual
pages of records and millions of,

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:12.600
hundreds of millions of
photographs and film.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.060
We've just got a lot to do.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:19.880
In our strategic plan,
under make access happen,

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.590
you will see that we are
going to digitize everything.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:27.190
That is the moon shot that
the archivist set out for us,

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:32.020
and something that
it seems impossible.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.690
But just by saying that,
it changes the mindset

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:39.880
and starts helping change the
culture of our agency to think

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.390
in this century for
something to be accessible.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.690
What does that mean?

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:46.430
And it means digital for us.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:50.930
And so in moving into
that digital world,

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:54.500
we developed a digitization
strategy.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.920
And in that strategy we
thought about the different ways

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.180
that we want to get
digitization done.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:05.180 position:56%
But we also then opened it up to the
public and said, what do you want?

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:10.370 position:56%
How should we prioritize the
digitization that we're going to do?

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:13.890
And so we have a matrix
of decision-making

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:17.750
for what we prioritize
for digitization.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:22.850 position:56%
And we're doing everything we can to
walk down that list and, you know,

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:26.290
make sure that we make
in a digital way,

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.630
the records accessible
to the public.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:32.880
So that's what, that's kind of that
larger vision where this sits in.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.890
So it's great to make it
available in our catalog.

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.530
But our catalog has so much.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:42.040
I see that as kind of
the ocean of our records.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.510
Right now we have 10
million descriptions

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.820
in our catalog, just descriptions.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.850 position:56%
Another 9.7 million digital objects.

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:56.530
We have a whopping 220 million
ready to come in as we scale

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.560
up the catalog over the
next couple of years.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.270
So just the size is
overwhelming for people.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:05.430
And what I really like about this
project and what we're working

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:09.450
on together is, because
we could all easily,

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:13.470
any one of us could overwhelm
this app pretty quickly.

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:18.570
It's not comprehensive in
thinking in new ways Brenda

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:23.540
on your staff talked to our staff
about paths into our records.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:28.690
And that path finding is something
that we really, I think we thought

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:30.930
of before, but this idea that
you don't have everything.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:32.670
You can have a slice to get in.

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:35.330
I love that idea.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.760
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: And I've had the
great opportunity and privilege

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.470
in our team to really dig into the
archives there a little bit with.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:46.080 position:56%
I mean just, I made some, the best
of the country in terms of curators,

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.810
in terms of preservationists.

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:50.280
People who know this stuff so well.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.780
And part of that, part of what
you're working on with all

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.920
of this is how do you
open the doors to people?

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.480
You know, there's a
research room obviously,

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.920
and it's used in certain ways.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.740
But how are you proactively
looking at getting the public

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:03.620
into those spaces in new ways?

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.390
I mean there's some
things in the works?

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:09.500
&gt;&gt; Pamela Wright: Well we have the
innovation Hub that's a brand new.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:10.800
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: It's brand new.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.100
&gt;&gt; Pamela Wright: Yeah.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.530
So at Archives One here downtown,

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:17.290
and I think tomorrow there's
a hack-a-thon in there.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:23.550
We found a room on the first floor
and decided to kind of open it

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:27.060
up as a space for the public
and staff to work together

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.770
on innovation initiatives and
projects that we're working on.

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.340
So yeah, so you will get
to see that tomorrow,

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:35.400
and we welcome you over there.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.910
What we're really doing
in a part of the Hub,

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:41.550
one of the projects is
citizen archivist digitization.

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.590
So if you're a researcher
at the National Archives,

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:48.900
and you agree to give us a copy
of anything that you're scanning,

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.410
we'll make sure to put your name in
the catalog, along with the scan.

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:56.190
So it's contributed by
citizen archivist Jon Voss.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.610
And it goes up in our catalog.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.470
This idea of opening up our catalog

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.870
and really we're calling it a
social catalog, making it open

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.850
so that the public can
contribute, not just consume,

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.190
is really important to us.

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:10.490
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Yeah, that's great.

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:12.240
It's, I mean it kind of reminds
me we talked a little bit

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.540
about this room setup, right.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.520
Like when we talked
about this panel.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.710
It's like it's just going to
be an informal discussion,

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.650
and Helena was like, they
do ballets on this stage.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:24.030
So like 50 years ago
or 100 years ago

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:25.870
when these room were being built,

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:28.170
that's kind of indicative
of the model, right.

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.470
&gt;&gt; Pamela Wright: Exactly.

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:30.770
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Like wisdom would
be imparted from this place.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.070
And I think we're now looking at,

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:33.930
and I think the Hub
is a great example.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.250
Like the tables move, the
chairs move, the white boards.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:37.560
It's a really exciting space.

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.560
We're actually building
things differently now.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:44.940
So I think that's a telling
sign of where we're going.

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.120
So Dave, I want to talk to
you a little about, you know,

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.760
we talked about The Smithsonian
as a thing, but you know very well

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.500
and you've made clear that
it's actually a large number

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.220
of institutions who are already
finding ways to work together

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.290
within that, both internally
and externally.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:02.850
So what have you learned about
collaboration in that space,

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.150
in your environment there?

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.810
And how has that changed
even in recent years?

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.880
&gt;&gt; David McOwen: It's
changed entirely

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.620
over the last few years
that I've been there.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.530
You know, The Smithsonian
is, there is the castle,

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:18.130
and there's an administrative unit.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.950
There's central IT unit
that supports us wonderfully

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:26.450
when it comes to getting our
objects out into the web.

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:30.560
But it's, you know, I work for
the new media department in the,

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:36.680
you know, Office of Public
Engagement in American History.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.550
So that's one museum.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:39.850
There's 18 others.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:41.150
There's a zoo.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:42.500
There's nine research units.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.800
That's The Smithsonian.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:50.160
So you know, when we collaborate
externally, that's kind of the end

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:54.740
of a very lengthy internal
collaboration process just to get

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:58.900
to step one with other
people, which is great.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:02.840
But it's, you know, it
does take a lot of effort.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:07.770
And it's a little more
chaotic because, you know,

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:09.700
we have great support
from the general counsel

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.840
to make legal documents happen.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.150
And we have support from the
castle to make connections.

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:20.840
But in this case, we decided, you
know, this is a really good idea.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.380
We're American history.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.610
We probably have the most
World War I stuff anyway.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:28.060
So we'll be the trailblazers.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.770
We'll go. We'll work
through the things.

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:34.020
We always work with
an idea internally

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:38.800
and in collaborative projects of
okay, how do we get this done.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.150
But how do we do this
in a way that's going

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:46.210
to enable the people next
door to do it tomorrow

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:48.730
or next week or next year.

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:51.990
We've been pretty successful
with that across the board

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:53.860
with our digital platforms.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.160
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Right.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.460
&gt;&gt; David McOwen: But it really is.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.850
And that's, aside from having
open data, which we're working on,

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:01.150
we're working towards that.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:08.660
The other piece of it is really
having a reliable platform

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:12.850
that other people are going to
be able to use and is going to be

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:15.500
around for a little while.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:20.500
Because it takes us a while to
kind of get spooled up on things.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:22.410
And it's a lot of effort.

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:25.490
Even if it's, you know,
free information,

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:28.280
it's objects that we've
already published out.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.580
The labels are written.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.340
All of that stuff's done.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.010
That still takes time.

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:35.940
It takes a, you know, a
staff member to sit down

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.540
and come up with the stories.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:38.840
Come up with the paths.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.190
Come up with the themes for things.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:43.220
And that's not even
counting the objects

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.990 position:56%
that aren't digitized yet, you know.

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:52.830
We did a project about the
Civil War, sesquicentennial.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:59.220
We did a project about the
Civil Rights anniversary.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:04.610
And they were great, but they
were one off technology platforms.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.660
And so they worked for the time,

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:10.340
and now we've kind of
put them over here.

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:14.910
And that doesn't help you kind of
build the momentum that you need,

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:19.730
you know, within The
Smithsonian, within any kind

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:22.500
of large organization where
you've got multiple pieces,

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:27.180
let alone being able to then turn
and, you know talk to other people

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.990
and say hey, we have this thing.

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:31.990
Do you want to come play and let's
build this and make it even better

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:33.880
and get our content out there?

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.180
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Right.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.840
Great. So I also, I
want to make sure

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.720
if you have any questions,
please start jumping in.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.020
Raise your hands.

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.320
I'll keep asking questions all day.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.470
But if you have something, I want
you to be able to dig into it.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:49.770
There you go.

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:51.960
&gt;&gt; Thanks very much.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:56.980
So the three of you represent
three legacies [inaudible].

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:58.550
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham:
And actually Carol,

00:24:58.550 --> 00:24:59.850
if you could give us one second.

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:01.490
Joe's bringing a mike down for you.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:03.570
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.380
Thank you.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:06.680
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: Thanks Joe.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.470
&gt;&gt; So I just mentioned
that, you know,

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:14.200
the three of you represent legacy
institutions tied to this country.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.120
And I'd be interested to know,

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:20.960
what's the biggest thing holding
the three of you back individually

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.980
as institutions and holding
the three of you back

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:28.430
from working more collectively
and collaboratively?

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:30.350
Is it technology?

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:31.650
Is it funding?

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.740
Is it?

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.040
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Policy.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.560
&gt;&gt; Policy.

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.860
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Good question.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.440
Who wants to jump in on that?

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:45.730
&gt;&gt; Pamela Wright: I'll, so I
think that some of the things

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:47.960 position:56%
that we're getting over, the hurdles

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.150
that we're getting
over is the culture.

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:55.490
And the institution, in
our institution anyway,

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:58.790
was it's collaborative, but
collaborative is kind of gravy.

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:00.610
And what we do and our mission,

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:03.270
we focus very internally
and do that work.

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:07.170
And I think one of my staff said,

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:09.860
it's no longer just what you
know, it's what you share.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.160
And that idea

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:16.360
of now mission-critical work
actually happens collaboratively.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.460
And that culture changing from,
we're going to just keep our head

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:23.220
down and not talk to anybody and
get our work done is changing.

00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:27.900
So I think there's culture change
in it, and then just funding

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:32.900
for digitization is, you know,
it costs a lot to do it right.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.810
So I think those two are big.

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:38.800
As we get to know each other more
and we get out of these meetings

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.430
and stuff, I feel like those, that
is becoming easier and easier.

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:46.260
It's just making sure that
we have leadership at the top

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.590
of our institutions that say
collaboration is important

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:52.090
and is critical to the mission.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:54.330
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: And I
have a different take on it.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.810
So I don't actually, I agree with
Pam, those are the good hurdles.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.270
But I also think we just
haven't done a good enough job

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:03.990
of showing how often and how
richly we do collaborate.

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.930
So for example, there
are the heritage months.

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:10.670
And the Library of Congress stepped
in, and we host that website.

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:13.930
And it must be at least ten
different federal agencies

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:17.910
that contribute their content and
their events to a single web space.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:20.870
But we also collaborate
all the time on standards.

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:26.680 position:56%
So the federal digitizing guidelines
initiative, but with web harvesting.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.600
That's another great
example of collaboration.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.690
I think that we have at times
taken turns, and that looks

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:35.870
as if we're not collaborating.

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:38.540
But in fact, we're just deciding
how to share the workload

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:40.330
and how to share the funding.

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:42.870
So I'd like to give
two more examples.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:46.530
The National Endowment
for Humanities.

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:47.830
It's great.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:50.290
The Library of Congress has
fantastic newspaper holdings.

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:51.690
But we're not the be-all
and end-all.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:55.490
So in partnership with National
Endowment for Humanities we agreed

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:59.820
to take responsibility to be the
long-term preservation steward

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.050
and the access provider.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.860
But it's 40 different states
throughout the country

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.390
and the territories
participating today.

00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:12.010 position:56%
And they've just crossed a milestone
of 10 million pages of newspapers.

00:28:12.010 --> 00:28:13.820
Fantastic.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.100
So despite what you read in the
newspapers from time to time,

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.420
the Library is alive and
well and very busily,

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:23.180
I mean the content is pouring in.

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.480
StoryCorps.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.700
Can you imagine when he app mobile?

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:30.460
Terabytes, petabytes, weekly.

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.260
And we're keeping up.

00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.720
American Archive of
Public Broadcasting.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:40.170
So there too at a national level
will take this turn and go ahead

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:42.700
and collaborate with WGBH.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:47.900 position:56%
That's the incunabula of television,
right up to the present eventually.

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:51.120
They're going to provide the access
because of the rights constraints.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.790
But we'll step in on
the preservation side.

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:56.680
So I think, if you can
help us understand how

00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.530
to better publicize our work, that
would probably be a good thing.

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:03.180
Because there's a lot more
going on than what shows.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.700
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Yeah, I think
that's a great point in terms

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.980
of how that's presented
to the public, you know.

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:09.780
And when there is so much going on,

00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:13.740
how is it that you build this
sort of open environment?

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.040
You know, as you say.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.470
And it's like, for me,
when I thought I was going

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:18.530
to the principal's office
when I first met you.

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:19.830
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:21.130
Welcome Jon.

00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:22.430
It's a great idea.

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:23.730
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Yeah, come on in.

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:25.030
And it's about, kind of, and
it took somebody telling me

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:26.330
who to talk to for that to happen.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:28.120
So that's a great, I think that
is a really important barrier

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.420
that we might look at.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.720
How to overcome.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.020
Do you have thoughts on this?

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.320
&gt;&gt; David McOwen: Yeah,
I mean, like I said,

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:37.990 position:56%
The Smithsonian is a little more
compartmentalized between the units.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:40.090
So we do collaborations
all the time.

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:43.340
It's generally one-on-one,
one-on-two.

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.980
When you're talking about
this level of collaboration,

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:50.710
which I think happens
less frequently, to me,

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:55.050
that basically comes for
us down to digitization

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:58.400
and getting the data
in an open format.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:04.330
You know, four years ago you
couldn't go to one central website

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.500 position:56%
to search Smithsonian's collections.

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.120
Now you can, 9.6 million objects.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.420
That sounds awesome.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:11.840
We have 138 million objects.

00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.090
So we have a lot of work to do.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:20.730 position:56%
And for now, that's a closed system.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:25.080
So I think the key
to unlock this door

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:31.450
to worldwide massive collaboration
is getting the data out there

00:30:31.450 --> 00:30:35.780
and into the hands of
anybody who wants to use it.

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:38.830
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Anyone
else have something?

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.850
I just, also as a quick
follow-up to that.

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:43.660
Sometimes it's frustrating
to me because I think

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.080
of this as an open gov thing.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.970
You know, we hear a
lot about open gov.

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:50.230
But we don't have that conversation
so much within cultural heritage.

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:53.430
And I think that's something
that we can leverage as well.

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:56.230
That there is a real remit
to have this out there

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.250
for the public and
for the public good.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:59.700
And having that come
from the top down.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.890
I think you're absolutely
right about this.

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:03.430
You know, there needs
to be a culture

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:06.330
of this being a critical
part of what we're doing.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:12.780
So. Other questions for this crew?

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:14.370
&gt;&gt; David McOwen: Come on now.

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:15.670
&gt;&gt; Helen Zinkham: It is
the end of [Inaudible].

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:17.870
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Alright, I'll ask
questions to these three all day.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:21.580
Believe me, this is so.

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.880
Let's see.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.650
So one of the things that is often
to me when we work on these kinds

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:31.900
of projects, I find that the
technical barriers tend to be more,

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.660
we can overcome those a lot easier

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.250
than the policy barriers
or the legal barriers.

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:43.700 position:56%
Now with this project, for instance,
it's been pretty straightforward.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.940
Marcus has been a huge
person through, you know,

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:49.720
like having a team that says
here's a very simple agreement

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.380
of how we're going to
cooperate together.

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:55.000
And it's been amazing to see the
legal counsels on both teams,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.730
or all teams make that happen.

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:59.620
But what are, how is that
played out for you on this

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.710
or for other projects, and how
can you foresee streamlining

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:04.010
that in the future?

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:05.890
I mean we talk about the culture,
but let's talk a little bit more

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:07.860
about the logistical elements.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.360
You know, what if you've
got an enthusiast out there

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.780
that says I've got a great idea
for a World War II project.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:16.350
I'm going to need these
things to do these things.

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:19.390
How might that happen in
the future going forward?

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:21.480
You know, how do we
facilitate those things?

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.880
&gt;&gt; Helen Zinkham: So
do you mean the degree

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.540
to which we'd be the tool builders.

00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:29.460
But then anyone could come and
bring their project or participate?

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.010
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Maybe not
even the tool builders.

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:33.980
You know, I think about when we
started the Civil War data project,

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.280
right?

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:38.300
It was, your take was, and
this maybe is also an evolution

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.600
of the tools over the time.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:43.270
That was ten years ago you
said, we have an OEI PMH server.

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:44.620
You can download all this stuff.

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:46.630
Make sure you look at
what the content looks

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:48.780
like as well, you know.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:52.020
Now there's APIs, National
Archives has an API.

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.460
Smithsonian, yours is a
little bit more unlocked.

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:56.770
&gt;&gt; David McOwen: It's,
we're working towards it.

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:58.070
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Okay.

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:00.000
&gt;&gt; David McOwen: It is a priority
that our previous secretary,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.660
digitization was, you
know, a priority,

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:06.500
that hasn't discontinued yet.

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:07.800
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Right.

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.730
&gt;&gt; David McOwen: But yeah
it's, we're working towards it.

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:12.030
A lot of that is resources.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:13.820
A lot of that is making
that a priority

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:19.270
to build something that's going
to work for us and for the public.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:20.570
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Well in your case,

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:23.940
you see that for internal
use first probably, right.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:25.580
Like how is this data going

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.320
to be used accessible
within the institutions?

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.050 position:56%
But then taking that a step further.

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:33.300
&gt;&gt; David McOwen: Yeah, I mean,
there's so many layers as far as,

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.970
you know, whenever
we publish an object,

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:40.660
it goes through a lengthy
process of, you know,

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.170
do we actually own this object.

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:43.690
Can we prove that we
own this object?

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:46.490
Are there any rights that
we didn't know about?

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:50.260
Along with the curatorial
process and just kind

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:54.930 position:56%
of the collections process of making
sure all the details are right.

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:58.010
So that slows us down a lot.

00:33:58.010 --> 00:33:59.330
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Yeah.

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:00.630
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: So
maybe you're also asking

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:02.950
about user contributed content.

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:07.000
One of the great things David
that occurs to me, a gift I've had

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.710
because of working with pictures,
they also come so scantily clad

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:13.170
with metadata, we've been dependent

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:15.600
on other people telling us
what's going on in pictures

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.320
for an awfully long time.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:23.260
So the idea that it has to be
finished and polished, it's never,

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.040
never really been in play.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.640
We seek. We craved.

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.460
Tell us more about.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.100
So I hope I didn't misstep here.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.310
But user contributed content,

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:35.050
programs like the Veterans
History Project.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:37.460
You're actively putting out a call.

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:40.630
If you know a veteran,
please make an interview.

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:43.140
And you can send that to
the Library of Congress.

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:45.300
There's a certain degree
of standard.

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.710
Could the sound file
be in this format?

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:49.160
We'd love to have a mobile app.

00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.430
I know it isn't modern
enough at this point.

00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:53.190
Fifteen years in.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:58.160
But that's a very clear, it's a
collection acquisition strategy.

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.240
And you put out a call for
help and open the doors.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.830
The firehouse people have
surfaced recently and said,

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:07.670
we've gathered all this
amazing information.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:09.580
Can't you take care of it for us?

00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:10.880
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Oh, interesting.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.230
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: So it's
not something we anticipated,

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:14.290
but it's certainly
something we can talk about.

00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:15.590
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Right.

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:17.670
Great. Pam, any thoughts.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:19.780
&gt;&gt; Pamela Wright: So I'm just
thinking about, you know,

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:26.640
ten years ago when we did MOUs
with like ancestry when we started.

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:29.380
It was very scary, and
there were, you know,

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.150
it was long discussions,
lots of meetings.

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:34.520
It took a long time to get to that.

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.140
Because of that work, because
of all the work that's happened

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.460
in the past, we know are
really comfortable with MOUs,

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.340
how they work, what
are we going to do.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:47.460
And I feel like we've got a
good relationship and kind

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.260
of track record with
our legal counsel.

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:54.140
So now these MOUs are
much easier to do.

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:57.690 position:56%
I think it's easier to
collaborate than it ever was before.

00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:01.210
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Yeah it's like there's
a little bit of a transition to,

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:02.890 position:56%
you know, you used to be really CYA.

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:05.430
Make sure we don't get
burned on anything.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:06.880
And really long things.

00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.180
But it's kind of converted
to how can we make sure

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:10.480
that this stuff is getting out.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.340
And that speaks to that
cultural change too.

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:14.780
&gt;&gt; Pamela Wright: And the
question of risk changes.

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:16.080
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: That's right.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:18.060
&gt;&gt; Pamela Wright: The risk isn't
how we're going to get burned

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.310
but what if we don't participate.

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:21.760
What if we aren't out there.

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.390
And I think that is
so exciting to see.

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:25.920
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: So social
media probably helped with that.

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.220
&gt;&gt; Pamela Wright.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:28.520
Yeah.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.820
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: I'm going
to see if we can't hear

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.120
from the audience on this one.

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.420
What are your hurdles?

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:33.720
Is it policy?

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.020
Is it legal?

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.320
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Yeah.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.620
&gt;&gt; I actually have a.

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:38.920
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: Four
different questions.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.220
&gt;&gt; It really follows
directly along the line

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:41.520
of what you've been
discussing so far.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.960
And you've touched on
it kind of tangentially.

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:50.600 position:56%
But, how do you reconcile
different prioritization within each

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:55.690
of your entities when it comes
time to doing things together?

00:36:55.690 --> 00:37:00.510 position:56%
In other words, one of the things I
think we discover often is something

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:03.470
that seems a priority to us
may not be the same level

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:05.230
of priority to a partner.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:10.260
And yet we need resources from that
partner to do the collaboration.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:16.420
So, and granted your point about
that experience of having done this

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:18.160
and gone through the legal
hurdles and that kind

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.510
of stuff is a major
streamlining thing.

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:24.800
But it does seem to me
that reconciling priorities

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:29.930 position:56%
between entities which may have at
a very broad level a common mission,

00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:34.640
but specifically may have other
things that each is trying to get

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.650 position:56%
down over a short period of time,
has to represent some complications.

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:43.560
How do you work through it?

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:47.330
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: So in,
we look for common cause.

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.920
Sometimes it's bottom up.

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.120
So we each probably
have strategic plans.

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.610
I know NARA does, Library of
Congress just published its own.

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:58.910
We find the line that
touches on digitization.

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:02.710
The Library of Congress isn't going
to say, well digitize everything.

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:06.570
Why? Because we have a lot of
published under copyright material.

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:09.870
We don't want to scare our
user community entirely.

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:13.480
So ours would say,
maximize digitizing,

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.510
prioritized to the rights
free, the rights cleared.

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:20.080
But when it was World War I time,
and back to my taking turns part,

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.240
we could all see the
centennial coming.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.520
It was The Smithsonian
who stepped in.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:28.090
They convened this huge
two-day conference.

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:31.750
Got everybody in [inaudible]
together and sort of took a poll.

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:33.050
What are you thinking about?

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:34.350
What's going to happen?

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:35.650
How's it turning out?

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:36.950
And there've been follow-up
meetings.

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:38.710
So there's communication.

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:41.450
We don't have to have
necessarily a shared exhibition,

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:44.700
but we can make sure that we
don't step on top of each other.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.380
Who's going to scan which
of their collections?

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:51.910
So NARA's gone big time into your
wonderful movies for World War I.

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:54.570
The Library of Congress
also has movies.

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:56.890
These are government
military training films.

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:59.800
Ours comes perhaps more
from private sector.

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.090
It may be commercial producers.

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:06.240
I guess I'm trying to say
that the parts fit together.

00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.810
Could we do more things together?

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:11.740
Maybe that's part of the louder
voice, the better megaphone.

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:16.250
But I don't too often feel like
people are arriving on the doorstep

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:19.070
and saying, I've got a great idea.

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:23.020 position:56%
You need to buy this meat, cook
that dinner and serve it back to me.

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:27.680 position:56%
It is a little friendlier than that.

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David McOwen: Yeah, and I'll say,

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:31.640
nobody has as much
money as they want to.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:35.440
So you're already,
hopefully, used to the idea

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:40.320
of strategically selecting
the objects or the materials

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.620
that you're going to focus on.

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:44.730
Hopefully centered around some kind
of story or narrative or something

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:47.510
that has multiple levels of entry.

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:50.280
So I think everyone's doing that.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:53.690
So if you sit down and say okay,
what story are you telling?

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:56.580
Well we're not going
to tell that story.

00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:57.880
The posters.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:01.520 position:56%
We have tons of World War I posters.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:04.560
Well, they have all the posters.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.840 position:56%
So we don't need to tell that story.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:10.910
Now we do have the original
artwork for the Uncle Sam poster.

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:13.320
So we're going to prioritize
that because

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:18.450
that tells a different story, a
unique story that only we can tell.

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:20.610
And so we try to focus on those.

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:25.300
And I think if everyone does the
same thing and then realizes,

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.110
oh hey, let's a conversation.

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:28.410
We really think this is important.

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:29.880
We're like, oh we think
that's important too.

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.370
Alright, let's combine.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:37.820
So I don't think it's as foreign
as it used to be certainly.

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:45.870
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: So I want to close on
one last question for each of you.

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:47.580
We're getting to the end here.

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:49.180
Is there anything, anyone else?

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:53.580
Just to leave it on a
very optimistic note.

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:55.780
For the dream of what
the future of these kinds

00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:57.130
of collaborations look like.

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:58.480
You get whatever you wanted.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.780
You could start over.

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:01.220
You would not have all the
infrastructure [inaudible].

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:04.040
What would that look
like for you five years

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.340
from now, ten years from now?

00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.640
What might it look like anyway?

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:11.450
&gt;&gt; David McOwen: I'll go first.

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:12.750
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Go ahead.

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:15.160
&gt;&gt; David McOwen: Open
data, open data, open data.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.930
I want all of our data, and
I want it in your hands.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:23.630
I do think that, especially as we
kind of migrate this cultural shift

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:27.720
into a digital world
that authenticity

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.410
and reliability is going
to remain an issue.

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:31.980
So there's always going
to be a place, I think,

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:36.430
for cultural institutions
to curate their information.

00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:38.880
That is not mutually exclusive

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:43.460
from everyone else curating
your information as well.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:47.200
And to me, the most exciting
part of that is kind of get

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:53.110
into semantic data, the connections
that you're going to make

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:58.680
between our data and between our
data and other people's data.

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.180
That's fantastic.

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:03.430
That's a beautiful
thing to consider.

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:07.640
I love that Cooper Hewitt, when
they did their collection search,

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.610
you can search by color.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:11.440
Which makes sense for
them, their design museum.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.320
I want to do that for our
stuff, because that's fun.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.620
It's interesting.

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:16.920
[ Inaudible ]

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:20.030 position:56%
You know, so, you know, shake up the
Yahtzee cup and see what falls out.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:25.470 position:56%
And I think the public and
cultural institutions and libraries,

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:29.700
they enjoy that because they can,
you know, play with your objects.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:32.830
And I think we have a lot
to learn from that as well.

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:37.720
Things that we will never, ever
come to if we just sit in our kind

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.710
of one-way conversations.

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.690
As interactive as we
try to make things,

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:44.960
it's still predominantly
a one-way conversation.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.830
So I can't wait for that.

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:48.130
I think it's going to be amazing.

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:51.350
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Awesome.

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:53.470
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: Go ahead.

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:54.770
&gt;&gt; Pamela Wright: Okay.

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:59.100
So, we have talked about this
a lot at the National Archives.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:02.700
And one of the, I mean there's
lots of ways to answer this.

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:06.300
But just one of the ways that comes
to me if you're asking this is,

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:11.340 position:56%
one of my staff said, wouldn't it be
excellent if you didn't have to know

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:15.560
which of the institutions you
had to go to to ask a question.

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:20.970
Could you just ask a question,
and they kind of help you?

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:26.390
And we learned from a
product that we have

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:30.210
within the National Archives called
the internal collaboration network.

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:33.050
It's on the Jive platform, and
it's a way to share documents

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:35.890
and talk across the agency.

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:42.750 position:56%
And that same platform is what Apple
uses when your phone dies and you go

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:45.880
to an Apple forum and
say hey, what do I do.

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:50.520
And either an export from
Apple, or more likely somebody

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:54.870 position:56%
from the community that knows how
to do it, will answer your question.

00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:58.430
And so we have been looking
at using that platform,

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:03.650
and we call it history hub, and
what we're just in pilot now,

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:07.440
but what we'd really like to do is
see if we could work with Library

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:11.170 position:56%
of Congress and Smithsonian so that
somebody could come to that platform

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:15.010
and say hey, I'm look
for sand borne maps.

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:16.310
I know you guys have some.

00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:17.610
I know we have some.

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:20.740
We have expertise in
different areas like that.

00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.810
It would be really cool
to work collaboratively

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:25.630
so that the public
could get their answer

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:26.990
and not have to know where we are.

00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:28.850
So that's just one example.

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:31.400
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Yeah great.

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:34.050
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: So I want all
the tools seamlessly available

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:38.730
Geospatial hosting environment,
transcription services.

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:40.780
Lots of user contributing content.

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:42.250
Lots of interaction.

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:43.700
Lots more money.

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:48.290
But I think I'm also
just open to change.

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:49.590
Bring it on.

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:50.890
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Alright.

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:52.190
&gt;&gt; Helena Zinkham: We didn't
anticipate the internet.

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:54.650
We didn't anticipate the web.

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:57.290
But I found the so on and so forth.

00:44:57.290 --> 00:45:00.190
So staying flexible, staying open.

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:01.490
I'm ready.

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:02.790
&gt;&gt; Jon Voss: Awesome.

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:04.090
Well thank you.

00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:06.890 position:56%
You know it's been an absolute
honor for me to work with you three,

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:08.510
to work with a lot
of the people here.

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:10.280
And for people watching online

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.500
and in the future I can
just say, dream big.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.540
You know, talk to these people.

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:17.840
Reach out to folks and
