KATHRIN O'SULLIVAN:
Hello, everybody.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.430
Welcome to this
Authors at Google talk.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.350
My name is Kathrin O'Sullivan.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.820
I work on the People
Development department.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.960
And I have the great pleasure to
welcome Erica Dhawan here today

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.810
to talk to us about her work.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.170
Erica is the CEO of Cotential
and works with companies

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.860
on getting big things
done through the power

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.030
of connectional intelligence.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.420
That's also the title
of her book, which

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.810
you can purchase outside after
the session for a discounted

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.680
price of $10.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.350
And Erica will also stay
and sign books for anybody

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.630
who would like that.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.030
Erica is a leading thinker
and keynote speaker.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.850
She's spoken globally at events
like the Global Economic Forum

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.300
in Davos.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.520
She holds an MPA from
Harvard, an MBA from MIT,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.440
and an MS in economics
from Wharton.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.210
So I'm going to hand
it over to Erica

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.796
to talk to us about
her book and her work.

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:04.629
ERICA DHAWAN: Great.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.460
Thank you so much.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.370
It's great to be here
and to explore and talk

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.830
about connectional
intelligence here in this room.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.550
And so in order to
do that, today I'm

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.250
here to really talk
about my new book,

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.130
"Get Big Things Done, the Power
of Connectional Intelligence"

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.060
that's co-authored with my
co-author Saj-Nicole Joni,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.130
but more importantly to talk
to each and every one of you

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.640
about how connectional
intelligence can

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.110
be leveraged in your own
life, in your career here

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.770
at Google, and beyond.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.920
So I'm going to dive
right in, and I'm

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.470
going to start with
telling you a little story.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.370
And this is a story
about a leading law

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.100
firm based in New York.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.600
The senior team at the law
firm noticed something peculiar

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.400
happening a few years ago.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.600
They noticed that the
youngest associates

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.940
at the firm, the
millennial associates,

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.840
started to bill less
hours than ever before.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.440
And this was quite peculiar,
because, one, they were giving

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.210
them more work, not less work.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.110
And two is we all know law
firms bill by the hour.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.080
So it was actually a concern.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.880
And so when they
dug into it, they

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.670
discovered that actually these
millennial legal associates had

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.400
created their own
Twitter network

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.250
to help each other solve
cases faster, questions like,

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.470
I need this legal citation.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.886
Does anyone know
where to find it?

00:02:22.886 --> 00:02:25.410
Or, I know we did a case in
law school just like this.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.770
What was the name of it?

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.850
And it became such a rapidly
productive community that it

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.930
was changing the bottom line.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.200
But the story actually
doesn't stop there.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.890
The legal firm has now taken
on an initiative called Twitter

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.210
at Work to help teach
everyone at the law firm

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.360
how to better use these tools.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.630
But there's one flip
side to the story,

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.170
and that's the fact that
these young associates get

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.590
promoted through billing hours.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.540
So the way that they're working
in a more productive way

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.700
is that actually, at the
heart, against the way

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.460
the industry is
still structured.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.910
So today, we are going
to talk about a rising

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.920
change in the future of work.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.520
And this is a
change that is being

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.650
embodied by the rise of the
multi-generational workplace.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.880
We have four generations
in the workplace today.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.450
And generations are simply
a manifestation of the way

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.910
that the world is changing.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.460
So when we talk about
Traditionalists, Baby Boomers,

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.610
Gen X'ers and Gen Y'ers, also
known as the millennials,

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.130
we aren't just
talking about an age.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.490
We're actually talking
of a cohort that

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.330
has a set of experiences,
a certain way

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.640
of working, mobilizing people,
solving problems, that's

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.500
actually a clue to the way work
will be changing in the future.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.740
So let me first highlight this
also with where we're going.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.930
Research shows that 75%
of the world's workforce

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.680
will be millennials by 2020.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.240
And I'm here to talk to you
about what really brought me

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.750
into this research on
correctional intelligence,

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.400
and it stems from
this question of,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.570
if we think about generations
as a manifestation of the way

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.600
that the world is
changing, just like it

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.720
did at the law firm, what's
unique about millennials?

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.590
And this is a big
hot topic right now

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.540
that many people are asking.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.510
And what I'm
actually here to say

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.260
is that often what
you hear about what's

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.440
unique about millennials
isn't actually true.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.480
And when you ask, what you
hear from what millennials

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.600
might say they
want might actually

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.890
be contradicted in action.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.510
So let me explain.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.130
Research shows that
72% of millennials

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.590
want to have ownership
or to be their own boss.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.750
But when we actually look at
where the next generation goes

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.740
when they leave a
large organization,

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.900
they actually more often don't
just start their own company.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.070
They go and join another
small or large organization.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.090
So having entire
ownership or being

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.460
your entirely own boss
isn't unique to millennials.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.670
The second thing
that we've heard

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.730
is that 88% of
millennials desire

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.180
a viable work-life integration.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.530
And while work-life is
incredibly important,

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.510
if you actually look at
the Fortune 500 companies

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.650
and you look at the best
work-life flexibility programs,

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.230
you actually see that there
is not a significant decrease

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.620
in turnover among young talent.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.240
So while work-life integration
it is a great perk,

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.120
it actually is something
that we all want,

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.490
and it's not unique to
millennials in terms

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.550
of why they stay at a company.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.970
The third thing we hear is
that 88 of the next generation

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.220
desire a collaborative
work culture.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.890
And collaborative work
cultures are fantastic, just

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.390
like one here Google.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.070
But again, when we look at
the research, what we find

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.110
is that there isn't a
significant decrease

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.300
in turnover looking at
the best companies that

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.560
have the highest rated
collaborative work cultures.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.100
So again, ladies and
gentlemen, that's not unique to

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.450
millennials.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.190
And fourth, we hear
that 74% of millennials

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.120
desire a lot of flexibility.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.590
But again, if we look at the
top companies around the world,

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.920
flexibility programs have
remained a perk but not a game

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.640
changer when we really
talk about fully engaging

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.070
our best talent and retaining
them in the workplace today.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.150
So, ladies and gentlemen, what
is unique about millennials?

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.270
I want to start by quoting a
famous quote by Henry Ford.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.700
Henry Ford said, if I had
asked people what they wanted,

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.900
they would have
said, faster horses.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.860
And I'm actually here to
kick this off and say,

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.840
if we look at the
future of work,

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.150
oftentimes what we hear isn't
exactly what people mean.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.860
And when actually
making a decision,

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.950
it could look actually
quite different.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.970
But I do want to say that
there is one thing that

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.050
is unique to the future work
mindset that's manifested

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.120
by millennials but is really
used by all generations

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.730
in the workforce today.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.800
And what I want to say
is that it's not only

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.060
a core competency of
the future of work,

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.340
but it's a core
competency in reaching

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.760
your customers, clients,
and other stakeholders more

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.170
intelligently in the
next wave of the century.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.970
And that is what my
coauthor Saj-Nicole Joni

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.960
and I call connectional
intelligence.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.590
Connectional intelligence
is the ability

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.870
to combine knowledge,
ambition, and human capital,

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.450
forging connections
on a global scale that

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.010
create unprecedented
value and meaning.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.420
So what does this
look like in action?

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.795
I'm going to start
by telling you

00:07:38.795 --> 00:07:43.290
a story of some unimaginable
transformations and examples

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.250
of connectional intelligence.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.500
The first is about a
grandmother, right up there.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.670
And this grandmother is part of
a unique cadre of grandmothers

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:54.930
called The Granny Cloud.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.490
Has anyone heard of
the Granny Cloud?

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.770
Raise your hand if you have.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:07:59.270
No?

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:03.920
So the Granny Cloud is a cadre
of grandmothers in the UK

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.570
and Australia who
use video Skype

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:10.270
to Skype weekly with Indian
children throughout India.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.650
And it all started
through an experiment

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.300
that a professor named
Sugata Mitra ran.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.710
This was an experiment where
he embedded computer kiosks

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:23.580
with Wi-Fi into slum
areas throughout India.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.190
And what he wanted to see is,
if you just left the computer

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.310
there, what would happen?

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.890
How would the children use it?

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.770
And what he saw is
that when he came back

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.580
a month or two months later,
the young children had entirely

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.940
learned how to use a
computer themselves.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.309
And they were getting online.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:39.940
There was Wi-Fi enabled.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.110
And the first thing
that they tried to do

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.900
was to learn English and
practice their English.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:47.440
So while this started to
get momentum and these

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.440
hole-in-the-wall kiosks started
to spread and also to get known

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.750
around the world, there was a
group of grandmothers in the UK

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.970
that said, hey, we
want to help, too.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:03.160
And when you think of help
from the original context,

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.870
you'd ask these
grandmothers for money.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.100
But they said, we
want to do more.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.080
And so they created the
Granny Cloud in partnership

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.580
with Sugata Mitra's team.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.150
And today, there are
hundreds of grandmothers

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.900
around the world that
are using the Granny

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.410
Cloud not only to connect with
each other through a Facebook

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.990
group and an email
newsletter, but to connect

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:25.210
through video Skype
with these children.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:26.990
And you think that
the story stops there

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.710
and the grandmothers
are the givers.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.220
But actually, it doesn't.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.460
In fact, research
is now being done

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.930
to show that video interaction
with grandmothers and those

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.360
at elderly age
actually increases

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.800
their cognitive ability
as they decline.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.110
So the Granny Cloud,
again, is not only

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.290
creating a one-way form of
connectional intelligence,

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.390
but it's truly creating
a two-way connectivity

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:55.200
engagement that is
transforming people's lives

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.680
around the world.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.750
The second story I want
to share is a story

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:03.020
about Patrick Meier who
ran an initiative called

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.510
Ushahidi-Haiti.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:08.060
Patrick spent two years
in Haiti before going back

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.960
to Tufts University grad school,
the Fletcher School there.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.430
And back a few years ago when
the Haiti earthquake hit,

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.230
he was at Tufts in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.520
But he was extremely
overwhelmed,

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.580
and he was instantly
trying to reach out

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.720
to his friends in
Haiti that were there

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.782
during the earthquake.

00:10:27.782 --> 00:10:29.490
So the first thing
that he started to do,

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.600
sitting from his
computer lab at Tufts,

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.340
was to start to
track the tweets.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.090
Because half of Haiti had
power, and half of Haiti didn't.

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:38.040
So he tried to track
any tweets that

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.210
were coming in from Haiti from
his friends and other people.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:47.040
And then he had been a part
of a team that had embedded

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.520
something called Ushahidi.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.950
And Ushahidi is basically
Google Maps meets Twitter,

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.810
where basically you can track
tweets and text messages

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.790
and map them to the location
where they're coming from.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:02.090
So he started to do this by
himself, tracking tweets.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.320
And then he got a team around
him at Tufts University

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.980
to ask others to
engage with him as well

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.720
to track this information.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.040
Soon enough, they had built
a map of hundreds of reports.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.180
They not only did that,
they reached out to someone

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.720
through Twitter that was in
Cameroon that knew the largest

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.730
telecommunications
company in Haiti

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:26.300
to get a 911-type symbol up
so people could also share

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.110
through text message alerts.

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:29.570
And these are
people sharing where

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:33.080
they were, where survivors
were that needed to be moved

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.210
to safer ground and beyond.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.070
So the next thing
that happened is

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:41.190
that many of these texts and
tweets were in Haitian Creole.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.590
So what Patrick did sitting
in Cambridge, Massachusetts,

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.450
is he invited the
Haitian diaspora,

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.030
the immigrant community, to come
in and translate these tweets

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.790
and created almost a
makeshift, 24/7 operating room

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.730
to track these messages.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.700
Within just a few
days in that week,

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.860
the Marine Corps and
the US Coast Guard

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.870
started to use
Patrick's Ushahidi map

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:07.430
to both find survivors and
move them to safer ground

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.350
and to even find
survivors that were

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.580
under rubble that
would have never been

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.670
saved without Patrick's map.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:17.600
And so by connecting a
disparate group of people,

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.506
by using connectivity
and people around him

00:12:20.506 --> 00:12:23.160
in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, he not only

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.130
was able to connect with
his friends in Haiti,

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.950
but he was actually able to
save lives in partnership

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:30.190
with government.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.190
The third story I
want to share is

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:35.715
the story of the Oreo
tweet at Super Bowl 2013.

00:12:35.715 --> 00:12:38.164
Has anyone seen this ad before?

00:12:38.164 --> 00:12:39.830
Tell us where it's
from, the person that

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.940
just raised their hand.

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.660
Yes, Super Bowl 2013.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:45.820
So raise your hand if
you remember the blackout

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.190
during the Super Bowl?

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:51.120
Yes you can tell who
watches the Super Bowl.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.320
In Super Bowl 2013,
there was a blackout,

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.080
and it didn't just
last a few minutes.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.840
It lasted 45 minutes.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.690
Many people blame
Beyonce for that.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.820
She was performing right before.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.260
But anyway, the
blackout happened,

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.010
and while the
players were trying

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.610
to keep their muscles warm and
most other people were eating

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:15.780
snack chips, Oreo at
that time came out,

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.620
in just four minutes
of the blackout,

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.020
with an ad that said, power out?

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:20.770
No problem.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:24.490
You can dunk an Oreo in the
dark, this ad, half lit,

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.090
half dark ad.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.010
They posted it on Twitter.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:31.940
It went absolutely viral,
over 15,000 retweets,

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.920
20,000 Facebook Likes.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.970
And the next day, it was dubbed
the best ad of the Super Bowl,

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.760
beating out every
multimillion-dollar commercial,

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:45.830
made in four minutes, and
basically didn't cost anything.

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.840
So how did this happen?

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:50.930
Well, the Oreo team knew
that breakthroughs don't just

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:51.500
happen.

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:52.580
You have to prepare for them.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.996
You have to be connectionally
intelligent about upbringing

00:13:54.996 --> 00:13:56.550
the right people together.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.830
So what the had
previously done is

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.700
they made sure at
every big event or game

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.396
they actually practiced by
getting every big decision

00:14:04.396 --> 00:14:05.520
maker in the room together.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.060
So they got the legal team, the
executives, the social media,

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:13.130
the design agency to come
together for every big event

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:16.540
just to see if they might be
able to capitalize on an idea.

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.740
And so it was at
that time when they

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.140
saw this happen, because they
had naturally been doing this,

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.960
prepare to act fast and be
relevant, that they actually

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.270
broke through with this ad.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:33.150
And today, brands everywhere
are trying to reinvent and learn

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.300
from this, because
it truly is flipping

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.610
the mindset of how
marketers will market

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:40.000
at big events in the future.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.190
And the fourth story
I want to tell you

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.750
is the story of the
Doritos guacamole chip.

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.330
They're delicious, by the way.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.770
But I actually want
to ask you first,

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:52.610
when you think of a Doritos
guacamole chip, what department

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.480
at Frito Lay would
come up with this chip,

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.980
would create this chip?

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.100
Tell me.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.222
R&amp;D, yep, R&amp;D,
product innovation.

00:15:02.222 --> 00:15:04.430
So you would think it would
come from R&amp;D and product

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:06.450
innovation, but in
fact, it didn't.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:09.370
This Doritos guacamole
chip came and was

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:13.010
discovered by the Latino
Employee Resource Network

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.550
at Frito Lay.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.410
So the Latino Network
typically comes together

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:19.170
for employee engagement.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.546
And when they came
together, they

00:15:20.546 --> 00:15:22.961
said, well, we don't want to
just connect with each other.

00:15:22.961 --> 00:15:25.250
We actually want to solve
a real business challenge.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:27.270
And one of the
things they asked is,

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:30.880
why don't we have a Doritos
chip for the Latino customer

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.720
segment?

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.190
So they did research.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.980
They pitched this idea
to product innovation.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:38.020
Product innovation
had never taken ideas

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.790
from a diversity network.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.140
They ended up trying it.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.460
It was $100 million product.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.670
Then the Asian network says,
hey, we want to do this, too.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.920
They came up with
a curry chip that's

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.630
a best seller throughout Asia.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:53.160
And today, the
company systematically

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.710
brings together every
single diversity network

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.560
to come up with product ideas
for their target segment.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:03.610
So what began as one informal
network that wasn't set up

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.600
to come up with product
ideas, when combined,

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.560
was able to help the
business and also then

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.040
got turned into a more
systematic, sustained effort

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.550
throughout the company.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.480
So these are all
some examples of

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.510
some unimaginable
transformations

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:19.420
in today's world.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.320
And today's goals
are really, first,

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.100
to help you understand what
is connectional intelligence.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:27.160
And I just gave you
a set of examples

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.060
that help to highlight some
of the research that we did

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.920
and some of the stories
that we feature in the book.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.610
But now I want to
talk a little bit more

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:39.030
about how can you identify how
connectional intelligence is

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:43.030
used and learn how to apply
it to your work, to your life,

00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.100
to your career here at Google.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.920
So in order to do
that, I want you

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.940
to understand what's in it for
you and for your organization.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.480
Connectional intelligence
is a leadership skill.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.740
But it has huge applications
for business results,

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.740
whether it's growing
talent, whether it's

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.990
driving growth,
managing risks, enabling

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.840
those interdisciplinary
breakthroughs.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.609
And the most important thing
about connectional intelligence

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:08.720
is it's a human skill that
can be used by anyone, that

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.210
can be used by an intern
at Google, by the CEO,

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.109
by someone starting
out, by someone

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:16.530
in a siloed function that
might see a new way of solving

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:20.349
a problem in a unique
way that might actually

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:25.060
help many more than you
might have ever thought.

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.300
So in order to
describe that, there

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.400
are five fundamental
capabilities

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.800
of connectional intelligence--
curiosity, combination,

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.860
courage, community,
and combustion.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.860
And let me go through each to
give you a better feel of this.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:41.660
So the first is curiosity.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.810
And curiosity from a
connectional intelligence

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:47.830
perspective is the ability
to broaden your perspective,

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.340
to ask a different
set of questions

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.170
before you solve a problem.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.900
So in the case of
Oreo, they truly

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.790
have the curiosity
to ask, how might we

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:01.130
get everyone ready to act
when it really matters?

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:03.250
That ad could have
taken six months

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:05.820
to create and
hundreds of thousands,

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.470
if not millions, of dollars.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.360
But instead, they focused
on being prepared.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.960
To asked the question, how can
we be prepared and relevant

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.600
when it matters most?

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.820
And another example of
curiosity is a story

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.530
that we feature in the book
about a man named Ron Wallace.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.320
That man is Ron Wallace.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.710
And ladies and gentlemen, that
is his 2,000-pound pumpkin.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:31.890
There is something called
be Topsfield Fair, which

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.170
hosts the world's
largest pumpkin contest.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:36.540
And every year,
pumpkin farmers compete

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:38.950
to grow the world's
largest pumpkin.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.270
And to give you a sense,
from the beginning of time

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:44.100
to the year 2000, the
largest pumpkin ever grown

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.740
was 1,000 pounds.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:51.710
And in a mere 12 years, in 2012,
Ron Wallace grew a 2,000-pound

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:54.250
pumpkin, doubling
the world's record.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:55.940
So how did this happen?

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:58.760
Well, Ron Wallace
knew that he had

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.960
to connect with
other fields in order

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.090
to truly understand how to grow
the world's largest pumpkin.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:06.070
So what he did is over
a series of years,

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:08.440
he first contacted many
scientists around the world,

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:11.930
asking them about new soil
science, new ways of working.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:14.550
He also connected with
potato farmers when

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.610
he read about how there was
one specific fungi that potato

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.980
farmers used to radically
expand the size of potatoes,

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.695
that he then tried
with pumpkins,

00:19:22.695 --> 00:19:25.410
and it radically grew
the size of pumpkins.

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.790
He not only did that, he created
a small circle of association

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.410
in Rhode Island where pumpkin
farmers in Rhode Island

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.540
would come together to
share best practices,

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.500
even though they
were all competing

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.560
with each other for
the big contest.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.650
And he became a leading
contributor to bigpumpkins.com.

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:45.610
It's a site where pumpkin
farmers around the world

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:47.460
share best practices.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.330
So in 2012, through his
connectional intelligence,

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.460
Ron Wallace, in his true
curiosity to ask different

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:57.600
questions, Ron Wallace wins
the world's largest pumpkin

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.810
contest, growing a
2,000-pound pumpkin.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.700
But the story actually
doesn't stop there.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.260
In fact today, small-scale
farmers in places like India

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.300
and throughout
sub-Saharan Africa

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.540
are now use using Ron's
discovery of the fungi

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:15.980
that he found with the potato
farmers to grow big crops,

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.640
because they can't afford
chemical fertilizer.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.810
So in fact today, Ron Wallace is
not only growing big pumpkins.

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:25.870
He's shaping the global food
supply in big agriculture.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.190
So for you, the
question is really,

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.860
how can you use different
tools and forums

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.040
to broaden your perspective
before you solve problems?

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.060
Where do you go to
find information?

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.220
And are there new
forms or new sets

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.790
of places to find and
collect that information?

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:46.180
The second C I want to
talk about is Courage.

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.180
And courage, from the
connectional intelligence

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.440
perspective, is
really this ability

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.160
to have difficult and diverse
conversations despite forces

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.450
to silence and control.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:57.880
One of the great
examples of this

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.850
is the Nike Green
Exchange program.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:03.960
Has anyone heard of the
Nike Green Exchange program?

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:09.710
Nike a few years ago decided
to release 400 of their patents

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:13.570
for noncompetitive,
environmentally sustainable use

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:14.970
by other companies.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.300
And this initiative was
called Green Exchange.

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.120
And they did this
because they understood

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.940
that in order to create
change in this industry,

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.300
in order to be a leading
player in sustainability,

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:29.140
they would have to act first and
do something really courageous.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.560
Soon enough, what
they began to see

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.900
is that their patents
were able to be

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.460
used in many different ways.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:40.210
For example, one patent in
Nike shoes, one robber patent,

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:42.030
ended up being used
by a mountain biking

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:43.650
company in their tires.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:45.410
And soon enough,
many other companies

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:47.810
began to follow,
including Creative Commons

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:49.740
and Best Buy and beyond.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.170
And they were truly able to
create a new conversation

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:56.560
about how to better leverage
and share intellectual property

00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:59.260
for non-competitive
and sustainable use.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.530
And the second
example of courage

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.020
from a connectional
intelligence perspective

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.330
is the story of how Lance
Armstrong got caught doping.

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:08.930
Does anyone know the story?

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:11.090
How did Lance
Armstrong get caught

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:14.490
doping in the biking scandal?

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:17.910
So, many people think
that Lance Armstrong

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:21.310
got ratted out by his
colleagues, other cyclists.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.300
But in fact, that
did happen, but that

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.480
didn't break the story
in the news altogether.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.200
There was buzz,
but at that time,

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.440
Lance Armstrong was a hero.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.670
Everyone wanted to be buddies
with him, because at that time,

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.740
it was the Livestrong campaign.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.360
So what actually
happened is while there

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.680
was some small buzz without
any major media agency

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.620
really pushing this out,
a group of scientists

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.070
looked at Lance Armstrong's
cycling history.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.330
And when they looked
at one specific race,

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.610
they saw roughly no
indication of doping.

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:54.850
But when they looked
over a 10-year history,

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:57.360
they saw a very clear
indication of doping.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.470
And they didn't have a
big media agency that

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:01.720
wanted to cover this,
so they posted it

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.960
on a small biking blogging
in New Work called New York

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.240
Velocity.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.800
And this biking blog was
filled with bicyclists

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.680
who just love to tell the
truth and share in the movement

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.940
around cycling.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.370
So they posted it
there, and then

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:18.840
a group of basically
cyclist activists

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.650
on Twitter and Facebook
started to spread the story.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:24.360
And it was after a few
months that through spreading

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.310
this story, that it actually
broke through in national media

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:31.750
and led to Lance
Armstrong's real opening

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:33.520
in that Oprah interview.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.820
So what truly
happened is that it

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.510
was a combination of
bloggers, of scientists,

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:41.520
and cyclists who
had no incentive

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.590
but to tell the
truth that actually

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:47.010
led to the breakthrough in
discovering the lie that many

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:48.310
of us didn't know.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.450
So the question for
you do is really,

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:53.610
how are you sparking
courageous conversations

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:55.160
in your target networks?

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.440
Where are the courageous
conversations happening?

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.210
And how can you engage with
them in an entirely new way that

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:03.560
might solve the pressing
challenges that you're

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.070
facing, just like
Lance Armstrong

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:10.080
or just like Nike
Green Exchange?

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.340
The third C of
connectional intelligence

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.410
is what's called Combination.

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:17.070
And combination by definition
is the root of innovation,

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:19.690
combining many disparate
ideas to come up

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:23.260
with an entirely new concept,
product, or innovation.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.310
And some of the best
examples of this, of course,

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.740
is the story of the Doritos
guacamole chip bringing

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.070
together the Latinos at
the company to come up

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:32.020
with a new product idea.

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.120
But it also happens
in many other forms.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.240
One example of that is Duolingo.

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.840
Who here knows what Duolingo is?

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.300
Tell us what Duolingo is.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.975
AUDIENCE: It's a [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:42.975 --> 00:24:44.350
ERICA DHAWAN: Yes,
it's basically

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:45.820
a language learning app.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.120
It's entirely free.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:49.590
It's almost like a free
version of Rosetta Stone.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.620
But many of you might
not know that while it's

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:54.930
a free language
learning app, it also

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:58.970
serves as a crowdsourced
text translation platform.

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:00.750
So let me explain.

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.970
The founder, Luis
von Ahn of Duolingo,

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:05.090
understood and
asked the question,

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.650
how can I combine
solving one problem

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:11.260
and solve an entirely different
problem at the same time?

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.110
So one of the
problems he saw was

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:17.330
that people around the world
needed to learn new languages.

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:20.000
And he said, how could I
teach the world new languages

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.160
for free?

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.570
The second problem
that he saw is

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:26.870
that many online websites,
whether it was something

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:32.030
like BuzzFeed or CNN, needed
to effectively translate

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:36.330
their sites from English to
French or Japanese to Mandarin

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:37.860
in a very quick way.

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.880
And so what he actually did
is he combined the two needs.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:44.990
And using Duolingo, when
players play Duolingo,

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:46.980
becuase it runs
basically as a game,

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.180
they're not just doing
random homework problems

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.080
of translating
English to French.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.690
They're actually
translating news websites.

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:56.480
So when a certain
aggregate amount of people

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:01.200
translate the game at the
same time in the correct way,

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:05.030
it automatically translates
news websites around the world.

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:09.220
So when you think about this,
how might you be combining?

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.882
Just like the Doritos
guacamole chip and Duolingo,

00:26:11.882 --> 00:26:13.840
how are you combining
information and knowledge

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.960
from inside and
outside your workplace?

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.210
Where might you be able
to solve one problem

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:21.070
and solve an entirely different
problem at the same time

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:24.230
by combining needs in a new way?

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:27.600
The fourth C of interconnection
all intelligence is Community.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:30.090
And community is
the root of the idea

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:34.010
of bringing people together
to care, to spark, to inspire

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:34.790
together.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:37.590
And one of my favorite
stories from our book

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:39.800
is a story at Colgate.

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.960
A few years ago, Colgate
had a big science problem.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.460
They had developed
a new fluoride,

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.209
and they were trying
to get their fluoride

00:26:46.209 --> 00:26:47.293
into their new toothpaste.

00:26:47.293 --> 00:26:49.250
But there was something
wrong, and the fluoride

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:51.400
was getting stuck in the
mechanical equipment,

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.970
and it wasn't meshing well.

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:54.660
And all the best
chemists of the company

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.900
were trying to figure this out.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:56.899
And they had difficulty.

00:26:56.899 --> 00:26:58.660
And it was costing
them a lot of money,

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:03.150
because they couldn't get the
new product out to market.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:06.180
So what they decided
to do is they

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.660
decided to post this
question in an anonymous way

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:11.720
on a website called InnoCentive.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.160
Anyone here know
what InnoCentive is?

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.360
InnoCentive is a website
of inventors, hackers,

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.760
problem solvers,
people that just

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.130
want to solve unique problems.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:23.860
So what they did is they
posted it on the site,

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.780
and within just a few
days, a physicist named

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:29.470
Ed Melcarek looked
at the site and said,

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:30.860
this isn't a chemistry problem.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:32.160
This is a physics problem.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.860
It's about chargeback particles.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.220
You charge the fluoride one way.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.980
You charge the
toothpaste the other.

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.760
Instantly, the
problem was solved,

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:42.790
saving the company a lot of
money, but not only doing that,

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:45.220
really allowing them to
see how they could leverage

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.400
a new type of network to solve
a problem that they couldn't

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.650
solve internally.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:52.350
And when we interviewed
Ed Melcarek for the book,

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:54.776
one of the things he
said is that he may never

00:27:54.776 --> 00:27:56.650
have been hired by
Colgate, because he didn't

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:58.420
have the traditional resume.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:02.100
So what we can actually do is
we can engage new communities

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.310
in ways that we never would
have imagined that can actually

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:08.500
help us solve the problems
we're facing in real time.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.070
The second story I'd
like to share is Uber.

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.440
Who here knows what Uber is?

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.990
Everyone's hands raised, right?

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:19.250
So when you end an
Uber ride, what's

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.230
the last thing you do
before you leave the car?

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:23.480
What's the last thing you
have to do to close the ride

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.570
and get your receipt?

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:27.134
Tell me.

00:28:27.134 --> 00:28:28.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:29.716
ERICA DHAWAN: Yes,
you rate your driver.

00:28:29.716 --> 00:28:31.600
And what does your driver do?

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.570
AUDIENCE: Rate.

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:34.800
ERICA DHAWAN: Yes, the
driver is rating you

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.750
while you're rating your driver.

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:38.860
And the reason why
this is important

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:42.510
is because if you are not
a great customer on Uber,

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:45.730
you could, at a certain
point, get kicked off.

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:48.110
Because for the first
time, really, there's

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:50.450
optimal nodes flowing
to optimal resources

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:52.700
in a two-way community
where we're really

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.060
rating each other
in a way to improve

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.230
our behaviors over time.

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:59.486
And so as we think
about the communities

00:28:59.486 --> 00:29:01.360
of the future in a
connectionally intelligent

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:05.760
mindset, it's really about how
might you create the incentive

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.520
structure to allow
people to care,

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.920
to spark, and inspire
together, but also

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:13.950
allow for a systematic
way, just like Uber is,

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:15.720
to bring the right
set of customers

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.920
with the right drivers together?

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.500
So I really want
you to think about,

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.480
when you're solving
a problem today,

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.730
one way to do it would be
through the Colgate example.

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:27.354
How might you be
leveraging communities

00:29:27.354 --> 00:29:28.640
outside your existing network?

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.139
And another way would be, how
are you creating the incentive

00:29:31.139 --> 00:29:35.010
structures for communities
to act in the most

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:37.360
efficient, productive way?

00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:39.980
The fifth C is Combustion.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.140
And combustion from a
connectionally intelligent

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.080
perspective is this ability
to mobilize resources

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:47.310
in pursuit of a large goal.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.300
One of the examples
of combustion

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.436
is a story about SAP.

00:29:51.436 --> 00:29:56.330
A series of years ago, SAP had a
big customer call waiting list.

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:58.827
They were overwhelmed with
customer service costs.

00:29:58.827 --> 00:30:00.410
And so one of the
experiments they did

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:04.000
is they created an open,
peer-to-peer customer platform

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.760
where any customer
could actually

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.060
ask any other customer a
question about the product

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:09.040
or service.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.160
And over 100,000 people
used it back in the day.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.890
Today, over two million
people have used the site.

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:17.380
The average response
time is 16 minutes.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:21.530
99% of queries are answered
correctly within 24 hours.

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:26.410
But the other thing that really
led to this platform combusting

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:30.071
is it's one of the top ways for
SAP to identify the products

00:30:30.071 --> 00:30:32.445
and services that they should
be marketing and delivering

00:30:32.445 --> 00:30:33.220
in the future.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.250
Because they truly
understand and have

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:38.960
the intelligence of what
customers are really asking for

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.340
and what they need.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:43.160
The second example of
combustion is the story

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.220
of My Starbucks platform.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:48.800
Has anyone seen this
platform or know what it is?

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.880
So who knows what the
Starbucks green stick

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:56.000
is that you put in your coffee?

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.454
Does anyone know what that is?

00:30:58.454 --> 00:30:59.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:00.369
KATHRIN O'SULLIVAN: Yes.

00:31:00.369 --> 00:31:02.250
So Starbucks has a green stick.

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:03.600
It's called a swizzle stopper.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.790
And it's used to make sure
that your coffee doesn't spill.

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:10.110
And for many people, it's
an iconic brand component

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.682
for Starbucks because
it's so well known.

00:31:12.682 --> 00:31:14.140
And many people
don't know, though,

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.970
that it actually came as
an idea from a customer

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:20.220
through something called the
My Starbucks platform, which

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:24.250
is a crowdsourcing platform
where customers can share

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:26.912
their ideas for the
store, for products

00:31:26.912 --> 00:31:29.370
that they should be delivering,
for different services they

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:30.500
should be offering.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.437
And today, Starbucks
implements hundreds

00:31:32.437 --> 00:31:33.520
of these ideas every year.

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:36.250
They get thousands of ideas.

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:39.090
And it's a top way, as
well, to truly combust,

00:31:39.090 --> 00:31:41.940
just like the case with
the green stick, which

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:46.350
is an iconic model for
the Starbucks brand today.

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.800
So for you, the
question is really,

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.410
how are you going to mobilize
your networks to collaborate

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:52.420
to achieve a goal?

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.510
When you may start an
initiative for one way,

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:57.290
just like Ron Wallace was trying
to grow the world's largest

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:02.270
pumpkin or the legal
associates were just

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.890
trying to work
faster, how might it

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:07.930
combust in an entirely
different way that could really

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:10.290
help others and
outside networks,

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:12.300
whether it's inside Google,
outside with clients

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.140
and customers to solve your
most pressing challenges?

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.000
And so what I share
now is that when

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.020
we think about connectional
intelligence, it's not new.

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:24.820
The great leaders of
our time in history

00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:27.170
have had very high
connectional intelligence,

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:30.980
whether it was Marie Curie or
Ben Franklin or Mahatma Gandhi.

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:34.760
But today, and as we know
here as leaders at Google,

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.450
the scale, depth, and
breadth of our connection

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:38.860
is radically different.

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.540
And it's changing
the way that we

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:44.800
solve problems, not only the way
that we might use technology,

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.024
but how we think and act,
mobilize resources, have

00:32:48.024 --> 00:32:50.190
the courage to connect with
people around the world,

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:52.870
have the curiosity to
ask different questions

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:56.360
and then combine those
ideas in new ways.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.530
And when you think about
connectional intelligence, what

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:01.840
you'll understand in the
book is that it's best

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.510
to think about it
at different levels.

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:05.140
So the first level
is the power of one,

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.760
is you as an individual.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:09.250
How can you use your own
connectional intelligence

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:12.040
get big things done, just
like Ron Wallace did,

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.876
a pumpkin farmer, and
for each and every one

00:33:14.876 --> 00:33:17.420
of you, whether it's working
your way up or solving

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.950
or launching a big product?

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:22.550
And so as you think about that,
what you'll find in the book

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:25.310
is a connectional intelligence
quiz, where you can actually

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:28.720
assess how and where you're
using connectional intelligence

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.740
in your work and in your life.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.460
The second type are
the power of tens,

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.340
so the power of small teams.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:38.850
This is the Oreo team that
said, we need to come together,

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.570
and it's when we're
acting together

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:43.000
in this relevant and fast
way that we're really going

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.900
to get something big done.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:48.880
And the third type is
the power of thousands.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.800
And the power of thousands
here is really this idea

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.010
that Colgate harnessed when
they launched and sent out

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:58.780
a question to a large
network of solvers.

00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:01.560
And from those
thousands, they were

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:05.100
able to scan and source it
and find the physicist that

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:07.060
was able to help
them truly break

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.210
through a difficult challenge.

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:11.520
So as you think
about the future--

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:14.489
and I started the talk
talking about the next wave

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:15.969
in the future.

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:21.139
And I also was talking about
redefining the next generation

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:24.500
of millennials, not just as an
age, but as a mindset shift,

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.050
that we are in an age where
actually some of our greatest

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:30.040
connectional intelligence might
even come from our youngest.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.750
And so in order to forge
a new way of thinking

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:35.889
across generations, we
need senior leaders,

00:34:35.889 --> 00:34:37.940
and we need younger
leaders to come together

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.929
to act together in
new ways of problem

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:44.350
solving just like we saw
when the productivity

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:47.090
idea from the legal
associates is now changing

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:49.550
the way the firm is
thinking about productivity

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:50.840
in the future.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.960
And so when you use
connectional intelligence,

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.960
you'll find that it will
benefit your customers,

00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:00.640
your constituents, but also the
planet and larger societies.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.270
And it can be used by
anyone in your workplace,

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:06.090
whether it's an individual,
a small team, or a larger

00:35:06.090 --> 00:35:07.430
crowd or network.

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:10.230
And what you'll find when you
harness connection intelligence

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:12.350
and you read more
stories in the book,

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:15.920
you'll find that it will help
you move from this idea of just

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.680
serendipity.

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.410
And we all love serendipity.

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:21.350
It's the way some of the
magic happens at places

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:22.760
here like at Google.

00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.340
But it will help you
create more intention,

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.140
a more strategic
way of accelerating

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:31.410
more of those
serendipitous reactions.

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:35.700
And as we saw with the story
of the Oreo Super Bowl tweet,

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.620
luck comes to the prepared.

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.090
So how can you create
a more systematic way

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:42.550
of leveraging the connections
and networks around you,

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:45.380
whether it's people,
ideas, or resources?

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:48.200
So in the book,
what you'll find is

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:51.650
that we talk about three types
of connectional intelligence.

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:55.390
And the way I'll help you frame
this that 10 years ago, Malcom

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:58.930
Gladwell coined the concept of
a connector as one of the three

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:01.360
ways that create
the rise of social

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.050
epidemics-- the mavens,
the salespeople,

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:05.330
and the connectors.

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:09.000
And while that idea was quite
revolutionary at the time,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.700
today it's quite outdated.

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.240
Because as we all know,
today we are all connectors.

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.100
In fact, we are over-connected.

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:18.730
So how do we get big things
done through our connections?

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:20.270
And what we found
in our research is

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:23.920
that in today's world, it's not
about being a connector or not,

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:26.130
it's what type of
connector you are.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:28.040
And there are three
types of connectors,

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.550
and you'll take a quiz
in the book to figure out

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:30.535
which one you are.

00:36:30.535 --> 00:36:34.120
They are the thinkers, the
enablers, and the connection

00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.380
executioners.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:38.810
The thinkers are those that
have the highest in curiosity,

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:40.040
as I shared before.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:43.065
They are the ones that
are like Ron Wallace

00:36:43.065 --> 00:36:46.550
the pumpkin farmer that asked
a different set of questions

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:50.070
to help broaden your perspective
before you solve a problem.

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:52.660
The second type of
connector are the enablers.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.660
The enablers are
those that understand

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.940
how to forge ties and bring
the right resources together

00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:59.060
in pursuit of a goal.

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:02.590
So these might be the highest
when it comes to community,

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:06.270
so the Colgate example
where they were able to see,

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:09.330
we should enable another
group of inventors and problem

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:11.970
solvers to help us solve
this science challenge.

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:15.230
And the third type of connector
are the connection executors.

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:16.730
These are the people
that understand

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:19.130
how to mobilize your resources
to get it done in action.

00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:22.160
They may be launching
the next Google product.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:24.280
They might be the
legal associates

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.110
that I described using the
Twitter at work network.

00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:30.120
And so the question today, and
you'll find this in the book,

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.990
is to understand what
type of connector are you,

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:35.210
and what's the big thing
you're trying to get done?

00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:37.090
And if you're
naturally a thinker,

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:40.480
but you need to actually have
a team of connection executors

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:42.936
around you, you can better
understand, who do you

00:37:42.936 --> 00:37:44.060
need to bring on your team?

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:45.980
Who do you need to
forge ties with?

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.080
If you're naturally
a connection executor

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.060
but you like to be
in your zone, but you

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.124
need to work across
different silos,

00:37:52.124 --> 00:37:53.540
who are the enablers
that you know

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:55.910
across Google or in
your customer client

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:57.670
base that you could
actually bring in

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:00.010
to help you solve that problem?

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:03.880
So as you go through
and understand what type

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:07.250
of connector you are, you'll
get to better understand

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:09.210
where you fit in
across the five season

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:11.870
Cs of connectional
intelligence that I described.

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:15.100
Thinkers are highest
in curiosity.

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:17.620
Enablers are highest
in community.

00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:21.550
And connection executors
are the combustion leaders.

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:23.410
They know how to
mobilize a resource

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:25.340
to get something big done.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:27.900
So if you're thinking
about how can you

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:29.660
bring correctional
intelligence here,

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:34.210
the first thing is to broaden
the knowledge base around what

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:37.750
connectional intelligence is and
how you can each use it, again,

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:39.720
as a human skill
to solve problems.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.120
There's no doubt that
this is the leading

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.580
place for technology.

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.760
But what's important
is how we as people

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.700
are leveraging all of
our resources and ways

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.430
to get the big things done.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:54.050
The second is obviously around
technology and thinking about,

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:57.060
how might you not only leverage
technology, but create ways

00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.630
where people are systematically
and scalably connecting?

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:03.670
And the third is to talk to
your senior teams about this.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:05.760
How are they using
connectional intelligence?

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.810
How can this be a
way to forge ties

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:11.030
across generations here
at places like Google

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:13.620
and with your clients
and customers?

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:17.245
So in order to do
finish this up,

00:39:17.245 --> 00:39:19.240
I want you to close
with three things

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.650
that I want you to do to take
home in an actionable way.

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:25.760
And there's lots of other
tools and tips in the book.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.330
The first is a 10-minute rule.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.470
And it's a 10-minute rule to
spend 10 minutes every day

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:33.370
connecting with a new source
of news or perspective

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:34.290
outside your own.

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:39.380
So if you're the person that
gets your news on Twitter

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:43.010
or on Facebook, maybe it's
reading three new influencer

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:45.070
blogs in your industry.

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:48.080
Or if you're someone that has a
hobby in an entirely different

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:49.630
thing, maybe it's
spending 10 minutes

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:52.080
actually investing
in that hobby that

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:55.910
could turn into something
really interesting for business.

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:59.020
The second is to spend
time with two people that

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.935
think very differently than
you at least once a month.

00:40:01.935 --> 00:40:03.310
So if you're a
thinker, I'm going

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:06.225
to ask you to find the enabler
and the executor that you know

00:40:06.225 --> 00:40:08.680
and spend time with them and
ask them how they would solve

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.320
problems that you're facing.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.210
And the third thing
is, in the book,

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:13.700
you'll find a
manager guide where

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:15.590
you can run a
connectional intelligence

00:40:15.590 --> 00:40:18.830
workshop with your
team to figure out who

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:21.090
and what are the different
connectors in your group.

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:22.480
How many thinkers do you have?

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.280
How many enablers?

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.590
How many executors?

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:26.020
And when you do
that, you can help

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:28.740
to redesign and think about
what might be missing.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:31.870
And it's really amazing,
because depending on your group,

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:34.890
you cannot often guess what
people are naturally good at.

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:36.920
But what you'll hear
is that oftentimes, you

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.530
have to adjust based on
the role that you're in.

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:41.810
So if you're in a role
that requires an enabler,

00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:43.800
you might be an
enabler in that role.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.820
But over lunch, you might
be more of a thinker.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.260
So it's good to understand
what type of roles

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:51.190
do you have to play to
get something big done,

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:53.500
and what roles are
you naturally are,

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.380
and run that little
session with your team.

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:59.580
So in closing, I want
to thank you again

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.170
for coming and
discussing this-- I think

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:04.810
we might have some
time for Q&amp;A--

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:07.750
and diving into what
connectional intelligence is

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:08.750
all about.

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:11.860
The other quick
things that I'm giving

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.840
is a freebie giveaway,
is if you text the number

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:18.880
66866 with the word
"Erica" just on your phone,

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:20.500
you'll receive
the details to get

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:24.590
a free connectional intelligence
quiz and manager guide.

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:27.700
And the last thing is
if you're interested,

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:31.140
host a connectional intelligence
training with your team.

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.930
So there's many
different ways to do it.

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:36.380
I'm happy to talk to you more
about what that looks like.

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.290
But most importantly,
what this will do

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:41.710
is it will help you move from
those serendipitous encounters

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:44.710
to leveraging and
intentionally leveraging

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:48.110
all of the connections around
you to get big things done.

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:52.000
So the last thing
I want to leave you

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.160
with before we close
and dive into questions

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.030
is that connectional
intelligence

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:58.460
is an amazing force.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.530
And it can be used in
lots of different ways.

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:04.170
It can be used to launch a
multimillion dollar product,

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:07.450
but it can also be used to
help a community that may not

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:10.330
be business people
or rich or successful

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:12.550
to actually get
something big done.

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:14.950
And in the book, we don't
just profile businesses,

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:18.810
but we profile individuals,
neighborhood communities,

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:24.280
college students, young kids,
those in different industries

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.370
across the world, whether it's
agriculture or sports that

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:28.970
are getting big things done.

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:31.760
So I encourage you to
ask the question of,

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.020
how will you use
connectional intelligence

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.380
as a force for good,
for all of those

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:39.430
that are counting on your
wisdom, your creativity,

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:40.680
and your heart?

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:44.800
Thank you so much, and
we'll dive into questions.

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.810
AUDIENCE: So different--
like a sociologist

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:50.500
would say that having a group
of people together collaborating

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.640
can actually be really
dangerous at times.

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.375
Because if they all
think the same way

00:42:54.375 --> 00:42:56.874
and reinforce each other, and
there's an error in the logic,

00:42:56.874 --> 00:42:58.750
then basically it's
just groupthink, right?

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:01.300
How in connectional intelligence
can you avoid that problem?

00:43:01.300 --> 00:43:03.370
ERICA DHAWAN: Great question.

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:05.560
So connectional
intelligence is very

00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:07.940
different from collaboration.

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:10.560
So collaboration is
about sharing ideas

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.590
with a lot of people.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:13.050
But you can do
that, as you said,

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:16.120
and share with a lot of
people, and get nothing done.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:20.080
You can also cause groupthink
or kill creativity.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.850
So connectional intelligence
is about understanding,

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:26.460
how can you more intentionally
bring together the right people

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:28.770
at the times when it
really matters most?

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:31.480
And that is done
by understanding,

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:34.379
what are the different types of
connectors that are around you

00:43:34.379 --> 00:43:34.920
on your team?

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.420
Because if you put together
just a group of thinkers,

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:40.280
you might get nothing
done, because they all

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.300
might love to collaborate
and share ideas,

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.912
but they're not going through
the flow of really executing.

00:43:44.912 --> 00:43:46.620
If you put together
a group of executors,

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:50.270
you might get the same rote
routine every single time.

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:52.260
So that's why it's so
important to understand

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:55.550
what type of connectors are
in these different groups.

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:58.370
And understand that this
isn't about more collaboration

00:43:58.370 --> 00:43:59.280
with everyone.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:02.120
This is about using the five
C's of connectional intelligence

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:05.070
to understand, when do we need
to broaden our perspective

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:06.300
and solve a problem?

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:09.340
And what are the right sets of
communities actually to come

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.620
together to solve this problem?

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:13.640
Great question.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.292
AUDIENCE: For the Colgate
example that you demonstrated,

00:44:17.292 --> 00:44:20.360
when you crowdsource an
answer with the public

00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:24.280
and then he comes up with a
multimillion dollar answer,

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.980
now is Colgate responsible
to pay this person?

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.070
Because actually
in written form,

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:32.520
there's a whole message
log of how the idea came

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:33.990
to through to fruition.

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.830
Can you explain a
little more about that?

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:35.570
ERICA DHAWAN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:37.570
So the way that
InnoCentive works is there

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:40.160
is a cash prize for the winner.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:45.440
So Ed Melcarek, the physicist,
did receive a cash prize.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:49.821
But it's set up in a way so
it's completely anonymous,

00:44:49.821 --> 00:44:50.820
the name of the company.

00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:53.700
So companies are able
to ask these questions

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.480
without revealing
confidential information.

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:59.160
Secondly, there is a cash prize
for the winner who answers it

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.800
correctly, which
enables and creates

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.230
an incentive for
the problem solvers.

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:09.590
But when I talked to Ed and also
others that use InnoCentive,

00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:12.920
for them it's also the journey
of expanding their curiosity,

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.810
of solving problems,
and learning from others

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:16.320
to see what they share.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:20.690
So I think from both
the confidentiality

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:23.190
and the incentive structure,
they've gotten it right.

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:25.572
The other thing I'll share
is that crowdsourcing is also

00:45:25.572 --> 00:45:27.280
different from
connectional intelligence.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:31.770
Because you can source a lot of
ideas, but really in that case,

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:34.987
the incentive and design
of solving that problem

00:45:34.987 --> 00:45:36.570
and bringing the
right groups together

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:38.720
is what allowed the
connectional intelligence

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:42.205
and that breakthrough
to happen for Colgate.

00:45:42.205 --> 00:45:43.830
AUDIENCE: So you give
a lot of examples

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:46.150
of when connectional
intelligence work really

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:47.680
well in your talk.

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:50.450
Can you give an example
of when it didn't work,

00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:52.920
when someone tried to do
this but it didn't work?

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.211
ERICA DHAWAN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:59.290
And it's a great question.

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:02.450
And the other thing I'll
say is I can give you

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:04.820
examples of where connectional
intelligence didn't work,

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:10.590
but also how it can
turn into a disaster.

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:12.710
It could be used for
great evil, right?

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:14.690
And so there's no
denying that we

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:16.340
can use connectional
intelligence as

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:19.120
a force for good or as
not a force for good.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:21.240
And that's why I ended
with that piece of,

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.670
how will you use it
as a force for good?

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:26.740
I think a couple
of examples of this

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:32.050
might have been a
few years ago, Gap

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:34.600
tried to crowdsource
a new brand logo.

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:36.850
And they crowdsourced an idea.

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:38.470
They changed their brand logo.

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:39.920
They launched it in the market.

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.060
So they tried to
engage a large crowd.

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.730
They tried to be connected.

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:47.890
And after they did that,
most of their market

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:49.600
hated the new
brand, and there was

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:52.050
a huge rejection of the brand.

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:54.920
And it actually led them to
change the brand again and go

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:56.770
back to what they had before.

00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:59.100
Another example of
this was-- and this

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:03.220
is sort of a flip to the Oreo
tweet, was during the World Cup

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.900
based on what KLM
Airlines had tweeted.

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:07.760
Did anyone see this?

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:12.140
So during the World
Cup last year in 2014,

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:15.340
KLM Airlines tweeted
something and made a joke

00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:18.010
about the
Netherlands-Mexico game.

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:23.710
And the team in Mexico was not
happy about what they shared.

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:27.610
And some of the leading figures
in Mexico responded on Twitter

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:29.790
and said, we will
never fly KLM again.

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:33.640
And it actually created this
overflow of bad PR press

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:36.080
for KLM, when what
they were trying to do

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:39.810
was respond and make a
joke about the World Cup.

00:47:39.810 --> 00:47:43.980
So actually, as we think about
connectional intelligence,

00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:47.880
there's no denying that when
we try things, we may fail.

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:52.140
Or it may go in a way
that we never expected.

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:54.050
And that's by nature
something that

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:55.910
happens when we always
open ourselves up

00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:56.990
to new people and ideas.

00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:59.370
That's why courage
is so important.

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:02.450
But what's critical is
that in the case of Gap

00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:05.740
or in the case of KLM, we
can't just let it happen.

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:07.700
We have to keep
engaging the community.

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.890
Because the brands
and the leaders

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:12.410
are actually ones
that won't stop at,

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:16.330
OK, this went downhill,
unless you go bankrupt, right?

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:19.900
But what they'll do, and
this is what KLM has done,

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.710
is they've tried to
reengage their population.

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:25.540
And they understand that there
will be issues like this,

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:28.430
but you almost have to
do some of that practice

00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:31.035
in order to engage
your customer base

00:48:31.035 --> 00:48:32.910
to make them feel that
you're actually human,

00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:35.250
that you're authentic,
and you're actually

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:37.700
building a long-term
relationship with them.

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.010
KATHRIN O'SULLIVAN: Thank
you so much for coming.

00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:39.810
Thank you, Erica.

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:41.100
It was grea to have you here.

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:41.500
ERICA DHAWAN: Think you.

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.333
Let me know if you have
any other questions.

00:48:43.333 --> 00:48:46.560
