everything but I forgot there's a thorn
left yeah no what I really liked unlike

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359
left yeah no what I really liked unlike
 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:17.029
left yeah no what I really liked unlike
a lot of shows that do like time travel

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039
a lot of shows that do like time travel
 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.279
a lot of shows that do like time travel
if you will there was only two sets

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289
if you will there was only two sets
 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.860
if you will there was only two sets
that's it there wasn't like 30 different

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870
that's it there wasn't like 30 different
 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.270
that's it there wasn't like 30 different
sets of fins and Jake's running around

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280
sets of fins and Jake's running around
 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.450
sets of fins and Jake's running around
there was just the simple two sets and I

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460
there was just the simple two sets and I
 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.980
there was just the simple two sets and I
liked that they could have gone over the

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990
liked that they could have gone over the
 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.720
liked that they could have gone over the
top and had like you know 30 40

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730
top and had like you know 30 40
 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.730
top and had like you know 30 40
different sets running all over the

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740
different sets running all over the
 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.070
different sets running all over the
place and doing all this stuff but it

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080
place and doing all this stuff but it
 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.420
place and doing all this stuff but it
was nice it was just in a sense

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430
was nice it was just in a sense
 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.790
was nice it was just in a sense
streamlined down to just the two of them

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800
streamlined down to just the two of them
 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.950
streamlined down to just the two of them
yeah and it's it seemed to make sense

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960
yeah and it's it seemed to make sense
 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.890
yeah and it's it seemed to make sense
that's like you have to keep the circle

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900
that's like you have to keep the circle
 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.070
that's like you have to keep the circle
going sort of this you know if you don't

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080
going sort of this you know if you don't
 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.450
going sort of this you know if you don't
and I thought they demonstrated that

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460
and I thought they demonstrated that
 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.700
and I thought they demonstrated that
pretty well with Finn not interrupting

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710
pretty well with Finn not interrupting
 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.530
pretty well with Finn not interrupting
Jake in the beginning mm-hmm cuz at

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540
Jake in the beginning mm-hmm cuz at
 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.879
Jake in the beginning mm-hmm cuz at
first I was like I was thinking back

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889
first I was like I was thinking back
 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.680
first I was like I was thinking back
like well why did you really just show

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690
like well why did you really just show
 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.240
like well why did you really just show
them I think that helped demonstrate

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250
them I think that helped demonstrate
 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.080
them I think that helped demonstrate
more you can't disrupt the cycle you

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090
more you can't disrupt the cycle you
 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:02.700
more you can't disrupt the cycle you
know like if you do that then it's like

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710
know like if you do that then it's like
 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.440
know like if you do that then it's like
the cycle is exactly that broken and

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450
the cycle is exactly that broken and
 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.640
the cycle is exactly that broken and
everything crumbles

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650
everything crumbles
 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.460
everything crumbles
you know you CJ keep blowing up so I

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470
you know you CJ keep blowing up so I
 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.290
you know you CJ keep blowing up so I
guess it I guess it has since they

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300
guess it I guess it has since they
 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.050
guess it I guess it has since they
killed a bunch of Jake's maybe or what

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060
killed a bunch of Jake's maybe or what
 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.400
killed a bunch of Jake's maybe or what
that dream Jake any who knows and yeah I

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410
that dream Jake any who knows and yeah I
 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.690
that dream Jake any who knows and yeah I
like that too how there's just this

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700
like that too how there's just this
 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.600
like that too how there's just this
endless cycle and only one gets out that

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610
endless cycle and only one gets out that
 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.690
endless cycle and only one gets out that
like kind of breaks if you know in a

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700
like kind of breaks if you know in a
 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.450
like kind of breaks if you know in a
sense like you know the so one Finn is

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460
sense like you know the so one Finn is
 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.280
sense like you know the so one Finn is
destroyed and then I'm ever Jake has to

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290
destroyed and then I'm ever Jake has to
 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.840
destroyed and then I'm ever Jake has to
sleep and be the new body but yeah the

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850
sleep and be the new body but yeah the
 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.000
sleep and be the new body but yeah the
one that was running that cycle kind of

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010
one that was running that cycle kind of
 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.280
one that was running that cycle kind of
gets out so it's it's fun it's it's some

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290
gets out so it's it's fun it's it's some
 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.840
gets out so it's it's fun it's it's some
pretty pre detail for a kid show because

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850
pretty pre detail for a kid show because
 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.580
pretty pre detail for a kid show because
like like yeah I feel like Batman at me

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590
like like yeah I feel like Batman at me
 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.350
like like yeah I feel like Batman at me
it's serious only something done similar

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360
it's serious only something done similar
 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.969
it's serious only something done similar
ideas but yeah kinda like what you say

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979
ideas but yeah kinda like what you say
 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:49.560
ideas but yeah kinda like what you say
like this really sir took the idea of

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570
like this really sir took the idea of
 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.840
like this really sir took the idea of
the loop and breaking the loop and what

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850
the loop and breaking the loop and what
 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.300
the loop and breaking the loop and what
can happen with it and place it maybe

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310
can happen with it and place it maybe
 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.580
can happen with it and place it maybe
enjoyably confusing I think it's meant

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590
enjoyably confusing I think it's meant
 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.830
enjoyably confusing I think it's meant
to be like this is hard to follow but

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840
to be like this is hard to follow but
 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.260
to be like this is hard to follow but
that's part of the fun yeah like I get

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270
that's part of the fun yeah like I get
 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.420
that's part of the fun yeah like I get
annoyed and bothered with I haven't seen

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430
annoyed and bothered with I haven't seen
 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.120
annoyed and bothered with I haven't seen
inception and I mean I heard it's good

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130
inception and I mean I heard it's good
 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.710
inception and I mean I heard it's good
and I heard is bad and I've heard all

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720
and I heard is bad and I've heard all
 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.550
and I heard is bad and I've heard all
different things but I think South Park

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560
different things but I think South Park
 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.850
different things but I think South Park
said it best in their episode in Sheep

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860
said it best in their episode in Sheep
 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.400
said it best in their episode in Sheep
shin yeah where they said just because

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410
shin yeah where they said just because
 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.310
shin yeah where they said just because
you make things complicated overly

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320
you make things complicated overly
 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.690
you make things complicated overly
complicated doesn't make it more

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700
complicated doesn't make it more
 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.060
complicated doesn't make it more
enjoyable yeah and again I haven't seen

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070
enjoyable yeah and again I haven't seen
 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.010
enjoyable yeah and again I haven't seen
the movie but that's what they were

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020
the movie but that's what they were
 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.510
the movie but that's what they were
talking about but that's how you feel

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520
talking about but that's how you feel
 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.719
talking about but that's how you feel
about a lot of time travel episodes and

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:30.729
about a lot of time travel episodes and
 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:32.610
about a lot of time travel episodes and
like infinite loop episodes have just

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620
like infinite loop episodes have just
 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.520
like infinite loop episodes have just
chosen it in general they try to go too

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:35.530
chosen it in general they try to go too
 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.070
chosen it in general they try to go too
complicated and you stop having fun

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080
complicated and you stop having fun
 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.149
complicated and you stop having fun
this one was just a lot more done well

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:42.159
this one was just a lot more done well
 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:43.740
this one was just a lot more done well
again I think because you have that 11

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:43.750
again I think because you have that 11
 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.529
again I think because you have that 11
minutes to yeah you can definitely serve

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:46.539
minutes to yeah you can definitely serve
 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.240
minutes to yeah you can definitely serve
like you know you do have to keep it so

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250
like you know you do have to keep it so
 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.089
like you know you do have to keep it so
tight so you only keep it to like the

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:51.099
tight so you only keep it to like the
 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:54.300
tight so you only keep it to like the
important stuff yeah so yeah no I I like

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310
important stuff yeah so yeah no I I like
 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.980
important stuff yeah so yeah no I I like
how is done I think that is a very good

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990
how is done I think that is a very good
 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.950
how is done I think that is a very good
point that like I think with Adventure

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960
point that like I think with Adventure
 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.770
point that like I think with Adventure
Time I'm glad I don't see this too often

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780
Time I'm glad I don't see this too often
 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.749
Time I'm glad I don't see this too often
anymore I think we started to see it a

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759
anymore I think we started to see it a
 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:06.119
anymore I think we started to see it a
little bit of round cow that matrix II

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:06.129
little bit of round cow that matrix II
 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:08.610
little bit of round cow that matrix II
Christopher Nolan II like you know sir a

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620
Christopher Nolan II like you know sir a
 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.100
Christopher Nolan II like you know sir a
period of time where it's like

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.110
period of time where it's like
 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.839
period of time where it's like
everything was like like you said oh

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:12.849
everything was like like you said oh
 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.879
everything was like like you said oh
it's complicated and kind of confusing

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:14.889
it's complicated and kind of confusing
 

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:17.189
it's complicated and kind of confusing
so it it must be good you know ya know

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199
so it it must be good you know ya know
 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:18.600
so it it must be good you know ya know
it's you still have to have an

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.610
it's you still have to have an
 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.999
it's you still have to have an
attachment you still have to care you

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:21.009
attachment you still have to care you
 

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:24.180
attachment you still have to care you
still had to be invested in it and I

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.190
still had to be invested in it and I
 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.439
still had to be invested in it and I
think even though a venture time does

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:25.449
think even though a venture time does
 

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:27.510
think even though a venture time does
have kind of like a you know a
