[inaudible]

3
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,150
all
right.

4
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,240
[inaudible] just spoke to

5
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,930
some of these
boy

6
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,920
[inaudible] [inaudible]

7
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,630
[inaudible]

8
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,180
just spoke to
some of these beliefs

9
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,700
Ahla has right now.

10
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:15,030
[inaudible]

11
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,900
Huh?

12
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:12,070
[inaudible] [inaudible]

13
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,780
awesome. That's a good goddamn song.
That is the first time I heard that song,

14
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,170
isn't it great? Yeah. First Time I
heard it and it got me. I love it. Yeah.

15
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,050
Even the video. Have you ever see
the video? It's just words in it.

16
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:56,040
Like it's just words, but yet you get
into the words. You know what? I really,

17
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,970
I'm masterpiece. I'm not into
soulful music like that usually,

18
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:00,110
but that's a good song.

19
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:04,580
I'm already thinking about like remix it
into like a disturbed or prong remix or

20
00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:08,210
something. Would you want to fuck these
gentleman's podcast sponsored once?

21
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,270
Always. Every time by the
podcast, by the fleshlight on, uh,

22
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,980
it's a Saturday.
This is an impromptu podcast.

23
00:04:15,981 --> 00:04:18,080
We decided to put together and Brian
just throw on that song. He said,

24
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:18,831
you have to listen to it.

25
00:04:18,831 --> 00:04:21,560
It was so good just listening to the
first couple seconds of it that we had to

26
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:23,270
play the whole thing.
I fucking love that dude.

27
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:28,110
Remember when he first heard the song
crazy. Yeah, that was [inaudible].

28
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,240
Oh Shit. That's not
all sparkly, Goddamn C,

29
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,740
whatever his name is. I remember when
Bj Penn, I forget who he was fighting.

30
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:37,940
I think he's finding Matt Hughes,

31
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,230
but he came out to was that crazy
song and I was like, God damn,

32
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:45,530
that's a good song. Cee Lo green
is his name from Gnarls Barkley,

33
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,030
but I am guessing,
you know,

34
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:49,040
I wonder what the edited
versions going to sound like.

35
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:51,470
Are they just going to meetings or are
they just going to bleep it out or change

36
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:54,450
the words are such, you know what? I
don't think they need to do that anymore.

37
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:58,070
Radio is dead. Yeah. I mean, the
people that are on radio right now,

38
00:04:58,071 --> 00:05:01,490
a lot of them are doing podcasts and it's
eventually going to go to that regular

39
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,700
terrestrial radio. They've
just fucking, they've gotten,

40
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,510
they've gotten so busy with it and fucked
with it so much that they've crushed

41
00:05:08,511 --> 00:05:11,090
it because there's no, you can't
fuck around on the radio anymore.

42
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,200
You can't have fun. He gets sued.
It's like, why can't you say fuck you?

43
00:05:15,201 --> 00:05:16,820
You remember the, the, the WHO song.

44
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:21,050
Remember what was the song that had
fucking in it? I don't remember who are,

45
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:23,410
you know, who the fuck are you? Right.

46
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:25,700
They played that shit on the
radio when I was a kid. Really?

47
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:30,640
Because it was the WHO.
Wow. Because, whew, whew.

48
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,160
Whew, whew. You get to the
puck goes, oh the fuck are you.

49
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,790
They kept that on the radio,
right. You can't do it.

50
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,030
But with this song you could probably
just put like cat sounds instead of fuck

51
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:44,540
and it would still work. I
listened. I listened to that.
Who the fuck are you song?

52
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,610
I listened to that. Who Song the
other day and they did get it.

53
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:48,950
It was on the radio and they did get it.
They got really fucked.

54
00:05:48,951 --> 00:05:52,820
They twisted the fuck. They took
like a pace out of the fuck. So, Oh,

55
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:56,200
who the fuck are you? You know there's,
yeah, it's, it's sort of there,

56
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,980
but it's not there.
You can get away with

57
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,750
it. Hmm. It's just good. Fuck it man.
Just let it get on the Internet. Get it.

58
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:06,800
Make it become mp3s and playing clubs.
It'll be gigantic. A satellite radio,

59
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,860
you know, Eddie, how much money did
you spend last night on junk food?

60
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,140
$250 but it wasn't all junk for,
there was some bar that was uh, uh,

61
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,830
two 12 packs of water. Wow.
So that's like $6, right?

62
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,630
You had,
you had a picture on your Twitter,

63
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:25,970
you guys gotta check it out
where it's just like junk food.

64
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:29,480
Tons and tons of junk. Yeah. That was,
no, I didn't set that up. I decided,

65
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:33,680
I realized I never go
grocery shopping ever. And,

66
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:35,690
but when I did back in the day,

67
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,870
you never do it stoned and hungry because
you ended up buying a bunch of shit

68
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:41,470
you would never eat. It just stacks
up and just stays in your house.

69
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,870
Everything sounds good.
You know what?

70
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,740
I'm gonna get some fucking
hamburger helper, every flavor,

71
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,990
all the shit you would never eat.

72
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,160
So I ended up doing that last night
and spent 250 bucks on just shit

73
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:03,140
pictures. Great. It feels so bad about
yourself after you bought a lot of cereal,

74
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,200
a peanut butter captain crunch.
I mean,

75
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,990
that was the big box of lucky charms.

76
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,620
A huge box was two 99 how the fuck
are you going to turn that down?

77
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,340
I hate three Krispy Kreme donuts in one
sitting the other night. The big ones,

78
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:20,780
chocolate cream filled. It was so
fucking good. There was so good.

79
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,150
But it's right away. As soon as you're
done, you feel like such a piece of shit.

80
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:29,090
Oh yeah. You never feel
good at done to my body. Oh,

81
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:32,420
you're always feel like shit.
You just throwing sludge in the machine.

82
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,390
That's like fucking a fat check.
You never going to feel good after,

83
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,900
after you feel like jumping out of
lumber. If you love her, Eddie. Well,

84
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:41,540
if you're in love with her and because
she's on the back because she got

85
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:46,100
pregnant and that's where you can get
you gotta do what you gotta do with some

86
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:48,820
dudes. It's not worth it for them to
get skinny to fucking skinny girl.

87
00:07:48,821 --> 00:07:52,430
They're like, you know when I like being
fat, I just fuck a fat chick. Yeah,

88
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,290
that's cool. Thank God. Well, there's,
everybody's got different tastes, man.

89
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,780
Someone's going to some girls like
really heroin looking dudes that's like a

90
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:02,330
look like that bitches
are angry enough man.

91
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,110
We had to tell their bang that
shit out of him. Calm down.

92
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,950
Some of them are angry too, Tom or
were just sad. They just lash out.

93
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,463
How would you like it?

94
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,160
How about the bad check that's hanging
out with three hot chicks at a club on

95
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:20,240
Trump? Love about that
chick, which is monster.

96
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,010
The path for everybody just destroying
the night to crush the night.

97
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,970
I used to do a bit about them,
about girls cock blocking,

98
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,470
need to bring that shit back.
I don't think ever recorded that.

99
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,550
God Damn it cock blocking a show
excepted for women. It's accepted.

100
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,870
Like if you don't cock block then you
had like no honor almost, you know?

101
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:43,850
But for guys if you cock block you
can get punched but you can cock block

102
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:48,260
another guy if he's trying to fuck your
girlfriend. That seems to be acceptable.

103
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,440
I've seen a lot of that where if a guys
hanging out with a girl but they're just

104
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:55,010
friends and the dude, we'll try to cock
block anyway. I've never seen that happen.

105
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,700
Say that again.
Explain it to is friends with the girls.

106
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:02,160
Say you are a young single man out in
the town and you meet a young lady and

107
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:04,020
she's attractive and she's here.
Oh,

108
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:07,110
these are just my friends and she's
with a girlfriend and a guy friend.

109
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:12,111
The guy friend will almost always cock
block unless he's like super cool and

110
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:13,380
thinks you're super cool.

111
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,770
Mostly guy friends hanging out
with a girl or just due to,

112
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:19,260
haven't really been successful
in fucking that girl.

113
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,800
You're going to be very upset if you
are and it's usually if she's pretty,

114
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,530
for sure if he's around, if
he's young, what are the odds?

115
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:28,890
He has his shit together enough that he's
cool with her being attracted to other

116
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:31,920
people other than him. If he's handsome
and she's pretty, what are the odds?

117
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,370
This fucking zero, the odds. Zero.
They're just, there's some twisted rub,

118
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,940
love triangle with her friend and
he really wants to fuck around,

119
00:09:37,941 --> 00:09:38,774
but he can't know.

120
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:42,360
Well, it's your friend.
It's cruel person. Do it.

121
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,470
They'll be friends with checks so long,
like hot. I've done that too. For decades.

122
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,750
I was friends with the chick from like
1994 and I finally fucked her in 2000

123
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,960
[inaudible] the whole time I wanted to,

124
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,760
I was waiting, but she was so
funny and so cool. We actually,

125
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,130
I like hanging out with that.

126
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,920
Eventually I brought the game afoot

127
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,120
with some smart women,
some smart women just,

128
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,730
they're so tired of the
bullshit that guys do that they,

129
00:10:10,731 --> 00:10:14,960
they will fuck with you and we'll drag
you around if you want to fuck them.

130
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,240
They just want to see how
much effort you put in,

131
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:21,080
how long you will stick around and to
them it's like it's almost a commodity

132
00:10:21,081 --> 00:10:23,540
they're giving up. Like if you
fuck, if she fucks you now,

133
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:24,920
you're not going to take
her seriously anymore.

134
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,930
You're just going to be like one
of the other girls that she fox.

135
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,500
But if she just strings you
around forever, then you're
her little play thing.

136
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:33,680
You're her little buddy and we kiss
every now and then. What's the big deal?

137
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,170
Well. How about if you haven't
kissed and then you think like, fuck,

138
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:40,500
I'm going to make that move after being
friends for four years and you make a

139
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:45,300
move and she turns you down to, and
that's Bruce. I thought we were friends.

140
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:47,190
Yeah. You mean this whole time
you've been trying to fuck me.

141
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,320
So like a crazy I was in the
moment. Yeah, that's never good.

142
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,590
You go out there and you tried
to kiss and she just turned.

143
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,310
She hasn't turned out that all the
way. Just a little bit. It's like Bam.

144
00:10:56,311 --> 00:11:00,030
She just gives you the jaw. That's
always that moment. You're like, damn,

145
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:03,130
she didn't respond the
way I wish she would have

146
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,290
weird thing with human beings. When one
person wants to be with the other person,

147
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,470
whether it's friendship or whether it's
sexually, any other persons on into it,

148
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,710
that's the worst.
So the worst thing to watch in a movie,

149
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:15,540
it's the most uncomfortable
thing to watch.

150
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,360
When you see a friend of yours that's
getting fucking just done over and you see

151
00:11:21,361 --> 00:11:25,440
it coming, man, I gotta just
watched this happen. Shit. Yeah,

152
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
it's the worst.

153
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,360
It's like if you love a check and all of
a sudden she doesn't love you anymore,

154
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,360
there's nothing she can steal from
you that hurts more than that.

155
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,780
Like my fucking house on fire.
Now I'll be like, there's a hotel.

156
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,760
I'm going to be okay.
I'm a little disoriented.

157
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:42,360
I can't believe my house is burnt to the
ground, but I'm going to be okay. Yeah,

158
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,320
pull that fucking deep love away and
he'd give it to someone else. Uh,

159
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,120
did that happen to my
babies with someone else?

160
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,650
Last time that happened was in
1995 and it fucking crushed me.

161
00:11:51,651 --> 00:11:54,130
I wrote are terrible and

162
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:58,330
put her on a cassette and left it on a
doorstep begging her to come back to me.

163
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,420
It was dogmas, dude. I would,
I had to sleep with value
during this to get it out.

164
00:12:03,421 --> 00:12:06,490
She, she just left me. Aren't you glad
she didn't have a Twitter back then?

165
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,490
Could you imagine like, oh my
God, check out on my Facebook.

166
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,370
Facebook doesn't have a
limit is much of a limit.

167
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,970
Can write a lot of shit when people
break up on Twitter. Stupid thing.

168
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:19,990
Celebrities break up on fucking Twitter
because they come together on Twitter

169
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,010
and they're back on. That's a good one
babe. All sweet baby. Love your baby.

170
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,610
And they go back and forth while the
whole world is watching him go back and

171
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:31,060
forth. Does that all the
time? Tito and Jenna Jameson,

172
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,000
that's what I'm talking about.
Back and forth all the time.

173
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:35,530
And then when they break up,
they have to make an announcement.

174
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:38,350
You have to say something because
they're not twitting together anymore.

175
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,860
They're not hooking each other up in the
twit. So then they have to announce it.

176
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,810
They're no longer going out.
That's working hilarious.

177
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,350
Can you have Twitter?
What happened to Steve adgs Twitter?

178
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,600
He just deleted his whole entire account
and it was like, fuck Twitter or if I,

179
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,820
you know, and I'm deleting my Facebook
also. And then the other day I'm like,

180
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:57,260
why haven't I heard from him in awhile?

181
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,590
And he just got it back on the Twitter
like a month later or something.

182
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:02,850
He's like, I had to get
back on Twitter to uh, uh,

183
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,800
talk about this movie I just saw
and now he has like 2000 friends.

184
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:10,010
But didn't he like have like a
million? Yeah, something like that.

185
00:13:10,011 --> 00:13:13,100
He just deleted all,
did Twitter suicide. I

186
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:15,880
was there a reason.
I don't know.

187
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,640
There's some people that feel
like we're too connected, man.

188
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:20,530
There's some people that don't like it.
They resent it.

189
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,140
They want the old school way where
people just like you, they like you,

190
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:26,050
they like you, you know you don't,
and when I have to talk all day,

191
00:13:26,051 --> 00:13:27,880
I don't have to be fucking tweet
and back and forth with you.

192
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,890
I'll do a Johnny Carson interview and sit
down with them. And if you're like me,

193
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,410
like me, you know, they don't want to
get into the whole social media thing.

194
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,830
I disagree with that. I
mean, I disagree with it too,

195
00:13:38,831 --> 00:13:41,600
but for some people it's like
their privacy is just, um,

196
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,730
there's people that aren't on Twitter,
aren't on a fucking barely on computers.

197
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,120
They are, they're not even on
the goddamn computer. They still,

198
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:51,660
you could live that life if you want.
You can totally sure.

199
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,410
My mom doesn't even know how to get texts.

200
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:58,650
I sent my mom a text like a month ago
and she finally just responded Oh mg.

201
00:13:59,561 --> 00:14:03,880
I didn't know I got texts.
My mom doesn't get text messages.

202
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:06,180
My mom just figured that out.
Like last week she,

203
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,850
she'll send the same text
twice cause she's not sure how.

204
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,500
Maybe you didn't go through
and let me send it again.

205
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:14,440
Maybe they didn't go through it. Let me
send it again. It's like a fucking letter.

206
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,140
My mom is scared of the
price. I'm like, mom, it's $5

207
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,860
for like 500 text messages. You could
just do that plan. And she goes, no,

208
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:25,220
I just can't afford $5 on my thing. I'm
like, mom, think of all the stamps cards.

209
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,680
You cave. She doesn't
understand it. You she has,

210
00:14:27,681 --> 00:14:30,690
I'd have a tech seminar to
go to or something. Yeah.

211
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,220
Some people just don't give a fuck about
technology. So maybe that's what it was.

212
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:38,840
Maybe he just felt like too compressed,
you know, maybe two to attach to people.

213
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,170
So it wasn't too long where it was all
about fucking fan mail and like opening

214
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:44,720
up like a and going that
stuff for whatever reason,

215
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:47,960
that stuff always creeped me out.
But, but this does not creep me out.

216
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,830
Like communicating with people
on an even level and boards and

217
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,160
you know, and Twitter and stuff like
that. I like that. That's fun. It's fun.

218
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,670
It's interesting, you know,
I mean, you can't respond to
everybody. It's impossible.

219
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:00,980
It's virtually impossible.
And some people get mad because of it.

220
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:03,440
And I understand you getting annoyed,
but there's no way I could respond.

221
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:04,760
Everybody.
I wouldn't have time to do shit.

222
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:06,920
I wouldn't have time to write anything,

223
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,160
wouldn't be able to work out with
enough time to get anything done.

224
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:14,330
There's just no fucking way you can keep
up. There's just no way. But it's still,

225
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,170
it's a fun way to give what you can
give, you know? And, and it's a fun way,

226
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,710
not money. Not that that's anything you're
giving. It's so special. But you know,

227
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:24,830
just to be able to communicate with
people and just the amount of information

228
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:25,431
that you get now.

229
00:15:25,431 --> 00:15:28,130
It's just so much different than when
you know our parents were growing up.

230
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,670
There was nothing like fucking ghetto
gaggers.com that someone could just click

231
00:15:31,671 --> 00:15:34,160
a link to you. You remember when
that guy did that to me on Twitter?

232
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,760
Some guy goes, hey, is this triangle okay?
This has got doing this triangle. Okay.

233
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,630
I click on it and this little skinny
white dude who's got this chick who truly

234
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,220
side, she's like this really
ghetto looking chick and
he's fucking her mouth and

235
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:50,630
there's a whole site dedicated to skinny
white dudes fucking the shit out of

236
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:54,380
these ghetto black checks. There's a
whole site. There was no nothing like, oh,

237
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:58,130
what's that side? Oh,
gaggers.com email me that. Yeah.

238
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,480
[inaudible] it's the strangest fuck
it that. I'll work back and watch it,

239
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,230
man. That's like watching
dolphins get harpooned and shit.

240
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,230
How hard shit like that was for your dad
to see how shit like that. My Mom, what?

241
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,020
For my mom to see how hard that was when
they were growing up to get a ghetto

242
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:19,820
gaggers photo.
It was impossible.

243
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,250
You couldn't find it and if
you tried looking for it,

244
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:25,100
you'd probably get arrested. You'd
probably get locked up in some FBI sting,

245
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,850
you know? I mean how many, how hard
was it to get like really obscene shit.

246
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,810
It's really hard time. I think that then
you see these like historic photos of,

247
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:37,370
you know, bondage houses from the
1910 did shit. They still did shit.

248
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,350
But I don't think it was easy to see it.

249
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,860
I think you had to get deep into that
world before you got into the bondage

250
00:16:42,861 --> 00:16:43,250
houses.

251
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,000
You had to be trusted into the circle
of fucking freaks and Weirdos willing to

252
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:49,220
tie each other up and fuck their
faces and do whatever they do.

253
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,470
It's probably a lot of drawings
back then of that though,

254
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,370
they would have to be me right before,
before 1835 there was no cameras.

255
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,260
So there was all drawn. Yeah, there
are stacks and stacks of drawings and

256
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,020
maybe it was just all talk. Maybe it
was just all written word, you know?

257
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:06,590
I know they did. They did have
like some sort of light porn,

258
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,630
like literature came at 10 how happy
people are when they invented Morse code.

259
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,950
What's the thought that was like magic,
right?

260
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,970
[inaudible]
technology.

261
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,080
You know what I mean? They'd send a wire
in the old west. Remember that shit?

262
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,650
That's crazy. She sent a
letter by y. How crazy is that?

263
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:32,860
I wonder how complex smoke
signals got [inaudible].

264
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,660
I mean, how many symbols are
there can you make with smoke?

265
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,450
Whether there's this dude
that lives in Alaska,

266
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,680
there's this dude that lives
in Alaska and he was on a, um,

267
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,990
Jack Carolla show on the road, whatever
it was called. What was it called?

268
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,550
Do you remember that show?
No,

269
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,460
it was caught on the road
and it was like a CBS show.

270
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,290
Scott would go on all these different
places and he went to Alaska to talk to

271
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:54,780
this prospect or,
and this guy spends like five,

272
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:59,781
six months alone by himself in Alaska and
then comes back into town and he says,

273
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:03,420
when he comes back into town, he can read
people's minds. It doesn't last forever.

274
00:18:03,421 --> 00:18:06,840
Buddy can do it for a short period of
time because he's not talking to anyone

275
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:10,890
out there and it learns how
to tune into thoughts, Huh?

276
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,630
What the fuck

277
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:18,660
can you prove this? Yeah.
Right. I mean, no. I mean,

278
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,410
I know this deal with this and
the tooth in the woods again.

279
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,690
Yeah. I mean, it's ridiculous, but
I think there's something there.

280
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,760
Not that there's, this guy can actually
read your mind, but I think there's,

281
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:34,050
there's obviously something else going
on just besides words he needs to be on

282
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:35,040
that show.
Uh,

283
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,120
Stanley's superhumans try to describe
what it feels like when you know someone's

284
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:42,150
full of Shit. We know when
someone's lying to you, you know,

285
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:45,390
that weird feeling when someone's
lying to you. Pantomimes yeah, yeah.

286
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,730
But even not even
pantomimes just something,

287
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,590
just something you just a hunch, you
know, just a weird vibe, a feeling.

288
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,870
You're tuning into something,
you know,

289
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,560
what is it that you have to do to get
really super sensitive to be able to do

290
00:18:58,561 --> 00:19:01,860
that all the time though, is they're like
exercises that you can do to try that

291
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,920
tuning, paranoia, paranoia. I
seriously, if you're paranoid,

292
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:09,100
you're watching every single Flint of
every single move is something else is

293
00:19:09,101 --> 00:19:11,200
making, you know, cause you're
paranoid about everything.

294
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:15,250
You're watching every hand motion, you
start getting overly sensitive, you know?

295
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,240
Yeah.
But that's not good.

296
00:19:16,241 --> 00:19:18,970
But I'm saying is to be able to read
it like all the time to be able to tune

297
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:22,180
into it all the time. It's gotta be
something that people get in close to.

298
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,940
You know, long time ago I was
reading that there was this one guy,

299
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,400
I forget who he was,
some saint character and um,

300
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,590
he was one of the first guys that
knew how to read without talking.

301
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,700
And there was one of the ways that they
thought this guy was divine because he

302
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:39,220
could like look at the,
the uh,

303
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:42,670
the scripture and he could close
it and then speak of the words.

304
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:43,960
And they were like, well, this is proof.

305
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:46,420
This guy's divine because he
doesn't even have to read it aloud.

306
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,690
And what it was is he was just the first
guy who figured out how to read without

307
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:52,180
talking. So Thomas, it's
like a totally normal thing.

308
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,170
We think that's what we always
do, but a long time ago, you know,

309
00:19:56,171 --> 00:19:57,880
thousands of years ago,
I mean who knows how long.

310
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,710
That was like really hard to do.

311
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Like you couldn't just look at something
and just like in thinks in your head.

312
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:06,550
Oh, that's a poster for the ultimate
doom. You have to say the ultimate doom.

313
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:10,750
You'd have to spell it out. How
strange is that? It's ridiculous.

314
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:14,500
That's like a technique.
That's the technique somebody figured out.

315
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,380
We just take it for granted. Just
reading. Imagine if everywhere you go,

316
00:20:19,381 --> 00:20:20,340
people had a real loud,

317
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:21,763
okay,

318
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,150
how God damn annoying would that be?

319
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:28,080
You're on a plane and everyone's got
their own book and you got to tune in to

320
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:31,530
whatever these fucking people are reading
stupid romance novel and you're trying

321
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:32,364
to read your shit.

322
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,453
You know what I'm picking up.

323
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,640
I'm picking up when was toilet paper
and invented and what the different

324
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:48,040
cultures use to wipe their ass over
the centuries. The day is considered

325
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,910
the way to go everywhere.

326
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:53,410
But here I'm talking about ancient England
ass wiping ancient ass wiping, moldy,

327
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:56,320
musty use, rivers, sticks,
rocks, twigs, faces of hope,

328
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,760
maybe nothing by a river
nearby and no one did.

329
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:01,640
You have a shit back.

330
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,480
Maybe the whole reason why people wipe
it all is because they want someone to

331
00:21:04,481 --> 00:21:06,940
eat their ass. We're the only animal
understands how good that feels.

332
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,200
That's why we keep our ass clean.

333
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,570
We used to drag them by the hair.

334
00:21:09,571 --> 00:21:12,420
Don't you think they would make would
make them clean your ass? You know,

335
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:15,450
clean my ass. You know that's how
the cavemen probably wipe their ass.

336
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:20,550
You know like,
I mean they used to try drag would force,

337
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,680
they were tools to the women were
tools. Yeah, the one that works.

338
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,040
That's why they would drag him
by the hair. They didn't care.

339
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,270
I don't think that's right.

340
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,540
First guy to wipe his ass probably it
was some problem was a gay guy who's gay.

341
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:36,460
Cavemen just trying to let me just
clean this place up. It's such a mess.

342
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,390
Do you ever walk it lathered
it up palm for and shit.

343
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,650
Never walk into a public restroom and
think it's like we're part of like a gay

344
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:46,120
joke. You know what I mean? Cause they,

345
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,740
why do we all have to pull out our dicks
and everyone is so no matter how old

346
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:54,040
you are, if you're standing
next to a bunch of people
and you pull out your tick,

347
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:58,780
it just, there's still, there's a little,
there's a touch of insecurity. Right.

348
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:03,300
Just a little touch I
miss too. It's like why?

349
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:07,810
Why can't we have compartments? Like
[inaudible] whole weird thing is that,

350
00:22:07,811 --> 00:22:10,780
you know for sure the dude's
have sucked other dudes.

351
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:12,940
Dick's in these very
bathrooms. Yeah. I was like,

352
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:15,880
why don't we play out a Dick's
gay dudes must love going.

353
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,570
That's what public restaurants
are such a turnoff.

354
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,300
Don't you think they're doing a bath?

355
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:24,120
Cause dudes do all pulling Dixon's
dicks on everywhere for them.

356
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,160
It's just like if you could go
into a chick's room. Exactly.

357
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,470
That's what I'm thinking.
There's a big fucking gay joke.

358
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,570
Gay Dude design the first public restroom.

359
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,460
Yeah,
but don't you think locker rooms or worse?

360
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:35,500
Way worse because at least peeing.
You have something to do.

361
00:22:35,501 --> 00:22:37,750
Locker rooms are just kind of like
getting dressed and talking about

362
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,910
clothing.
No locker rooms are bad too.

363
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:41,820
I mean you should have
your own private booths.

364
00:22:41,821 --> 00:22:44,890
Some urinals have walls where
you can't see other dudes, Dick.

365
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,110
But then some brand new
brand new stadiums, the brand
new stadiums and they are,

366
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,760
you have a trough was
pulling out their dicks

367
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:57,660
did. I used to do taekwondo with back in
the day and he was a male dancer and he

368
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:01,440
always used to creep people out
because he would be like, he would get,

369
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,940
he would take a shower and then he would
just like stroll around the bathroom

370
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:10,680
was chest out like this stroll around.
Sometimes he would stretch out naked.

371
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,060
He'd be fucking naked Bro.

372
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:15,630
And this company like stretch his
legs out and his fucking, his deck.

373
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:19,920
I mean he probably had like a hundred
fat chicks suck at a day. And some guys,

374
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,491
you know,

375
00:23:20,491 --> 00:23:24,420
I mean this guy was a male dancer and he
definitely had guys that that asked him

376
00:23:24,421 --> 00:23:27,090
to dance because he told me that's
the best way you can make money.

377
00:23:27,091 --> 00:23:28,770
He doesn't like to do it.
I don't want to do it man.

378
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,010
Thanks to like road show around
the bathroom and his elephant Dick.

379
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,920
He'll look at elephants trunk just flop.
It was like three,

380
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,670
three quarters hard all the time.
This dude would just walk around.

381
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:42,910
Nothing's gayer than that.
That's

382
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,090
what about that hour that you posted
on Twitter the other day with that and

383
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:49,460
some Mexicans talk about that
shit. That's crazy. Yeah.

384
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:52,070
Apparently it's some crazy owl.
It's um,

385
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,510
there's a bunch of different names for it.

386
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,740
I think someone said it's a frog owl
and someone said it's a thorny hour or

387
00:23:57,741 --> 00:24:00,230
something like that.
I guess it's a from Australia.

388
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:04,580
I posted some video up on my Twitter,
some, some dudes sent it to me. It's a,

389
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:08,240
a Mexican news story about
um, this, this animal.

390
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:11,150
They don't know what it is and they
think it's a wedge and it's just as crazy

391
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,070
owl. It's a really weird looking at second
and by slight here, let me pull it up.

392
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,360
I'll pull it up on my,

393
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,890
on my Twitter while we're talking so
he could see it because it's just so

394
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:21,290
strange. It doesn't look like
a real animal. Less light bird.

395
00:24:21,291 --> 00:24:25,070
It looks like a little dragon from a
Harry Potter movie, like a half Lizard,

396
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:27,170
half bird that's come to
life. And it's like, you know,

397
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:31,070
finding you fleshlight should make one
of these birds [inaudible] totally legit

398
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:34,130
picture. Oh no, it's a video man.
It's a real animal. And there is,

399
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:38,480
there's videos of them. Oh,
they found more than one.
Oh, you know, it's an animal.

400
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:41,480
It's a real animal in Australia.
It's just, is freaky looking owl?

401
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,840
It's called like a tawny owl or
something like that. And people,

402
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,920
why was it in the Mexican
news? Uh, because I guess
they didn't know what it was.

403
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:52,430
Whoever it was. I mean, it's, you know,
the Mexican version of like some local,

404
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:56,540
you know, news story where a bunch
of Yahoos are out there with cameras.

405
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,050
Like we have cup today, which we get this
fucking thing. They're holding it down,

406
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,220
but let me, let me pull it up real quick.
He's like, why can't it be Mexican? Man?

407
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,540
Eddie got very sensitive. Any bravos
and Mexican. I don't know if you need,

408
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,420
I don't appreciate some of
their marks. Did the tone. Yeah,

409
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,060
just think you were joking with me.
When I first moved here,

410
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:16,070
he used to always tell me you
were Mexican. And I was like, oh,

411
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:18,380
that's his joke here. Like
she never believed it. Well,

412
00:25:18,381 --> 00:25:21,980
what's really funny is when
he makes chicks and tells
him he's half Japanese and

413
00:25:21,981 --> 00:25:26,270
half Eskimo, he says, yeah, I'm a
Jap. Oho stories always different.

414
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,200
It's always like, you know, my
father was a, you know, a soldier.

415
00:25:30,201 --> 00:25:33,380
His father was in World War II,
just only like some crazy. As a kid,

416
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:37,950
I always used to tell people I was half
Japanese, half Eskimo as all right.

417
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,880
Kind of like sweat shop our sweat this.
Brian,

418
00:25:40,881 --> 00:25:43,850
can you turn slide strange
reptilian bird found in Mexico?

419
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,520
[inaudible] microphone on it. That'd be
no, but it'd better if you do it though.

420
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,570
You know you can plug into it.
Remember? Yeah. I thought you meant no.

421
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,800
Just so that people can hear it
because Eddie's speaks Spanish.

422
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:55,040
He'll know what they're saying. It
says Mexico. Yeah, no, it is in Mexico.

423
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,500
I thought you said it was an
Australia. Well, it's just an animal.

424
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,010
I mean it lives in Australia and
someone found one in Mexico. Oh Shit.

425
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:05,180
I mean animals that live in Australia can
surpass the guy on a cargo boat. Yeah.

426
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,250
Probably something like that. Right? Yeah.

427
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:09,320
It's amazing how many different
animals come from everywhere.

428
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,630
There's so much of sparrows in
Hawaii then aren't from there.

429
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,630
All the pigs and Hawaiians.
Enough from there.

430
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,990
Okay. You got it. Okay. Here we go.

431
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:22,130
[inaudible] can you translate
Mr Rob [inaudible] microphone.

432
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:31,220
[inaudible] I know what she's saying.

433
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:41,220
Let's just say big Gaudy [inaudible].

434
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,320
Okay.
It's a wedge

435
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,640
Lopez.

436
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,480
[inaudible] they speak

437
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:04,850
really
don't understand proper.

438
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,400
Did you keep it so street?
You know what I'm going to give you.

439
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:14,040
You know what I'm saying? There it
is. There it is. Look at this thing.

440
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:19,930
This is the burden. It really does look
like a lizard now. It looks like a,

441
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:22,050
yeah, it looks like a flying
lizard, but it's called the,

442
00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:24,630
I think it's called a tawny owl look.
Awesome.

443
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,390
It's a real bird man.
I want to see it fly.

444
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:36,360
Look at it. It's pretty dope. I mean,

445
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,680
what's really funny is I put, I put it
up on Twitter. All right, kill it Brian.

446
00:27:40,681 --> 00:27:41,514
I think we're done.

447
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,530
I put it up on Twitter and dudes,
most people were like,

448
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:47,550
what the fuck was that?

449
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,390
And in some people out an
answer for what the fuck it was.

450
00:27:50,391 --> 00:27:52,830
You fucked one of those. If it was
drugged up and now we went and bite you.

451
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,770
No problem. Frogs figured it
out. If it was really drugged up.

452
00:27:56,771 --> 00:28:01,440
Have you ever seen people, Eileen frogs
and the frogs and the chimp? Fuck it.

453
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:06,090
That's what I meant.
Frog fucking how smart fucking chimps.

454
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,400
If somebody wants a Twitter
this while we're live here,

455
00:28:08,401 --> 00:28:09,150
if someone wants to Twitter's,

456
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,890
tell me what the fuck that
apple is so I can look it up.

457
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,590
Cause it's not a tawny owl.
It's something else. Tony owls.

458
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,030
Just a pretty normal looking out.

459
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,180
But I know at some kind of fucking
freaky owl that we didn't know existed.

460
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:22,050
That shit up.
I'm putting tion how crazy is it?

461
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:25,880
The chimps figured out how to fuck frogs.
10 chimps are super smart chips,

462
00:28:25,881 --> 00:28:28,910
smoked cigarettes, man. You ever see
that? No, I haven't seen that at all.

463
00:28:28,911 --> 00:28:30,720
I'm smoke cigarettes. You give
chimps cigarettes. They like them.

464
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,260
You see the video the other day,
somebody credible stimulates, have it.

465
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,840
Somebody dropped a game boy into the
chimp cage and San Francisco and there's

466
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:40,290
like video and photos of like just chimp
just sitting there playing game boy and

467
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:44,580
like a baby chimp lake sitting on the
board are watching. They're like really,

468
00:28:44,581 --> 00:28:49,170
really, really, really, really,
really, really stupid people. Yeah,

469
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,590
but way stronger and way more violent.
Way more violent.

470
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:56,580
They're like nine year olds can't
even understand how strong they are.

471
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:00,990
Apparently like, oh, 150 pound champ
is as strong as a 500 pound man.

472
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,590
Just try to wrap your head around that.
What a 500 pound man would feel like.

473
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:10,000
It sounds stupid. That is, no, that's
500 pounds like fessel or five.

474
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,380
Right,
Brock Lesnar 500 pounds,

475
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:17,220
his body Sheldon has there been
like a dude all yoked, no fat,

476
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:21,270
totally shredded and 400 pounds.
I'm sure there must be. Yeah,

477
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:25,290
I would imagine at this point not power
would imagine there's somebody that's

478
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:29,480
doing that, like the biggest bodybuilder
ever. I'm sure we could find it.

479
00:29:29,481 --> 00:29:31,590
We'll Google it.
Brian Google the biggest bodybuilder ever.

480
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,310
We're going to find this out,
Brian. It's totally possible.

481
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,003
Vegas,

482
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,590
like the average bond petted a bodybuilder
when they're competing or they what?

483
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:42,370
5%

484
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,170
body fat. What do you, what? What's
the average? To be totally ripped,

485
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,940
it's you gotta be really good.
5% or 2% or 3%

486
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,670
when I was doing taekwondo and when
I was cutting weight to make a high,

487
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:56,260
I was fighting at 140 pounds and I
really didn't weigh 140 pounds and I was

488
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,800
really skinny. I was very thin at the
time to a very lean, low body fat.

489
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:02,590
I was four and a half percent body fat.
When they told me like,

490
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:04,180
this is getting kind
of low. Like, you know,

491
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,540
you can't really get much lower than
that and be like competitive in anything.

492
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:10,960
Well, one place says those guys steer.
Those guys don't do anything. No,

493
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,310
they're not.
You know what I'm saying?

494
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,030
They're just posing so they can get
really low, like unhealthy loan.

495
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,270
They get to like 3% I think they're like
about to pass out or did you pass out?

496
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:22,600
They pass out all the time. Those guys
are dehydrated as fuck, man. It's like,

497
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:26,320
it looks, I mean, I'm not
into the bodybuilding look.
It's a little ridiculous.

498
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:30,370
But you know, as just an aesthetic, just
like looking at it like, it's like, like,

499
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,250
wow, look what that guy has done with
all his work and sculpted his body.

500
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:35,440
It's kind of fucking freaking.
That's Quincy Taylor.

501
00:30:35,441 --> 00:30:40,240
That was 2009 largest wine
at least. And how much? Uh,

502
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,000
one 10.
No,

503
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,760
340 pounds with a 5% body fat.

504
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,150
Whoa. That's pretty low.
Probably the biggest right
there. That's pretty big. Well,

505
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:58,770
Bob Sapp was,
what was he like three 75 was Bob Sabaj.

506
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,650
It was about three 75 three 50 but he
had a lot of fat. He was never shy.

507
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,570
Well, he wasn't, and when he first
came out and thought, Oh, Gary,

508
00:31:06,571 --> 00:31:09,620
I would not say you had a lot of fat. He
wasn't trying to, he had a little bit,

509
00:31:09,621 --> 00:31:14,310
a little, but he was so swole. Do you
remember how big Bob Sapp was? Fuck yeah.

510
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,730
For people who hadn't,
who don't know what we're talking about.

511
00:31:16,731 --> 00:31:20,260
There was a dude who fought out of
Seattle, Washington, and he only had,

512
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,560
he had a run of only a few years because
it was just this chemically fueled

513
00:31:24,561 --> 00:31:28,790
fucking suicide mission. There was no way
he could keep it up. There was no way,

514
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,060
no way. You could be that big for that
many years. How long can you keep that up?

515
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,210
He was,
he was a fucking nightmare for awhile.

516
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,500
And then 75 18 months. It was a Bob
Sapp going to take over the world.

517
00:31:39,501 --> 00:31:41,980
He was so big.
He crushed Ernesto,

518
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,850
who's twice in a kickboxing match,
straight kickbox. He beat her nest,

519
00:31:46,851 --> 00:31:47,684
a host.

520
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:52,390
That's how strong he was and his sheer
might was enough to bully who's to know

521
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,870
corner and just smash him. He was more
feared than Brock Lesner is today.

522
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,150
Yeah, he was before that
car went fine. He was,

523
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:02,500
he was feared and it was cool
because you would lose, you know,

524
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,690
he would come really close to smash and
guys like Noguera and then he would gas

525
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:08,910
out. No, Garrett got that harmed by
like, oh shit. What that, no terrified.

526
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,070
I remember we watched it here. We had a
party here and we were all, oh no, no, no.

527
00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:15,980
It was that we were all at Larry's house.
Larry's Larry's house.

528
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,360
We were watching this shit live and right
when that started I was just, no way.

529
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,360
He right when he was getting his
ass kicked at the first 45 seconds.

530
00:32:23,361 --> 00:32:28,130
I like no way he's going to win. He's
too big. He's too big. He's done.

531
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:32,480
He's too big. I said that like the times
we just too big. It's too freaking out.

532
00:32:32,481 --> 00:32:36,050
It was the craziest fight ever because
here Nogueira was the pride champion at

533
00:32:36,051 --> 00:32:39,050
the time, you know, and Nogueira back
then was the number one heavyweight,

534
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,370
the world.
Nobody had beaten him yet.

535
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,420
He was strangling everybody in the Jiu
Jitsu community. Fucking loved him.

536
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,960
Exactly.
Here's this guy was a big heavyweight,

537
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:52,280
200 3,240 pounds and he was strangling
like high level wrestlers like Mark

538
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,113
Coleman off his back.

539
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:57,710
Just was the first big guy to
have a very dangerous car. Yeah,

540
00:32:57,711 --> 00:33:01,580
he started jacking the high level
guys. Yeah, you can take it.

541
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:05,750
He can take it son.
No was the Jujitsu Savior.

542
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,160
How about new Giro Cro cop? How about
that fight. Take sit for that first route.

543
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,690
Takes it. He got took
before minute round, Bro.

544
00:33:14,691 --> 00:33:17,090
This is the,
the pride system is a 10 minute round.

545
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,270
Wasn't unusual rules was there was a
regular 10 minute round, right? Yep.

546
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:24,020
And Nogueira before
it'll get a busted out.

547
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:28,160
The whole like the general consensus in
the MMA community was the guard ain't

548
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:30,690
shit. No, no, you can't. You
can't tap guys off your back. Yet.

549
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:34,310
People believe that people
believed that the God is dead.

550
00:33:34,311 --> 00:33:36,950
People actually said that they believe
in in a large percentage of the

551
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:40,460
population. Should you see the
WC? Yes. Sued Anthony Pettis.

552
00:33:40,461 --> 00:33:45,290
How about pat about that fucking
mother? Fuck Jackie Chan. Yes,

553
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:50,200
please. Touches two rounds doing
chat. Yeah. Yeah. Real Nick Cage.

554
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,690
He does. It's effective that a
lot of guys don't like to do it.

555
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,960
Is that double roundhouse kick
Shogun does that sometimes.

556
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:00,510
I've you seen me do that one. Don't
move. That's an old school setting.

557
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:01,970
A lot of styles have it,

558
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:05,420
but that's like always thought to be
like really flashy but it's kind of high

559
00:34:05,421 --> 00:34:07,490
percentage if you can touch
them with the first kick.

560
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,320
If you hit the guy with the first kick,
the second kick is right there. Yeah.

561
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:13,130
Just most guys don't want to do that in
MMA because they're going to get taken

562
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:16,310
down. Thank God. Doesn't give a
fuck. The knee pad has is amazing.

563
00:34:16,311 --> 00:34:18,410
He's fucking guard is so nasty.

564
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,550
It's so quick like how he throws up that
trying like every time Shane roller had

565
00:34:22,551 --> 00:34:25,520
his harm in their peds threat, threatened
with a triangle, like real tight,

566
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:29,810
real tight and rollers. No
joke, no joke. Strongest fuck.

567
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:31,310
And Shane Roller tested him too.

568
00:34:31,311 --> 00:34:34,490
He clipped him up a couple of
hard times and chased him down.

569
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,670
But pet has kept his shit
together. Just fraught. SMART,

570
00:34:37,671 --> 00:34:41,660
didn't get in any silly brawls. When
he got tagged, he moved away. You know,

571
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,210
he was a great fight.
They didn't show it on the card,

572
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,370
but it was on the undercard.
I don't know why they didn't show it.

573
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:49,910
Hobby Vasquez against the Mackins. What
happened? I don't even know what to do,

574
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:53,960
Dude. Hobby Vasquez is
going to tear some ass. Oh,

575
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:58,730
he's telling me he's going to test
them as Hobby Vasquez and me grew up,

576
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,310
uh, you know, in the southern
California Jujitsu scene,

577
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:06,230
he was the most feared guy in my
division to my category. We were rivals.

578
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:10,730
I went against him four times and he
beat me all four times. He was amazing.

579
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,810
And I'm one of those four times.
I think I won. You know, it's the,

580
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,370
the match and on my DVD, but he
technically won on points, but whatever.

581
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,330
But anyways, I always knew, I knew
about explain. What do you mean?

582
00:35:23,331 --> 00:35:27,640
Why did you think you won when he won?
Well, that was the match where, uh,

583
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:31,790
I pull up, I pulled guard and he passes
my garden, puts the neon, the belly.

584
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:35,150
So that was five. Nothing right
away. And then I recovered God.

585
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,980
Then I put them right into the truck.
Now caught in the twister,

586
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:42,450
you know, I was, um, it was a five.
Nothing, but I'm a, I'm in the truck.

587
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:46,080
So you had them in the, for folks who
don't know when, when you're in the truck,

588
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:47,360
when you're in a twister,
you're,

589
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,550
you've got the guy in a very
vulnerable situation is the position.

590
00:35:50,551 --> 00:35:52,440
It's like there's a few positions did,
you did too,

591
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,960
where you're in a lot of trouble when
a guy has your back. When I got eyes,

592
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,550
your mouth for anybody
who doesn't know Jujitsu,

593
00:35:56,610 --> 00:36:00,030
but one of them that's really
weird is this position called the,

594
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:03,730
it was originally the guillotine
from wrestling, right? Yes, but um,

595
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:07,350
Eddie has turned it into a pretty high
percentage submission move for guys who

596
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:10,480
don't understand the position. Hobby
understands the position. But yeah,

597
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,650
but the referees and the rules were
not set up to think that that was a

598
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:15,120
dangerous spot.
Exactly.

599
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,880
And so he's got five nothing because he
passed my guard and putting the on the

600
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:22,380
belt and then I from from him
passing, he over committed. I took,

601
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,730
I went and put one hook in,

602
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:27,510
ended up on the truck is a guy I have to
get tapped in that position before they

603
00:36:27,511 --> 00:36:29,910
recognize that that's a dangerous
position for someone to be in.

604
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,670
If I'm trying to get to someone of,

605
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,350
I'm trying to get to a position that
we call a 10th planet Jiu Jitsu,

606
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:38,130
we call it a truck and this is a step
right before you lock a guy up in a

607
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:40,290
twister.
How many times do guys get,

608
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,510
have to get tapped from that
spot before they recognize that?

609
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:47,070
Or do you think that if there's like
a lot of like old school shit going on

610
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:50,160
where they don't want to add
any new dangerous positions?

611
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:56,330
It takes a lot of time to add the
truck to your game and to master it.

612
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,290
It takes,
a lot of times you're going to have,

613
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:01,560
the only way you're going to master
it is a, for some personal reason,

614
00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:04,620
you fall in love with it and you just
attach yourself to it and you just want to

615
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:09,621
do it or you got to have an instructor
shoving it down your throat and a in a

616
00:37:09,931 --> 00:37:13,680
curriculum that eventually, you know,
he understands is all about the numbers.

617
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,850
That's for someone developing them,

618
00:37:14,851 --> 00:37:17,070
but what I'm talking about
incorporating it into like if you,

619
00:37:17,071 --> 00:37:19,350
you have a a Jujitsu competition.

620
00:37:19,351 --> 00:37:22,830
Why or why do they not recognize
that position as a position?

621
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,370
Because not enough people are doing it,
but still if you tell,

622
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:27,870
if you explain to them
what you're trying to do,

623
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:32,040
like it seems like Jujitsu community
should be the [inaudible] position.

624
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,480
They don't understand
what, that's silly, right?

625
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,380
There's that many people are
doing it. It takes, it's v.

626
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:41,130
That's the what I was talking about.
If every few people are good at the time,

627
00:37:41,131 --> 00:37:43,560
but it's commonly
acknowledged at this point,

628
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:46,710
that's a significant submission move.
That's a real move.

629
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,550
Everybody knows a twist is a real move.
You know what,

630
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,170
it's starting to get legit now
because cut some Maura in Japan.

631
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,060
He just twisted somebody on,

632
00:37:54,061 --> 00:37:57,840
there've been four or five twisters
I think now and everybody's kind of

633
00:37:57,841 --> 00:38:00,780
acknowledged that it's a real position
and once you acknowledge it's a real

634
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:02,730
position, it's like
here, here's another one.

635
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:06,870
How about when Matt Hughes
got Ricardo Elmeda in that um,

636
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,690
that Schultz headlock, you saw
that right? It's kind of sleep.

637
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:13,200
We talked about that. Now if a
guy gets that now that had an arm,

638
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:16,800
if he knows that position, he's
like in a near submission, he,

639
00:38:16,801 --> 00:38:20,370
if he's like a mad huge type character
that was never like a near submission

640
00:38:20,371 --> 00:38:20,750
position.

641
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:24,990
It was like a position of control that
front headlock you could do their front

642
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:27,710
head lock. I mean you could
switch cars in Anaconda. Yeah,

643
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,050
there's a lot of shit there but
that's a new one. But again for,

644
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,810
for that move to really take off. I
mean, you're seeing it, you're smart guy,

645
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:34,980
you see it,
it's the jet.

646
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:39,220
But to get to that legitimacy personally
with that move is going to take a lot

647
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:41,680
of practice and people,
especially MMA fighters,

648
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:45,250
they just don't have the time to add,
to spend,

649
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:49,480
to add new techniques to their arsenals.
Yeah, they got to do kickboxing.

650
00:38:49,481 --> 00:38:52,180
They gotta run,
they got a slam tires with sledge hammers.

651
00:38:52,181 --> 00:38:55,180
I got a rug roll of pills. They
got drag logs, all that shit.

652
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,930
To add a new system to your,
your ground game,

653
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,190
you can have to find some time and
uh, you know, 20 minutes a day,

654
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:07,390
an hour a week, maybe they're
just not doing it. That's all.

655
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,640
I talked to Jake shields about this.

656
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:13,120
We had a long interview for that thing
I'm doing for ufc.com it's a thing called

657
00:39:13,121 --> 00:39:18,100
a UFC ultimate insider and
it's me interviewing a lot
of guys this week is Dana

658
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,710
White. Next week it's changed Tony.
Now that one was fucking hilarious.

659
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:24,970
But I'm interviewing Jake shields.
We talked about the idea of a specialist.

660
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:29,020
We talked about the, and I said that he,
you know, he's a specialist, you know,

661
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:32,020
Anderson Silva's specialists, Cro, cop
specialists, these guys who are really,

662
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:35,440
really good at one thing and then they
start learning the rest of the things,

663
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,050
you know, and he said that he believes
that that's the best way to go.

664
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:41,560
What do you think about that? What's
the best way to go to be a specialist?

665
00:39:41,561 --> 00:39:44,590
To be awesome at one thing instead of
trying to learn mixed martial arts,

666
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:48,700
learn Jujitsu, learn kickboxing,
learn wrestling, find one thing,

667
00:39:48,701 --> 00:39:51,190
get fucking awesome at it.
I mean,

668
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,430
are you trying to raise a
kid to become an MMA fighter?

669
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:58,710
Are you 30 years old and do you just
want to do like, no, no, no, no.

670
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,060
What I'm talking about is
what he was talking about.

671
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,320
And then they fight for MMA is that he
believes that the best way to go is to be

672
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:07,150
a specialist or something like that.
He's like,

673
00:40:07,151 --> 00:40:09,880
the level of Jujitsu that I'm at is
what he said. It's like, you know,

674
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:11,650
it's going to take these guys.
They're not,

675
00:40:11,651 --> 00:40:13,870
they're not going to reach that
level is basically what he's saying.

676
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,600
They're not there. They're not regular
training director and reach that level.

677
00:40:16,601 --> 00:40:19,600
So if it turns into a ground game, he's
always going to be able to dominate them.

678
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,420
And you know, and with the Jake
shields style, like Jake shields is a,

679
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:26,800
he's a powerful fucking dude. If he
gets guys down in a in a nasty position,

680
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:28,650
he can squash people,
you know, and he's a,

681
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,700
he's a powerful motherfuckers between
Jake shields and other wrestlers that

682
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:35,020
we've seen come and go,

683
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:40,060
is that he got really good at passing
the guard and getting to the mount and

684
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:42,310
getting to the back and mastering chokes.

685
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:47,290
He understood that that's the way
you're going to survive in this sport.

686
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:51,310
You can be a wrestler and when you
know you've been an all American,

687
00:40:51,311 --> 00:40:53,950
every goddamn ear,
maybe a champion every goddamn here,

688
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,860
if you don't learn how to
submit people and pass,

689
00:40:56,861 --> 00:41:00,380
the Guardian will never survive.
If you don't learn how to pass the guard,

690
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:03,220
you will never survive.
If you're an MMA fighter,

691
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,790
if you're not doing what George
Saint Pierre is doing, if that,

692
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:11,440
that is the ultimate game plan,
he trains and the ultimate optimal way,

693
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,630
you know, you've got to, if you're a
wrestler, if you're a wrestler college,

694
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,420
also anger and not doing what
GSP has doing after the down,

695
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:21,100
you're never gonna make it look at,

696
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:25,600
there was a school at [inaudible] school
of thought where Tito just stays in

697
00:41:25,601 --> 00:41:28,450
God's garden, smashes him from that
position and he's really good at it.

698
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,390
As far as got guys who are good
at beating guys up in the guard,

699
00:41:31,391 --> 00:41:35,850
like Prime Tito in his prime. He's one of
the very best that it's very hard gone.

700
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,330
Tito's a bad motherfucker.
But if you look at his fights,

701
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:41,550
he's not grounding and pounding anybody
in his last. He hasn't, that hasn't worn,

702
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,210
he doesn't want to do that.
He's had some real issues with his health.

703
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,820
I mean who knows how he's going to be
when it comes back. But for me again,

704
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:49,910
what about Chael Sonnen and Anderson
Silva? This, there's a perfect example,

705
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:54,450
part two or one the fight.
Yes. That's a perfect example.

706
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,860
Lingered in. The guard didn't
pass. Kayla, Shut Kale.

707
00:41:57,861 --> 00:42:02,300
Simon's been in the game at least
eight years. If from day one,

708
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:06,290
if he woulda just fell in
love with the art of passing.

709
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:10,850
It's just like the art of down. Let me
propose this just as devil's advocate.

710
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,060
What about guys who say that you know a
guy's garlic? Anderson Silva is a very,

711
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:18,260
very difficult guard to pass and Cheo was
pushing a fucking pretty furious pace.

712
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,020
What if he was thinking that this
would just expand too much energy,

713
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:23,150
worried about getting caught so
he's not even going to try to pass.

714
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,820
He's just going to hold him down and
tried to beat him up until he finds his

715
00:42:25,821 --> 00:42:27,310
opening. Well, if he, if,

716
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:32,090
if you're asking what his strategy should
have been at what point and how much

717
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:32,750
training,

718
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,770
like if he would actually worked on his
passing and master the passing and he's

719
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:38,240
been doing it for five years.

720
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,900
If he's been working on mastering passing
for five years, I go to pass his guard.

721
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,940
But if he says,
I'm about to fight Anderson Silva,

722
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,800
I haven't really been working on
passing. I'm like, staying in guard. You,

723
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,560
if you try to pass,
you're probably fuck up.

724
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,260
Just if you could stand half
guard to stay there. Don't try.

725
00:42:51,261 --> 00:42:54,910
I wouldn't advise someone to pass
if they weren't good at it. Right,

726
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,040
but I mean just for MMA,
I mean just for the sake of arguing,

727
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:01,490
you get a guy like Chael Sonnen who's this
badass wrestler. It was a power house.

728
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:04,850
One of the very best guys had taken dudes
down and beats a lot of guys up like

729
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:07,760
that first round. He stayed
inside Anderson's card and
he beat him up. You know,

730
00:43:07,761 --> 00:43:08,960
he beat him up from inside there.

731
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:11,840
[inaudible] he worked him over
and he's really good at that.

732
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:16,730
What if he thinks that he's good enough
at defending and they fucked up and made

733
00:43:16,731 --> 00:43:17,151
a mistake,

734
00:43:17,151 --> 00:43:19,760
but he's good enough at defending to do
that to the very best in the world and

735
00:43:19,761 --> 00:43:22,790
he's got it down right now.
He knows what he's doing right now.

736
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:26,450
When he starts adding a bunch of stuff
to it, like passing, he's worried about,

737
00:43:26,451 --> 00:43:27,830
you know,
maybe this will take too much energy.

738
00:43:27,831 --> 00:43:29,930
I mean just devil's advocate again,

739
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:34,970
five round fights he hasn't been working
on is this is what I would do. I'd go,

740
00:43:34,971 --> 00:43:35,540
you know what,

741
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:39,440
the rematch is coming up within six
months and you think so much time,

742
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,230
maybe a year or whatever it is.
Whatever it is. Well the, if ever,

743
00:43:42,231 --> 00:43:45,050
we don't really know if whatever
rematch. Yeah, well they might,

744
00:43:45,051 --> 00:43:46,830
they might not have it.
Okay, well we'll let,

745
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:50,090
let's assume you have to prepare
for it because he's out there.

746
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,100
People want to see it.
So you would say,

747
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:56,870
I would got to work on passing your guard
if you passing the garden like now and

748
00:43:56,871 --> 00:43:58,850
then by the time the
fight happened I would,

749
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:03,940
I would analyze his passing and if this
passing was still lacking and within a

750
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,720
year I'd go, okay, just do the same shit
you did last time. We'll try to pull it.

751
00:44:06,721 --> 00:44:10,430
So your thought is that anybody who's
as good as Chael Sonnen is at wrestling

752
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:13,190
could get that good at Jujitsu.
And be even more dominant.

753
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:16,340
Just be be a guy who could,
if you could hold you down to your guard,

754
00:44:16,341 --> 00:44:19,310
he could really mount you too. He could
really take your back to her. Look.

755
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:24,320
Liquid GSP is doing after the takedown
look Jake shields is doing after the tech

756
00:44:24,321 --> 00:44:26,090
down and look what you know.

757
00:44:26,091 --> 00:44:30,020
Even then there's wrestlers
that got really good at passing.

758
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:32,340
The guard got good at getting to the out,

759
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,750
but they haven't really mastered any
submissions yet and that will maybe now

760
00:44:36,751 --> 00:44:38,580
today, yes, but so far,

761
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,880
you know Sean Sherk is one
of the best passers in Nma.

762
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:46,140
That motherfucker was slicing through
black belts guards. He's a great passer.

763
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:50,310
He just needs to develop more. Go to
chokes. Real simple. That could happen.

764
00:44:50,311 --> 00:44:52,740
You just got to put the time
and John Fitch, same thing.

765
00:44:52,741 --> 00:44:56,610
John Fitch is out the the stage of his
development where he's getting really

766
00:44:56,611 --> 00:45:00,360
good at passing and getting that
the back and getting them out.

767
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:03,900
He just needs to keep going. Keep
working. You're, you're almost there.

768
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:07,920
Get two or three moves,
put a thousand reps in each and boom,

769
00:45:07,921 --> 00:45:12,140
they're on your in your pocket.
It's science I think doing, yeah.

770
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,420
He's just seems like development.
Yeah.

771
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,420
Eventually you're going to see John
Fitch have one or two really good

772
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:21,710
submissions that he's killing people with
and then you're like, damn, he's, it's,

773
00:45:21,711 --> 00:45:23,760
it's coming along. It's going
to take shield is already there.

774
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:27,630
He's going to be breaking guys to Jake
Shields is the furthest wrestler so far

775
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:30,090
right now in Nma.
All the wrestlers.

776
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:34,680
Jake is not only mastered passing but
Jake gets to the back beautifully,

777
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:39,180
gets to them out beautifully
and has some go to shit is good.

778
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:43,320
Teens are Badass. He's got,
uh, I mean is from hell.

779
00:45:43,321 --> 00:45:47,400
Does that crazy one arm guillotine where
you grabbed the guy's channel and you

780
00:45:47,401 --> 00:45:49,770
post out in front of his
head and he pulled it up.

781
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,800
That's Tito Ortiz used that way
back on Yuki Kondo. Remember that?

782
00:45:52,801 --> 00:45:55,530
And then Jake is still looking to
expand his game because even at the,

783
00:45:55,620 --> 00:46:00,620
at the point where Jake is the future is
going to be Jake standard after people

784
00:46:01,381 --> 00:46:01,711
see it.

785
00:46:01,711 --> 00:46:05,490
That's going to be the standard and the
people that are gonna pop through are

786
00:46:05,491 --> 00:46:09,440
the ones that not only have Jake shields,
but then they got like seven,

787
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:12,810
eight other little transitions
that end up in kills too.

788
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,100
You know that the future,
these kids that are training now,

789
00:46:17,101 --> 00:46:21,840
like those Rufo brothers, Holy Shit,
those Rory Macdonald, there's a,

790
00:46:21,841 --> 00:46:26,320
there's a perfect example. There's a dude
who grew up doing mixed martial. Yeah,

791
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:30,410
there's a lot of kids right now,
like 40 Victor Song.

792
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:35,790
Holy Shit. Adabola. He's my,

793
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,720
he does my job for the Spanish broadcast.
This is the coolest fucking guy.

794
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:43,770
He has three sons. One of them is named
Bandler lay. He's the Spanish Joe Rogan.

795
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:47,280
One of them is named Vandelay. His name
is victor is one of the greatest guys.

796
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:52,120
One of his sons are awesome. They're
just, they just worship and I may,

797
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:56,730
he's got one 10 year old son Doherty
and then he's got two younger sons,

798
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,620
like three and four that really,
really young,

799
00:46:58,621 --> 00:47:01,650
but before they could walk there
were already throwing combinations.

800
00:47:01,651 --> 00:47:05,280
He has a raising three killers and body.
Holy Shit.

801
00:47:05,281 --> 00:47:10,281
He's 10 I'm talking to a 10 year old
and he's breaking down other people's

802
00:47:11,221 --> 00:47:12,390
performance and how,

803
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:15,570
like at tournaments he's breaking down
other people's performance as well.

804
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,990
How they miss the electric chair,
why the old school didn't work.

805
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:22,670
He's pointed out chair and old
school or old techniques. Yeah, yeah.

806
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:26,930
And I'm sitting there having
a philosophical conversation
with a 10 year old.

807
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:30,010
He's a very, he's a very good
father and he's all the time with

808
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,650
his kids and he's genuinely
enthusiastic about his kids.

809
00:47:32,651 --> 00:47:36,790
He takes his son all over the place.
He's a super fucking cool human being.

810
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,380
That's not a great time with that guy.

811
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:42,640
That's when I got really into Mexico
when I got really into all this border

812
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:44,440
violence,
when I really,

813
00:47:44,441 --> 00:47:48,910
really got into it was talking to to
him because when we first met him,

814
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:51,700
he was a,
victor was living in Juarez,

815
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:55,240
which is like the bad town,
the bat border town.

816
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:57,180
And he said it was horrifying.
They say,

817
00:47:57,181 --> 00:48:01,030
I have to drive at night with their dome
light on so that people can see inside

818
00:48:01,031 --> 00:48:02,460
your car and they know there's no,

819
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:05,950
no enemy in your car because there's just
all this drug violence back and forth.

820
00:48:05,951 --> 00:48:08,490
He said it was terrifying. Yeah. And He,

821
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:12,280
it took him a long time to
get to the United States to
get to them, to move here,

822
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:13,540
to work for the UFC.

823
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:16,900
He was like working for the UFC
and then going back to Juarez,

824
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,860
just fearing for his life.
Like so close to like the,

825
00:48:20,861 --> 00:48:24,880
the perfect fucking Gig ever. He's the
guy who was a huge mixed martial arts fan.

826
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:29,560
Oh, he's always fun times. An
MMA fighter, good martial art,

827
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:33,850
martial arts school in Mexico
and he's rolled at Eddie's
Jim, uh, a gang at times.

828
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,460
He's opening up 10 planet in El Paso,
Texas.

829
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,260
That's the Spanish Joe Rogan is going
to be the head instructor to 10 pound at

830
00:48:41,261 --> 00:48:43,180
El Paso that's in the works right now.
And he's looking for,

831
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:46,600
could not meet a nicer human being.
And this guy was living when we met him,

832
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:48,220
he was living in a war zone essentially.

833
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:51,370
He's living in the middle of the
drug war zone. Solon teacher.

834
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:56,400
He translated for me in Argentina when
I did a few seminars down there and the,

835
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,550
we worked together like fucking
Abbott and Costello. Man,

836
00:49:00,551 --> 00:49:05,020
it was fucking perfect. How have this,
that's awesome because my Spanish sucks.

837
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:08,830
I need that. I would throw an
occasional Spanish here and there,

838
00:49:08,831 --> 00:49:10,970
but I didn't want to, I didn't want to
go too deep and sound like an idiot,

839
00:49:10,971 --> 00:49:14,200
so I kept in English, but victor
was right there. It was like, man,

840
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:17,620
we worked together like a broadcast team.
It's like not stepping over each other.

841
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:20,650
He knew that the punctual,
he would add some shit that I missed,

842
00:49:20,651 --> 00:49:25,240
that I would hear him
like, Damn Dude, he's a bad
motherfucker, man. What his sons,

843
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:29,500
these raising some nightmares.
Yeah,

844
00:49:29,501 --> 00:49:32,320
but very respectful and very cool.
They're not going to be thugs.

845
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:33,580
They're just going to
be a little killer's.

846
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:37,030
He's just such a nice guy and that's
the one of the coolest things about this

847
00:49:37,031 --> 00:49:40,870
job. Working for the UFC. We work with
so many cool people, man, that those,

848
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,180
those road trips are fun as
fuck. Oh yeah. That's like,

849
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:46,870
it's a giant family of like a hundred UFC,
um,

850
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:51,140
employees and everywhere you go,
like the story is,

851
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,740
I mean there's the in the cage,
everybody sees in the cage,

852
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,310
but there's so much shit
going on and allow the UFC,

853
00:49:57,311 --> 00:50:01,120
the production or the different people
that work for them when they argue with

854
00:50:01,121 --> 00:50:03,880
each other. I'm on nine.
I'm on line right now.

855
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:08,170
What the fuck do you get your shit
together? We go in five, four. I love,

856
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:13,270
I love it when the producer Bruce
Conner and or the director, Anthony,

857
00:50:13,271 --> 00:50:16,690
Jared, Donald, when they, you,
you missed a flight. I started
fucking with goalie. No,

858
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:20,120
when they start yelling at each other,
it's hilarious. They fucking goalie.

859
00:50:20,121 --> 00:50:23,920
Cause sometimes I hear Goldie literally
next to me even though he's pressing the,

860
00:50:23,921 --> 00:50:27,040
you know, the direct directly. I can
hear his voice because he's go, no,

861
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:31,000
you fuck told me I'm fuck I'm here
right now. What the fuck? Oh yeah.

862
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:34,600
I love those arguments. I just sit
in the back just dying of laughter.

863
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:37,880
Tell everybody's friendly. They're,
they're like, they like little, you know,

864
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:40,430
wives and husbands bitching at each other,
but they love each other. It's like,

865
00:50:40,431 --> 00:50:42,610
oh yeah, super, super cool relationship.

866
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,600
There's no one that goes just
fucking guys here. Again,

867
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:48,050
like there's not one guy like that.
Everyone was super fucking cool.

868
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,930
The whole crew was awesome. Everybody,
all those guys in the production.

869
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,630
It's a greatest traveling road
road show ever. I mean we're like,

870
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,180
it's like a carnival, you know,
it's like a traveling carnival now.

871
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,190
It used to be a Vegas thing
for the longest time we
were doing most of them in,

872
00:50:59,191 --> 00:51:02,030
in Vegas. Yeah. Man, I
can't believe that. Uh,

873
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:07,040
I almost walked away from it
almost. Huh? What Eddie does,

874
00:51:07,041 --> 00:51:09,640
if you don't know is Eddie when, when
the fights are going on, there's,

875
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:13,790
there's always like a really important
position and move that we want to show in.

876
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:15,230
Um,
in the replay transition.

877
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:19,730
Transitioning setups could be striking
to you cause you do that too, right?

878
00:51:19,731 --> 00:51:23,180
You don't just do not striking dental.
Need me for the striking.

879
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:25,940
I'll add my 2 cents on different angles,
but they don't need me.

880
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:29,190
What was the ground stuff?
If you watch like the one that he wasn't,

881
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:32,360
that was the one where Brock Lesnar
fought. Shane car went in the truck,

882
00:51:32,361 --> 00:51:34,370
missed this really important transition.

883
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:37,580
They missed him getting out of the
half guard and going, this is one,

884
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:41,270
this is when I quit initially I've been,
I worked for the UFC for seven years.

885
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:46,250
It's been wonderful. I love
everybody. Dana, Lorenzo,
frank, their kids, everybody.

886
00:51:46,251 --> 00:51:47,090
I love them to death.

887
00:51:47,091 --> 00:51:51,020
They're the greatest motherfuckers on the
planet for doing what they did for MMA

888
00:51:51,021 --> 00:51:53,930
in my life. I've been working with
them for seven years, you know,

889
00:51:53,931 --> 00:51:56,750
and then I thought it was
time to move on and um,

890
00:51:56,751 --> 00:52:01,700
I thought it was time to
leave the production truck
and started asking my fire.

891
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:02,930
I just want her to court,
you know,

892
00:52:02,931 --> 00:52:07,260
it's time I had guys in the main card
and they started blowing up and I'm like

893
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,460
showing them because you're going
to help truck. Right, right. Well,

894
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:11,900
we found a way to let you do both,

895
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:15,570
which is really the ideal thing because
I quit for one shot. But the, the,

896
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,640
the play by the, uh, rather the
playback, you know, the replays,

897
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:22,550
they were missing like a lot
of the transitions. If you
don't understand Jujitsu,

898
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,413
if you don't know it,

899
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,420
then you're not going to be able to pick
up what was important about a series of

900
00:52:26,421 --> 00:52:28,760
moves. All you're going to see
is, Oh, here's the checkmate,

901
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:31,610
but there's all this shit that's
going on before the checkmate.

902
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:35,320
And that's like what makes
MMA so interesting. Yeah.

903
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:37,640
You see like a guy setting
a guy up for something.

904
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,430
You see a guy goes for the single and
he grabs his leg and this is where he

905
00:52:40,431 --> 00:52:40,851
fucked up.

906
00:52:40,851 --> 00:52:43,730
He got his arm through and
here's the cinches it and
he rolls into the, you know,

907
00:52:43,731 --> 00:52:45,830
the gator roll whenever,
whenever the technique you're looking at,

908
00:52:45,831 --> 00:52:49,160
like what's cool is to be able
to see though all the steps,

909
00:52:49,161 --> 00:52:52,790
especially when it's a difficult path to
see all the cool steps that the guy had

910
00:52:52,791 --> 00:52:55,610
had to get through to get to what,
to what the final submission is.

911
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:59,240
Before I started supervising the replays,

912
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:02,600
if someone got caught in a
triangle that's a submission move,

913
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,080
the replay would be the guy
tapping and the triangle.

914
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:09,710
And I just got used to watching the
UFC. I would just rewind it, you know,

915
00:53:09,711 --> 00:53:11,540
if you want to see the setup,
you can't wait for the replay.

916
00:53:11,541 --> 00:53:15,350
You got to rewind it manually and check
out the setup. But when I started,

917
00:53:15,351 --> 00:53:17,660
you know, the guys in the
truck, they're awesome guys.

918
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:19,940
They just don't train Jujitsu.
They just, they're just not,

919
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:23,120
they just don't understand. Yeah. And
like other sports, I mean, you know,

920
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:26,070
like if you're watching a boxing match,
you really need to see

921
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,670
the combination that finished the guy
off. That's what you need to say. Yeah,

922
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,500
well the Jujitsu, it's like it's,
you're never sure where to start it.

923
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:34,680
You know it as he started here too,
while here's where he ends it.

924
00:53:34,681 --> 00:53:37,350
So let's just do it a couple of seconds
before that and then show the ending.

925
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:41,880
Yeah, yeah. Jujitsu for
people who don't know, it's,

926
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:44,230
it's one of the most
interesting things to,

927
00:53:44,231 --> 00:53:47,400
to try to learn and get good at because
it's one of the most humbling things

928
00:53:47,401 --> 00:53:51,270
where you realize that no matter what you
do, you're never going to know it all.

929
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:55,110
It's impossible. Like you can think,
you know all the punches in the world,

930
00:53:55,111 --> 00:53:57,150
you know, you can box and
you know, you, you know,

931
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:59,430
there's only a certain amount of ways
you can move your hands when you're

932
00:53:59,431 --> 00:54:01,170
hitting things with your
knuckles. You know, there's a,

933
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:04,440
there's a finite number and there's a
bunch of different combinations and a

934
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:06,960
bunch of different ways to set people
up and to hit people with things that

935
00:54:06,961 --> 00:54:10,440
aren't expecting. There's no
taking away from the art of boxing.

936
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,510
But what Jujitsu is,
it's so weird.

937
00:54:12,511 --> 00:54:15,330
It's like there's so many
positions to fuck somebody up.

938
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:19,720
There's so many ways to choke somebody
to take an arm to fuck their leg up to.

939
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:23,370
There's so many different counters.
There's so many different positions.

940
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,120
It's really never ending and that sounds
ridiculous when you tell people that

941
00:54:27,121 --> 00:54:30,420
it's never ending,
but there's always new moves.

942
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,980
I've been doing Jujitsu now
since 98 and there's always,

943
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:39,510
there's shit now that nobody had then.
Nobody was doing anything. Just changing.

944
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:42,180
It's always evolving. Yeah.
It really is like chess.

945
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:45,030
It really is like a a like a game of
chess where you're trying to kill each

946
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:49,140
other. It's like chess,
but like the chess board,

947
00:54:49,141 --> 00:54:53,670
like who's your boss? Alive grew
and it changed and always changing.

948
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:57,930
The shapes and the powers of the different
pieces always change and it's growing

949
00:54:57,931 --> 00:55:01,980
in different directions and that's what
Jujitsu, he's like, yeah, that's also,

950
00:55:01,981 --> 00:55:06,090
it's like it is like sense does make sense
because it's like it's super tactical

951
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:10,080
changes. Yeah. You might go row
with some big Chai wrestler, dude,

952
00:55:10,081 --> 00:55:12,090
you got to roll a totally different game.
You know,

953
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:14,940
you go against some Jeff Glover character
and you're going to watch your p's and

954
00:55:14,941 --> 00:55:15,271
q's.

955
00:55:15,271 --> 00:55:18,450
Then next thing you're going with some
big giant gorilla guy and kind of try to

956
00:55:18,451 --> 00:55:20,580
figure out how to attack them off your
back. There's totally different moves.

957
00:55:20,581 --> 00:55:21,930
20 different people because they're new.

958
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:26,230
There's a new moves than the
actual world of chess is there.

959
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:30,380
Cagney winds come up. Now there's
like certain long shoulders, right?

960
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,720
There's no new moves in poker. There's
no new moves would be their strategies.

961
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,840
I think they probably, they, they're,
they're creative with their strategies.

962
00:55:36,841 --> 00:55:37,230
I don't think,

963
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:39,930
I don't know chess enough to understand
how many different moves there are,

964
00:55:39,931 --> 00:55:42,360
but I understand there's like
thousands if not millions.

965
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:46,350
I know forms even chat
like it's like chess,

966
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,210
but it's different and
they have different,

967
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,080
the pieces have different powers over.

968
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:56,220
So a Chinese checkers
version of chess really,

969
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,790
or just any,
I wonder this Chinese 10

970
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,280
times a hundred like it's super
crazy and super technical.

971
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,660
Watched a video once where
the gerd was in a whole room.

972
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:09,810
He's that guy that runs that.
A website with Marcello Garcia.

973
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:14,540
Marcel Garcia has their website with
God. Josh, I forget his last name. Well,

974
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:17,130
he was in the movie searching for
Bobby Fisher was based on his life.

975
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,810
I forget Josh's last name,
forgive me,

976
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,330
but he's a brown belt
under Marcello and he, uh,

977
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:25,420
he's fanatical about Jujitsu and he talks
about Jujitsu. He was a chess master.

978
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,000
So he talks about Jujitsu the same way.
He talks about chess.

979
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:30,460
And he was talking about
playing chess at one time.

980
00:56:30,461 --> 00:56:34,480
He did a demonstration where he played
40 fucking games at the same time.

981
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:37,270
There's all these people in a room, I
think it was 40. Forgive me for them.

982
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:40,590
I have the wrong number. It's incred eat
a bunch of different games altogether.

983
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:41,650
I believe he said it was 40.

984
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:44,500
And he was wandering around this
room playing all these games.

985
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:47,500
Like you would move to the next table,
make his move, move to the next table,

986
00:56:47,501 --> 00:56:48,220
make his move.

987
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:51,730
And he said that all these things just
kind of flowed together and they all

988
00:56:51,731 --> 00:56:55,600
became one giant big game. So
yeah, if that's your answer, yeah,

989
00:56:55,601 --> 00:56:59,200
you can pay play 40 fucking different
bad start stacking your chest.

990
00:56:59,201 --> 00:57:00,880
That's a dude is taking
it to another level.

991
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:04,150
He was talking to my brain just started
hurting. I just wanted to take a nap.

992
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:08,130
I was listening to him talk about it. I
was like, I just want to take a nap at.

993
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:10,630
That dude has bad breath.
I bet he doesn't.

994
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:13,630
Everybody's fucking
perfect because a genius,

995
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:17,870
but he brushes and flosses.
He never skips a day. Uh,

996
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:21,700
and he's becoming a Jujitsu master
now too. He's obsessed with Jujitsu.

997
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,180
Can I say to him, can I plug? Is it a
good tug of pluck short seminar? Yeah.

998
00:57:25,181 --> 00:57:27,730
Where's your job?
My next seminars in Rochester,

999
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,270
it's going to be a 10th planet Rochester,
the name of the Nma academies. Empire,

1000
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:33,550
September 18th Saturday,

1001
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:38,080
September 18th my new website's up
and running. 10th Planet, J J. Dot.

1002
00:57:38,081 --> 00:57:42,640
Com three techniques till October
1st all the techniques for free,

1003
00:57:42,641 --> 00:57:45,430
the whole world can happen.
Everything that's on the website,

1004
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:49,150
so a that's till October
1st that's about it for me.

1005
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:53,440
This website or this podcast is always
a strange podcast for people who don't

1006
00:57:53,441 --> 00:57:55,030
know anything about MMA or Jujitsu.

1007
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:58,990
And you get into these conversations like
the ham sandwich in the truck and the

1008
00:57:58,991 --> 00:58:03,130
Douche bag. These are all a Jujitsu moves.
One of the funniest things about, uh,

1009
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:07,210
you know, uh, training at 10th
planet is all the moves are,

1010
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:10,840
almost all of them are ridiculously
named. I mean, some of them make sense,

1011
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:13,650
you know,
but we have quite a few ridiculous names,

1012
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:17,830
some names that I'm practicing control.
Anytime someone says that, I'm like,

1013
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:21,640
dammit. Well, there's her crack and
control, which has come up in the WEC.

1014
00:58:21,641 --> 00:58:24,720
Frank Mir had to call it crack at it
controls. Yeah, he called it. He said,

1015
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:28,760
this is what a Eddie Bravo refers to
as crack head control. Why is that?

1016
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:33,230
I can control so bad of a, well, how
about when I said rape choke when I say,

1017
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:35,740
but he got upset.
But that's what it is.

1018
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:39,550
Why is anything upsetting if that's
what it is? What crack had controlled.

1019
00:58:39,551 --> 00:58:41,030
The reason why we called
the crack and controllers,

1020
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:44,020
the idea was that it's a very
good position from the bottom.

1021
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:47,080
You've got the guy tied up
good and proper, and that was,

1022
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,720
it's a good position that you'd want
to be in if there's a crazy crack head

1023
00:58:49,721 --> 00:58:52,180
trying to beat the fuck out of you because
when you lock them up and crack head

1024
00:58:52,181 --> 00:58:54,550
control, he really doesn't have
any options to beat. He can't move.

1025
00:58:54,551 --> 00:58:57,580
He's completely helpless. So that's
why I was crying. He's tied up tight.

1026
00:58:57,670 --> 00:59:00,640
So we call it crack a control
and then there's retard control.

1027
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:03,470
If the crack had controlling
working, right. Um,

1028
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,570
torque control and crack head control,
probably around the same,

1029
00:59:07,571 --> 00:59:10,740
equal equal, but you used to think
that retard was better because of it.

1030
00:59:10,741 --> 00:59:15,000
Gable grip, maybe. I, you know,
when I should test, I should test.

1031
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,560
There's a move that's going to get done
in the octagon eventually called the

1032
00:59:17,561 --> 00:59:18,191
Douche bag.

1033
00:59:18,191 --> 00:59:20,980
And it's one of the best ways to take
a guy's arm when you're in what we call

1034
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:24,080
spiderweb. When you're in the, um,
when you're inside mount on a guy.

1035
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,950
And you're trying to attack his
arm and you've got an arm and you,

1036
00:59:26,951 --> 00:59:29,760
you're lying on your back and he's
on his back and you can't get his arm

1037
00:59:29,761 --> 00:59:31,160
straightened out.
This is awesome.

1038
00:59:31,161 --> 00:59:34,100
Move called the Douche bag where you
take your foot and he'd stick it in the

1039
00:59:34,101 --> 00:59:36,930
dude's face like a Douche bag lit right,
isn't that his neck?

1040
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,960
And then you pop it
out and it works great.

1041
00:59:38,961 --> 00:59:42,290
And eventually people are going to
figure it out and we were going to see a

1042
00:59:42,291 --> 00:59:45,920
douchebag and MMA and you know it before.
Wherever Deason happens,

1043
00:59:45,921 --> 00:59:48,770
I'm going to have to say this
is, I'm sorry, ladies and
gentlemen, hide your kids.

1044
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:51,350
This is called the Douche
bag and that's what it is.

1045
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:55,550
It's funny that Douche bag is a
bad word. That's hilarious. Well,

1046
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:57,390
it's kind of unpleasant.

1047
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:02,270
Jina cleansing device once
a clean someone's old PC.

1048
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:07,470
Well it affects women commercials. I
think it offends some women. Women.

1049
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,940
Some women just don't want you
talking about Vaginas, period dudes,

1050
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:14,660
or very rarely upset when chicks are
talking about dicks and Dick Products,

1051
01:00:14,661 --> 01:00:17,780
and even if you're making fun of the
side of the size of Dicks do's don't get

1052
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:21,650
upset. But any conversation that
a man has about a woman's vagina,

1053
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:25,430
it better either be technical. He better
be the father of her children are,

1054
01:00:25,431 --> 01:00:25,671
you know,

1055
01:00:25,671 --> 01:00:29,360
and I'm saying like you can't just talk
about chicken posties so you call up

1056
01:00:29,361 --> 01:00:31,190
Douche bag. That's something
that cleans out of posting.

1057
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:32,810
That's a fucking terrible insult.

1058
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:37,970
Don't talk about my emptiness
all of the time. It's just empty.

1059
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:41,210
There's no sac, there's no
ball. There's a whole empty, no,

1060
01:00:41,211 --> 01:00:44,720
that's a terrible way to look at it.
Emptiness. No, it's into enveloping.

1061
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:48,800
It's just love covering your cock
and it's nothing. It's not nothing.

1062
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:52,070
It's getting rid of the death thing.
It's closing in on the deck.

1063
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:56,240
It's not nothing. That's
a very significant thing.
It's a trays. That space.

1064
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:59,780
It's like a Venus flytrap. There will
be no space once the union has made.

1065
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,660
That's why a girl with a, an excellent
pussy is always going to need a deck.

1066
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:04,210
That was beautiful.
Thank you.

1067
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:10,520
He's definitely standing up for women
like I represented the fucking scumbags

1068
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:15,380
IMT brother. It's a beautiful thing.
Go like faking out the tree on you.

1069
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:16,640
It looks like it's empty,

1070
01:01:16,641 --> 01:01:21,600
but really my grandmother raised me and
she's basically my best friend and I

1071
01:01:21,601 --> 01:01:24,170
just fucking can't see you
talk about women like that man,

1072
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:25,730
that while she's still alive,

1073
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,510
that was a move that dude's would do
where they would stand up for women.

1074
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:32,090
Just just to be a con when
it didn't make any sense.

1075
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:36,200
There was one time where I was at a bar
with a cup of comics and this one dude

1076
01:01:36,201 --> 01:01:38,240
who wasn't very funny,
but he was very self righteous.

1077
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,630
These girls were drunk as fuck and
they were just being really loud and

1078
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:44,960
obnoxious at the comedy show and then
they decided to drive home and I'm like,

1079
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:48,350
oh, check out these fucking pigs. That's
what I said, you know? That's what I felt.

1080
01:01:48,351 --> 01:01:50,750
I felt like there were pigs.
There were loud angry,

1081
01:01:50,751 --> 01:01:53,600
mean chicks heckling at the comedy show
and then they were getting into a car to

1082
01:01:53,601 --> 01:01:55,100
drive home and the guy's like,
hey man,

1083
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,470
I don't want to be around you if you
want to talk about women like that,

1084
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,460
what are you talking about that
talking about women in general,

1085
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:04,940
I'm talking about these three shitty
human beings that had been yelling and

1086
01:02:04,941 --> 01:02:08,240
they're drunk as fuck and they're going
to drive and maybe slam into a fucking

1087
01:02:08,241 --> 01:02:12,140
family and you know, blow a
car up. They were heckling
in. You smashed him. Oh yeah.

1088
01:02:12,141 --> 01:02:15,400
Well I don't remember if I smashed him
cause he's are the early days of my

1089
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:18,470
heckling. Heckling skills
were not that good back then.

1090
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:21,600
This was 1991

1091
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,120
90 91 I only have been doing
comedy a couple of years.

1092
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:29,150
What do you personally think about
chail son's ability to talk shit fucking

1093
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:34,710
unprecedented. I've never seen a
professional athlete talk as much shit.

1094
01:02:34,711 --> 01:02:37,470
Get me to laugh as much.
Chill son and made me laugh.

1095
01:02:37,471 --> 01:02:40,500
More than 90% of the comedians I know
when he would start talking shit.

1096
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:45,130
How about with fucking Jim Rome? He
chill son says that he thinks that lamb,

1097
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:48,540
Lance Armstrong took drugs
and he cheated and you know,

1098
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:51,300
he took steroids and that's why
I lost the ball, the cancer.

1099
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,450
So he realizes after he said that, that
you probably shouldn't have said that.

1100
01:02:54,451 --> 01:02:56,550
Like he's saying all kinds of
crazy shit to get attention.

1101
01:02:56,590 --> 01:03:00,600
It's a fucking genius ploy. I mean, the
guy's a smart dude, right? He's running,

1102
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:04,500
he runs for office as a Republican.
He says crazy shit. Like, you know,

1103
01:03:04,501 --> 01:03:07,470
I'm a Republican and I don't lie on
my back when a man between my legs,

1104
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:10,260
like he says crazy shit like
that and it's funny. So anyway,

1105
01:03:10,261 --> 01:03:12,630
he says all this shit about Lance
Armstrong and then he realized it's fuck,

1106
01:03:12,631 --> 01:03:15,420
what do I do? What do I do?
So he brainstorms, says,
I'm just going to deny it.

1107
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:18,300
So he gets on Jim Rome show.
He goes, I did not say that.

1108
01:03:18,301 --> 01:03:21,480
Lance Armstrong and I
have known lance. I, uh,

1109
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:23,850
worked out with Lance at
the Nike Training Facility.

1110
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:26,970
It's already pleased them for the
fucking tape. And she'll send, he goes,

1111
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:29,610
maybe I have a bad connection,
but that doesn't sound like me.

1112
01:03:29,611 --> 01:03:32,420
That fell a sounded Hispanic fucking home.

1113
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,150
He's still her dude.
When he,

1114
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,280
when he gets up and does those
question and answer things,

1115
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,780
nobody's better than handle. He's, he's
got prepared material. He's good. Wow.

1116
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:47,130
He's a fucking genius man. He's the best
shit talker ever. If he won, God damn,

1117
01:03:47,131 --> 01:03:48,060
that guy would be witches.

1118
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:52,320
Fuck that guy is the UFC middleweight
champion would be the richest,

1119
01:03:52,321 --> 01:03:56,280
the biggest draw in all of MMA because
no one could talk shit like him.

1120
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,920
But Brock Lesner is always going to be
the biggest just cause he's Brock Lesner.

1121
01:03:58,921 --> 01:04:01,380
He's just fucking larger
than life monster character.

1122
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:05,250
But Chael Sonnen would be right up there
with all those Sarah Palin punch bags,

1123
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,440
all those fucking crazy
tea party assholes.

1124
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:11,390
And you think you'd have water lock on?
Yeah, I would hate it if I had to go.

1125
01:04:11,391 --> 01:04:14,760
No Shit talking contest with shell son.
And I was like, damn, this might get ugly.

1126
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:18,840
This guy's got a paddling. Shit. Got a
battle. I'm like, wow, this would be on,

1127
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:22,650
I don't know man. I wouldn't
like it. I don't like it.
That's it. That's a tough one

1128
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:25,613
I would like is there,

1129
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:28,590
is there a sport like that where he
just talks shit on someone like can just

1130
01:04:28,591 --> 01:04:29,070
come at them.

1131
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:32,790
You can just contact your mom hurt
someone you can't hurt someone here knows

1132
01:04:32,791 --> 01:04:34,140
themselves like real shit.

1133
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:38,780
Like talking like a Yo Mama show but
you're really required and shit talking

1134
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:41,940
really is is calling somebody out on
something or getting somebody on some shit

1135
01:04:41,941 --> 01:04:42,780
that they're not addressing.

1136
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:45,180
But if you are addressing
everything and you're honest,

1137
01:04:45,210 --> 01:04:47,790
it's very hard to talk shit on someone
who was pretty honest about themselves

1138
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,820
cause you talk shit on like a,
like a good comic, you know,

1139
01:04:50,821 --> 01:04:52,710
Talk Shit on a Doug Stan
hope or something like that.

1140
01:04:52,711 --> 01:04:57,030
Doug will tell you what's wrong with
him a hundred times worse than you could

1141
01:04:57,031 --> 01:04:59,820
ever tell him what's wrong with
you and then he'll fuck with you.

1142
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:04,140
Like if you pick on like Doug, Doug will
go, you know about being an alcoholic.

1143
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:04,381
Doug,

1144
01:05:04,381 --> 01:05:08,400
we'll go deep into how fucking crazy he
has deep into what's wrong with being an

1145
01:05:08,401 --> 01:05:12,480
alcoholic. Deep into how wiki fields, when
he takes that six beer of the morning,

1146
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,070
he'll go deep into it and
then he'll turn on you.

1147
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:18,160
You'll fuck cause he just took away.

1148
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:20,770
You're not going to say anything
better than what he said about himself.

1149
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:24,100
And then he's going to shred you cause
he's a hundred times smarter than you and

1150
01:05:24,101 --> 01:05:26,500
he's done this everyday of his
life for the last 20 years.

1151
01:05:27,610 --> 01:05:30,790
It's really like doing Jujitsu against a
white belt. It's like ever take a break.

1152
01:05:30,791 --> 01:05:34,360
I don't think monster dogs. Yeah, he
takes a little breaks. He goes to Bisbee.

1153
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:36,980
He's been talking about moving to
Austin, Texas. We're talking about Doug,

1154
01:05:36,981 --> 01:05:39,820
Stan hope, fantastic comedian
and good friend of mine.

1155
01:05:39,821 --> 01:05:42,580
And we were cohosts on one of
the worst shows on television,

1156
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,140
the second version of the man show.

1157
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:48,490
A couple of haters on the internet or on
a thread about my website or something

1158
01:05:48,491 --> 01:05:50,350
like that.
And one guy comes on and says,

1159
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:55,590
why don't you post his match with Leo
Vira to ask to watch a real ass whipping

1160
01:05:55,811 --> 01:05:57,820
or something like that. How
come he doesn't post that? Oh,

1161
01:05:57,821 --> 01:06:00,340
this is your match with Leo
Vieira. Yeah. And I'm like, dude,

1162
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:03,940
why don't you check out
the intro to my DVD? I,

1163
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:07,930
I show me getting fucked up. I put it on
my intro. Dude, why don't you watch that?

1164
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,210
That's funny. How many
people do that is, um,

1165
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:14,340
drug Galinos speaking of which is fighting
tonight. He's on the strike force.

1166
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:18,670
Yeah, he's, he's making a comeback.
How old is that dude? You know what?

1167
01:06:18,671 --> 01:06:20,800
I didn't even know I
heard about Broccolini.

1168
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:24,250
My whole like a whole
Jujitsu crew shock stage.

1169
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:28,390
Someone 42 or something and he's not
that old. Okay. How old John Shock? Yeah.

1170
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:30,190
I guess John Talks about 42 as well.

1171
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:33,970
And I didn't know who the whole seeing
all these old school Jujitsu guys.

1172
01:06:33,971 --> 01:06:36,140
It's cool seeing all these good
guys and, oh, and you know what?

1173
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:38,860
Who the fuck if there's another fight
that just got announced that it's a

1174
01:06:38,861 --> 01:06:42,740
fucking awesome fight. Oh,
Efrain Escudero is fighting that.

1175
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:46,690
That sick Jujitsu kid, who's that kid
who just fought recently on versus

1176
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:52,330
the Brazilian, Really Young
Kid, 20 years old, hot, which

1177
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:58,720
I don't know who this is. What some
of you folks out there in la La land,

1178
01:06:58,721 --> 01:07:00,310
you know who it is?
Put that shit up on Twitter.

1179
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,320
I don't know what the guy's name was,
but anyway,

1180
01:07:02,321 --> 01:07:06,250
he's going to fight Efrain in Austin,
Texas. See Spikes in Austin. Yeah.

1181
01:07:06,251 --> 01:07:10,240
There's a couple of Brazilians coming
out on the prelims that people don't get

1182
01:07:10,241 --> 01:07:11,950
to watch generally.
Sometimes they throw them up,

1183
01:07:11,951 --> 01:07:13,780
but I think I know you're talking about,

1184
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:17,620
there's a couple of lightweight
Brazilians that are on fire right now.

1185
01:07:17,621 --> 01:07:21,130
I forget their names though.
Yeah, I forget the dude's
name. I think one is like,

1186
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:25,680
like Charles Oliva Charles all the
bat. Is it that? Is that dude? Okay.

1187
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,570
That's exactly the kid we're
talking about and he submitted,

1188
01:07:28,571 --> 01:07:32,710
who the hell are they submit?
I forget. God was good though.

1189
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:37,000
He locked him up quick. Anyway,
dude, I'm the worst fucking

1190
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:42,040
the worst with, there's so many different
names are so many different dudes.

1191
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:46,960
I want to give a quick shout out to Matt
Horowitz for choking out Talis latest

1192
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:50,200
last week. For those of you who missed
it, it was the biggest win of his career.

1193
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:53,740
Nobody deserves it more than Matt.
He works harder than anybody I know.

1194
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,400
And he has, you know, no one has
an open mind like a Matt Horwood.

1195
01:07:57,401 --> 01:08:01,430
So I love you man. If you don't
know who Matt Horwitz was, Mara,

1196
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:05,380
which is one of the weirdest guys
ever that's fighting. And he uh,

1197
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:10,120
he was in the UFC for a bit and lost a
couple of squeaky close decisions and got

1198
01:08:10,121 --> 01:08:14,260
the boot, but he's just the strangest,
coolest, nicest, friendliest guy.

1199
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:16,040
And every time you talk to him it's like,
well,

1200
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:21,070
the universe is a beautiful place and
stars and galaxies are all connected

1201
01:08:22,851 --> 01:08:24,580
together and one,
uh,

1202
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:29,270
timely pulse all bringing us
closer to love and to the future.

1203
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:33,890
Yeah. And you're like, oh, okay. All
right man. He's like, but he believes it.

1204
01:08:33,891 --> 01:08:36,350
Like he says shit like that.
Like that's really what's on his mind.

1205
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:40,160
The Universe is a beautiful thing.
Fucking who has,

1206
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:43,670
who has less ego than that guy? No
one. He has zero ego and his ground,

1207
01:08:43,671 --> 01:08:45,470
I mean this standup needs
a lot of work still,

1208
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:50,120
but his wrestling and his Jujitsu
especially is looking dangerous.

1209
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:51,561
He didn't tell us late,

1210
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:54,110
does not just to catch him and
take his back and strangle him,

1211
01:08:54,111 --> 01:08:57,530
but to put them in bad positions
over and over again and survive.

1212
01:08:57,531 --> 01:09:00,050
When he was in that arm trial,
he had his back a couple of times.

1213
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,290
He had him in the Juke
claw. He, he, he did great.

1214
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:06,260
[inaudible] did not expect him
to be that good on the ground.

1215
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:08,570
I think he underestimated
how good his ground game his,

1216
01:09:08,571 --> 01:09:10,700
I think he looked at some other fights
and he thought he was gonna be able to

1217
01:09:10,701 --> 01:09:14,000
stale mate with them in the ground.
But you know, Harwich just attacks.

1218
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:18,290
He attacks his fucking guard looks
so good. Matt, when he went to that,

1219
01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:21,140
the Hayzlett,
which is the move off the Omoplata,

1220
01:09:21,141 --> 01:09:25,670
which is a shoulder lock
rolling with him is amazing.

1221
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:26,660
He calls out,

1222
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:30,550
like in every position he'll call
out and we'll talk about what the,

1223
01:09:30,590 --> 01:09:31,940
what's going on in the position,

1224
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:36,570
what he should do and what I'm
gonna do those whales right now,

1225
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:40,250
he's got me in crack at control. He's
trying to get my hand to the mat. Oh,

1226
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,220
dissolve B work.

1227
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:44,980
And now he's probably going to try to
clear my neck and get me in to invisible

1228
01:09:44,990 --> 01:09:48,430
call. I should probably keep my
posture up. I mean he'll know.

1229
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:52,890
Narrate the whole role. It's
incredible. Yeah. He's uh,

1230
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:56,780
maybe he does that all the time. I want
to give a shout out to the frogmouth owl.

1231
01:09:57,050 --> 01:10:01,100
The frog mouth. Did you find it? Yes. The
pup on frog now, is that what it's called?

1232
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:05,480
Yeah. Did you get a picture of
it? A p. U. A. N. A. P. U. A. N.

1233
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:07,100
This is what we were talking
about earlier in the show,

1234
01:10:07,101 --> 01:10:09,980
ladies and gentlemen is fucking Mexican.
Which p you what?

1235
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:15,160
P? A. P. U. A. N. Frogmouth.

1236
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:22,920
So if I can give a shout out to Tyrone to,
what does that mean,

1237
01:10:23,070 --> 01:10:26,940
Tyron? Oh, well, here's the thing. Okay.
It doesn't really look like that. No,

1238
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:29,173
not really.

1239
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,770
I mean it looks weird but it doesn't look
nearly as weird as the one that was in

1240
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:36,830
that video. Look, this just looks
like a fucked up like an hour.

1241
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:42,110
Maybe the one was just an extreme
version of it. Yeah, it's kind of like a,

1242
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,330
I don't know if you saw that picture
that's floating around right now,

1243
01:10:44,331 --> 01:10:47,960
that pig that looks like the faces
like gotten in a car accident,

1244
01:10:47,961 --> 01:10:51,350
but that's actually what the face looks
like. It looks speak in a car accident.

1245
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:52,760
Heidi montages,

1246
01:10:52,761 --> 01:10:57,590
plastic surgeon died this
week cause he was twittering.

1247
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:01,130
That's about his dog and he fell off
a cliff. That was his last Twitter.

1248
01:11:01,131 --> 01:11:01,950
It was last quarter,

1249
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:04,420
if that was his last Twitter was
right before he fell off the car.

1250
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:08,840
He was on top of a mountain with his
dog and he took this photo of a his dog

1251
01:11:08,841 --> 01:11:13,841
like overlooking this sweet like hill
on PCH and that was his last Twitter.

1252
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:17,310
And then he, uh, something happened
where he fell off the side of the road,

1253
01:11:17,311 --> 01:11:19,140
probably involving a
cell phone, but, well,

1254
01:11:19,190 --> 01:11:21,780
how do you know that it wasn't everyone's
saying that he was twittering right

1255
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:22,710
when the crash happened,

1256
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:25,140
which most likely he was twittering
and he fell off the cliff.

1257
01:11:25,141 --> 01:11:26,330
You don't just fall off the exact,

1258
01:11:26,340 --> 01:11:29,970
the exact quote was moments before he
twittered and then they showed that.

1259
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,220
So you say no.
What are you saying?

1260
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:33,990
I don't think he was
twittering while I was driving.

1261
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:36,100
Is that what you're saying? She
was, what are you talking about?

1262
01:11:36,101 --> 01:11:39,580
What other explanation do
you have for the [inaudible]?

1263
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:43,180
You show crazy, Brian. You just argued
that you don't even have any evidence.

1264
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:44,200
Of course he was doing,

1265
01:11:44,201 --> 01:11:49,190
what's your evidence
[inaudible] off a cliff?

1266
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:52,810
The evidence is he twittered
when he was in his car. Right.

1267
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:55,540
That means he was driving and
twittering for sure. Okay.

1268
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:59,350
If you're in your car and that's when the
Twitter goes off and it's right before

1269
01:11:59,351 --> 01:12:00,940
you crash the fucking,
but he's saying,

1270
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:04,240
he's saying how do you prove that the
trial wasn't right before he got what

1271
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:07,010
calls? No, no,

1272
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:09,700
so so the proof is he drove off the cliff.

1273
01:12:10,450 --> 01:12:15,100
That's the proof is in the moments here
earlier, he was triggered that together.

1274
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:20,530
Even if the Twitter making the Twitter
didn't cause him to drive off the cliff,

1275
01:12:20,531 --> 01:12:25,531
the type of person that would be in his
fucking car twittering about his dog,

1276
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:29,290
that type of person is not
paying attention and if
it's not that it's going to

1277
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:29,920
be something else.

1278
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,310
It's going to be him trying to make a
phone call or him getting a phone call or

1279
01:12:33,311 --> 01:12:37,390
him changing the station or him looking
for something on the navigation system.

1280
01:12:37,391 --> 01:12:41,890
He's a fucking idiot or he would have
a lot of hatred for this guy that died.

1281
01:12:41,891 --> 01:12:46,810
That Twitter makes me crazy when I
see people texting and twittering when

1282
01:12:46,811 --> 01:12:48,370
they're driving,
it drives me nuts.

1283
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,710
Some fucking lady did this
when she was working for,

1284
01:12:50,711 --> 01:12:52,690
to the Improv and she was
taking me to the publicity.

1285
01:12:52,691 --> 01:12:56,230
She was a very nice lady and in
the middle of fucking the highway,

1286
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:01,440
this bitch starts steering with her
knees to hands on under the texting.

1287
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:04,780
I go, hey, hey, hey, you got to
stop. Like you can't do it. She goes,

1288
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:06,010
I'm really good at this.
I'm like,

1289
01:13:06,011 --> 01:13:09,880
the fuck you are the fuck you really
good at this? Like stop. Pull over.

1290
01:13:09,881 --> 01:13:13,990
Get me out of the car. There's no way
you're not paying attention. That's nuts.

1291
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,780
You're going to have two hands
off the fucking steering wheel.

1292
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:18,820
You're going to be steering with
your knees while you do this.

1293
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:21,520
She just touching it with her knuckles,

1294
01:13:21,670 --> 01:13:23,800
like kind of like sort
of steering like this.

1295
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:26,200
If you're going to text while you drive,
you got to do it with one hand.

1296
01:13:26,201 --> 01:13:29,830
You can come on. What the fuck
are you thinking? You know what?

1297
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:32,260
I'll be honest with you,
man. I'll be honest with you.

1298
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:36,570
I text through fucking Mulholland.
Ah.

1299
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:41,590
I tend to go into my hall and
stoned as fuck. Stop doing that. No,

1300
01:13:41,591 --> 01:13:44,610
no. I'm listening to is what you
gotta do, man, is what you gotta do.

1301
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:47,740
That's what I do when I get in my car.
I throw my fucking phone in the seat.

1302
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:50,720
I don't even look at that shit. And if
it, if it rings, it goes through the boot,

1303
01:13:50,721 --> 01:13:54,340
your system. If it rings, I can press a
button and talk to somebody, but I don't,

1304
01:13:54,341 --> 01:13:57,100
I don't fuck with
[inaudible] like this in La.

1305
01:13:57,101 --> 01:14:01,150
It's way different than it is in your,
like this probably is because you did it.

1306
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:01,570
There was,

1307
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:04,720
there were times that you did do it and
you fucking looked up and you're on the

1308
01:14:04,721 --> 01:14:06,580
other side of the fucking road.
Well, I've never done that.

1309
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:09,670
Never got to those points. No,
I've never done that. But there's,

1310
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:12,130
I don't like the temptation to do

1311
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:14,650
it because when I'm at home and
my phone is just sitting there,

1312
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:17,140
I want to check Twitter, but I'll
find myself checking Twitter. I,

1313
01:14:17,141 --> 01:14:19,120
there's a million things
that I should be doing,

1314
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:21,820
but because I have the access to it,
because it's right there,

1315
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,940
it's very hard to avoid. For me.
I'm very indulgent like that.

1316
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:28,680
So I don't want to be in my car, like
looking through Twitter. I know me, I,

1317
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:32,380
I would do it. I would start
replying to people in Ohio though.

1318
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:35,230
That driving was so boring
that you could read a book.

1319
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:37,690
Seriously do that because
anything can happen.

1320
01:14:37,691 --> 01:14:40,090
I try to time it and red
lights led lights them up.

1321
01:14:40,091 --> 01:14:41,650
12 you can get one out at a red light.

1322
01:14:41,651 --> 01:14:44,800
That's totally off the record as long
as long as you're not doing it while

1323
01:14:44,801 --> 01:14:47,350
you're actually driving. They'll
try to finish the last three words.

1324
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:49,080
Just call you the last three words.
We're almost there.

1325
01:14:49,081 --> 01:14:52,480
We're almost there and then you're
driving. Dude. It's, it's very dangerous.

1326
01:14:52,481 --> 01:14:56,770
They got to have voice activated.
They do. That's the future they do.

1327
01:14:56,771 --> 01:15:00,970
Then the Android, the new android system.
Apparently it works not just for that.

1328
01:15:00,971 --> 01:15:03,430
It works for navigation and worked
for a bunch of different things.

1329
01:15:03,431 --> 01:15:07,450
You can write notes to yourself. Iphone
is going to handle that shit. Maybe. Well,

1330
01:15:07,451 --> 01:15:09,610
you know what I phone does a
lot of cool shit that I like.

1331
01:15:09,611 --> 01:15:14,380
I liked the fact that you can record
notes. The the, the little recording icon,

1332
01:15:14,381 --> 01:15:17,620
what is it called? Can I see your
notes? The one that's on the front page,

1333
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:22,000
record voice memos. Voice memos and that
shit. That's what it is. And voice memos.

1334
01:15:22,001 --> 01:15:23,230
Keys up to your computer.

1335
01:15:23,231 --> 01:15:27,730
So I record shows and then I'll have to
do is stick it into my computer or if I

1336
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:29,470
have an idea I recorded on that,

1337
01:15:29,471 --> 01:15:32,410
I stick it into my computer and I have a
record of it and then I back it up with

1338
01:15:32,411 --> 01:15:35,000
mobile meme. It's like you can't fuck
with that. Convenient really quick.

1339
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:38,590
It's the convenience you could
have if you want it to. Yeah,

1340
01:15:38,591 --> 01:15:42,630
I mean if you want to make a really shitty
CD and release it for free, this car,

1341
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:46,120
you can drive around and listen
to it unless you got it all.

1342
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:50,560
Know Apple does a lot of cool shit,
but this Google android man, those,

1343
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:52,210
those fucking things are coming close man.

1344
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,760
They've got a lot of cool new
features that apple doesn't have yet.

1345
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:59,830
Does iPhone or apple, do they make
like a, like a Badass car system?

1346
01:15:59,831 --> 01:16:04,240
That is, no, that's a good middle
of the Red Apple Car Stereo too.

1347
01:16:04,241 --> 01:16:06,700
That would be the shit.
Well you kind of already have line.

1348
01:16:06,701 --> 01:16:10,350
It's called the iPhone. I don't use
that at the same way. You don't,

1349
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:13,900
can't just put down,
I mean, yeah, you can,

1350
01:16:13,901 --> 01:16:16,390
can't just tell it like my Lexus,

1351
01:16:16,391 --> 01:16:19,420
I can just press a button and tell
it where I want to go. I could say,

1352
01:16:19,421 --> 01:16:23,560
you know Irvine well yeah,
using gps software on the iPhone.

1353
01:16:23,561 --> 01:16:25,330
I have navigation where it has like,
you know,

1354
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:28,030
but you have to touch your phone off
to just touch a button on the steering

1355
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:28,510
wheel.

1356
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:31,360
If we could get it so that everything
was voice operated and you didn't have to

1357
01:16:31,361 --> 01:16:33,370
take your hand off the steering
wheel ever. That would be the move.

1358
01:16:33,371 --> 01:16:34,030
The problem with the Va,

1359
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:37,270
the iPhone is you've got to fuck around
with this little tiny device and focus

1360
01:16:37,271 --> 01:16:41,050
on this little thing that's right in front
of you as opposed to this whole world

1361
01:16:41,051 --> 01:16:43,270
that's you're headed towards
you going 70 miles an hour.

1362
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:45,340
That's what fucks you up
about driving and texting.

1363
01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:48,190
You focus on this little thing and
then every time you look up you have to

1364
01:16:48,191 --> 01:16:52,870
regain all your bearings.
Is that

1365
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:59,500
we've accepted, um, talking while we're
driving. You know what the other one,

1366
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:04,090
if he got a headset or you got to assist
system like yours, we're allowing that.

1367
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:06,100
As long as you got your eyes on the road,

1368
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:10,160
you can talk because then they would
have to outlaw talking the guy sitting

1369
01:17:10,161 --> 01:17:12,950
shotgun, right? Like you
can't talk in the car.

1370
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:15,500
And the worst thing when dad's in that,
if you couldn't talk in your car,

1371
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:18,800
it was too dangerous. When you have
it over your loud stereo systems,

1372
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:20,810
it's like you're in their rural listening.

1373
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:24,530
So if they're downtown and it's like busy
or you wouldn't be allowed to sing to

1374
01:17:24,531 --> 01:17:27,980
a song, um, I listened.
It should be blown.

1375
01:17:27,981 --> 01:17:30,240
I talked to [inaudible] on my phone
all the time. She just started.

1376
01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:33,110
I don't think it's any different than
me having a person in the car that I'm

1377
01:17:33,111 --> 01:17:34,940
having a conversation with.
What about,

1378
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:40,270
what about outlawing plan drums on your
steering wheel? Doesn't do that, right?

1379
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:43,060
They're going to have to outlaw that
shit, right? You're not fully controlled.

1380
01:17:43,061 --> 01:17:45,860
The vehicle cop can pull your hopes,
your fucking listening to some rock.

1381
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:48,290
You don't have to have two hands
on the steering wheel, right.

1382
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,670
You don't even have to have two hands.

1383
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:51,610
You don't have to be 10 and
two you have to be seatbelt.

1384
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:53,810
And that's about it really.
I never really knew.

1385
01:17:53,811 --> 01:17:55,700
I mean they assume that you're
going to control the vehicle,

1386
01:17:55,701 --> 01:17:57,830
but I don't think that you have
to control in any particular way.

1387
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,680
If you want to get fruity and have like
a little ring that you stick your finger

1388
01:18:00,681 --> 01:18:02,120
through and drive around town like this,

1389
01:18:02,121 --> 01:18:06,160
you can't wear shades while you
drive all the suicide wheel.

1390
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:09,380
Do you remember a thing called the
suicide wheel? When I was a kid, well,

1391
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:13,070
you know a couple of dudes who had hot
rods had a little thing called a suicide

1392
01:18:13,071 --> 01:18:17,150
wheel and it was just like a little tiny
wheel that was on the steering wheel.

1393
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:20,210
And you would, you would steer
with this little tiny wheel.

1394
01:18:20,211 --> 01:18:23,120
But that wheel spun
itself. Yeah. So like you,

1395
01:18:23,121 --> 01:18:25,910
this fucking car would spin all over
the place holding on to this thing.

1396
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:30,980
They called it a suicide wheel. That's
crazy. I think that's the Cholo thing. No,

1397
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:34,090
no. Hot Rod steering wheels.
When I was a kid, I a chain,

1398
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:34,960
you know the little chains,

1399
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:40,370
all any of my friends want wanted was
one of those fucking stupid old American

1400
01:18:40,701 --> 01:18:44,300
hot rods. That's all anybody wanted.
All my old cars, my first cars,

1401
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:48,530
my first car was a 1973 Chevelle
and then I had a 68 four, four,

1402
01:18:48,531 --> 01:18:52,940
two and then I had a Buick
Skylark and I had a Chevelle all,

1403
01:18:53,010 --> 01:18:56,330
all and a Barracuda.
All my cars were like old hot rods.

1404
01:18:56,770 --> 01:19:00,710
All of a sudden I think them
changed still also the fucking dope.

1405
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:04,810
Those old cars, man, they suck.
Like my Barracuda sucks driving it.

1406
01:19:04,811 --> 01:19:08,570
It's the handle like shit. They're,
they're totally dangerous. They don't,

1407
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:12,350
they don't break as well as very, cause
they're super, super heavy. You know,

1408
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:16,430
there's this, it's like a
really antiquated sort of a
way of constructing a car.

1409
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,670
But,
but there's something about a man,

1410
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:22,880
there's something about those cars to
rappers bling out their steering wheel

1411
01:19:22,881 --> 01:19:23,714
ever. Totally. Yeah.

1412
01:19:24,110 --> 01:19:28,340
Diamonds on their standing tall kinds
of bees on their steering wheel. Man.

1413
01:19:28,650 --> 01:19:32,360
You can watch movies on their stand
where ever watched MTV cribs nine I the

1414
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:36,980
steering wheels on there fucking with a
big like seven inch screen where they're

1415
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:41,600
watching videos on their steering wheel.
That should be illegal, not illegal.

1416
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:45,090
Can fucking town driving around some
other joint watched Scarface had you

1417
01:19:45,091 --> 01:19:46,390
fucking steering wheel off.

1418
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:51,050
It's bad that Eddie Bravo's texted this
motherfucker's watching scar face for

1419
01:19:51,051 --> 01:19:52,250
the 1 billion of time.

1420
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:56,850
That was like the best episode of curb
my enthusiasm when I'm crazy eyes. Kyla,

1421
01:19:56,990 --> 01:20:00,110
you remember when Larry David met crazy
eyes killer and he had him over the

1422
01:20:00,111 --> 01:20:04,090
house. He's explaining this floor
is my floor is made out of some,

1423
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:08,040
some flow of shit, so I'm just, we got
a big flat screen. We play Ska phase

1424
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:08,970
24 hours a day,

1425
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:13,971
like 24 seven do you ever see the one
where he gets caught with a hooker while

1426
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:17,460
an weed in the car? No. That's the
best way I saw that one. That's,

1427
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:21,870
that's a good one. Yeah, the old
ones. The best ones because a genius,

1428
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:23,640
it's not that many dudes like that.

1429
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:27,780
It's so hard to get really good at
making those kinds of comedies. You know,

1430
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:30,030
it's like every time there's
a new sit comments out, she's,

1431
01:20:30,031 --> 01:20:32,070
I want to give it a shot.
I want to give him a chance.

1432
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:37,440
But how many people are good at that? You
know, so hard. Especially on regular TV.

1433
01:20:37,441 --> 01:20:40,290
It's so hard to do anything
controversial on regular TV.

1434
01:20:40,291 --> 01:20:44,100
Now have you heard bait car? What does
that then they show bait car bait car.

1435
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:47,340
Yeah. It's where spell it
[inaudible] see ar. Yeah.

1436
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:49,200
It's where they take a
car and they set it up.

1437
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:51,950
They've done it in like cops before
where they take it and set it up and then

1438
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:56,390
like these people go to steal it and
everything locks. I saw that. Good.

1439
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:59,930
It sounds great. That's a great
pitch. But they can't, um,

1440
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:01,830
they don't want to go
on high speed chases.

1441
01:21:01,831 --> 01:21:04,410
So what they do is they just turn off
the car. Yeah. But that's kind of cool.

1442
01:21:04,690 --> 01:21:07,660
Just pull that trapped in cars like that
though. I don't want a high speed chase.

1443
01:21:07,661 --> 01:21:12,530
Yeah. Slamming into some fucking kids.
Chase, man. No, it's not. What I tivo

1444
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:19,260
watched one, I go, I erased all that
shit. Like, oh, this is boring. Tivo.

1445
01:21:19,261 --> 01:21:23,080
Steven Seagal law man. No.
Oh, you've got off. Yes.

1446
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:26,520
You've got to get that on DVD or
get it on iTunes. You gotta get it.

1447
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:31,290
You got to get it. It's Jeevan Seagal.
He's a real cop. Steven Seagal was a cop.

1448
01:21:31,740 --> 01:21:34,800
That's incredible.
Now what do you think,

1449
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:38,370
what do you think about Anderson
Silva walking out at Stevenson,

1450
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:43,050
I think as a seal was awesome.
It was a co like a funny thing.

1451
01:21:43,070 --> 01:21:46,290
If it was, he will never tell
you. He would never admit it,

1452
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,630
but we are like a genuine fan too.

1453
01:21:48,631 --> 01:21:51,600
When I went to interview Anderson
Silva at Black House and Silva,

1454
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:53,310
I'm not bullshitting for a half an hour,

1455
01:21:53,311 --> 01:21:56,720
was in character as Helio Gracie
for half an hour. I would love to.

1456
01:21:56,750 --> 01:22:01,260
They said that he had done it for the
last two hours and he was yelling Jujitsu

1457
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:06,960
and he starts talking in Portuguese,

1458
01:22:06,961 --> 01:22:09,180
all these different things
yelling out and he's doing it.

1459
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:12,870
No bullshit for 30 fucking straight
minutes. He's a, he's a joker.

1460
01:22:12,871 --> 01:22:16,320
Man thinks everything is funny.
That guy has always playing around.

1461
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:19,690
So what do you think Steven Seagal thought
you thought he was like, damn it was,

1462
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:20,520
he honored like Shit.

1463
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,220
He really wants me badly think
to Anissa Silva's taking notes.

1464
01:22:23,221 --> 01:22:25,300
Why Steven Seagal is telling
him how to kick people in India.

1465
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:27,810
That's the dumbest thing in the world.

1466
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:32,070
The Anderson Silva may very well be the
greatest fighter that has ever graced

1467
01:22:32,071 --> 01:22:33,420
the face of the planet.

1468
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:38,550
There may not be another guy ever that
has ever lived that is on that guy skill

1469
01:22:38,551 --> 01:22:41,370
level. And that's no bullshit.
That's, that's some real shit.

1470
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,920
And you really think that he
wants to listen to Steven Seagal,

1471
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:47,320
tell him in a twist wrist and shit.
That's crazy shit. That's his,

1472
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:50,070
he was going to do it. Someone's got
to walk out with fucking Chet leads.

1473
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:54,360
It's funny, but I think he
probably respected him as
a martial arts maybe. Look,

1474
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:57,450
people can tell you all kinds of
things and they might be retarded.

1475
01:22:57,451 --> 01:22:58,410
They might be half crazy,

1476
01:22:58,411 --> 01:23:01,380
but every now and then they'll say
something that you can use. You know,

1477
01:23:01,381 --> 01:23:04,320
every now and then p I've had a lot of
dumb people say some really useful shit

1478
01:23:04,321 --> 01:23:07,810
to me. I just, it's like a matter of
being able to cherry pick that out of the,

1479
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:12,700
out of the other diarrhea they're spewing
man with all the crazy techniques that

1480
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:15,370
are being proven that were
once thought of as jokes.

1481
01:23:15,371 --> 01:23:16,630
Like we were talking about this before,

1482
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:20,440
all the weird shit at first we never
thought that head kicks whatever work and

1483
01:23:20,441 --> 01:23:24,310
then you know Marco, who else? Uh Oh
no, no. Margolis was the leg kicks,

1484
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:28,240
leg kicks in work mark who ask him prove
that now everyone liked kicks, judo,

1485
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:30,550
judo before Caro and then there was no,

1486
01:23:30,610 --> 01:23:34,510
there was no head of was Judah shall
we spent was the first guy to head kick

1487
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:38,140
everyone. At one point we thought
head kicks would never work.

1488
01:23:38,350 --> 01:23:40,810
They would never work in real fights
like that was all for the movies.

1489
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:44,230
No one kicked anybody. They had that
you're going to get taken down there.

1490
01:23:44,231 --> 01:23:44,950
Low percentage.

1491
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:47,650
Now people are not getting knocked off
a bunch of different things and then

1492
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:52,570
those balls that the new one is done.
Yeah. Kuda kicking with the front kick.

1493
01:23:52,571 --> 01:23:57,310
We thought those kicks were jokes like
a few years ago and now have never did

1494
01:23:57,311 --> 01:24:00,670
because semi shield has been taking guys
out with that in k one forever and I

1495
01:24:00,671 --> 01:24:04,510
think most people look at the fact that
he was so tall like that's why they work.

1496
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:07,210
That's what I thought. I go,
you know what? He's so tall.

1497
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:09,550
He's making these weird kicks work.
He's just going to poke people.

1498
01:24:09,551 --> 01:24:10,540
I didn't quite think that.

1499
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:13,600
I thought it was real because he uses
it on high level guys and most people

1500
01:24:13,601 --> 01:24:15,190
thought Badr Hari with that.

1501
01:24:15,310 --> 01:24:18,010
Most of the stuff on those
traditional karate kicks were a joke.

1502
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:20,620
Do you know there's a thread
where people are fighters?

1503
01:24:20,621 --> 01:24:23,380
Only magazine said that he's going to
come back to the UFC and he's talking

1504
01:24:23,381 --> 01:24:27,130
about, I read that, I don't know, and
then make to 65 and then the latest huge.

1505
01:24:27,131 --> 01:24:31,630
Now we've had turning sidekicks
proven turning like Kung Lee.

1506
01:24:31,631 --> 01:24:34,990
He's proving the turning side kicks are
legit after other people have done it

1507
01:24:34,991 --> 01:24:36,280
too.
But now it's totally legit.

1508
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:40,580
Now you've got Anthony Pettis doing
the fucking Jackie Chan kicks. Yeah,

1509
01:24:40,581 --> 01:24:43,540
they're crazy kick that he did was he
came down literally where he was like

1510
01:24:43,541 --> 01:24:47,690
touching the ground and kicked like
a split over his head and, and, and,

1511
01:24:47,691 --> 01:24:50,770
and fucking caught Shane Roller. It was
one of the craziest kicks I've ever sold.

1512
01:24:50,830 --> 01:24:52,660
I mean,
who the fuck knows?

1513
01:24:52,810 --> 01:24:57,810
Maybe that Akiko grab your fucking hand
and twist it and dude flips a Kito Shit.

1514
01:24:59,410 --> 01:25:01,990
Does that have a chance?
A practicing it?

1515
01:25:01,991 --> 01:25:05,530
There's people [inaudible] got a guy
who was like a real good wrestler with a

1516
01:25:05,531 --> 01:25:09,790
real good bass who really understood a
Kiddo and you let them grab a hold of you.

1517
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:10,690
Yeah,
I bet he could do it.

1518
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:14,230
It's just not that high
percentage grabbing risks and
twisting them and flipping

1519
01:25:14,231 --> 01:25:17,680
people by twisting. Is
that possible? Why not man?

1520
01:25:17,681 --> 01:25:19,120
Look if they can do it in demonstration.

1521
01:25:19,121 --> 01:25:23,080
If a body can physically move that way
in the right scenario with the right dude

1522
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:26,020
who's the right amount of skill and
strength and he pulls it off in the right

1523
01:25:26,021 --> 01:25:29,320
dude who's not suspecting it and
gets caught and goes with it. Yeah,

1524
01:25:29,321 --> 01:25:30,670
it can happen.
Anything can happen.

1525
01:25:31,150 --> 01:25:34,330
Do you think we're going to see it in
the next couple of years? Probably not.

1526
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:36,880
I think we'll see some wing Chung,
some fucking chain fists.

1527
01:25:37,090 --> 01:25:40,360
Someone someone's going to win Chung
from the mountain could work like some

1528
01:25:40,361 --> 01:25:42,580
trapping hands from the mouth
back to us from the mount.

1529
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:46,270
We really haven't seen that cause remember
in the amount everybody punched the

1530
01:25:46,271 --> 01:25:48,910
same way,
but then the day they punched with hooks,

1531
01:25:48,911 --> 01:25:53,220
like just this sloppy hook wing Chung
actually makes sense to practice from the

1532
01:25:53,221 --> 01:25:57,280
amount because it's all that little close
hand fighting and you can't move and

1533
01:25:57,281 --> 01:25:58,800
Bob and weave like you can't inboxing.

1534
01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:00,910
You really kind of stuck in a
rigid position while you're,

1535
01:26:00,911 --> 01:26:04,130
while you're jacking a guy.
So he's really probably maybe the art

1536
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:04,670
for it.

1537
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:08,630
If a guy was a really bad ass wing Chun
Guy and he got awesome entry Jitsu and

1538
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:11,540
developed a sick mount, he'll
probably, what I'm talking about,

1539
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:14,330
wing Chung from the mouse trapping hands
from the mountain might work only makes

1540
01:26:14,331 --> 01:26:15,370
sense if you look,

1541
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:18,080
there were like lost records and
that's what wing Chung was for.

1542
01:26:18,081 --> 01:26:20,480
Just people just started
doing it. Standing. It's
never going to work. Standing.

1543
01:26:20,481 --> 01:26:21,101
If you imagine,

1544
01:26:21,101 --> 01:26:25,100
imagine we'd see some dude mounts somebody
and just fucking do what are these?

1545
01:26:25,101 --> 01:26:27,590
Their Hammer fisting. Remember?
Then the hammer fist came in,

1546
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:31,190
so people were starting to hammer fist
from the mount. No one does that before.

1547
01:26:31,191 --> 01:26:35,000
Eel Hammer fisted jaws put people out
left and right all over the place.

1548
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:38,000
There's jumping hammer fist on
a guy that just got knocked out.

1549
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:41,060
Those are the deadliest ones.
This is something that you, uh,

1550
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:44,790
you tweeted me about the other day that
I wanted to talk about. Um, you, uh,

1551
01:26:44,840 --> 01:26:49,190
you watched that, uh, Bryant Gumbel
thing on brain damage. Oh my God.

1552
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:53,540
Whoa.
I didn't realize how common brain damages,

1553
01:26:53,630 --> 01:26:57,910
the crazy thing is you expect it from
football players because they're, they're,

1554
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:02,360
you know, getting a concussion in football
is totally normal. They, you know,

1555
01:27:02,630 --> 01:27:07,220
like Steve Young had like five or six
concussions, you know, Troy Aikman,

1556
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:09,740
they finally go cause they have
too many fucking concussions.

1557
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:12,500
They go like MMA fighters do quarterbacks.

1558
01:27:12,501 --> 01:27:14,570
Like how many more times can
this guy get knocked out?

1559
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:17,390
And then they finally just
can't do it no more. You know,

1560
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:22,100
and when they get knocked out too,
it's like they got hit by a bus,

1561
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:26,300
but now they've proven this is the
Bryant Gumbel thing. They just proved.

1562
01:27:26,570 --> 01:27:29,150
You would think that, you know, there's a
lot of these, a lot of football players,

1563
01:27:29,151 --> 01:27:34,070
they end up losing all their, they get
end up going through a slow paralysis,

1564
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:37,430
a slow,
it's the slowest desk sentence ever.

1565
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:40,280
Steve Smith used to be the running
back for the Raiders. I remember him.

1566
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:43,550
He can't move at all. He stares at
a computer and spells out words.

1567
01:27:44,180 --> 01:27:48,080
It was amazing. That's, you've got a
Tivo. It's Bryant gumbles real sports.

1568
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:50,840
They finally found proof
of why this is happening.

1569
01:27:50,841 --> 01:27:53,960
Because every time you get jacked in,
the brain are getting knocked out.

1570
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:58,940
There's some toxic proteins that form
on your brain and if they leak into your

1571
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:03,170
spine, you're fucked. It's like Lou
Gehrig's disease. It's the same thing.

1572
01:28:03,171 --> 01:28:06,830
I think it's a l s or something like that.
And you were telling us,

1573
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:10,070
you were telling me that Lou
Gehrig has knocked down like, like,

1574
01:28:10,071 --> 01:28:12,470
like it doesn't make sense.
Lou Gehrig play baseball.

1575
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:15,500
Like he's not playing football too.
Well that's the most gentle sport ever.

1576
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:17,570
But it turns out that he had,

1577
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:21,080
he got knocked out brutally
six different times.

1578
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:22,880
They reported it in newspapers,

1579
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:26,660
brutal concussions where
he got beamed by fastballs,

1580
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:30,560
slid into second base and collided heads
with the other guy where he's knocked

1581
01:28:30,561 --> 01:28:34,400
out for five minutes and
they needed smelling salts
to wake him up six different

1582
01:28:34,401 --> 01:28:38,030
times. And he never took a day off. He,
you know, I don't want to talk about,

1583
01:28:38,031 --> 01:28:40,730
they always talk about a strict and Lou
Gehrig streak where he played like over

1584
01:28:40,731 --> 01:28:44,900
2000 games straight. So he knew when he,
he would come back from the concussion.

1585
01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:48,080
Always play the next game. Oh,
we never took any time off.

1586
01:28:48,170 --> 01:28:52,580
So that's why he died of what he died.
He had some protein talks and stuff.

1587
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:55,550
I could be, I don't remember a total,
either people get it by the way,

1588
01:28:55,551 --> 01:28:58,730
who've never had, we should just clarify
it. People who've never had impact.

1589
01:28:58,731 --> 01:29:00,020
Like Stephen Hawking's.

1590
01:29:00,290 --> 01:29:03,720
Stephen Hawking's has Lou Gehrig's disease
and obviously nobody fucking beat the

1591
01:29:03,721 --> 01:29:06,630
shit out of that dude. You never know.
Maybe as a kid he got smacked around.

1592
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:09,760
[inaudible]
a kid.

1593
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:14,280
Imagine that smart world. You Ain't
smart. You think you're fucking smart.

1594
01:29:14,570 --> 01:29:15,890
The fuck. Shut the fuck up. Steven.

1595
01:29:15,930 --> 01:29:18,750
Go to your room before I beat your
ass with those fucking science books.

1596
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:22,530
I will beat your ass if you read
another fucking physics book.

1597
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:26,370
He probably got his ass
beat. Stephen. Stephen.

1598
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:29,700
I don't think that probably happened.
I'm just going to state my opinion.

1599
01:29:29,701 --> 01:29:32,550
Probably. Did you think it
did Brian? Yeah. Have you
ever been knocked unconscious?

1600
01:29:32,630 --> 01:29:37,060
No. Never. We'll check this out.
Soccer players from me get from, uh,

1601
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,840
the collisions with like
60 mile an hour balls.

1602
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:41,340
They're hitting them with
their head all the time.

1603
01:29:41,490 --> 01:29:43,920
Soccer players go down left
and right from the ship.

1604
01:29:44,130 --> 01:29:47,880
They go through a slow process
where there's certain death,

1605
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:50,760
there's no way you can load that.
People need to realize,

1606
01:29:50,761 --> 01:29:54,300
is this not even concussions?
It's just repeated blows to the head.

1607
01:29:54,330 --> 01:29:57,570
Jarring blows the hat. And the
crazy thing is check, check,

1608
01:29:57,990 --> 01:30:01,030
check out this coincidence
and how common it really is,

1609
01:30:01,031 --> 01:30:03,790
is there's this football player,
they would have, you know,

1610
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:07,380
gathered diseases of slowly dying.
His best friend was a boxer,

1611
01:30:07,381 --> 01:30:11,900
a great white hope boxer that fought all
the greats. Larry Holmes, George Joseph,

1612
01:30:12,150 --> 01:30:13,320
I forget this guy's name.

1613
01:30:13,321 --> 01:30:17,820
He had a mustache famous white box or
that got knocked down. Canada. Yes.

1614
01:30:17,821 --> 01:30:22,760
George Avala. Yes. That guy. His best
friends, his football player. Uh,

1615
01:30:22,890 --> 01:30:26,140
you know, he watched them. He fucking
watched him go through the chimney,

1616
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:29,680
still not dead, but now he finally
can't move. Nothing slowly. No, no.

1617
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:34,530
He died and as soon as he
died, this motherfucker gets
it. The boxer has it now.

1618
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:36,240
He can walk slowly.

1619
01:30:36,241 --> 01:30:41,241
He's still walking in is slowly
losing control of his muscles,

1620
01:30:42,030 --> 01:30:43,500
tend to flatter crazy,
you know,

1621
01:30:43,501 --> 01:30:46,840
then they really need to take that into
consideration when it comes to MMA and

1622
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:51,060
boxers, MMA fighters, you know, we, we
don't, we haven't seen that happen yet.

1623
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:54,570
We haven't seen the one case of a
guy getting really fucked up. But if,

1624
01:30:54,590 --> 01:30:56,670
if people keep fighting,
it's going to keep happening.

1625
01:30:56,671 --> 01:30:59,460
There's no way to avoid
it in boxing and boxing.

1626
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:00,930
They get hit so hard in the head,

1627
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:04,440
they just die on the way after the
fight on the way to the hospital.

1628
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:07,850
They don't even go through Lou Gehrig's
disease. They just die away quicker.

1629
01:31:07,851 --> 01:31:11,190
Well you actually know what
I'm [inaudible] actually,
no, they're unrelated.

1630
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:14,400
That's a different, different
type of ailment. When you, um,

1631
01:31:14,610 --> 01:31:16,660
the problem with these guys
that are dying is there,

1632
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:19,470
almost all of them are cutting
weight. No, but what I'm saying is,

1633
01:31:19,471 --> 01:31:22,410
I'm not saying it's the same thing.
I'm just saying it's totally different,

1634
01:31:22,411 --> 01:31:24,330
but it's worse than the
slow death cause they just,

1635
01:31:24,510 --> 01:31:27,310
whatever it is from cutting weight and
all that shit, that means you die out.

1636
01:31:27,930 --> 01:31:30,680
Some guys get the slow death, but the
guys who get the slow death aren't,

1637
01:31:30,750 --> 01:31:34,980
it's a different sort of a damage. Gerald
McClellan. Mcclellan, what about that?

1638
01:31:35,010 --> 01:31:37,440
Yeah. Mcclellan cut. Uh,
nasty amount of weight.

1639
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:39,870
Mcclellan was like famous for
being like one of the biggest guys.

1640
01:31:39,871 --> 01:31:43,830
I think he was fighting one 75, right?
One 75. And he was so, he was a crock guy.

1641
01:31:43,860 --> 01:31:46,170
It was his fight with Nigel
Benn. Yeah, Nigel Benn.

1642
01:31:46,171 --> 01:31:48,240
He hit it and Nigel band with
everything but the kitchen sink.

1643
01:31:48,241 --> 01:31:50,730
But Nigel band wouldn't
go away until there.

1644
01:31:50,770 --> 01:31:54,990
He's a black guy with the Jheri curl. I
remember that Shit. He's said Jerry curls.

1645
01:31:54,991 --> 01:31:57,270
What? His dreadlocks. Well No, no,

1646
01:31:57,271 --> 01:32:00,040
he didn't have dreadlocks and
may have just the sweat and

1647
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,360
it looked like a Jerry curl.

1648
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:03,310
Let it look like he was
fighting with the Jerry crowd.

1649
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:06,340
Didn't much blood green fight with
a Jheri curl. I think you did. Yes.

1650
01:32:06,341 --> 01:32:09,280
And the Mike Tyson with Jerry curls.
Those are old school man.

1651
01:32:09,281 --> 01:32:12,130
You remember with the, they had to
make that shit illegal though, right?

1652
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:17,380
Jheri curls getting in
everyone's eyes. Oh, it's greasy,
isn't it? Yeah. Oh yeah man.

1653
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:21,520
Yeah, that's tough. It's
really nasty. Hey, any of your,

1654
01:32:21,550 --> 01:32:22,760
straighten your hair with ah,

1655
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:27,150
like conditioner or are straightening
black person hair straightening.

1656
01:32:27,151 --> 01:32:32,020
Know it's craziness. I just blow dry
it straight. I think it's dreads, bro.

1657
01:32:32,440 --> 01:32:34,180
I'm gonna need to simply,
yeah, he's got like dreads.

1658
01:32:34,690 --> 01:32:37,420
He's just got like some crazy natty hair.
Does that Nigel band?

1659
01:32:38,350 --> 01:32:40,610
He was a bad mother
fucker. Yeah, you're right.

1660
01:32:41,230 --> 01:32:45,340
He got knocked down like shit
like twice in the first round.

1661
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:49,870
The first round was a war
watch. Nigel Benn, Gerald
McClellan. Watch that fucking,

1662
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:52,660
that's the fight that
change Roy Jones style.

1663
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:54,890
A lot of people think Roy
Jones like saw that fight.

1664
01:32:54,891 --> 01:32:58,540
It was like fuck it and hurt. You know,
watch his friend get all fucked up.

1665
01:32:58,541 --> 01:32:59,800
He's the guy who's going
to fight eventually.

1666
01:32:59,801 --> 01:33:02,350
That was like a super food that
was being talked about. You know.

1667
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:05,950
Who Do you think had the best defense
ever? Inboxing. Pronounce Whitaker. No.

1668
01:33:05,951 --> 01:33:09,970
Hopkins huddled than pronounce. Yeah.
I think Hopkins has the best defense.

1669
01:33:10,230 --> 01:33:13,270
Pernell Whitaker could stand in front
of guys. Yeah. And he could, you know,

1670
01:33:13,390 --> 01:33:16,000
he could keep from getting
hit roll with guys,

1671
01:33:16,001 --> 01:33:18,640
but he wasn't doing that
to a guy like Hopkins.

1672
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:21,610
You know what I liked about what I like
about Hopkins is Hopkins doesn't take

1673
01:33:21,611 --> 01:33:25,390
any stupid chances. You know, a lot of
guys think that certain styles are boring.

1674
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:29,920
You know, like, like some people you know,
think that, you know, like, like, like,

1675
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:33,670
like the John Fitch Style, uh, John
Fitch wins ugly takes guys down.

1676
01:33:33,671 --> 01:33:36,160
Pizza my pounds on them.
But sometimes it goes to decision,

1677
01:33:36,430 --> 01:33:39,850
but I think that still beautiful.
That guy's imposing he shit on that guy.

1678
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:41,560
And what I like about a guy like Hopkins,

1679
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:44,860
he shuts everybody else's bullshit down,
hardly ever gets hit,

1680
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:47,260
stands right in front of you.
And if you're like a Felix Trinidad,

1681
01:33:47,261 --> 01:33:49,020
that opens up too much on him.
He'll break you,

1682
01:33:49,060 --> 01:33:52,930
break you into knock you the fuck out. And
if you tighten up like Roy Jones, okay,

1683
01:33:52,931 --> 01:33:55,510
you'll get to decision, but that
guy just beat you, you know?

1684
01:33:55,511 --> 01:33:57,520
And he does that to everybody.
I like John Fitch,

1685
01:33:57,521 --> 01:34:00,960
but I'll like them a lot more once it
gets really good with submissions are

1686
01:34:00,970 --> 01:34:03,400
going to be a giant always fighting
though he's fighting monsters.

1687
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:06,580
She fought Tiago owls to Tiago
is so fucking hard to finish.

1688
01:34:06,581 --> 01:34:09,270
He's so big and strong and
powerful, you know? I mean,

1689
01:34:09,271 --> 01:34:12,160
just even hold that motherfucker down.
It's getting like near impossible.

1690
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:14,680
If he didn't come in overweight
and looked so fucking drawn out,

1691
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:16,600
you know who not. This guy's a beast, man.

1692
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:21,430
You gotta try the fought Koscheck.
That guy's a fucking savage.

1693
01:34:21,630 --> 01:34:22,780
You got to strive to be.

1694
01:34:22,781 --> 01:34:26,920
If you're grappling and you want to
maximize your crown fighting skills,

1695
01:34:27,070 --> 01:34:30,400
strive to be as good as Marcella Garcia.
It's real simple.

1696
01:34:30,401 --> 01:34:34,750
Marcella Garcia is the greatest
Nogi grappler of all time.

1697
01:34:35,080 --> 01:34:36,400
No one's even fucking close.

1698
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:40,420
He's a master of many submissions.

1699
01:34:40,421 --> 01:34:43,000
Speaking of which Jack Arrays
fighting Tim Kennedy. Tonight.

1700
01:34:43,001 --> 01:34:44,320
We're going to watch the shows by,
of course,

1701
01:34:44,321 --> 01:34:47,190
right afterwards we get some pizza
shop your way. Another motherfucker,

1702
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:50,440
but technically,
even though Zachary beat Marcella Garcia,

1703
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:54,790
he's just my overall Marcella
Garcia has more polished,

1704
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:59,750
mastered weapons, so should strive.
Yeah, but it's pretty close. I agree,

1705
01:34:59,751 --> 01:35:03,920
but or is still fucking incredible.
He is awesome.

1706
01:35:03,921 --> 01:35:07,970
Definitely top five in the world
at submissions. Heart is crazy too.

1707
01:35:07,971 --> 01:35:11,510
Here's the guy who got his arm broken
by Hydro Gracie [inaudible] Gracie broke

1708
01:35:11,511 --> 01:35:14,210
his arm and he finished the
fucking match and won on points.

1709
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:17,900
He was willing to let his fucking arm
get broken and it's Hugh Jitsu match.

1710
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:21,350
I mean, what do they get paid for
a Jujitsu match, you know, nothing.

1711
01:35:21,351 --> 01:35:24,020
And this guy's like, go ahead,
snapped my arm, get a tree. Asai

1712
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:28,620
free siu would row meal.
I get to mix that.

1713
01:35:28,670 --> 01:35:31,940
The top guys get granola too with them.
Not everyone.

1714
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:36,260
There's savages competing in a fucking
one of the best sports in the world that

1715
01:35:36,261 --> 01:35:38,960
nobody cares about. It's one
of the weirdest things that
people don't care about.

1716
01:35:38,961 --> 01:35:41,900
Submission, grappling. You would think
that, you know, boxing is pretty popular.

1717
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:45,110
I mean obviously hugely popular on
its own and it's a segment of MMA.

1718
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:46,610
Why isn't submission grappling?

1719
01:35:46,611 --> 01:35:50,480
Why hasn't someone figured out a way to
promote high level submission grappling

1720
01:35:50,481 --> 01:35:53,420
lacks Jocko raid like Marcella Garcia,
Jake shields,

1721
01:35:53,421 --> 01:35:55,760
those types of dudes who just
attack guys and finish them off.

1722
01:35:55,910 --> 01:36:00,470
That shit's excited. Or Rico chipper
rally, the professional submission league.

1723
01:36:00,471 --> 01:36:05,360
It looked great and he needed
Randy couture to uh, you know,

1724
01:36:05,361 --> 01:36:08,690
be the poster boy and it would've
worked with Randek a Turk is Radica tour

1725
01:36:08,691 --> 01:36:10,850
retired for a minute and
Radica tourists that, okay,

1726
01:36:10,851 --> 01:36:14,630
I'm retired but I'm going to still want
to compete and submission grappling as

1727
01:36:14,631 --> 01:36:16,890
the way to go. And Rico
trip, I was like, man,

1728
01:36:16,891 --> 01:36:18,410
I'm going to make this
guy headline every show.

1729
01:36:18,411 --> 01:36:20,360
And he did a couple shows
and they're awesome.

1730
01:36:20,390 --> 01:36:25,250
Rico chip really had an awesome show.
He just needs a, he needs a headline.

1731
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:27,110
Ricoh, Ricoh, if you're
listening out there,

1732
01:36:27,111 --> 01:36:31,430
anybody that knows Rico get Marcello
Garcia to headline your shit.

1733
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:35,080
The revolve it around Marcello Garcia.
Yeah, but that's the differences.

1734
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:37,220
Randy coture is huge with
the general population.

1735
01:36:37,221 --> 01:36:40,420
You can have reacted to her
grappling in general population.

1736
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:44,900
You could make it successful with Marcello
Garcia. He's that big. It's huge. No,

1737
01:36:44,901 --> 01:36:46,780
but he's not with regular people.
Randy couture,

1738
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:51,290
successful with regular human things.
Definitely the initial, the initial blow,

1739
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:54,560
you know, it would be from the [inaudible]
tour event that the problem is,

1740
01:36:54,561 --> 01:36:56,990
that's what you need in order
to get something off the ground.

1741
01:36:57,020 --> 01:36:57,920
You need a guy like that.

1742
01:36:57,921 --> 01:37:01,250
You can't just take chances and let
people eventually grow to love it because

1743
01:37:01,251 --> 01:37:04,280
you're running out of money. I think
you could do that with Marcella Garcia.

1744
01:37:04,281 --> 01:37:06,170
You can't. You can't do
something like, you know,

1745
01:37:06,171 --> 01:37:08,750
you have to have something that people
are gonna look at all these fucking guys

1746
01:37:08,751 --> 01:37:10,820
that are fighting and Bella tour,
they got killers and Bella Tor,

1747
01:37:10,970 --> 01:37:13,970
they got these distro get Hector Lombard
is fighting and Bella to our crushing

1748
01:37:13,971 --> 01:37:17,230
people. Nobody's paying attention. No
one's talking about it. Hector Lumbar,

1749
01:37:17,231 --> 01:37:20,660
if he was in the fucking UFC would be
on in sports illustrated. Right now.

1750
01:37:20,690 --> 01:37:24,890
He's a fucking Cuban immigrant who was
fighting for the Cuban Olympic judo team.

1751
01:37:24,891 --> 01:37:29,870
I believe it just fucking destroy
your five 985 pounds, shredded,

1752
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:34,850
ridiculous muscles move so fucking fast
blasted Jason Silva out in like six

1753
01:37:34,851 --> 01:37:38,660
seconds. He's crushing people,
Dude. Quashing people in Bella tour,

1754
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:41,630
nobody gives a fuck. You know why? Cause
it's Bella Tor and nobody's paying.

1755
01:37:41,631 --> 01:37:44,030
Nobody knows what it is.
You go ask a million people on the street,

1756
01:37:44,031 --> 01:37:44,720
what's Bella tour?

1757
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:48,080
Well he might be there for 10 years and
still people might not know where Bella

1758
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:51,200
is and that will be the end of his
competitive prime. That's the problem.

1759
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:52,600
You can't just say like,

1760
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:55,260
oh we're going to start this thing and
because we have Marcella Garcia going to

1761
01:37:55,261 --> 01:37:58,050
be huge because no one's going to
just fucking pay to see Jujitsu.

1762
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:00,780
You know they're not going to do it
if they're not practicing Jujitsu you.

1763
01:38:00,781 --> 01:38:02,760
So you'd be limited to only practitioners.

1764
01:38:02,940 --> 01:38:06,570
So you have like a tiny percentage of
the population is willing to buy your

1765
01:38:06,571 --> 01:38:10,020
product on television and much less than
we'd be willing to buy an MMA fight.

1766
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:11,880
Cause MMA you get the fans,

1767
01:38:11,881 --> 01:38:14,580
you get people who actually trained in
it themselves and then you get all these,

1768
01:38:14,620 --> 01:38:17,580
wow, who's who want to see people get
the fuck beat out of him. All right,

1769
01:38:17,581 --> 01:38:19,530
so you get a,
you get the whole cross section.

1770
01:38:19,830 --> 01:38:21,360
But if you get a guy like Marcello Garcia,

1771
01:38:21,361 --> 01:38:24,630
you're only going to get people into
Jujitsu unless surely you've got to row.

1772
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:29,100
You know how many stars wear nothing one
day and they blow up the next day with

1773
01:38:29,101 --> 01:38:29,520
them.
Right.

1774
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:34,200
The reason the UFC is huge as they have
the money for the marketing and they put

1775
01:38:34,201 --> 01:38:35,034
faces out there,

1776
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:38,310
if someone came along with that kind
of money and that kind of power,

1777
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:41,160
Marcella Garcia could be
an instant star overnight.

1778
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:42,390
All of these guys were nothing.

1779
01:38:42,391 --> 01:38:45,270
One day they're stars the next day
just cause they, they're on TV.

1780
01:38:45,310 --> 01:38:46,800
But you've got to be an example.

1781
01:38:46,801 --> 01:38:50,460
I'm talking about guys getting
knocked the fuck out, Mike Fox Sports.

1782
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:53,340
No one watches that Bella
tool was on be on Fox sports,

1783
01:38:53,370 --> 01:38:55,210
but I've bought a Bella Bella.
You we're going to have grappling.

1784
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:57,360
You would have to be on what
ESPN to become successful.

1785
01:38:57,390 --> 01:39:00,030
Well is towards successful,
I guess it's on.

1786
01:39:00,031 --> 01:39:04,470
If it's on successful then you started
off this conversation with saying

1787
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:07,430
submission,
grappling should be fucking Houston.

1788
01:39:07,431 --> 01:39:11,880
It's really hard to make something
popular. [inaudible] successful hard.

1789
01:39:11,881 --> 01:39:13,650
The hard part is mothers
are enough to keep it on.

1790
01:39:13,651 --> 01:39:16,950
Television part isn't actually get in
the cage and putting the show on the hard

1791
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:19,560
part is marketing like.
Exactly. That's what I'm saying.

1792
01:39:19,561 --> 01:39:23,640
Like market on having a great product
for us has got a lot of great fighters.

1793
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:25,890
I've watched Beltre and there's
some fun fights to watch,

1794
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:28,020
but if you want there are
they getting sued by the UFC?

1795
01:39:28,230 --> 01:39:29,460
I probably shouldn't
be talking about them.

1796
01:39:30,370 --> 01:39:34,360
The other story you want to start
with Ken babby that's fucking strange.

1797
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:35,520
Can have happier.

1798
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:40,170
I don't know what really happens so
we probably shouldn't talk about that.

1799
01:39:40,220 --> 01:39:45,210
Crazy fun. No know nothing. I know. Now
I know. Is the UFC fucking rules. Yeah,

1800
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:48,660
exactly. It's rules, but I'm looking
forward to strike force tonight and Brian,

1801
01:39:48,661 --> 01:39:50,100
you're gonna stay over.
I'm gonna Wrestle.

1802
01:39:50,130 --> 01:39:51,520
You're going to get in your underwear so,

1803
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:55,650
so I think I'm going to see that movie
night. Date. Night. What? Eat. Pray.

1804
01:39:55,651 --> 01:39:56,484
Love my dick

1805
01:39:58,270 --> 01:40:02,160
rather than good pick out after this man.
Yeah, everything's great. I actually,

1806
01:40:02,161 --> 01:40:04,980
have you seen the movie date night
about build birthday? Are you,

1807
01:40:04,990 --> 01:40:07,870
are you talking to me for real birds
by seeing the movie date night? Yep.

1808
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:10,980
Go bears as well. I love bill burn,
but that's not a nice, that cop in it.

1809
01:40:10,981 --> 01:40:14,580
I've done a lot of shit. I'm not
proud of either. Phil. I don't know.

1810
01:40:14,581 --> 01:40:18,060
Maybe it's good. I'm just kidding.
It's just comedy date nights.

1811
01:40:18,061 --> 01:40:19,900
The one that Steve Carell one,
right? Yeah. You'll be funny.

1812
01:40:19,930 --> 01:40:24,510
Tina Fey or I'm only fucking around. I
saw the, did we talk about the, the uh,

1813
01:40:24,570 --> 01:40:29,160
the fucking Stallone movie? Oh No,
no. [inaudible] I saw what the fuck,

1814
01:40:30,810 --> 01:40:35,090
I'm blanking out. My loud hall called it.

1815
01:40:35,490 --> 01:40:39,870
I'm trying to delete it off my hard drive
and look, I love Randy. Go tour. Okay.

1816
01:40:39,871 --> 01:40:43,920
I love Randy couture and I think Randy
couture has a definitely possibility for

1817
01:40:43,950 --> 01:40:47,300
a giant career as an action star.
I mean the dude he got out of real life.

1818
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:50,580
Plenty good. Plenty good
to me. I'm, I bought it.

1819
01:40:50,610 --> 01:40:54,040
All I want to see is him beating the
fuck out of people. He's a real badass.

1820
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:57,640
He's fucking, he's clean and healthy
and fucking looks great for his age.

1821
01:40:57,641 --> 01:40:58,720
You guys,
Goddamn movie star.

1822
01:40:58,750 --> 01:41:02,170
I think for sure Randy couture could
be a giant movie star for sure.

1823
01:41:02,171 --> 01:41:05,590
I think he's beloved.
After that guy retires,

1824
01:41:05,710 --> 01:41:08,020
if he just decides to do giant
fucking action, who's what?

1825
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:12,970
Arnold could act better. Shit.
Shit. Romantic comedies. Maybe not.

1826
01:41:13,030 --> 01:41:14,490
Anyway,
it was,

1827
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:18,520
I think he could do a romantic
Canada chicks want to fuck him.

1828
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:21,280
That's all he needs to just needs to
be funny and how they want to fuck him.

1829
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:25,540
He's a fucking gladiator, right? Look
at that year. So the movie was a,

1830
01:41:25,930 --> 01:41:29,350
that said the movie was
wretched. It was. It was. It was.

1831
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:31,990
It was like you are than
the 18 this is what I said.

1832
01:41:31,991 --> 01:41:36,200
I didn't see the 18 it was like you took
every cliche in an acting movie through

1833
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:36,690
it together.

1834
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:40,390
He had a 12 year old piece it together
and then you just ground it up and

1835
01:41:40,391 --> 01:41:41,350
stuffed it up.

1836
01:41:41,351 --> 01:41:45,460
Stallone's asshole with like one of
those pastry bags and he just diarrhea

1837
01:41:45,461 --> 01:41:48,570
splattered onto the screen. That
was the movie. It was so dire.

1838
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:50,640
Would never want to see that below.

1839
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:53,170
Actually tried to get
more shit than anything.

1840
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:57,340
So that's just the loan actually tried
to steal the script from one of my

1841
01:41:57,341 --> 01:41:59,980
students. Yeah. Tell that's one
the reason why I brought this up,

1842
01:42:00,070 --> 01:42:01,600
tell this whole the whole story,
by the way,

1843
01:42:01,601 --> 01:42:04,820
that motherfucker should not be proud
of that script. Yeah. What the fuck?

1844
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:08,800
[inaudible] said they butchered.
I'm sure they did.

1845
01:42:08,801 --> 01:42:11,160
I'm sure that they have an ugly,
you know,

1846
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:12,730
we'll tell the whole semester's Stallone,

1847
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:17,170
put out his management team or
whatever, allegedly allegedly. Well,

1848
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:20,270
they went to court. This is what
happened. Okay. They went to court.

1849
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,930
You say a little while, just so you don't
get sued, allegedly. Just say allegedly,

1850
01:42:22,931 --> 01:42:26,610
allegedly. This is what you're right.
I'm helping you. I'm [inaudible] alone,

1851
01:42:26,650 --> 01:42:27,790
put out an APB area.

1852
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:32,010
He's looking for an action thriller
or whatever, and action movie.

1853
01:42:32,760 --> 01:42:35,940
I'm sure you had a lot of guys come
through his office. Dave Callahan,

1854
01:42:36,120 --> 01:42:40,170
he looked at the credits. He's my
purple belt. Low Pan is his nickname on,

1855
01:42:40,530 --> 01:42:45,150
on the internet. Anyways, he writes
scripts he met with Sylvester Stallone.

1856
01:42:45,510 --> 01:42:46,770
They rejected the script,

1857
01:42:46,771 --> 01:42:51,771
but then for some reason he decided to
keep the script and not give Dave cal him

1858
01:42:53,881 --> 01:42:58,080
any credit and he was shopping
this, you know, he was, he,

1859
01:42:58,081 --> 01:43:01,140
he was basically going around
town saying he's got a script.

1860
01:43:01,141 --> 01:43:03,030
He wrote the script and he's
getting all these stars,

1861
01:43:03,031 --> 01:43:06,120
make you work and all of these guys to
do it. And so he seems like a big shot,

1862
01:43:06,150 --> 01:43:09,180
you know. And, and then, uh,

1863
01:43:09,210 --> 01:43:12,300
Dave Callahan's people found
out they took them to court.

1864
01:43:12,690 --> 01:43:17,610
So as long tried to fucking fight it
and they usually win according to Dave

1865
01:43:17,610 --> 01:43:20,520
Callahan. Writers usually lose
in these kinds of situations.

1866
01:43:20,850 --> 01:43:25,110
And the evidence was so clear that,
you know,

1867
01:43:25,470 --> 01:43:30,050
did court or when, and court ain't going
on. And yet if you look at the credits,

1868
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:34,760
it says original story by Dave
Callahan, screenplay, Dave Callahan,

1869
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:38,100
Sylvester small money from the film also.
I'm sure,

1870
01:43:38,101 --> 01:43:39,060
I don't know what his deal was,

1871
01:43:39,061 --> 01:43:41,700
but basically Sylvester Stallone
tried to steal his script.

1872
01:43:41,810 --> 01:43:45,630
You know what killed me when I read
all these people that loved it. Yeah.

1873
01:43:45,770 --> 01:43:49,310
I read all these people online that
loved it and I was like really?

1874
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:52,100
Like you didn't see like everything
and like the thing with Arnold

1875
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,290
was kind of funny. It was kind of
funny with Bruce Willis and on,

1876
01:43:54,310 --> 01:43:57,260
what's his problem? He wants to be
president [inaudible] that shit was funny.

1877
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:00,230
That was a funny line. It was good.
But that's it. Other than that,

1878
01:44:00,231 --> 01:44:02,810
it was like a bunch of shit that you
saw come on a million miles away.

1879
01:44:02,811 --> 01:44:05,180
You know the is never going to die.
This is ridiculous.

1880
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:06,890
When he went back to save the girl,
you like,

1881
01:44:06,891 --> 01:44:09,890
what the fuck you should have saw Scott
pilgrim and he went back to see if the

1882
01:44:09,891 --> 01:44:12,230
girl, and he didn't even fuck
her and that's just an American.

1883
01:44:12,350 --> 01:44:15,110
You're going to go all the way to another
country and risk your life and your

1884
01:44:15,111 --> 01:44:17,210
friends' lives and she loves
you and she hugs on you.

1885
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:19,730
You don't even fuck are you
leave her there on the island.

1886
01:44:19,910 --> 01:44:21,020
That shit's ridiculous.

1887
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:25,940
You just came back in a plane with
guns and fucked up everyone in her town

1888
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:29,660
risking your life,
rescued her while her father was murdered.

1889
01:44:29,661 --> 01:44:33,050
You don't even fuck her. That's
ridiculous. That was offensive to me.

1890
01:44:33,170 --> 01:44:36,210
That as a fence that offended me. I'm
like, what kind of a movie are you making

1891
01:44:36,290 --> 01:44:38,880
here? Should have fucked her
like he saved her life. Exactly.

1892
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:43,950
That's fucking communism, man. You
fly into a country and your risk,

1893
01:44:43,951 --> 01:44:45,090
your life for the hottest

1894
01:44:45,140 --> 01:44:47,380
chicken, the planet and she doesn't
even fuck you when it's over,

1895
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:51,460
but you just flew from another country
to land in this shitty little island and

1896
01:44:51,490 --> 01:44:54,400
get shot at you. Don't even fuck
her and she wants to fuck you.

1897
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:56,980
Pretty sure she got nothing to live for.
She got nothing going on there.

1898
01:44:57,370 --> 01:45:00,040
Get drunk and be a cool thing
to text your girlfriend. Right?

1899
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:04,000
I'm going to fuck you tonight. Like I
saved your life. Wow. You could pretend

1900
01:45:06,230 --> 01:45:11,230
I tried. I tried to trends without
your role. Rope roleplay. Yeah.

1901
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:15,610
You ever do real plan? No. No. Yeah,

1902
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:18,760
I don't get that. I'm the telephone
repairman that that kind of shit.

1903
01:45:18,790 --> 01:45:21,370
You gotta like dress up and
shit and some dudes do it man.

1904
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:24,580
They go out and buy outfits and
shit. Wiffle. Where? Something crazy.

1905
01:45:25,930 --> 01:45:29,050
The pretend they're shooting a cooking
show in the kitchen. He just comes in.

1906
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:31,060
He's crazy.
He's raped her in the kitchen.

1907
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:33,790
I remember when our one
friend that could be hot,

1908
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:37,680
I can't remember her when friends or one
friend. I brought up a threesome though.

1909
01:45:38,110 --> 01:45:42,570
Little hope of his friend. Yeah.
I don't have to say that. Fuck.

1910
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:44,250
He used to come up to
me. He goes, hey man,

1911
01:45:44,370 --> 01:45:48,360
you should really try to put diapers on
and slapped around a little and he was

1912
01:45:48,361 --> 01:45:49,200
being serious.

1913
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:52,400
Yeah. We have this one friend that
uh, he talked to me about how,

1914
01:45:52,401 --> 01:45:56,740
how hot it was too. Ball gag has chicken
Wipper yeah, he likes to whimper. I go,

1915
01:45:56,741 --> 01:45:58,330
how hard cause I leave marks.

1916
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:05,450
He speaks here leaving marks and
stuff. Do you? I'm a fan of that.

1917
01:46:05,451 --> 01:46:10,160
I like beating up like the ass. I like
beating and beating and beating it up.

1918
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:14,780
Really Punch it. What do you do with it? I
don't punch it. I just, that's strongest.

1919
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:19,580
You've probably me fucking iron
palm from the Shaolin Temple. Bam.

1920
01:46:19,581 --> 01:46:23,120
You slap them that hard in the
ass as hard as I can. Whoa.

1921
01:46:23,390 --> 01:46:26,230
Serious white girls like wow.
Some girls,

1922
01:46:27,890 --> 01:46:32,360
most girls, like most girls
like that. That is a strong
most, okay. Let's clarify.

1923
01:46:32,361 --> 01:46:36,340
Most girls who are willing to fuck you.
Right? I see. I do. Can't say most.

1924
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:40,590
It's natural. I think it's natural.
The girls liked it to get, you know,

1925
01:46:40,700 --> 01:46:44,330
fucked rough. No girls, girls that
I've fucked do, I've never had

1926
01:46:46,190 --> 01:46:50,080
verbally. They don't like it really
has. Eddie has this very specific type

1927
01:46:50,080 --> 01:46:52,400
that he dates and he thinks that that,
that's like a,

1928
01:46:52,410 --> 01:46:56,880
a generous section of the population,
but it's not, oh no, no. I've, I tried.

1929
01:46:57,120 --> 01:47:01,920
I think so. It's your percentage
percent. No. I was like, okay.

1930
01:47:01,921 --> 01:47:03,840
Some girls do.
Some girls,

1931
01:47:03,841 --> 01:47:07,560
I'm going to say I'm going to
say 75% of women, like at Ross.

1932
01:47:07,561 --> 01:47:11,420
75% of women willing to fuck
you. Yes. Okay. Exactly.

1933
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:15,120
But that's not 75% of all
women, Bro. I'm just saying.

1934
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:19,230
That's what I think. Standby.
They're attracted to you.

1935
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,810
There's certain girls who
you're the ideal guns.

1936
01:47:21,811 --> 01:47:23,730
What are you saying about the
girls that are attracted to me?

1937
01:47:23,790 --> 01:47:27,210
I'm seeing those girls like to be
smacked around a little bit. Yeah, look,

1938
01:47:27,211 --> 01:47:31,080
it's natural. Look, what do you, this
is a wild fucking musician. Characters.

1939
01:47:31,081 --> 01:47:34,260
A trained killer. Jujitsu expert
teaches people all around the world.

1940
01:47:34,261 --> 01:47:37,230
What do you think they want from you?
They want some exotic, crazy killer dick.

1941
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,720
I want you to do something nutty with
them. They want to feel threatened.

1942
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:40,950
Those bitches are nuts.

1943
01:47:40,951 --> 01:47:43,470
They might be stuffed in a corner
and want to be putting a cradle on.

1944
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:46,450
Forced them to shock your Dirk.
And just so you're saying once I'm crazy,

1945
01:47:46,510 --> 01:47:51,510
so you're saying a larger percentage of
the population likes it nice and smooth.

1946
01:47:52,830 --> 01:47:54,030
Who think about who you are.

1947
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:57,810
Think about who like it's all the girls
I dated like smooth. I've tried it.

1948
01:47:57,811 --> 01:48:02,180
Those are the clothes you
[inaudible] wouldn't it?

1949
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:06,610
Don't be threatening with that.
[inaudible]

1950
01:48:06,630 --> 01:48:08,310
I'm not attacking you at all.
I'm pumping you up.

1951
01:48:08,370 --> 01:48:12,480
Look what you are is a very specific,
tight, I'm not attacking you in any way,

1952
01:48:12,481 --> 01:48:15,750
shape or form. I liked quality opposites.
Quite. Yeah, but quite the opposite.

1953
01:48:15,751 --> 01:48:16,531
I'm not attacking you at all.

1954
01:48:16,531 --> 01:48:19,590
What I'm saying is those bitches want
the Ganga is Khan treatment. Right?

1955
01:48:19,591 --> 01:48:21,090
That's why they're coming. Don't
want it with me. They're not.

1956
01:48:21,091 --> 01:48:25,170
They're not there for the shop guy who's
going to watch fucking cat videos with

1957
01:48:25,171 --> 01:48:29,310
them. They make me scissor cats. I love
cats too. Scissored them. They're like,

1958
01:48:29,311 --> 01:48:31,550
just put your hands, pull your dick
up and scissor me and I'm like,

1959
01:48:31,950 --> 01:48:36,660
is that what you doing? Scissor assholes
with girls they ever get from the like,

1960
01:48:36,661 --> 01:48:39,900
I like to hold you from behind.
No, I want to take you back.

1961
01:48:39,901 --> 01:48:42,990
They tried to take her now
and it's more romantic.

1962
01:48:42,990 --> 01:48:46,290
Defend yourself against a bluebell
girl. At what? A blue belt girls.

1963
01:48:46,730 --> 01:48:48,580
If a girl was a blue belt,
do you think? Not sure.

1964
01:48:49,510 --> 01:48:53,870
Like [inaudible] CIF rule one
rules or USC Fujitsu's no,

1965
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:56,640
just just to do too. She's just trying
to chase you down. I'm going to hit you.

1966
01:48:56,641 --> 01:48:59,550
It's just going to trust anyone.
Could you do to, I don't.

1967
01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:01,100
I think if you know a little bit,
you just to,

1968
01:49:01,110 --> 01:49:02,310
you're going to be able to fight somebody.

1969
01:49:02,311 --> 01:49:05,700
That's the girl Jujitsu to get your order.
Boy.

1970
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:11,850
Pretty power. Some bad ass bitches. Yeah.
To the Wilson bluebells ladies out there,

1971
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:16,860
we are willing to give you $20 if you
will engage in a Jujitsu submission

1972
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:21,510
grappling match at 10th Planet Jiu
Jitsu against the video. You have to be,

1973
01:49:21,511 --> 01:49:22,344
this is what Yahoo Bell.

1974
01:49:22,360 --> 01:49:27,010
You have to be a blue belt with less than
two years of training and under 120 oh

1975
01:49:27,011 --> 01:49:29,580
eight no way. You want to do a brand? No.

1976
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:35,290
No reason to do that and I'll give you
some lessons. It's not Brian give lesson.

1977
01:49:35,370 --> 01:49:38,490
It's not Brian. I'll play the UFC
video game against a girl. Well,

1978
01:49:38,491 --> 01:49:40,560
if you want to look, I
wouldn't, if it was MMA,

1979
01:49:40,561 --> 01:49:42,720
I'm sure you'd beat the shit out of her
because all you have to do is punch her.

1980
01:49:42,780 --> 01:49:44,250
Right.
The real thing is like put Jujitsu.

1981
01:49:44,280 --> 01:49:46,440
Remember when we did that thing with um,
uh,

1982
01:49:46,441 --> 01:49:51,130
Seymore butts and Felicia remember
that at the old legends? Yes,

1983
01:49:51,670 --> 01:49:54,280
yes. But the reality, yeah. Felicia, Oh,

1984
01:49:54,281 --> 01:49:56,080
who was one of John Jacques
Machado is black belts,

1985
01:49:56,081 --> 01:49:59,830
is a friend of ours and she's a really,
really cool chick and she's a killer.

1986
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:04,500
She's like 135 pounds. She's strong as, as
she sees like, oh, the kettlebells. Yeah.

1987
01:50:04,820 --> 01:50:09,370
Crazy crossfit grow and a serious jujitsu
black belt. Like she will fuck you up.

1988
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:11,350
She's the legit and uh,

1989
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:14,530
and Seymour Butts was filming a reality
show and Seymour Butts as, as porno star.

1990
01:50:14,890 --> 01:50:15,730
And he came to,

1991
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:20,530
he came to the bomb squad and we had
him roll with a girl and he came up,

1992
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:24,100
he got ahold of me because he wanted,
you know, for the shot, for the show.

1993
01:50:24,101 --> 01:50:27,520
I'm going to go learn Jujitsu for the
show and I'm a go against a girl or

1994
01:50:27,521 --> 01:50:30,020
something. And they film the
reality show at the bomb squad. Yes.

1995
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:31,270
They came down in one of my classes.

1996
01:50:31,271 --> 01:50:33,520
That's where the original 10 planet
was located on the bomb squad.

1997
01:50:33,521 --> 01:50:38,170
So we filmed it. He, he didn't
want to roll with thirst,

1998
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:41,350
right? Or he did one. He did not
know what was going to happen.

1999
01:50:41,351 --> 01:50:42,940
What happened is he didn't use any of it.

2000
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:45,700
He didn't use any of them rolling
with her in the actual show.

2001
01:50:45,730 --> 01:50:47,380
He only came down a couple of times.

2002
01:50:47,381 --> 01:50:49,660
You can't learn Jiu Jitsu in a
couple of dollars, but he didn't.

2003
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:52,990
I thought the idea was that he was going
to get humiliated by the girl and that

2004
01:50:52,991 --> 01:50:56,050
was going to be fun. But I don't remember
seeing any of that. Did they put it on?

2005
01:50:56,051 --> 01:51:00,140
They never, they never ever did.
Never. She killed she crushed room.

2006
01:51:00,370 --> 01:51:04,270
She just strangled him, choked him
armed Bardem she did everything to them.

2007
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:08,750
But if there is no lot rules than he
would have won. Now with Felicia. Felicia,

2008
01:51:09,260 --> 01:51:11,920
maybe it was a blue belt girl.
No, Felicia is a black belt dude.

2009
01:51:11,921 --> 01:51:15,100
You're not going to be able to be, odds
are in her favor. Anything can happen.

2010
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:19,650
A big man can like, yeah, you might see
on the picture even trying to know. Yeah,

2011
01:51:19,660 --> 01:51:20,590
anything could happen.
You're right,

2012
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:25,660
but the odds are she's going to get you
put money on the black belt check if you

2013
01:51:25,661 --> 01:51:28,490
don't know how to fight. It's one
thing if you're a fighter, girls,

2014
01:51:28,530 --> 01:51:32,210
black belt girls go through guys
that are really good at Jujitsu. God,

2015
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:33,940
it's crazy to watch belts and stuff.

2016
01:51:33,970 --> 01:51:37,540
A blackbelt chick can run through a guy
that's been trained two or three years

2017
01:51:37,710 --> 01:51:38,770
easily.
It's crazy.

2018
01:51:39,050 --> 01:51:42,490
It's really high end girls like
attack dudes like here at Gracie.

2019
01:51:43,150 --> 01:51:47,680
I hear crazy stories like embarrass his
guys all the time. I'm sure for sure.

2020
01:51:47,681 --> 01:51:50,740
She's a fucking savage.
She's awesome and she's hot as fuck.

2021
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:52,270
How ridiculous is that?

2022
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:55,750
Hot as fuck in a trained killer
and a Gracie who's kid is at,

2023
01:51:55,751 --> 01:51:57,850
is that Hickson's kid? No, Borea hens.

2024
01:51:57,851 --> 01:52:01,240
Those sisters daughter.

2025
01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:05,770
Enzo sends a sister.
Flavio is like a famous actress in Brazil.

2026
01:52:06,370 --> 01:52:10,830
She had a Kiera, Kiera. The
father was never around and Kiera,

2027
01:52:10,970 --> 01:52:13,770
it just kept the Gracie name.
Her mom's, she's a Gracie.

2028
01:52:13,771 --> 01:52:16,370
Her mom's like legit racing. You know
her mom's super hot to one of the,

2029
01:52:16,390 --> 01:52:19,900
when I went to Brazil and in 2000
for the moon, Diaz as a purple belt,

2030
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:25,900
John, jock and Hanzo, we're actually
tried to hook me up with Flavio Heroes.

2031
01:52:25,901 --> 01:52:30,550
Mom. Oh my God. When I was 30 Oh my
God, cure was 14 at the time. What?

2032
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:35,170
Kira was never together. We're all hanging
out. Have you should put a hit out on,

2033
01:52:35,171 --> 01:52:38,830
you know that's true here. You fucking
kissing and tell him to the hole.

2034
01:52:38,831 --> 01:52:42,640
I didn't just spank, that was out 10
years ago and nothing ever happened.

2035
01:52:42,641 --> 01:52:44,380
You know what we,
she couldn't speak English.

2036
01:52:44,381 --> 01:52:48,680
I didn't speak Portuguese
are the attraction lasted
for five minutes and then

2037
01:52:48,681 --> 01:52:51,500
that was it. I think it's really
cool when you go to those worlds,

2038
01:52:51,501 --> 01:52:54,620
you just championships and even Abu
Dhabi at a level that the chicks are

2039
01:52:54,621 --> 01:52:59,480
fighting at the two level is
really, really high. Yeah.
That's so fun to watch, man.

2040
01:52:59,481 --> 01:53:02,830
Chicks become like really dangerous
killers cause Jujitsu is one of the things

2041
01:53:02,850 --> 01:53:04,430
are,
it takes some strength to do,

2042
01:53:04,670 --> 01:53:07,130
but it really takes technique
and practice and you know,

2043
01:53:07,131 --> 01:53:11,030
a girl can get to the point where she
could fucking kill a man where she can

2044
01:53:11,031 --> 01:53:13,100
dominate a man doesn't take that much.
It doesn't take that much.

2045
01:53:13,101 --> 01:53:14,510
Especially when you think about your legs.

2046
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:18,110
A girl has legs that are willing to carry
around her hundred and 30 pound body

2047
01:53:18,111 --> 01:53:21,980
all day long and he puts it,
doesn't, Cyborg doesn't count.

2048
01:53:21,981 --> 01:53:25,730
That's a set of accounts
like Shana Baseline. I mean
she does count, but she's,

2049
01:53:25,731 --> 01:53:29,450
you know, obviously she's a broad end
of the spectrum. If you had to guess,

2050
01:53:29,451 --> 01:53:34,130
what would you say that's all about
what cyborg she does. You know, she,

2051
01:53:34,250 --> 01:53:37,680
she does everything she can.

2052
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:41,960
She can enhance her strength.
Yeah. Or She's just unusually,

2053
01:53:41,961 --> 01:53:44,860
very strong genetically. That's
possible too. Probably isn't an awesome,

2054
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:48,260
prissy boner. You know what's going to
take to beat her some crazy Samoan chick,

2055
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:52,930
another chess. Tom Check, some
justice stirring or 14,000 train.

2056
01:53:53,050 --> 01:53:56,660
Some fucking big German bitch
with big broad shoulders and shit.

2057
01:53:56,661 --> 01:54:00,290
You know someone, someone from a hardy
Viking fucking bloodline something strong.

2058
01:54:00,410 --> 01:54:04,940
How crazy is so bad ass fighter?
Like what the fuck is her name?

2059
01:54:04,941 --> 01:54:09,530
Gina Carano hot and can fuck you
like that's a rare combination.

2060
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:13,250
Cause usually the girls like a fuck
you up or ugly. It's never hot chicks.

2061
01:54:13,251 --> 01:54:16,430
They could fuck him except Kira.
Yeah, she's like the fuck up.

2062
01:54:16,431 --> 01:54:19,220
A lot of dudes in a street fight
or standing brawl street fight.

2063
01:54:19,340 --> 01:54:23,060
She'll kick off her pumps and fuck you up.
Leg kick you punch you in the face.

2064
01:54:23,070 --> 01:54:23,903
You don't know how

2065
01:54:25,580 --> 01:54:29,660
to get your ass kicked in front of all
your friends at a club by some hot showed

2066
01:54:29,750 --> 01:54:34,100
by a hot chick. Fucking Kael you too.
She could easily Kao a dude. Yeah. Hey,

2067
01:54:34,101 --> 01:54:36,890
how about this man? Why is it that
there's not that many black chicks in MMA?

2068
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:39,610
How many black chicks are there on
MMA every time I want strike force it.

2069
01:54:39,611 --> 01:54:42,860
So either Cyborg or there's
some white checks. It's, I mean,

2070
01:54:42,861 --> 01:54:45,390
you don't see that many a time
check a black chick to be cyborg.

2071
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:48,590
They can't force him for short classes.
That might be it.

2072
01:54:49,010 --> 01:54:51,740
I mean obviously this black chicks
can afford it, but the ones who can,

2073
01:54:51,741 --> 01:54:53,540
they didn't want to fight.
You know, it's like it's,

2074
01:54:53,550 --> 01:54:58,400
it hasn't permeated into the ghettos the
way it has in other cultures in other

2075
01:54:58,401 --> 01:55:01,910
countries, you know, in Brazil and
it's permeated into the lower end.

2076
01:55:01,911 --> 01:55:05,360
People look at it as a way
to like, you know, and then
also, you know, even the, the,

2077
01:55:05,361 --> 01:55:06,980
the people who are educated in,

2078
01:55:06,981 --> 01:55:09,980
in like Damien Maia comes from
a wealthy background. He comes,

2079
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:14,240
but just the sheer desire and
drive to fight for him, you know?

2080
01:55:14,241 --> 01:55:17,780
So it became exciting and interesting to
him. It's not necessarily with chicks,

2081
01:55:17,781 --> 01:55:20,540
it's, it takes a very special check
to want to go in there and throw down.

2082
01:55:20,570 --> 01:55:25,570
Right now at the level the sport is
for women's MMA right now it's so tiny.

2083
01:55:26,151 --> 01:55:29,840
There are so few girls that are doing
it that like Venus and Serena could jump

2084
01:55:29,841 --> 01:55:33,710
into on a mountain and fuck chicks
up light away within a year.

2085
01:55:34,680 --> 01:55:38,540
You know the biggest one can
fight cycle within a year

2086
01:55:40,460 --> 01:55:45,390
they would fuck up. Ticks had been traded
six years. Her legs are like football,

2087
01:55:45,391 --> 01:55:47,550
like male football player.
Let's make it happen.

2088
01:55:47,551 --> 01:55:50,700
Could you imagine her leg kicking you?
Just digging in.

2089
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:54,530
You know boss Wooten styled big in
that fucking Shannon. I'll tell you.

2090
01:55:55,090 --> 01:55:56,640
Imagine what kind of damage she could do.

2091
01:55:56,640 --> 01:55:59,070
The amount of distance she
could cover so quickly.

2092
01:55:59,130 --> 01:56:01,700
They could consistently get tennis.
They can easily get bored.

2093
01:56:01,701 --> 01:56:05,190
A fucking tennis match so well I,
you know what they could do?

2094
01:56:05,330 --> 01:56:09,270
It could enhance their training for
tennis. It could make them more explosive.

2095
01:56:09,360 --> 01:56:12,060
If they decided to get into
MMA just into Moy Tai and shit,

2096
01:56:12,150 --> 01:56:13,740
just enhance their tennis turtle.

2097
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:16,770
It would definitely enhance their movement
and then they fall in love with it.

2098
01:56:16,860 --> 01:56:17,693
That's the hope.

2099
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:21,180
Some MMA for training and then have the
fall in love with it and then someone

2100
01:56:21,181 --> 01:56:25,050
offers like a big money fight to imagine.
Imagine their knees,

2101
01:56:25,330 --> 01:56:29,700
the knees would be like, God fucking
insane. There is a grip on that.

2102
01:56:29,701 --> 01:56:31,320
Tennis racket must be death.
Right,

2103
01:56:31,350 --> 01:56:36,300
but we didn't use that shit over the back
of your neck and need him the fuck up.

2104
01:56:36,301 --> 01:56:38,730
I was going to train them. I go,
let's, let's just start with the knees.

2105
01:56:38,731 --> 01:56:40,350
Get really good at the,
at the Thai clinch.

2106
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:43,230
Get really good at that and then we'll
expand from there. Yeah. What'd you say?

2107
01:56:43,231 --> 01:56:48,090
The booty clinch, Judy Chu's. Yeah,
man. I had double leg after a year.

2108
01:56:48,150 --> 01:56:52,560
Giant asses from all right. Jumping.
They're double legs would be like GSP.

2109
01:56:52,710 --> 01:56:56,520
Jesus fucking Christ
pitches the cashed checks.

2110
01:56:57,030 --> 01:56:59,460
They would probably be the greatest MMA.
Imagine if they,

2111
01:56:59,461 --> 01:57:03,330
if they fought together like Minataro
and his brother do. Yeah, that'd be,

2112
01:57:03,540 --> 01:57:05,850
they would be in sand.
There would be the crushers.

2113
01:57:06,330 --> 01:57:07,620
They would have to
eventually fight each other.

2114
01:57:07,621 --> 01:57:10,650
That'd be the only way they is kind
of black chicks out there. Fine.

2115
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:12,810
There's got to pee.
There definitely are.

2116
01:57:12,811 --> 01:57:14,760
I've definitely seen
black chicks fight in MMA.

2117
01:57:14,790 --> 01:57:18,120
I just haven't seen the percentage
is much lower than than girls.

2118
01:57:18,121 --> 01:57:19,950
For some reason.
Within a white girl's brother.

2119
01:57:19,951 --> 01:57:22,650
For some reason it seems like more
white girls are doing a lot of Spanish.

2120
01:57:22,651 --> 01:57:25,590
Girls are doing a lot of Japanese
checks. Japanese. Very popular. Right?

2121
01:57:26,220 --> 01:57:29,860
There's a Badass Japanese chicks.
We're going to be Fuji that bitches bad.

2122
01:57:29,861 --> 01:57:32,520
She's young. She's bet. What you
just making people up, Brian,

2123
01:57:32,521 --> 01:57:33,660
you let me know what the
fuck you talking about?

2124
01:57:34,040 --> 01:57:37,860
Zalia Fosto isn't she fighting tonight
too? I don't know. And start a course.

2125
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:38,520
I don't know.

2126
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:42,030
We could find out real quick is going
to get mad at us for pumping up strike

2127
01:57:42,050 --> 01:57:42,883
force.

2128
01:57:45,540 --> 01:57:46,160
Yeah.

2129
01:57:46,160 --> 01:57:48,890
So Brian, what goes through your mind
when we're talking about all this?

2130
01:57:48,980 --> 01:57:53,000
How will you know? I always get
something every year I start liking,

2131
01:57:53,001 --> 01:57:54,950
like I just recently
started liking ice tea,

2132
01:57:55,250 --> 01:57:58,190
but I haven't got to the grapefruit
part and I'm just wondering if that's

2133
01:57:58,191 --> 01:58:01,430
something that happens later in life.
You start liking grapefruits.

2134
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:04,240
One Who fucking likes?
My Dad likes to eat grapefruits.

2135
01:58:04,250 --> 01:58:06,530
Do you like to eat grapefruits?
Well, I love grapefruits.

2136
01:58:06,620 --> 01:58:09,590
I think they're delicious. Oh, you got
a good one. I think. Did you, your wife,

2137
01:58:09,591 --> 01:58:12,020
you'd like grapefruits
or did it come later? No,

2138
01:58:12,021 --> 01:58:13,250
I kinda liked him when I was young.

2139
01:58:13,251 --> 01:58:16,380
I used to drink a lot of grapefruit
juice cause I heard it was even higher in

2140
01:58:16,381 --> 01:58:19,210
vitamin C than an orange juice.
That might be not true. Yeah.

2141
01:58:19,490 --> 01:58:24,380
Bobby Lashley is fighting. Who'd you say?
Who you ask? What's Phyton? Zalia frosto

2142
01:58:25,970 --> 01:58:28,070
maybe she's not fighting. I
thought, I don't see that.

2143
01:58:28,130 --> 01:58:29,560
I don't see any girls in the car.

2144
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:34,510
Andre Galvao was supposed to be fighting
McCargo but Macaca didn't show up.

2145
01:58:35,140 --> 01:58:36,760
Who was gonna fight him?
Um,

2146
01:58:38,150 --> 01:58:38,710
yeah.

2147
01:58:38,710 --> 01:58:42,420
Oh, um, Andre. Dan

2148
01:58:42,450 --> 01:58:46,580
have been awesome. I love Andrea Kako
and Macaca was banished Jujitsu. Oh,

2149
01:58:46,610 --> 01:58:50,740
legend man. Yeah. I wonder what happened.
I don't know. It happened not on at all.

2150
01:58:51,580 --> 01:58:53,950
It was on the undercard anyway,
and there's no way to see the undercard,

2151
01:58:53,951 --> 01:58:56,950
which sucks because some of these
songs singing about the UFC too.

2152
01:58:57,100 --> 01:58:59,470
I mean you can watch them
online after the event is over,

2153
01:58:59,471 --> 01:59:03,160
but then she'd be away that you could
just tune in to just the whole undercard

2154
01:59:03,161 --> 01:59:05,980
like from the moment that first fight
starts the first fight at four o'clock in

2155
01:59:05,981 --> 01:59:08,140
the afternoon. Show me that
shit. Why are you saving?

2156
01:59:08,141 --> 01:59:12,160
They don't have that like
on like a certain channel
on the ufc.com which I love

2157
01:59:12,161 --> 01:59:15,400
the fact that you can always get any
fight you want on ufc.com that's the shit.

2158
01:59:15,401 --> 01:59:19,450
But me as a fan, you know, if I find out
that the first fight of the night is,

2159
01:59:19,451 --> 01:59:22,690
you know, fucking two guys
that I know, I know their name,

2160
01:59:22,691 --> 01:59:25,610
they're not like mainstream guys, but
I know they're both bad ass. Like,

2161
01:59:25,690 --> 01:59:30,190
like Hayzlett and uh, and Rick Story.
Here's a perfect example. That one aired,

2162
01:59:30,191 --> 01:59:33,760
right? Did that air? I don't
remember. Okay. But if it didn't air,

2163
01:59:33,790 --> 01:59:35,890
imagine what that fight was on
the undercard. It wasn't airing.

2164
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:39,460
I would want to fucking see that
fight, man, when it's happening.

2165
01:59:39,580 --> 01:59:43,240
I don't want to go on the underground
and find the results out right after it.

2166
01:59:43,241 --> 01:59:47,080
And I can't see the video and then click
on ESPN three d if it's being filmed in

2167
01:59:47,081 --> 01:59:51,190
three d, they, whoever, I
don't know. That's a good
idea. I mean, I guess there's,

2168
01:59:51,220 --> 01:59:54,400
there's must be a method to their
madness, but the reality is, man,

2169
01:59:54,401 --> 01:59:57,580
you could just overdose on MMA if
they wanted to show you everything.

2170
01:59:58,760 --> 02:00:00,220
The people that are putting this together,

2171
02:00:00,250 --> 02:00:02,800
like the people that are making
these decisions don't realize,

2172
02:00:02,950 --> 02:00:07,120
realize how important all of these fights
are to the fans, the hardcore fans.

2173
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:08,630
We want to see all of them.
It's not like box.

2174
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:11,710
It makes me sick when I look at this car,
like this card is nasty.

2175
02:00:11,711 --> 02:00:12,491
Like I'm looking at the car,

2176
02:00:12,491 --> 02:00:14,530
there's great fights in the car
and I'm looking forward to it.

2177
02:00:14,710 --> 02:00:17,170
But then when I looked down and I see,
I know it didn't happen,

2178
02:00:17,171 --> 02:00:20,860
but I looked down and see golf valve
versus fucking Macaca. I go, Oh shit,

2179
02:00:20,861 --> 02:00:25,330
that's a bad ass fight.
Venetia is Magallanes Draka
Coleen. Oh versus rocky long.

2180
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:26,980
I want to see that fight.
How come I can't see it?

2181
02:00:27,190 --> 02:00:31,380
You know the crazy thing and Macaca most
people newbies don't understand that

2182
02:00:32,540 --> 02:00:35,380
the [inaudible] and then they was at,

2183
02:00:35,381 --> 02:00:39,700
that's right where MMA was that back in
the late nineties and that the dark area,

2184
02:00:39,790 --> 02:00:42,790
the dark period Macaca and pay late Landy,

2185
02:00:43,210 --> 02:00:47,380
they were considered like the shit,
the shit to weights out there.

2186
02:00:47,380 --> 02:00:50,500
There were insane palae knocked out
Matt Hughes in Kuwait. I remember that.

2187
02:00:50,530 --> 02:00:53,590
You know another legend
volleyed [inaudible] can I show,

2188
02:00:53,890 --> 02:00:56,080
can I show everybody this shirt?
What do I do?

2189
02:00:56,081 --> 02:00:59,360
How do I show the people the back of the
shirt? If you just turn around and say,

2190
02:00:59,380 --> 02:01:00,450
well,
why would look so you did.

2191
02:01:00,620 --> 02:01:04,700
There's this dude named while lead
Ishmael who is a a legend crossing grab.

2192
02:01:04,701 --> 02:01:06,910
When I was trying to across some
Gracie's place way back in [inaudible] 98

2193
02:01:06,911 --> 02:01:09,790
that's when I first met him.
When I started working for the old UFC.

2194
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:13,840
He fought Takahashi at that
UFC and UFC 12 and Dothan,

2195
02:01:13,841 --> 02:01:18,100
Alabama and this dude is just one of the
all time characters. Badass Jujitsu Guy,

2196
02:01:18,310 --> 02:01:23,110
choked, hoists, Gracie unconscious, but
he's famous for his terrible English.

2197
02:01:23,950 --> 02:01:28,690
He had a few with high end Gracie,
this high end. He's cook, he's Faggot,

2198
02:01:29,150 --> 02:01:33,410
Cook, kill him. He's cook. He's
fuck it. That's all even so hook.

2199
02:01:33,450 --> 02:01:37,790
Fuck a ton Chrissy. You know I'm saying
he's not damn man. I got to the pizzas.

2200
02:01:38,250 --> 02:01:40,010
I just walk with me and my girlfriend go

2201
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:43,520
to beach. I see that cook,
that faggot stemming there.

2202
02:01:43,521 --> 02:01:48,320
You need to find this Brian TV if you can
find this. Volleyed is mile. It's no w.

2203
02:01:48,340 --> 02:01:52,220
W. W a. It's, it's Waleed
but it's spelled with a w.

2204
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:53,920

2205
02:01:55,790 --> 02:01:58,510

2206
02:01:58,770 --> 02:02:01,550
I. S. I. S. M. A. I. L. Yeah.

2207
02:02:01,590 --> 02:02:04,650
And go on Youtube and find like a famous
interview. Yeah, it was like hard.

2208
02:02:04,700 --> 02:02:09,000
Hi Gracie. Mile high end
rot. Lion, Gracie, r.

2209
02:02:09,001 --> 02:02:13,260
Y. N. Gracie. You got to listen to
this guy talk cause it's got again,

2210
02:02:13,270 --> 02:02:14,460
I'm hilarious.
Anyway,

2211
02:02:14,461 --> 02:02:19,080
he's one of the coolest guys of all
time and a Badass Jujitsu guy and he uh,

2212
02:02:19,230 --> 02:02:23,280
he's famous to you and you
can say whatever you want.
When I mentioned it, Tracy,

2213
02:02:23,450 --> 02:02:23,710
hi.

2214
02:02:23,710 --> 02:02:28,200
Is that chicken and let everybody in the
light beat the he one minute they have

2215
02:02:28,690 --> 02:02:33,460
no, I don't want to talk about this
chicken. You'll see those guys are weak.

2216
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:38,080
I told you, I told the by
everybody. I remember the
last time I come here and say,

2217
02:02:38,081 --> 02:02:41,140
Hey, this guy's nothing. Is that a week?

2218
02:02:41,570 --> 02:02:44,470
You'll know everyday say
read the question everyday.

2219
02:02:44,471 --> 02:02:46,930
Say before the fight happened,
the fight.

2220
02:02:47,230 --> 02:02:52,180
I just want everybody who remind
everybody to remember everything they say

2221
02:02:52,181 --> 02:02:56,030
before the fight. The happy, the fight.
You know what I mean? You'll see.

2222
02:02:56,031 --> 02:03:00,910
Like I told Dave about I ready to
fight so hard. I showed with the bike.

2223
02:03:00,940 --> 02:03:01,773
Can imagine

2224
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:07,710
better to the rest time much
better because at 10 hertz
and though why not go to

2225
02:03:07,720 --> 02:03:12,220
party? I don't know my foot scrub
out to, but I'll do, I go to trade.

2226
02:03:12,580 --> 02:03:16,840
I guess it is. Oh right. Let's go
through. You know I go twain, I'm ready.

2227
02:03:17,140 --> 02:03:21,110
I it didn't bubble. You don't instead of
having gotten, have a good [inaudible].

2228
02:03:21,790 --> 02:03:25,390
I know I have hard. No, I
have your heart to fight.

2229
02:03:25,630 --> 02:03:30,610
There's no doubt about, you'll see
there'd be a lot of guy stuck. A Lotta no,

2230
02:03:30,740 --> 02:03:35,520
she shit serious like you, this Guy
Hicks on grace yet. So Hi Baba Baba Baba.

2231
02:03:35,630 --> 02:03:40,560
Stay inside the home not to go show
up. You know what I mean? You know I,

2232
02:03:40,610 --> 02:03:45,040
I'm, I'm fighting all the
time on stand. I'm fine. No,

2233
02:03:45,041 --> 02:03:46,180
I'm ready to fight.

2234
02:03:46,730 --> 02:03:50,790
I'm say I am not staying
inside my home as a here.

2235
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:54,790
Wait Stacy. Yeah, he talked
about, she's crazy to hear.

2236
02:03:55,120 --> 02:03:58,480
Almost in tears one day asking me who
got you want to fight this guy up with a

2237
02:03:58,481 --> 02:04:03,170
fight because you image a bit for
greatness. I beat high and Gracie,

2238
02:04:03,171 --> 02:04:05,740
he Kasi. I bet how you Gracie, he's,

2239
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:10,270
he's got he's guys Cozzie I bet.
Here's a greater, he skies it.

2240
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:14,590
I beat the highest degrees that he's
abroad there. What they're gonna do. Neti.

2241
02:04:15,070 --> 02:04:17,920
C'Mon man. Show up. Yeah.

2242
02:04:17,930 --> 02:04:22,930
He was talking shit to Hixon this wall
over the god that was a different video

2243
02:04:23,621 --> 02:04:25,870
actually that was got
that one before we talk.

2244
02:04:25,871 --> 02:04:28,990
He wouldn't after Hixon in that role.
The time shit about Hixon.

2245
02:04:28,991 --> 02:04:32,560
I can't believe that. For people
who don't know Hixon Gracie is like,

2246
02:04:33,010 --> 02:04:35,170
he's like the god of Jujitsu.

2247
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:37,830
If you named one guy that everybody
says is just head and shoulders above

2248
02:04:37,831 --> 02:04:38,160
everybody

2249
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:43,140
else, it's Hixon. No, it's hard to
see man. Hold on there. It says,

2250
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:47,670
what it says is don't be coward.
Don't run off the fight.

2251
02:04:47,700 --> 02:04:50,340
That's a Waleed Ishmael tee
shirt. It's odd. We got it.

2252
02:04:52,710 --> 02:04:56,800
Don't be coward. Don't run off the
fight. Then he had that printed. Yeah,

2253
02:04:56,801 --> 02:05:01,480
and like you sure you want to spell it
this and this is my fin for you say don't

2254
02:05:01,481 --> 02:05:06,400
be coward sir,
but it says don't be cowered on a stand.

2255
02:05:06,401 --> 02:05:10,510
I know. Don't be a coward. No,
don't be coward. Not A, okay.

2256
02:05:10,511 --> 02:05:12,920
I'm going to have to have you
initial this really quick for me.

2257
02:05:12,940 --> 02:05:15,760
Just put your initials right here
and right there and right there.

2258
02:05:15,790 --> 02:05:19,270
I'm not scared. You want to take a look
at it one more time? One more time.

2259
02:05:19,450 --> 02:05:21,800
It's perfect for him. He probably looks
at it and goes, that's exactly what I,

2260
02:05:21,810 --> 02:05:26,770
I say, don't be coward. Don't want have to
fight. That's fucking nonsense. Proliant.

2261
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:29,080
I would never had one and I lost her

2262
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:32,750
and I'm so sad that I lost it. Now does
he go home and just be like, hey hon,

2263
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:35,000
how's it going? I'm home.
He's a super cool guy.

2264
02:05:35,590 --> 02:05:40,360
Okay, cool. Then it's like a
character could sorta camera comes on.

2265
02:05:40,520 --> 02:05:43,330
He's playing the camera camera.
Sort of like Chael Sonnen.

2266
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:45,910
He's the Brazilian channels something.
He's talking shit and sell fights.

2267
02:05:45,911 --> 02:05:48,170
But he's also talking shit
cause he's a bad mother fucker.

2268
02:05:48,171 --> 02:05:52,110
And this guy chose buddies. Really?
Gracie. Completely unconscious. Yeah.

2269
02:05:52,180 --> 02:05:52,781
He caught hoists.

2270
02:05:52,781 --> 02:05:55,450
Gracie and a clock choke in a
Jujitsu match and putting the sleep.

2271
02:05:55,510 --> 02:05:57,190
This is after hoists became huge.

2272
02:05:57,220 --> 02:06:00,730
Voice was giant because of the UFC and
he did this on the beach in Brazil in

2273
02:06:00,731 --> 02:06:02,630
front of everybody.
Remember that? Exactly what?

2274
02:06:02,631 --> 02:06:07,020
I'm gonna be Super Nice every time I run
into him backstage at the FCA happens.

2275
02:06:07,680 --> 02:06:10,750
Friendly hugs. Super, super happy guy.

2276
02:06:11,080 --> 02:06:12,940
I mean he said you did two legend

2277
02:06:13,050 --> 02:06:17,580
for sure. There's a lot, there's a handful
of legends in Jujitsu, but while he'd,

2278
02:06:17,581 --> 02:06:19,350
Ishmael is definitely a legend.
Just the,

2279
02:06:19,590 --> 02:06:21,640
just the fact that he choked
out hoists Gracie like

2280
02:06:21,810 --> 02:06:23,660
Ah, you know what? As a brown belt,

2281
02:06:23,661 --> 02:06:28,280
he won against our master John
Jackman shadow and he lost,

2282
02:06:28,281 --> 02:06:30,800
but it was a close match and
Jon talk was a black belt. No,

2283
02:06:30,830 --> 02:06:33,710
everybody was scared of John Shock at
that point. No one wanted to step up,

2284
02:06:33,980 --> 02:06:38,550
but volleyed as a brown belt stepped up,
he lost. But Dad was a battle. It wasn't,

2285
02:06:38,780 --> 02:06:39,613
it wasn't.

2286
02:06:39,830 --> 02:06:42,170
His Jujitsu is very strong.
He's just helped.

2287
02:06:42,171 --> 02:06:46,100
Bull is a bull of a man and he will not
give up and he gets cuts through dudes.

2288
02:06:46,101 --> 02:06:49,940
Man, he's strong as fuck and one of the
nicest guys ever. We had a great picture.

2289
02:06:50,090 --> 02:06:52,790
It's still on my mom's face page.
My myspace page is like,

2290
02:06:53,030 --> 02:06:54,530
it's like a abandoned playground,

2291
02:06:54,770 --> 02:06:58,040
but if you go to my photos
is one of us with Waleed.

2292
02:06:58,200 --> 02:06:59,810
We're all screaming Jujitsu.

2293
02:07:00,040 --> 02:07:03,690
Yeah, it's on my mind. It's on my mind
space too. I got it up there. It's a

2294
02:07:03,690 --> 02:07:07,440
classic. My space.com/the twister.
Yeah, and if they want to find Eddie,

2295
02:07:07,441 --> 02:07:08,280
that's where it's at.
Damn.

2296
02:07:08,281 --> 02:07:11,310
This show's been going on for an hour
or two hours and 20 minutes. By the way,

2297
02:07:11,311 --> 02:07:15,900
Joe, you gotta check out pet seaman.
Terry? No, I don't scare you.

2298
02:07:15,901 --> 02:07:18,330
I don't want to know about that. Finding
or die. No, it's on funny or die.

2299
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:21,630
You don't have to be redone.
I'm fucking hooked on Stephen King's son.

2300
02:07:21,810 --> 02:07:25,230
Stephen King's son is named Joe Hill
and he's a horror writer as well.

2301
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:29,070
Really fucking good. I'm reading this
book called the heart shaped box.

2302
02:07:29,250 --> 02:07:31,960
Somebody put it on the message board.
[inaudible] they put the, you know the,

2303
02:07:32,040 --> 02:07:34,710
his son's a writer, so I said,
fuck it. I'll buy it on the IPAD.

2304
02:07:34,711 --> 02:07:38,980
You know I the kindle thing on the
IPAD. It's fucking great book, man.

2305
02:07:38,981 --> 02:07:42,560
Just like his dad. It's like he
inherited his dad's brain. I mean,

2306
02:07:42,590 --> 02:07:45,700
it's fucking good. I'm halfway
into this book. It's a total page.

2307
02:07:45,710 --> 02:07:47,860
Maybe he wrote it for his son.
You would love it.

2308
02:07:47,861 --> 02:07:49,800
It's about a a fucking rock star.

2309
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:54,010
Who a is like a goth dude who's like
into all kinds of creepy, weird shit.

2310
02:07:54,011 --> 02:07:58,060
Like he's got like a head from a guy who
had been tortured and he puts fucking

2311
02:07:58,300 --> 02:08:02,420
like pens in the, in the
skull. Sounds like Marilyn
Manson. Exactly. That kind of,

2312
02:08:02,460 --> 02:08:07,460
it's just a crazy old goth dude
and he buys a ghost online.

2313
02:08:07,930 --> 02:08:09,580
Someone's selling a dead man suit.

2314
02:08:09,670 --> 02:08:12,160
And this woman who is selling it as saying
that there's a ghost that comes along

2315
02:08:12,161 --> 02:08:13,490
with it.
This guy thinks for a goof,

2316
02:08:13,491 --> 02:08:15,640
he's going to buy this fucking suit
and it's going to be kind of cool,

2317
02:08:15,730 --> 02:08:19,210
but the dead man actually does
Honda. Dude, it's fun man.

2318
02:08:19,240 --> 02:08:22,540
It's a fucking Paige Turner.
It's a good God damn well written book.

2319
02:08:23,170 --> 02:08:25,150
Fucking something about
books, man. You know,

2320
02:08:25,151 --> 02:08:27,460
you can get so deep into
a story with a book,

2321
02:08:27,730 --> 02:08:30,790
you know that you just can't get in a
movie. I want to see everything. You know,

2322
02:08:30,791 --> 02:08:31,481
I love movies.

2323
02:08:31,481 --> 02:08:34,600
I love the fact that it's like a two
hour ordeal and it's over and I'm out of

2324
02:08:34,601 --> 02:08:36,250
there like that. It was pretty
cool. They wrapped it up nicely,

2325
02:08:36,700 --> 02:08:39,430
but there's something fucking
killer about books, man.

2326
02:08:39,670 --> 02:08:42,100
I didn't appreciate that for a long time.
For a long time,

2327
02:08:42,101 --> 02:08:45,580
I didn't appreciate just the, the flat
imagination of sitting there reading text,

2328
02:08:45,820 --> 02:08:46,810
but there's something cool now.

2329
02:08:46,850 --> 02:08:50,600
I like how you build your own characters
in your head saying this person has a

2330
02:08:50,601 --> 02:08:52,370
certain look to you in your head.

2331
02:08:52,430 --> 02:08:55,580
That is your own unique way of
thinking about what this person,

2332
02:08:55,720 --> 02:08:56,141
yeah,

2333
02:08:56,141 --> 02:08:59,830
and they can make some really exciting
shit that's just completely unrealistic

2334
02:08:59,831 --> 02:09:01,060
for a regular movie.

2335
02:09:01,061 --> 02:09:04,570
You don't have to have giant
fucking special effects
budgets and then have to be

2336
02:09:04,571 --> 02:09:05,620
crazy off the charts,

2337
02:09:05,860 --> 02:09:08,560
but they're just describing it with
their words and creating this incredible

2338
02:09:08,561 --> 02:09:12,880
picture in your, in your own head. You
know, what am I saying? Reading is good.

2339
02:09:12,881 --> 02:09:14,470
Reading is fundamental.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2340
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:20,400
this show like all shows bitches brought
to you by the fleshlight Hollaback.

2341
02:09:20,860 --> 02:09:24,580
If you buy it online on Joe
rogan.net I believe you get 15% off.

2342
02:09:24,610 --> 02:09:27,520
And one of the reasons, there's two
reasons why we have the sponsor,

2343
02:09:27,521 --> 02:09:31,970
our podcast one is because a, we met
with Krista, one of the guys who run set,

2344
02:09:32,010 --> 02:09:33,450
we're going to hang out somehow with an,

2345
02:09:33,560 --> 02:09:35,950
we're going to hang out with
them in Austin, Texas when
we go there for the UFC.

2346
02:09:36,040 --> 02:09:38,740
Just a super cool chill dude.
And it just seemed like,

2347
02:09:38,950 --> 02:09:43,360
and the other thing was that I think it's
a, it's for real, legit good product.

2348
02:09:43,361 --> 02:09:44,400
I use it and it's,

2349
02:09:44,470 --> 02:09:48,370
it's way better than just beating off
and cause I think it's ridiculous that

2350
02:09:48,371 --> 02:09:51,730
people think that it's, um,
there's something taboo about
it. I think that's silly.

2351
02:09:52,270 --> 02:09:54,600
You know, I don't know what it is,
but there, there's something, uh,

2352
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:57,550
that I think is absolutely ridiculous
that people think that something silly

2353
02:09:57,551 --> 02:09:58,630
about pursuing pleasure

2354
02:09:58,760 --> 02:10:01,400
and we can use it in the
shower. Fuck yes, totally.

2355
02:10:01,490 --> 02:10:04,520
I think that's the best spot we should
really talk to though about getting a

2356
02:10:04,550 --> 02:10:07,560
fleshlight out version of it.
It could be your own personal flashlights.

2357
02:10:08,030 --> 02:10:08,271
Yeah.

2358
02:10:08,271 --> 02:10:11,270
I was talking about this book and this
is the book that I talked about with Dane

2359
02:10:11,270 --> 02:10:12,770
Cook and I've talked about
it with other people before.

2360
02:10:13,070 --> 02:10:15,830
I've given this book to a bunch of my
friends. I'll give it to you, right Brian?

2361
02:10:16,010 --> 02:10:17,780
It's called the war of art.
I want to give it to you.

2362
02:10:17,781 --> 02:10:18,620
I want you to read this shit.

2363
02:10:18,650 --> 02:10:21,470
Have you ever given us this
book for creative people?

2364
02:10:21,471 --> 02:10:24,020
It's one of the best books and
I'm not getting paid for this.

2365
02:10:24,021 --> 02:10:27,020
This is just my own recommendation.
It's a fucking fantastic book.

2366
02:10:27,050 --> 02:10:29,960
If you're an artist, if you're
a comedian, if you're already,

2367
02:10:29,961 --> 02:10:33,260
and I were just having a conversation
about this today because Ari a took a um,

2368
02:10:33,680 --> 02:10:36,080
uh, what are those Adderalls
it took an Adderall,

2369
02:10:36,081 --> 02:10:38,240
which is why he can't be here today
cause he's cleaning up his house.

2370
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:42,320
That's awesome. Really? Yeah. Yeah. Our,
he's been on a positive kick lately, man.

2371
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:44,000
You've been having some
really cool conversations.

2372
02:10:44,001 --> 02:10:46,340
We had a really cool one today.
We were talking about like burning,

2373
02:10:46,370 --> 02:10:47,450
like pass enemies,

2374
02:10:47,451 --> 02:10:51,440
like letting old grudges go and he's
trying to be more healthy with his mind.

2375
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:56,270
And we talked about um, how, you know,
it takes like he is on his Adderall,

2376
02:10:56,271 --> 02:10:58,690
he takes an Adderall now he wants
a fucking cleaning his house up.

2377
02:10:58,700 --> 02:11:00,590
He wants to write some material.
And he was like,

2378
02:11:00,640 --> 02:11:03,830
what's so crazy that if you worked
as an accountant you would want,

2379
02:11:03,831 --> 02:11:06,530
while you're at work you would want to
sneak away and write jokes, you know?

2380
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:08,510
But when you're not,
when you're a comedian,

2381
02:11:08,511 --> 02:11:10,910
you don't ever sit in front of the
fucking computer and actually write jokes.

2382
02:11:11,180 --> 02:11:13,460
It's like you find a way
to fuck off and not do it.

2383
02:11:13,490 --> 02:11:15,740
And it's all explained by this book.

2384
02:11:15,741 --> 02:11:20,090
This book is a fascinating look
into the psychology of creativity,

2385
02:11:20,390 --> 02:11:23,630
not just about writing,
but I think it applies to any kind of art,

2386
02:11:23,660 --> 02:11:26,270
any kind of thing where you're supposed
to be dedicating a certain amount of

2387
02:11:26,271 --> 02:11:28,730
time to thinking about things.
It was fucking fantastic.

2388
02:11:28,731 --> 02:11:30,020
So I bought a stack of
them cause I was on,

2389
02:11:30,021 --> 02:11:32,470
I wanted to give Dane Cook one
when he was here and uh, I,

2390
02:11:32,550 --> 02:11:35,870
I couldn't find it so I just bought a new
stack. So just, just Google that shit.

2391
02:11:35,871 --> 02:11:38,300
Buy It online. I'm telling
you it's a quick, easy read.

2392
02:11:38,660 --> 02:11:42,320
It's only like a hundred pages or some
shit. It's not my much to it. Yeah.

2393
02:11:42,321 --> 02:11:46,070
163 pages. It's not
that much. And you know,

2394
02:11:46,071 --> 02:11:48,220
you can get a lot out of it just
from a couple of chapters. You know,

2395
02:11:48,221 --> 02:11:49,130
you have to read the whole thing.

2396
02:11:49,131 --> 02:11:51,830
Just listen to what that fucking
guy says and just try it.

2397
02:11:52,190 --> 02:11:55,930
Just force yourself to create, you know,
there's a lot of shit going on that you,

2398
02:11:55,931 --> 02:11:59,450
you, you, you distract yourself with.
It's not really that necessary. So

2399
02:12:00,950 --> 02:12:03,950
that's my message for the day. Thank you
very much. That's my positive message.

2400
02:12:04,010 --> 02:12:05,990
Brian, do you have anything
to say before we wrap this up?

2401
02:12:06,060 --> 02:12:10,320
No. Check out my video though.
Pet Cemetery. Is that, did
you make this video? Yeah.

2402
02:12:10,410 --> 02:12:14,490
Oh, okay. It's only a minute long.
Funny or die one guy. One Cup,

2403
02:12:14,491 --> 02:12:17,460
sort of a subset of trouble
with it already got in
trouble with already getting

2404
02:12:17,461 --> 02:12:21,060
in trouble. The police spelled this
video out for our friends. Hit P,

2405
02:12:21,061 --> 02:12:25,440
e t and then the next word is
cemetery, but seamen as Amy, m,

2406
02:12:25,500 --> 02:12:29,380
e n, t, a, r y. Seaman, Terry
Seaman. Terry [inaudible].

2407
02:12:30,030 --> 02:12:34,590
And what is it about, uh, two young
guys finding love. Really? Yeah.

2408
02:12:34,770 --> 02:12:36,720
It's funny. Yeah. I'm getting
one to watch it right now.

2409
02:12:36,780 --> 02:12:39,960
How long has it put it on your computer
and as long. Is it one minute long.

2410
02:12:39,961 --> 02:12:42,140
One minute long? Yeah. Okay. We're
going to watch this then we're going to,

2411
02:12:42,370 --> 02:12:44,430
we'll give you our thoughts about this
and that's how we're going to end the

2412
02:12:44,431 --> 02:12:48,170
show is a gentleman. This is on a
youtube, funny or die funny or die? I can,

2413
02:12:48,180 --> 02:12:52,350
I'm not putting on Youtube cause
will get fucked up. What will happen?

2414
02:12:52,930 --> 02:12:55,530
You'll see it this illegal.

2415
02:12:55,560 --> 02:12:57,630
Am I doing something illegal
that it's not illegal at all,

2416
02:12:57,750 --> 02:12:59,340
but it's edited to look illegal.

2417
02:13:01,400 --> 02:13:01,600
Yeah.

2418
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:06,160
Let's type in pet cemetery.
Pat Seaman. Terry, here it is.

2419
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:07,353
We're going to watch it.

2420
02:13:07,800 --> 02:13:08,633
Hmm.

2421
02:13:09,550 --> 02:13:11,260
But I can't turn my volume on.
All right.

2422
02:13:11,261 --> 02:13:13,330
I can't talk while this was going
to ask, what's going on. Oh,

2423
02:13:13,331 --> 02:13:14,770
I don't watch it and close your eyes.
See,

2424
02:13:27,030 --> 02:13:28,140
okay.
What we're watching

2425
02:13:30,780 --> 02:13:34,590
is and his friend Ari and
they're fucking animals.

2426
02:13:41,420 --> 02:13:42,260
Oh my God.

2427
02:13:46,660 --> 02:13:51,380
Fuck is wrong with you guys. Oh
my God. You shouldn't be in jail.

2428
02:13:52,190 --> 02:13:54,860
You should be in jail for that
and I mean you've got to see that

2429
02:13:56,360 --> 02:13:59,420
ladies and gentlemen, that was
just, I don't want you to see this.

2430
02:14:00,280 --> 02:14:03,470
I don't want you to watch it because I
know you'll feel less about Brian and I

2431
02:14:03,471 --> 02:14:06,350
know you feel you'll think less about Ari.
Glean out for me.

2432
02:14:06,351 --> 02:14:07,540
Why is it pet cemetery?

2433
02:14:07,680 --> 02:14:09,890
Because there were fucking animals
and shooting semen inside of them.

2434
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:14,150
Then you watch the video semen,
but it's like cemetery. Oh my God,

2435
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:15,073
that's so strange.

2436
02:14:16,270 --> 02:14:17,103
You don't know what we're talking.

2437
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:20,370
They played that live in front of a, the
last night he, Cheryl did it. Really?

2438
02:14:20,790 --> 02:14:23,730
How do people react?
People just went crazy.

2439
02:14:23,731 --> 02:14:27,210
I guess they cheered that people
are in discussed cheering, laughing.

2440
02:14:27,211 --> 02:14:30,600
It was just pretty, and it's pretty
funny though. TMZ was there too.

2441
02:14:30,601 --> 02:14:32,490
It's pretty freely.
What a TMZ you have to say about,

2442
02:14:32,491 --> 02:14:34,550
you didn't say anything about that
shit. What the fuck, dude? You almost,

2443
02:14:34,570 --> 02:14:37,560
you were almost there and asked me did
you guys talk about being naked and I

2444
02:14:37,561 --> 02:14:40,890
should've just done it for that. Now Aria
has actually took it too far. Like, yeah,

2445
02:14:40,980 --> 02:14:44,400
I just wanted to fuck your cat for
real. Yeah. He went to the bathroom.

2446
02:14:44,401 --> 02:14:47,550
I thought the cat and the dog afterwards
and he said he was just like giving

2447
02:14:47,551 --> 02:14:50,700
them love and petting them
both. Shut up Ryan. I know.

2448
02:14:50,701 --> 02:14:52,020
When you're making things
up you can't trick.

2449
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:56,630
Did you play dicks out for real ever?
No. No. Ra did put us all legal.

2450
02:14:56,880 --> 02:14:59,100
He pulled down his pants and
yet boxes you could have hit.

2451
02:14:59,130 --> 02:15:02,680
You coulda hit your cock with a dog.
You know you're caught right dog.

2452
02:15:02,730 --> 02:15:06,180
It's all about [inaudible] music
is going to give you advice.

2453
02:15:06,181 --> 02:15:08,130
This is how you get away with this.
It's not about editing.

2454
02:15:08,131 --> 02:15:09,310
If you're going to make sure,
yeah.

2455
02:15:09,670 --> 02:15:13,130
Oh, hide your cock with
the dog. All right. Okay.

2456
02:15:13,270 --> 02:15:17,890
W if you saw the raw, the raw video of it
is just as like give us laugh. Oh yeah.

2457
02:15:17,891 --> 02:15:20,900
Love. But we're like rocking my,
we're doing it. You're making,

2458
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:24,210
when you're making out with the cat and
you've got your mouth over her. Nice.

2459
02:15:24,390 --> 02:15:26,910
Actually, it was on the side of his mouth
and I was just like, I'm bored. Blah,

2460
02:15:26,911 --> 02:15:28,830
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah. Time to watch, man.

2461
02:15:29,340 --> 02:15:30,670
Feel like you're doing something wrong.

2462
02:15:30,671 --> 02:15:35,671
Not that are just giving them a
loving lovings almost best reality.

2463
02:15:35,940 --> 02:15:38,360
It's, it's told the best reality. It's uh,

2464
02:15:38,780 --> 02:15:43,000
it's so time beastiality showtime
beastiality I was dating a girl once.

2465
02:15:43,001 --> 02:15:43,960
It was in one of those movies,

2466
02:15:44,900 --> 02:15:47,410
did her, and you know,
we, you know, we broke it.

2467
02:15:47,420 --> 02:15:48,680
We only dated for like
a short period time.

2468
02:15:48,710 --> 02:15:52,520
And then I saw her on this movie like
many, many, many, many, many years later.

2469
02:15:52,730 --> 02:15:57,730
She was on one of those fucking crazy
late night porn slash movies where she was

2470
02:15:58,191 --> 02:16:01,700
getting banged. Some dude was banging her
in a bed, but the position was all off,

2471
02:16:02,540 --> 02:16:04,920
you know, like his dick
was like, way down here.

2472
02:16:04,950 --> 02:16:08,480
I was like sticking it in that
pussy close, but it was like,

2473
02:16:08,481 --> 02:16:13,280
look at this dirty bitch. What a
weird job. Those chicks that only

2474
02:16:13,340 --> 02:16:17,480
do that kind of porn. Yeah, that's
all they do. It's like, you know,

2475
02:16:17,481 --> 02:16:21,980
it's just terrible acting. It was never
goes inside. It never goes into town.

2476
02:16:22,280 --> 02:16:25,700
She doesn't let you go. No penetration.
Sorry your pussy. And it's totally cool.

2477
02:16:25,701 --> 02:16:29,780
Dudes just like rabbit is taped balls,
closeup on her and she's like,

2478
02:16:29,790 --> 02:16:33,220
they take their dick to the side.
I wonder what the dudes get hard.

2479
02:16:33,430 --> 02:16:34,870
A buddy of mine did,
one of those he had,

2480
02:16:34,930 --> 02:16:36,490
he had to do a scene like that
with a check and she goes,

2481
02:16:36,491 --> 02:16:39,100
you can fuck me if you want
to know. And he was like, oh,

2482
02:16:39,101 --> 02:16:41,990
how many times have you said
that? That's like, think of,

2483
02:16:42,740 --> 02:16:45,610
we're actually going to have sex in those
movies, want, we'll do it all the time.

2484
02:16:45,611 --> 02:16:48,700
Apparently. If you see there was that
movie, uh, the, what was the, um,

2485
02:16:48,850 --> 02:16:51,730
there was nine and a half weeks and
Mickey Rourke and then there was the, um,

2486
02:16:51,880 --> 02:16:56,500
the sequel velvet violet, some
wild orchids. What now? That's it.

2487
02:16:56,650 --> 02:17:00,470
I say why would work very
strong, very strong. Anyway.

2488
02:17:00,471 --> 02:17:03,190
Apparently Mickey Rourke and
his girlfriend were in that
movie and make you work.

2489
02:17:03,191 --> 02:17:05,920
Really fucked his girlfriend and yeah,
everybody saw it.

2490
02:17:05,950 --> 02:17:10,780
Said [inaudible] happened. [inaudible]
showtime probably doesn't happen too much.

2491
02:17:11,470 --> 02:17:12,251
Very often at all.

2492
02:17:12,251 --> 02:17:14,780
I think Mickey work was just
completely out of control then he was,

2493
02:17:15,070 --> 02:17:19,200
he was boxing. He had his
fucking face implanted. He
was going crazy. You remember,

2494
02:17:19,590 --> 02:17:21,160
remember when he had cheekbones put in?

2495
02:17:21,980 --> 02:17:25,750
I still think you have to get
them removed. Yeah, for sure.

2496
02:17:25,751 --> 02:17:27,730
He doesn't look the same anymore.
If you go and look at, there was,

2497
02:17:27,910 --> 02:17:30,040
there was a period of time,
a dark period for Mickey Rourke.

2498
02:17:30,041 --> 02:17:33,790
He was in this Tupac movie and he was
on steroids. It was gigantic. Just Jack,

2499
02:17:33,791 --> 02:17:36,610
like a fucking professional bodybuilder
and he was playing like some street

2500
02:17:36,611 --> 02:17:40,570
fighter boxing character that was
like the beat the bottom, you know,

2501
02:17:40,571 --> 02:17:44,110
he like completely bottomed out and then
came back and I was in like iron man

2502
02:17:44,111 --> 02:17:47,320
two and shit and he's said, you know,
giant blockbuster movies and shit.

2503
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:50,980
He's like doing awesome. But for a
long time he was like off the deep end.

2504
02:17:50,981 --> 02:17:55,120
Crazy after he was a
huge challenge to star.

2505
02:17:55,970 --> 02:17:59,560
Then went like kiss when kiss went
into boxing at the end of kiss,

2506
02:17:59,561 --> 02:18:02,890
whatever a joke. He became a joke.
Nobody wanted to work with them.

2507
02:18:03,100 --> 02:18:06,310
And then apparently Robert
Rodriguez said like, you know,

2508
02:18:06,311 --> 02:18:10,310
like Quentin Tarantino and those dudes,
they like to bring in like, yeah,

2509
02:18:10,340 --> 02:18:14,710
weird character. John Travolta. He
resurrected John Travolta's career. Yeah,

2510
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:18,370
same thing. John Travolta was kind of
the joke before, cause up bad ass actor.

2511
02:18:18,371 --> 02:18:19,710
He's a bad motherfucker.

2512
02:18:20,050 --> 02:18:23,160
I've been in this fucking the Steven
Seagal go home though. Stephen Skull, um,

2513
02:18:23,380 --> 02:18:26,350
Stallone movie, which was a
silly movie. Even in that movie.

2514
02:18:26,351 --> 02:18:29,950
Mickey Rourke stole the scenes when he
was in the scenes. He's so real. I mean,

2515
02:18:29,951 --> 02:18:31,000
he's such a,
you know,

2516
02:18:31,030 --> 02:18:33,910
there's some dudes who are just so
good at that acting thing, you know,

2517
02:18:33,911 --> 02:18:36,220
and he's one of them. He's a,
he's a bad motherfucker at it.

2518
02:18:36,500 --> 02:18:39,310
He quit in the middle of being a
giant movie, started becoming a boxer.

2519
02:18:39,970 --> 02:18:42,850
He couldn't get any parts.
Was that what it was? I think,

2520
02:18:42,851 --> 02:18:45,100
I think didn't he the story
as who knows if it's true,

2521
02:18:45,101 --> 02:18:48,040
but the story is he got blackballed
because of Robert De Niro Angel Heart.

2522
02:18:49,390 --> 02:18:53,290
They had like such a feud or whatever
that Robertson and Ariela said,

2523
02:18:53,291 --> 02:18:53,831
this is the story.

2524
02:18:53,831 --> 02:18:58,090
It could be all rumors that Robert Dinero
said like basically if whatever movie

2525
02:18:58,091 --> 02:19:00,430
company he was signed with,
if you work with that dude again,

2526
02:19:00,431 --> 02:19:02,940
I'm not going to work with you.
It's so people what?

2527
02:19:03,050 --> 02:19:05,890
That's [inaudible] have a story like that.

2528
02:19:05,891 --> 02:19:09,700
You've got to research that shit on the
Internet. [inaudible] heard this story.

2529
02:19:09,730 --> 02:19:11,620
That's like the Rod Stewart
Stomach pucks though.

2530
02:19:11,621 --> 02:19:13,750
We have to find this out before
we're going to end this show.

2531
02:19:13,751 --> 02:19:16,180
But before we end the show, he must
find out if this is true. Otherwise,

2532
02:19:16,181 --> 02:19:20,120
we're spreading some crazy rumor. I said
about why you work for like that up.

2533
02:19:20,140 --> 02:19:23,350
I know, but let's find out what
their actual gear. There's no,

2534
02:19:23,380 --> 02:19:26,050
I know there is a real room or I'm
sure somebody actually told it to you,

2535
02:19:26,260 --> 02:19:28,010
but what it was just
someone in high school

2536
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:31,480

2537
02:19:31,970 --> 02:19:36,220
blackball blackballed. Yeah. That's
good. Blackball from Hollywood.

2538
02:19:37,030 --> 02:19:39,670
I don't believe this.
What? Say Ye Twitter.

2539
02:19:39,730 --> 02:19:42,910
I will let you people answer cause I
know there's some fucking movie buffs out

2540
02:19:42,911 --> 02:19:47,080
there. I am following you. I'm following
the Twitter feed right now. Someone,

2542
02:19:52,271 --> 02:19:56,470
blackballed from Hollywood ready and it's
not coming up with anything on Google.

2543
02:19:56,471 --> 02:20:01,000
I wish nobody gives a fuck about
this show. Dude. Don't spend,

2544
02:20:02,530 --> 02:20:06,880
I'm asking for help of getting
nothing. Let's try it. Everyone's out.

2545
02:20:07,360 --> 02:20:11,110
Yeah. Maybe. Maybe the show ended a long
time ago. Maybe we don't realize it,

2546
02:20:11,350 --> 02:20:15,280
but my wife won't eat shitty
all week at east guys.

2547
02:20:15,281 --> 02:20:19,030
Everyone's going out to the bars per
right now to watch strike force. Yeah.

2548
02:20:19,150 --> 02:20:22,450
So what's happened in Brian?
It is Strikeforce starts
in a half an hour. Oh Shit.

2549
02:20:22,750 --> 02:20:27,220
Pom Pom Pom. Yeah. Nothing. So I'm not
seeing shit. No one has an answer for me.

2550
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:30,310
All right, you fox. That's how
you guys want to do it. All right.

2551
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:35,200
No one's helping me, man. How many
people were watching the show?

2552
02:20:35,201 --> 02:20:36,980
Brian is 900 last night.

2553
02:20:37,150 --> 02:20:41,560
That's as good as we ever got to do ladies
and gentlemen. And on that note, um,

2554
02:20:42,190 --> 02:20:44,260
anything else to say?
What do you got there?

2555
02:20:45,460 --> 02:20:49,780
What does is, is is I was just going
to have some Indian music for you.

2556
02:20:50,260 --> 02:20:53,110
What is it? Is a gay, no.
Sounded Gay. Let's hear it.

2557
02:20:56,280 --> 02:20:57,140
Oh my,
no tracks.

2558
02:20:58,020 --> 02:21:01,770
I was just talking with a woman today
who says that she believes that Michael

2559
02:21:01,770 --> 02:21:04,500
Jackson was castrated.
I believe it.

2560
02:21:04,530 --> 02:21:07,210
She says there's no way a man can
sing like that. She was like a,

2561
02:21:07,211 --> 02:21:08,790
a woman who would know this kind of thing.

2562
02:21:09,720 --> 02:21:12,300
Like someone who's very
wise and in the business.

2563
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:13,930
She said she believes he was frustrated.

2564
02:21:14,070 --> 02:21:17,370
What a great excuse for someone who
wants to be a transsexual. Yeah,

2565
02:21:17,470 --> 02:21:19,440
I cut my dick off and I'm not gay.
What do you know?

2566
02:21:19,580 --> 02:21:21,620
There's a thing called the cost.
Stratos.

2567
02:21:21,640 --> 02:21:26,640
There's a type of singing in in Italy
like opera singing where they castrate the

2568
02:21:26,671 --> 02:21:30,410
boys and sell them into like an
indentured servitude to work as a CA.

2569
02:21:30,411 --> 02:21:33,150
Strato that's like a
real thing. They, they,

2570
02:21:33,540 --> 02:21:35,430
I don't know the entire details of it,

2571
02:21:35,670 --> 02:21:38,850
but they take out your testicles so
you can reach higher higher notes.

2572
02:21:39,430 --> 02:21:43,810
Is it a certain sound that they have?
Hit that again and Billie Jean. Yeah. No,

2573
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:47,760
I mean, just stop and think about,
you're just out there surfing you. Fuck,

2574
02:21:47,770 --> 02:21:51,650
I was looking for different songs.
This, that's a good one. Okay,

2575
02:21:52,510 --> 02:21:53,690
here we go.
Don't you think it's a good one?

2576
02:21:53,720 --> 02:21:56,290
[inaudible] think about this
and if someone told you, hey,

2577
02:21:56,680 --> 02:22:00,250
this is my favorite man.
I love how he sings.

2578
02:22:02,040 --> 02:22:04,350
Think about this. Think about Michael
Time. Pick about this. Listen to this

2579
02:22:13,950 --> 02:22:17,370
take about, if you never knew
Michael Jackson, Everett,

2580
02:22:17,550 --> 02:22:22,550
you were raised in a fucking island and
then you come to La and you hear about

2581
02:22:22,681 --> 02:22:25,970
this fucking singer up out with,
you'd

2582
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:28,800
be tripping. Fuck, how
the fuck is this crip?

2583
02:22:28,810 --> 02:22:32,540
He's always a Marilyn Manson
type pop. Guys like Marilyn
Manson. They go, no, no, no,

2584
02:22:32,550 --> 02:22:35,700
no. He's our Marilyn Manson.
He's people already good.

2585
02:22:35,701 --> 02:22:37,760
Keep it playing in the
band did he went through,

2586
02:22:38,110 --> 02:22:43,110
he went from black to white in front of
the whole world on album covers you the

2587
02:22:44,521 --> 02:22:48,210
biggest albums in rock history
or music history. He did it.

2588
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:51,240
You just put the album covers
to and go, oh yeah, but that's,

2589
02:22:51,270 --> 02:22:53,330
that's a disease that's,
he's got little likable.

2590
02:22:53,340 --> 02:22:57,300
What the really crazy thing is he turned
himself into a freak in front of the

2591
02:22:57,301 --> 02:23:00,540
world. Yeah, cut his face
up. She changed his chin.

2592
02:23:00,541 --> 02:23:04,740
He was the biggest music stars ever.
Bigger than Elvis.

2593
02:23:04,741 --> 02:23:07,890
Bigger than the Beatles. Michael
Jackson is number one with a bullet.

2594
02:23:08,190 --> 02:23:10,680
No one has been more talented.
No one's been more striking.

2595
02:23:10,890 --> 02:23:13,860
And the guy became a freak and fire
the world and he had an excuse.

2596
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:16,480
He became a white guy. I mean,
look at the nose. Look at the hand,

2597
02:23:16,520 --> 02:23:17,460
look at the colors again.

2598
02:23:17,800 --> 02:23:21,090
I know a black girl who has the same
as going to see disease. He has,

2599
02:23:21,210 --> 02:23:25,050
she has dark brown makeup. She has dark.
He, he did a bunch of crazy shit too.

2600
02:23:25,051 --> 02:23:27,960
I mean he did a lot of shit to his face.
He would never admit it.

2601
02:23:27,961 --> 02:23:30,990
He said he only had like his nose fixed
cause it so he could breathe better.

2602
02:23:31,290 --> 02:23:34,260
Yeah. He had like a gang of shit
and when he was on Barbara Walters,

2603
02:23:34,261 --> 02:23:37,860
Barbara Walters was checking him. Gone
Horde. Michael, what do you look at?

2604
02:23:37,861 --> 02:23:40,230
What do you see when you
look in the mirror? He goes,

2605
02:23:40,770 --> 02:23:44,160
I don't look in mirrors blog.
He said he don't look in the mirror,

2606
02:23:44,490 --> 02:23:49,490
but he was so fucking talented that
it wasn't enough to creep people out.

2607
02:23:50,400 --> 02:23:54,990
People still want to hear this guy sing
and watch them dance. Don't buddy ever.

2608
02:23:55,710 --> 02:24:00,390
You can get away with a lot of shit if
you write good music, look at like Queen,

2609
02:24:00,391 --> 02:24:02,850
look it up, John. You can get
away with a lot. People will like,

2610
02:24:03,210 --> 02:24:06,150
you'd get away to Spain gay now, like a
lot of singers are coming out and saying,

2611
02:24:06,151 --> 02:24:08,210
okay, well no one cares. Like
fuck, that sounds awesome.

2612
02:24:08,510 --> 02:24:11,580
With Michael Jackson came out before he
died and said, here's some people will,

2613
02:24:11,581 --> 02:24:14,420
but most people don't need
him. Most Inalfa won't. Yeah,

2614
02:24:14,850 --> 02:24:16,800
but no one had never moved
like Michael Jackson.

2615
02:24:16,801 --> 02:24:19,020
Like remember when we watched
that James Brown video with Joey?

2616
02:24:19,410 --> 02:24:24,120
James Brown was a totally on another
place in another dimension and another,

2617
02:24:24,540 --> 02:24:28,520
but his was a very masculine
way. You know his was, oh,

2618
02:24:29,910 --> 02:24:32,640
oh, you know there was some, there
was sex in masculinity to it.

2619
02:24:32,790 --> 02:24:37,790
This was like feminine and beautiful
and the way he moved was like so like so

2620
02:24:38,311 --> 02:24:38,881
pure.

2621
02:24:38,881 --> 02:24:42,570
Like his movements were so fucking crisp
and he would hit them Fang like who

2622
02:24:42,571 --> 02:24:45,030
knew when he would pull his pants
up enveloping the tip of his toes.

2623
02:24:45,210 --> 02:24:49,170
It'd be like Damn, when he would moon
lock. When you moonwalk and dude,

2624
02:24:49,240 --> 02:24:51,920
just glide so gracefully.
I'd met a thought.

2625
02:24:51,921 --> 02:24:55,260
I had never been a fan of
Michael Jackson's music ever.

2626
02:24:55,261 --> 02:24:57,740
I listened to all the songs a million
times. It's not going to grow on me,

2627
02:24:57,741 --> 02:25:00,750
but listen to the song and then it's
never been a fan of went to go see that

2628
02:25:00,751 --> 02:25:04,890
Michael Jackson movie. This is it.
To make fun of it. Just to be like,

2629
02:25:04,980 --> 02:25:07,590
I thought it was going to
be just a freak show. Mad.

2630
02:25:07,900 --> 02:25:10,710
I am a fan now of that
motherfucker's creativity,

2631
02:25:10,711 --> 02:25:13,080
the way he commanded that whole show,

2632
02:25:13,260 --> 02:25:16,980
all these producers that they're just
bowing down him everywhere he walked,

2633
02:25:17,100 --> 02:25:22,100
he had command of everything
and he's an amazing performer.

2634
02:25:22,290 --> 02:25:24,070
I went in there to laugh at him.
I came out.

2635
02:25:24,071 --> 02:25:26,200
A big fan still won't buy any of his cds.

2636
02:25:26,290 --> 02:25:31,290
It's just not my vibe that God put in
something was that song you want to be

2637
02:25:31,301 --> 02:25:35,080
starting something with.
Which one is that? If you
want to be starting something,

2638
02:25:36,250 --> 02:25:39,880
I think the end of the end of thriller,
the end of it,

2639
02:25:39,970 --> 02:25:43,990
he breaks into this groove live that's
fucking amazing. That I would take,

2640
02:25:43,991 --> 02:25:47,470
I would fucking, I mean that shit is
just an amazing, and he played it live.

2641
02:25:47,471 --> 02:25:48,370
I'd never heard it before.

2642
02:25:48,490 --> 02:25:51,730
I don't think I've ever
gotten to the total end of
thriller, but I was impressed.

2643
02:25:51,731 --> 02:25:54,730
I became a fan. How's it performer?
He really took things too,

2644
02:25:54,731 --> 02:25:58,900
like a crazy place where
you are so confident that
he was absolutely in control

2645
02:25:58,901 --> 02:26:03,160
of every move that he made. That was
like, it was jaw dropping to watch.

2646
02:26:03,340 --> 02:26:07,720
It was like the way he would move was so
fucking powerful. Grabbed all his shit.

2647
02:26:08,020 --> 02:26:11,470
His dancing he had, he would,
he would make everyone,

2648
02:26:11,800 --> 02:26:15,230
when they auditioned motherfuckers,
they all had to be they,

2649
02:26:15,231 --> 02:26:17,890
they told him straight up, because you
are an extension of Michael Jackson.

2650
02:26:18,080 --> 02:26:19,570
You're not trying to bring no flavor.

2651
02:26:19,750 --> 02:26:21,460
Don't try to bring your
own flavor into this.

2652
02:26:21,610 --> 02:26:23,500
You are an extension of Michael Jackson.

2653
02:26:23,620 --> 02:26:26,680
So there's certain parts of the songs
where everyone's doing the same thing he's

2654
02:26:26,681 --> 02:26:30,610
doing and then they go off
and then Michael Jackson
has is he's got like 16 bars

2655
02:26:30,611 --> 02:26:32,350
where you could freestyle. No
one tells him what did, he goes,

2656
02:26:32,470 --> 02:26:33,730
I'm going to be right here going off.

2657
02:26:33,880 --> 02:26:36,820
And then it gets back into the show and
then it's all around and then he comes

2658
02:26:36,821 --> 02:26:41,350
out and goes, this is just my shit I'm
just going to do. It was all his shit.

2659
02:26:41,830 --> 02:26:44,620
He had the craziest dance style ever.

2660
02:26:44,621 --> 02:26:47,770
No one's ever dance like Michael
Jackson to songs and performed them.

2661
02:26:47,950 --> 02:26:49,560
There's never been
anybody like that model.

2662
02:26:49,561 --> 02:26:53,320
It's almost like he had more inside
him that he had the lead out,

2663
02:26:53,530 --> 02:26:57,460
so he was so tortured, like that's
what your sense from his performance,

2664
02:26:57,461 --> 02:27:02,260
like it was so powerful and
Crispin electric and it was
almost because he had so

2665
02:27:02,261 --> 02:27:05,590
much in return Moyle that it had to.
That's how it came out.

2666
02:27:05,740 --> 02:27:07,330
It came out in his movements.

2667
02:27:07,331 --> 02:27:10,150
There was something about watching
it where you felt for him,

2668
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:12,420
you felt what he was doing,
but you didn't.

2669
02:27:12,430 --> 02:27:14,980
It wasn't just a guy
dancing and a guy singing.

2670
02:27:14,981 --> 02:27:18,500
It's like the intense expression
that he was using to dance and sing.

2671
02:27:18,910 --> 02:27:21,730
It's like he was reaching
these emotional points,

2672
02:27:21,731 --> 02:27:25,630
these emotional peaks that you like,
fuck man, that dude is out there.

2673
02:27:25,930 --> 02:27:29,710
That motherfucker was so talented.
The people who dislike, you know what?

2674
02:27:29,711 --> 02:27:33,330
He might be fucking with kids. So what?
You know what I mean? Put on his album,

2675
02:27:33,331 --> 02:27:37,690
his house people forgave his
Eddie all clarify something.

2676
02:27:38,050 --> 02:27:41,080
Sleeping over with kids and locking
the door. People are like, whatever.

2677
02:27:41,081 --> 02:27:43,740
There's no proof. There's
no video. Whatever. Eddie,

2678
02:27:43,741 --> 02:27:46,270
you didn't like him up until
watching that movie though.

2679
02:27:46,660 --> 02:27:49,570
I never was a fan of his muse
has been so shitty. I can't,

2680
02:27:49,620 --> 02:27:53,490
are you talking about this amazing that
movies when the dumbest movies that you

2681
02:27:53,491 --> 02:27:57,570
like, Nacho leave rests or shut the
fuck. C'Mon. You're like Nacho Levi.

2682
02:27:58,210 --> 02:27:58,570
Okay,

2683
02:27:58,570 --> 02:28:01,240
well let's not get upset at each other
for liking one thing to the other person

2684
02:28:01,241 --> 02:28:04,480
doesn't like this is, it was amazing.
I did not watch the whole thing,

2685
02:28:04,630 --> 02:28:07,630
but I watched a part of it while I was
getting tattooed and I found it pretty

2686
02:28:07,631 --> 02:28:09,130
fascinating.
I thought it was interesting.

2687
02:28:09,490 --> 02:28:12,700
I thought it was an in depth look at
him talking and interacting with people

2688
02:28:12,701 --> 02:28:14,440
that you don't get a chance
to see in like real time.

2689
02:28:14,441 --> 02:28:18,780
Seen it like 10 times different
documentaries in the past.
I haven't, I mean, well,

2690
02:28:18,790 --> 02:28:22,250
I mean it was, you know what? Maybe
maybe I liked it a lot. And you didn't

2691
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:24,590
because I'm a musician.
Yeah. You know what I mean?

2692
02:28:24,591 --> 02:28:27,670
And I look if it was about Gulf,
like if it was about tiger woods in the,

2693
02:28:28,130 --> 02:28:31,430
you know you might not like it
but this golf fan worshiped it.

2694
02:28:31,460 --> 02:28:34,940
Cause you know if that movie was a came
out when Michael Jackson was alive,

2695
02:28:34,941 --> 02:28:37,280
he would be pissed off cause
that's how bad that movie was.

2696
02:28:37,310 --> 02:28:39,490
I don't know about that man.
A lot of people liked it.

2697
02:28:39,530 --> 02:28:41,900
Joey Diaz rants and
raves about that movie.

2698
02:28:41,901 --> 02:28:43,520
To him it was an enjoyable experience.

2699
02:28:43,770 --> 02:28:46,880
It's like you got to send me back
Brian to show to that who put together,

2700
02:28:47,510 --> 02:28:50,300
I've seen a lot of documentaries that
Michael Jackson, that was the worst one.

2701
02:28:50,301 --> 02:28:52,490
That's all I'm saying.
I understand it was the worst you,

2702
02:28:52,491 --> 02:28:54,950
but what I'm saying is there's a lot of
people that thought it was fascinating.

2703
02:28:55,100 --> 02:28:58,630
It was done very quickly in slap together
but I think that's part of the trouble.

2704
02:28:58,700 --> 02:29:01,520
That's part of the interesting aspect
of is there's a lot of raw with them

2705
02:29:01,521 --> 02:29:04,880
looking at the production I was looking
at like all this lost footage of him

2706
02:29:04,881 --> 02:29:06,950
backstage and practicing and rehearsing.

2707
02:29:06,951 --> 02:29:09,440
There's a lot of putting it
all together and the auditions,

2708
02:29:09,441 --> 02:29:13,760
that was amazing shit. The way it was all
put together. Dude, I may be a retard,

2709
02:29:13,910 --> 02:29:17,060
but when I left that I cried a couple
of fucking times and I was like,

2710
02:29:17,061 --> 02:29:20,330
this mother fucker is when he started
breaking down and he's like, I'm like,

2711
02:29:20,570 --> 02:29:22,280
I can understand why you
wouldn't like it Brian,

2712
02:29:22,310 --> 02:29:23,270
cause you're not gonna do that shit.

2713
02:29:23,300 --> 02:29:25,960
But I could also understand why he would
love it because he really is into the,

2714
02:29:25,970 --> 02:29:26,391
no, no, no.

2715
02:29:26,391 --> 02:29:30,440
I'm a big Michael Jackson fan of every
single album right here on my computer.

2716
02:29:30,660 --> 02:29:34,850
It's just that I found that most piss
water production and I'll have a dog in

2717
02:29:34,851 --> 02:29:36,710
this race because I honestly
did not watch the whole thing.

2718
02:29:36,710 --> 02:29:40,610
I only watched like maybe 2030 minutes.
So I'm just saying,

2719
02:29:41,190 --> 02:29:44,060
I was just amazed his whole
career that you didn't like them.

2720
02:29:44,061 --> 02:29:47,240
But then seeing that movie,
I still don't like the music.

2721
02:29:47,241 --> 02:29:50,180
What documentaries have you,
I'm not liked that I liked.

2722
02:29:50,181 --> 02:29:52,130
Was there anything that I
really loved and you hated?

2723
02:29:52,520 --> 02:29:54,250
Is there anything that I
really love that you hit on?

2724
02:29:54,380 --> 02:29:58,880
So we have pretty similar taste. What
movies annoyed you? That didn't annoy me.

2725
02:29:59,070 --> 02:30:02,540
Anything you can think of a,
I know there's been some,

2726
02:30:04,010 --> 02:30:06,040
I'm more tolerant for
retarded movies in are,

2727
02:30:06,490 --> 02:30:09,350
you know what movie I just saw for
the first time, but, and that I liked,

2728
02:30:09,620 --> 02:30:13,370
I was shocked. I'm not a Zombie
Movie Fan at all. Ambulance? No,

2729
02:30:13,371 --> 02:30:17,560
no resident evil one. Oh, that's pretty
good too. I liked it. Did you like it?

2730
02:30:18,980 --> 02:30:22,640
I liked it. It was the first, there
was the best excuse for Zombie.

2731
02:30:22,670 --> 02:30:24,830
Did you watch and I like
checking like, okay. Was that,

2732
02:30:24,831 --> 02:30:28,640
did you watch what you check? Did
you uh, did you not see Zombie land?

2733
02:30:29,120 --> 02:30:32,840
I saw that too. I was cool. It was
cool. The excuses for the zombies.

2734
02:30:33,110 --> 02:30:37,160
Like I'd like the scientific one from
resident evil. It was like a hot dog.

2735
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:41,180
You know, the cutting edge of size. Only
one. There's only one 28 days later.

2736
02:30:41,210 --> 02:30:45,230
Every other Zombie movie needs to shut
the fuck up. Shaun of the dead. Yeah.

2737
02:30:45,231 --> 02:30:46,280
But that's kind of funny.

2738
02:30:46,281 --> 02:30:48,890
That's not not the same as far
as like scary Zombie movies.

2739
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:53,060
28 days later is the shit. You seeing
that I'm not just the English movie.

2740
02:30:53,330 --> 02:30:57,110
I don't remember who the sequel wasn't
bad either. Not Bad. Yeah. Not as good,

2741
02:30:57,111 --> 02:31:01,850
but not bad. Pretty fucking good man.
True. That's a realistic scenario.

2742
02:31:01,970 --> 02:31:04,730
It's a, a biological, a
weapon that they're creating.

2743
02:31:04,730 --> 02:31:07,760
They're testing out on chimpanzees in a
bunch of animal rights activists come in

2744
02:31:07,761 --> 02:31:11,480
and break into the testing lab and release
the champs, the champs of tack them.

2745
02:31:11,481 --> 02:31:14,180
Just start ripping them apart
and some new drug called rage.

2746
02:31:14,240 --> 02:31:16,580
It's a biological weapon.
Takes off from the chimps,

2747
02:31:16,581 --> 02:31:19,830
gets into people and if anything happens,
a spit gets in your eye,

2748
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:22,290
blood from a person,
they bite you,

2749
02:31:22,291 --> 02:31:26,010
they get infected instantly and you become
all these fucking crazy zombies like

2750
02:31:26,310 --> 02:31:28,640
super steroid rage.

2751
02:31:28,810 --> 02:31:32,160
Really zombies though their
eyes turned total red.

2752
02:31:32,310 --> 02:31:37,020
They're fucking just trying to your dead
flesh. You got to watch it there. It's,

2753
02:31:37,340 --> 02:31:39,780
it's dope. It's dope. And it's believable.

2754
02:31:39,870 --> 02:31:42,720
If you think about the diseases that we
have, just think about rabies, rabies,

2755
02:31:42,721 --> 02:31:45,160
we'll turn some raccoon into
some crazy mother fucker.

2756
02:31:45,161 --> 02:31:46,560
The ones who are coming to your
house and tried to kill you.

2757
02:31:46,860 --> 02:31:48,870
People been attacked by
raccoons when they're on rabies.

2758
02:31:48,900 --> 02:31:50,760
They kill dogs when they're on break,
but that,

2759
02:31:50,790 --> 02:31:52,680
can you think that's Zombie though?

2760
02:31:52,750 --> 02:31:55,510
That seems like if they came
up with anything, look, if,

2761
02:31:55,520 --> 02:31:58,740
if there's a way that you can change
people's behavior through a parasite,

2762
02:31:58,890 --> 02:32:02,580
through introducing some sort of a,
a bacteria or a disease into their system,

2763
02:32:02,581 --> 02:32:05,540
which we know you can, you know,
we know about that cat, Paris, I,

2764
02:32:05,541 --> 02:32:09,420
we've talked about that from Brazil or
the isn't as the definition of a Zombie.

2765
02:32:09,421 --> 02:32:13,020
Someone who was dead and then
later came back to life somehow.

2766
02:32:13,050 --> 02:32:16,440
That's the part where you gotta you gotta
have a good reason for you were dead.

2767
02:32:16,441 --> 02:32:19,260
Well, if a parent side came
in and took over your body,

2768
02:32:19,261 --> 02:32:22,110
and if it wasn't killed parasite,
you'd be dead. If it's using,

2769
02:32:22,111 --> 02:32:25,680
if it hijacks your central nervous system
and kills your mind and your mind no

2770
02:32:25,681 --> 02:32:26,520
longer exists.

2771
02:32:26,521 --> 02:32:30,300
Literally there's a parasite living in
your brain connected to all your nervous

2772
02:32:30,301 --> 02:32:34,740
system and running your shit remotely.
[inaudible]

2773
02:32:34,920 --> 02:32:37,890
I'm sure. Yeah. When you think sick,
sick, I just have some questions here.

2774
02:32:37,891 --> 02:32:40,890
I don't know. I don't know the definition
of a Zombie. A realistic possibility.

2775
02:32:40,891 --> 02:32:42,780
There's a fish that has a parasite,

2776
02:32:42,960 --> 02:32:46,500
a bunch of fish rather in this parasite
takes the place of the fishes tongue and

2777
02:32:46,501 --> 02:32:48,570
eats the tongue.
It's the craziest thing to look at.

2778
02:32:48,720 --> 02:32:51,580
I forget what the name of it is, but
if you Google fish, Tom Parasites,

2779
02:32:51,870 --> 02:32:54,680
if you're ambitious,
I tongue is eating our racing thing.

2780
02:32:54,870 --> 02:32:57,710
The fish stay alive
because the fucking this,

2781
02:32:57,711 --> 02:33:01,230
this parasite becomes its tongue
and it helps it swallow food.

2782
02:33:01,350 --> 02:33:04,950
It literally cleans to the inside of its
mouth and takes the place of its tongue.

2783
02:33:05,070 --> 02:33:06,630
The fish no longer has a tongue.

2784
02:33:06,750 --> 02:33:09,570
Instead it has a parent's eye that helps
it eat cause it needs it to get food

2785
02:33:09,571 --> 02:33:13,810
down his throat. So he just,

2786
02:33:13,830 --> 02:33:16,400
some of the food eat some food.
So the fish swims around,

2787
02:33:16,410 --> 02:33:18,390
catches all this food and the
parasite eats it with them.

2788
02:33:18,740 --> 02:33:23,070
But if the parents I died or left, the
fish is fucked. It says a China autonomy.

2789
02:33:23,110 --> 02:33:26,040
Novelis something,
but h it eats your stuff,

2790
02:33:26,160 --> 02:33:29,570
your tongue and leaves you with nothing
there. So the fish, if the parents,

2791
02:33:29,571 --> 02:33:33,960
I decided to commit suicide and leave the
fish's mouth, the parents, I'd doesn't,

2792
02:33:33,990 --> 02:33:37,290
there's no tongue anymore to
parasites have parasites. They most,

2793
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:40,080
it's an endless cycle.
That's a good question.

2794
02:33:40,081 --> 02:33:44,250
But I would Amazonian hot butches have
vaginal parasites. Did you see that?

2795
02:33:44,310 --> 02:33:47,070
Imagine that walked the entire length
of the Amazon. Did you see that?

2796
02:33:47,310 --> 02:33:51,570
I heard about it. What the fuck?
Somebody get that guy a hobby, right?

2797
02:33:51,600 --> 02:33:54,060
There's a 14 year old girl
from Holland, I think. Yeah,

2798
02:33:54,150 --> 02:33:57,570
from Holland who was just got
permission to sail around the world.

2799
02:33:58,020 --> 02:34:01,300
She's 14 she gonna to sail around the
world. The fuck is wrong with people.

2800
02:34:01,301 --> 02:34:04,290
She's done the fuck is wrong with
by herself, by herself. She's done.

2801
02:34:04,291 --> 02:34:05,550
What the fuck is wrong with people?

2802
02:34:05,551 --> 02:34:08,430
Why do they want to do such crazy
dangerous shit storm and you're fucked?

2803
02:34:08,520 --> 02:34:12,630
Well just why do it if you want to get
over to Brazil or if you know you want to

2804
02:34:12,631 --> 02:34:15,820
get to China, why don't you get
in a plane? Why do you want to,

2805
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:18,100
why do you want to go buy a
rowboat? Is that, is that really

2806
02:34:18,100 --> 02:34:21,340
going to be more of a journal on the edge?
Yeah.

2807
02:34:21,430 --> 02:34:24,610
That's like that's a difficult plane.
You're not even going on a good boat.

2808
02:34:24,790 --> 02:34:27,670
You're taking a boat that has to get
there by the wind. That's so stupid.

2809
02:34:28,540 --> 02:34:29,373
That's the dumbest,

2810
02:34:29,380 --> 02:34:34,380
you know what I think is stupid too is
people like me and like you who fucking

2811
02:34:34,541 --> 02:34:37,420
hate getting on planes
and we're like we hate,

2812
02:34:37,450 --> 02:34:42,220
we do it so much that we hate getting on
a fucking rocket ship with the craziest

2813
02:34:42,221 --> 02:34:46,200
whoever. We love these views from the
Hollywood hills houses and from the, the,

2814
02:34:46,220 --> 02:34:49,600
the, you know a top of Mandalay bay.
Look at this view. But we can get,

2815
02:34:49,601 --> 02:34:51,280
we get on a plane,
the crushes,

2816
02:34:51,281 --> 02:34:54,970
all those views smashes them
and we're like fuck this flight.

2817
02:34:55,390 --> 02:34:58,960
We get an awesome to you for two hours
and we hate it cause it kind of looks all

2818
02:34:58,961 --> 02:35:01,720
the same. It's boring,
it's boring usually.

2819
02:35:01,721 --> 02:35:05,460
But I try to retrain my thought and
try to appreciate that. Sometimes I,

2820
02:35:05,461 --> 02:35:07,550
I'm on a plane and I look out
the when and I'm trying to do,

2821
02:35:07,551 --> 02:35:11,530
I put my iPod on good music. I just
focus on the beauty that you'll never,

2822
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:13,780
you'll never see again the
way the clouds are formed.

2823
02:35:14,440 --> 02:35:16,570
Like it's the ultimate in randomness.

2824
02:35:16,571 --> 02:35:19,480
Like clouds will never be that
moment will never be like that again.

2825
02:35:19,720 --> 02:35:22,900
The stars in the sun, they're like
clocks. They will always be there.

2826
02:35:23,290 --> 02:35:27,970
Clouds and all, you know, it'll never
be the same ever. Every moment is,

2827
02:35:28,500 --> 02:35:29,830
I'm right.
Some of my best shit

2828
02:35:29,840 --> 02:35:30,411
in planes.

2829
02:35:30,411 --> 02:35:32,960
I write some of my best shit in planes
looking out the window cause it's so

2830
02:35:32,961 --> 02:35:34,940
humbling. Yeah. There's
something about the experience.

2831
02:35:35,180 --> 02:35:38,720
It just gives me this little extra tingle
of fear that I think makes the writing

2832
02:35:38,721 --> 02:35:41,220
better. Tingle of humility. You know,
it's just like you bitch, you're,

2833
02:35:41,230 --> 02:35:45,080
you're in the tube flying through
air, you know, above everything.

2834
02:35:45,081 --> 02:35:48,550
How are we doing this?
Especially when you, if you eat
like a cookie right before,

2835
02:35:48,640 --> 02:35:49,210
before you take it

2836
02:35:49,210 --> 02:35:54,060
are some straight hash
oil. I took, I went to uh,

2837
02:35:54,110 --> 02:35:57,620
teach a seminar in the UK a long
time ago and drank this hash oil tea.

2838
02:35:57,810 --> 02:36:01,270
I wanted it to go to sleep and I had the,
I was so lucky.

2839
02:36:01,330 --> 02:36:03,890
I got the whole role to myself
is like fucking FirstClass.

2840
02:36:03,910 --> 02:36:07,000
I'm laying down in the whole role,
take this whole jar of Hash oil.

2841
02:36:07,100 --> 02:36:10,000
I'm going to sleep the whole way. I
didn't sleep, my eyes were closed,

2842
02:36:10,300 --> 02:36:13,780
but it was the brightest shit I've
ever seen. It was his pride is this.

2843
02:36:13,781 --> 02:36:17,110
No kidding. And Man, I, dude,

2844
02:36:17,111 --> 02:36:20,620
I came up with the craziest
shit all the way to England.

2845
02:36:20,621 --> 02:36:24,250
Just put together this stupid movie in my
head. And I talked about the gang bang.

2846
02:36:24,550 --> 02:36:27,550
I put put,
I ended up being a ripoff of Mamma Mia,

2847
02:36:27,610 --> 02:36:30,400
but it's like my version of gang bang.
And um,

2848
02:36:31,050 --> 02:36:32,920
I couldn't stop putting
the scenes together,

2849
02:36:33,120 --> 02:36:36,340
putting the whole story together and
developing characters and everything.

2850
02:36:36,550 --> 02:36:38,860
I couldn't stop.
I wanted to go to sleep.

2851
02:36:38,861 --> 02:36:42,610
But the movie had to be done in my
fucking Ed. Dude. It was amazing.

2852
02:36:42,660 --> 02:36:44,040
Do when you eat something,

2853
02:36:44,041 --> 02:36:47,010
when you eat weed and you are in
a humbling situation like that,

2854
02:36:47,011 --> 02:36:49,880
like when you're in in the air flying
through the air like that and you're at a

2855
02:36:49,881 --> 02:36:52,910
high altitude too. Like I think
when you're in a plane it's, it's,

2856
02:36:53,100 --> 02:36:54,900
it replicates being in like Denver,

2857
02:36:54,990 --> 02:36:56,880
like as far as like amount
of air that you can get.

2858
02:36:56,881 --> 02:36:58,890
So you get drunker and you get higher.

2859
02:36:59,070 --> 02:37:03,540
So if you're eating some shit and
you get on a plane, oh my God,

2860
02:37:03,570 --> 02:37:06,210
I've had some life changing experiences.
High as fuck on a plane.

2861
02:37:06,340 --> 02:37:06,770
Totally.

2862
02:37:06,770 --> 02:37:11,480
A lot of fucking ideas and
decisions get made high on planes.

2863
02:37:13,330 --> 02:37:16,220
A lot of life changes.
Chill Dude, which we travel

2864
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:19,520
so much. And how many times have you and
I like right about to get on a plane,

2865
02:37:19,550 --> 02:37:22,880
eat a cookie, get on the plane. Like
you're feeling this yet? Not yet. Not yet.

2866
02:37:22,940 --> 02:37:25,280
But like we were going to
England, dude, that's a must.

2867
02:37:26,060 --> 02:37:29,360
When we went to England once for the UFC,
you'd gave me some shit,

2868
02:37:29,361 --> 02:37:33,680
like some breath strips or whatever and
I went to sleep and sometimes that shit

2869
02:37:33,681 --> 02:37:36,380
doesn't hit you for like eight hours.

2870
02:37:39,460 --> 02:37:41,270
I woke up in England.
That's probably what it was.

2871
02:37:41,271 --> 02:37:45,920
I woke up in England and while we were
going through customs, whoo. I'm like,

2872
02:37:45,921 --> 02:37:49,310
there's something wrong with me.
I thought it was something wrong with me.

2873
02:37:49,850 --> 02:37:52,910
All of a sudden hit it hit
like a fucking two term

2874
02:37:54,440 --> 02:37:59,420
worst time ever to be high cost. What are
you doing here? I'm like, I don't know.

2875
02:37:59,421 --> 02:38:03,800
Let me, Eddie. Eddie has a past. He got
pulled over having a gun in his car.

2876
02:38:03,801 --> 02:38:06,530
Totally legit. He was working
for a cat check cashing store.

2877
02:38:06,710 --> 02:38:08,480
He's supposed to have a gun.
He wasn't a criminal,

2878
02:38:08,600 --> 02:38:12,020
but just because they caught him
with a gun that shits on his record.

2879
02:38:12,021 --> 02:38:16,130
So every time we go to Canada for the
UFC, WWE, he gets pulled aside. Yeah.

2880
02:38:16,730 --> 02:38:19,390
What happened? What
happened? Microphones. Dad,

2881
02:38:22,370 --> 02:38:26,750
check, check. Your microphone stopped.
No, this should still working. Dude.

2882
02:38:26,751 --> 02:38:30,380
Your microphone stopped. I Dunno what
happened there it goes. Now it's back.

2883
02:38:30,381 --> 02:38:33,620
What happened Brian? Hello. Check. Check.

2884
02:38:35,660 --> 02:38:38,510
Anyway, that's a good way to end this
show. This is a fucking three hour show.

2885
02:38:38,511 --> 02:38:40,670
God Damn it.
God Damn Strike Forces an eight.

2886
02:38:40,760 --> 02:38:44,870
This is officially the longest
of our podcasts ever. I'm sorry.

2887
02:38:44,940 --> 02:38:49,700
I hope you enjoyed it. Um, uh, I'll give
one last plug the plug and plug it up.

2888
02:38:49,701 --> 02:38:53,300

will be out this week for the next UFC,

2890
02:38:55,790 --> 02:38:59,780
the Boston show starring Joey Karate.
It's hilarious.

2891
02:39:00,150 --> 02:39:01,760
I'm subscribe to my youtube,

Subscribe the new one.

2895
02:39:11,931 --> 02:39:16,070
We're going to change the name to MMA
wild so I keep forgetting that cause 10th

2896
02:39:16,071 --> 02:39:19,340
planet Kush is pretty bad ass I think I
say keep it because people know it. Yeah,

2897
02:39:19,341 --> 02:39:22,670
I think so. Yes, because you told me MMA
wild. I had to remember it three times,

2898
02:39:22,820 --> 02:39:24,770
but when I go looking for 10 planet Kush,
I always know,

2899
02:39:24,771 --> 02:39:27,600
I think it's perfect cause it's got
weed in there. It's got 10th plants.

2900
02:39:27,610 --> 02:39:32,240
Everything is that Sun. Well, that's a
totally, totally one at MMA. Wild Joe.

2901
02:39:32,420 --> 02:39:34,400
He's trying to get out of the tunnel.
We don't need to talk about,

2902
02:39:34,401 --> 02:39:35,234
we'd talk cocksucker.

2903
02:39:35,240 --> 02:39:38,240
I'm trying to get a sitcom trying to
get something on the discovery channel.

2904
02:39:38,270 --> 02:39:40,700
You think that's what it is and
cock sucker. The people at Disney,

2905
02:39:40,760 --> 02:39:42,950
they're that close. I don't want
to work anymore. I'm on the fuck.

2906
02:39:42,951 --> 02:39:45,290
I don't want to get on a plane. I'm
300 pounds. I got a breathing machine.

2907
02:39:47,650 --> 02:39:50,660
Any Bravo. I love you with all
my heart, but do me a favor.

2908
02:39:50,661 --> 02:39:55,550
Take the fucking Kush off.
Take the fucking push off wild.

2909
02:39:55,551 --> 02:39:59,420
It's fucking wild. It's MMA. Come on
to this. Those of you on Twitter land,

2910
02:39:59,930 --> 02:40:00,740
what do you think?

2911
02:40:00,740 --> 02:40:04,730
Should we keep a 10th
planet Kush or should we go
[inaudible] listen, the agents,

2912
02:40:04,770 --> 02:40:07,370
Joey's trying to do the right thing
and is trying to get a gig that's he's

2913
02:40:07,371 --> 02:40:09,470
trying to do. I was trying to get
a gig. He doesn't call it Brian.

2914
02:40:09,471 --> 02:40:12,170
Brian had some video him smoking weed.
What happened with that Brian?

2915
02:40:12,560 --> 02:40:14,280
We have one video where he was smoking

2916
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:17,850
weed in it and he made me, uh, take it
down, take that down. And I'm like, wait,

2917
02:40:17,851 --> 02:40:21,330
don't you have a show that you interview
or interview pot stores and you smoke

2918
02:40:21,331 --> 02:40:23,850
weed and possible all,
we had them all taken down and I'm like,

2919
02:40:24,950 --> 02:40:28,740
yeah, maybe he's trying to clean this
shit up. No, nothing wrong with it.

2920
02:40:28,741 --> 02:40:32,990
It's beautiful. I think you should
embrace it. Only go with it, you know.

2921
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:36,990
Well we got to do is figure out a way to
make Joey famous as a comic. You know,

2922
02:40:36,991 --> 02:40:40,950
it's almost a travesty when when we go on
the road and Joey, uh, in ours as well,

2923
02:40:40,951 --> 02:40:43,180
ours should be a headliner too,
but these guys are headliners.

2924
02:40:43,181 --> 02:40:45,720
They're both headliners and they're,
they're opening for me. You know,

2925
02:40:45,770 --> 02:40:47,600
did people should be
paying to see Joey Diaz?

2926
02:40:47,670 --> 02:40:50,490
They should be going and seeing
Joey Diaz do a 45 minute set.

2927
02:40:50,850 --> 02:40:54,270
I know Joey doesn't like to do long sets
like that. He's a monster for like 15,

2928
02:40:54,271 --> 02:40:56,390
20 minutes. That's what
he's best at. Crushes. Yeah.

2929
02:40:56,400 --> 02:41:00,060
Just opened when he opened for you
when you taped your last special.

2930
02:41:01,220 --> 02:41:05,370
I had never seen him dominate. If
we does anybody. Yeah, I have it.

2931
02:41:06,630 --> 02:41:10,570
I told him I go on the DVD. No, no,

2932
02:41:11,390 --> 02:41:14,100
this what we're going to do that wants
to make sure he doesn't have anything

2933
02:41:14,130 --> 02:41:18,240
except a couple of a showtime specials,
little 10 minutes out and shit.

2934
02:41:18,390 --> 02:41:21,120
He wants to make sure we're going to do
something with him I think at like Sal's

2935
02:41:21,121 --> 02:41:22,290
comedy hall or something like that.

2936
02:41:22,440 --> 02:41:24,960
Well we set up some
cameras and have Joey film.

2937
02:41:24,961 --> 02:41:28,290
They're like two nights in a row
and have a killer set and DVD.

2938
02:41:28,291 --> 02:41:32,880
I don't think it would be too hard to
convince Dana to produce like a Joey Diaz

2939
02:41:32,881 --> 02:41:35,850
as little special little
spike. Special man. Dude.

2940
02:41:35,851 --> 02:41:39,870
He was hard to do a spike special
because they need a name that he, yes,

2941
02:41:39,871 --> 02:41:40,530
he would crush.

2942
02:41:40,530 --> 02:41:42,980
You know what he would crush on in some
sort of a television show where people

2943
02:41:43,010 --> 02:41:44,850
get to know them but the
two a one off special,

2944
02:41:44,851 --> 02:41:47,010
you got to have a name that's
unfortunately the problem.

2945
02:41:47,120 --> 02:41:50,580
Well we need to do is get something
and promote it through my website and

2946
02:41:50,581 --> 02:41:53,190
promote it through Twitter and
get it out there, you know,

2947
02:41:53,191 --> 02:41:55,290
and get comedy central to do
something with them. That's,

2948
02:41:55,560 --> 02:41:59,670
that's what what Joey is,
is as rare down and dirty out there.

2949
02:41:59,671 --> 02:42:03,630
And then jungle comedian Joey will go
and do 20 minutes at a Mexican restaurant

2950
02:42:03,631 --> 02:42:05,640
tonight and like,
he'll like Joe Rogan.

2951
02:42:05,641 --> 02:42:08,700
I get this fucking new place I'm
trying done near Pasadena. You know,

2952
02:42:08,701 --> 02:42:11,190
it's always like this fucking Guy
Louis Alvarez send me down there.

2953
02:42:11,191 --> 02:42:15,000
It's the bomb. They got good pulled pork
and you fucking get a free sandwich.

2954
02:42:15,001 --> 02:42:16,890
You go on stage,
do 20 minutes and he'll,

2955
02:42:16,920 --> 02:42:19,920
he'll do fucking 20 minutes for
50 bucks here. He'll go, you know,

2956
02:42:19,950 --> 02:42:23,390
this guy tells me a hundred. I go
down there, I go to San Covina,

2957
02:42:23,391 --> 02:42:27,060
I'll go down there. I do a fucking
set. Let's fuck. He's a wild man.

2958
02:42:27,370 --> 02:42:29,850
He's like always working on his act.
He's always like hustling.

2959
02:42:29,970 --> 02:42:31,800
He's always going from place to place.
You know,

2960
02:42:31,950 --> 02:42:35,360
Joey's always putting new shit together.
He's always like piecing this out.

2961
02:42:35,370 --> 02:42:39,810
He's like, he's on the grind,
comic hustling. He's doing comedy,

2962
02:42:39,840 --> 02:42:40,890
hustling on the grind,

2963
02:42:40,891 --> 02:42:44,940
picking up twos and ones and the hundreds
and 50s and slap it all together with

2964
02:42:44,941 --> 02:42:46,950
some fucking residuals.
They're filling,

2965
02:42:47,310 --> 02:42:49,530
someone's filming a documentary
on him all this week.

2966
02:42:49,531 --> 02:42:52,830
The falling into all of these gigs.
Yeah. Yeah. He told me about this. Yeah.

2967
02:42:52,831 --> 02:42:56,370
That's what they should do. Someone should
do it. He's a real American original.

2968
02:42:56,490 --> 02:43:00,120
There's no did.
He should be gigantic.

2969
02:43:00,740 --> 02:43:01,800
He's not fucking funny.

2970
02:43:04,920 --> 02:43:06,660
This is what Joey looked
like when I met him.

2971
02:43:09,900 --> 02:43:12,760
This was Joey. When I met him, Joe,

2972
02:43:13,030 --> 02:43:15,760
he was like 200 pounds,
maybe,

2973
02:43:15,790 --> 02:43:20,680
maybe two 20 he was a fucking like a thug
looking big pussy lips and character.

2974
02:43:21,780 --> 02:43:26,350
It was like a big football player dude.
And in the time that I knew him in,

2975
02:43:26,351 --> 02:43:27,670
you know,
10 plus years,

2976
02:43:28,120 --> 02:43:33,120
he gained fuck almost 200 pounds and
then I lost a hundred they lost a hundred

2977
02:43:33,461 --> 02:43:36,700
which is incredible. That's
incredible. How many people do that?

2978
02:43:36,730 --> 02:43:41,500
I mean the Joey karate that did the
intros to DVD and the joy Crotty now.

2979
02:43:41,680 --> 02:43:44,740
Totally different human. Yeah. It's
half and half his size. It's ridiculous.

2980
02:43:44,800 --> 02:43:48,940
He was ginormous. What a unusual human
being that guy is. You know, I mean,

2981
02:43:49,240 --> 02:43:51,520
I am, one of the things
we're very fortunate about,

2982
02:43:51,820 --> 02:43:54,760
I mean I'm fortunate about everything.
Basically. I'm the luckiest dude ever.

2983
02:43:54,850 --> 02:43:58,090
But one of the things I've fortunate is
all the cool friends that I've managed

2984
02:43:58,091 --> 02:44:02,500
to meet and be friends with and keeping
my life all the years, you know? And,

2985
02:44:02,501 --> 02:44:03,370
and you guys too,
you know,

2986
02:44:03,371 --> 02:44:07,960
you guys are both good friends of mine
and I want to hug this out and just be

2987
02:44:07,961 --> 02:44:11,070
friends. Brian, pay attention. If you turn
on the air conditioning, you can look,

2988
02:44:11,090 --> 02:44:14,470
be your friends. Oh, I didn't turn it
on. Yeah, it's pretty warm in here. Um,

2989
02:44:14,500 --> 02:44:17,260
but Joey, Joey is one of those
rare dudes where it's like, wow,

2990
02:44:17,261 --> 02:44:20,950
I might not ever meet a guy like him
ever, ever in my life. Or You, I know.

2991
02:44:20,951 --> 02:44:24,370
I don't think I'll meet another you
and you ain't meeting another me bitch.

2992
02:44:24,790 --> 02:44:28,360
I doubt it. Another mini
either stupid Brian,

2993
02:44:28,361 --> 02:44:33,250
what does that had that it's like,
what is it? Legend of Zelda? Hey,

2994
02:44:33,251 --> 02:44:35,490
did you hear about that guy that is suing,
uh,

2995
02:44:35,530 --> 02:44:39,030
the Hawaiian guy who is suing
some South Korean game, uh,

2996
02:44:39,070 --> 02:44:40,780
company because he can't function.

2997
02:44:40,960 --> 02:44:43,150
He's so addicted to this
game that he can't function.

2998
02:44:44,350 --> 02:44:48,140
I could see that fucking
brought us, allowing the
lawsuit that I can see this as,

2999
02:44:48,150 --> 02:44:49,180
that.
I can see that.

3000
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:52,870
But how the fuck can you sue someone
for making something awesome?

3001
02:44:53,170 --> 02:44:56,020
All you're saying is you've made something
so awesome that I don't want to do

3002
02:44:56,021 --> 02:44:56,800
the rest of my shit.

3003
02:44:56,800 --> 02:44:59,950
What if there was some kind of clause
in the software that's like, okay,

3004
02:44:59,951 --> 02:45:03,850
you've been playing for three
days straight. You know,
I had to play for an hour.

3005
02:45:04,510 --> 02:45:05,343
What if I got money?

3006
02:45:05,450 --> 02:45:07,820
What have I gotten money and I have all
the time in the world and I just say,

3007
02:45:07,821 --> 02:45:08,501
you know what I'm gonna do,

3008
02:45:08,501 --> 02:45:11,170
I'm gonna play this fucking crazy game
for a full month and I'm gonna make a

3009
02:45:11,171 --> 02:45:12,760
documentary on it.
And that's what I want to do.

3010
02:45:12,850 --> 02:45:15,280
I want to eat and sleep and play
this game. Why can't I do it? Well,

3011
02:45:15,281 --> 02:45:17,020
you can get special permission
from the game. Makes it,

3012
02:45:17,030 --> 02:45:18,370
you're going to make a documentary,

3013
02:45:18,371 --> 02:45:22,600
but some of these people are fucking
really like spending weeks at a time on

3014
02:45:22,610 --> 02:45:24,160
that's on them, dude.
If they weren't that,

3015
02:45:24,161 --> 02:45:27,490
they'd be picking scabs or sticking
things up their ass. People are crazy.

3016
02:45:27,640 --> 02:45:28,930
People are fucking crazy.

3017
02:45:29,080 --> 02:45:31,780
And if you came up with something that's
so awesome that they just want to do it

3018
02:45:31,781 --> 02:45:35,950
every day and they forget to eat, fuck,
fuck them. You can't sue for that.

3019
02:45:35,951 --> 02:45:38,200
That's like anti evolution
over that judges.

3020
02:45:38,290 --> 02:45:41,560
That's an anti-evolution motherfucker.
A judge who allowed that lawsuit.

3021
02:45:41,710 --> 02:45:44,920
That's ridiculous. He might be
allowing it to happen just so he,

3022
02:45:45,140 --> 02:45:48,070
so the video game maker will win and no
one else will be able to do it, you know?

3023
02:45:48,140 --> 02:45:50,130
Is that true? It might be like I
might be right. Yeah, but that's,

3024
02:45:50,160 --> 02:45:51,070
it seems like you would,

3025
02:45:51,071 --> 02:45:53,590
you'd want to just throw it out
then and set a precedent right away.

3026
02:45:53,750 --> 02:45:56,620
This is not going to be accepted. You
can't sue someone for that. I mean,

3027
02:45:56,621 --> 02:45:57,670
there's no legal battle,

3028
02:45:57,671 --> 02:46:00,820
but you're saying something so awesome
that I can't go back to regular life.

3029
02:46:00,990 --> 02:46:03,500
I can't function internet.

3030
02:46:03,540 --> 02:46:06,360
Getting to a point though where it's like
a drug like any other joint without a

3031
02:46:06,361 --> 02:46:09,560
dude for five days. All I did is
I and your Jones, our Twitter,

3032
02:46:09,620 --> 02:46:12,500
Twitter messages up. No, I was
okay. I was in Hawaii. I was, okay.

3033
02:46:12,810 --> 02:46:16,400
Let me just fucking hanging out all
day. I, I, all I did was go on Twitter,

3034
02:46:16,401 --> 02:46:18,940
look a little bit and look at some
fucked up videos and some pieces of up it

3035
02:46:18,950 --> 02:46:23,090
throws, you know why he still had to go
check, but you know what I did though.

3036
02:46:23,090 --> 02:46:26,570
I only did it with my iPad. I didn't
go online. I didn't fuck with my forum.

3037
02:46:26,571 --> 02:46:28,680
I didn't, I didn't go
on. I did. Maybe I did.

3038
02:46:28,681 --> 02:46:30,480
We'll go to the underground a little bit.
There you go.

3039
02:46:30,560 --> 02:46:33,920
But I didn't do it nearly as much
as I do during the day. It is.

3040
02:46:34,430 --> 02:46:38,670
But I think it's a good try to do
a week with zero. Okay. But why?

3041
02:46:38,960 --> 02:46:42,160
Just see if he can do it, but I could
do it. I mean people have done it. Yeah.

3042
02:46:42,200 --> 02:46:44,960
My grandfather live without his whole
life. He never got online. Yeah.

3043
02:46:45,020 --> 02:46:48,360
But their ticket to death.
You're in Hawaii. You could,
it could have done easily.

3044
02:46:49,230 --> 02:46:51,350
Sit down and you go,
I wonder what's going on on Twitter.

3045
02:46:51,380 --> 02:46:53,900
Maybe somebody posted something.
Life changing that type of information.

3046
02:46:53,901 --> 02:46:58,100
I must figure out nonsense.
Ghetto gaggers.com sign. I
want to see the next thing.

3047
02:46:58,480 --> 02:47:01,700
I'm going to hire someone to sue
me for being addicted to my music.

3048
02:47:01,760 --> 02:47:04,980
That's a good number. That's strong. Yo.
Seven o'clock strike forces on right now.

3049
02:47:04,981 --> 02:47:08,270
All right, we're going to end this.
Um, go to a, what is the website?

3050
02:47:08,600 --> 02:47:13,070
10th Planet J j.com.
Free Techniques Til October one.

3051
02:47:13,071 --> 02:47:15,530
All of them are free.
I mean if you never done some Jujitsu,

3052
02:47:15,710 --> 02:47:19,070
find a place near you. There's 10 flat
and affiliates all over the country.

3053
02:47:19,071 --> 02:47:20,900
If you can't find that fun,
another Jujitsu school,

3054
02:47:20,901 --> 02:47:23,390
it's the fucking most fun thing.
It's a great way to exercise.

3055
02:47:23,750 --> 02:47:27,380
You don't have to think about doing boring
shit like going to the gym and riding

3056
02:47:27,381 --> 02:47:28,370
a bike.
It makes it fun.

3057
02:47:28,970 --> 02:47:33,950
Brian Red band.com pet seen Terry on funny
or die. See Metairie. It is very funny.

3058
02:47:33,951 --> 02:47:34,731
It's very disturbing.

3059
02:47:34,731 --> 02:47:37,670
But Brian is a funny little character
and he always makes funny things.

3060
02:47:37,671 --> 02:47:40,250
And thank you very much for tuning
in my friends. We appreciate it.

3061
02:47:40,251 --> 02:47:44,720
This is the extended three hour version
of the podcast, never to be repeated.

3062
02:47:44,940 --> 02:47:49,280
And this is the one time we babbled all
the way to strike force. Uh, but, uh,

3063
02:47:49,281 --> 02:47:53,030
I hope you guys enjoyed it and as
always, I love you bitches. Thank you.
