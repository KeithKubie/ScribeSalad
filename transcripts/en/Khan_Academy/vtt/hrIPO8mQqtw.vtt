00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.320
In all of the double
integrals we've done so

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.820
far, the boundaries on
x and y were fixed.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.490
Now we'll see what happens
when the boundaries on

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.690
x and y are variables.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.580
So let's say I have the same
surface, and I'm not going to

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.910
draw it the way it looks, I'll
just kind of draw

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.580
it figuratively.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.310
But the problem we're actually
going to do is z, and this is

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.820
the exact same one we've
been doing all along.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.900
The point of here isn't to show
you how to integrate, the point

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.020
of here is to show you how
to visualize and think

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.100
about these problems.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.430
And frankly, in double integral
problems the hardest part is

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.690
figuring out the boundaries.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.560
Once you do that, the
integration is pretty

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.130
straightforward.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.260
It's really not any harder then
single variable integration.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.130
So let's say that's our
surface: z is equal

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.990
to xy squared.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.150
Let me draw the axes again.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.140
So that's my x-axis.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.950
That's my z-axis.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.310
That's my y-axis.

00:00:58.155 --> 00:01:02.350
x, y, and z.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.290
And you saw what this graph
looked like several videos ago.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.340
I took out the whole grapher
and we rotated and things.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.190
I'm not going to draw the graph
the way it looks; I'm just

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.020
going to brought fairly
abstractly as just an

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.140
abstract surface.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.210
Because the point here it's
really to figure out the

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.420
boundaries of integration.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.033
Before I actually even draw
the surface, I'm going

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:21.690
to draw the boundary.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.630
The first time we did this
problem we said, OK, x goes

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.600
from 0 to 2, y goes from 0 to
1, and then we figured out the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.240
volume above that
bounded domain.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.920
Now let's do something else.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.785
Let's say that x
goes from 0 to 1.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:51.590
And let's say that the volume
that we want to figure out

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.920
under the surface, it's not
from a fixed y to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.370
an upper-bound y.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.170
I'll show you: it's
actually a curve.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.340
So this is all on the xy plane,
everything I'm drawing here.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.920
And this curve, we could view
it two ways: we could say y is

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.450
a function of x, y is
equal to x squared.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.380
Or we could write is equal
to square root of y.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.480
We don't have to write plus or
minus or anything like that

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.880
because we're in the
first quadrant.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.150
So this is the area
above which we want to

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.010
figure out the volume.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.070
Let me, yeah, it doesn't hurt
to color it in just so we

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.070
can really hone in on
what we care about.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.170
So that's the area
above which we want to

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.490
figure out the volume.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.010
You could kind of say,
that's our bounded domain.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.520
And so x goes from 0 to
1, and then this point

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.190
is going to be what?

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.260
That point's going to
be 1 comma 1, right?

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.210
1 is equal to 1 squared, 1 is
equal to the square root of 1.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.130
So this point is
y is equal to 1.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.290
And then I'm not going to
draw this surface exactly.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.530
I'm just trying to give you a
sense of what the volume of

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.700
the figure we're trying
to calculate is.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.210
If this is just some arbitrary
surface-- let me do it in a

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.910
different color --so
this is the top.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.770
This line is going vertical
in the z-direction.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.340
Actually, I could draw it like
this, like it's a curve.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.865
And then this curve back here
is going to be like a wall.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.460
And maybe I'll paint this side
of the wall just so you can see

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.270
what it kind of looks like.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.800
Trying my best.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.960
Think you get an idea.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.890
Let me make it a little darker;
this is actually more of an

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:53.220
exercise in art than in
math, in many ways.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.090
You get the idea.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.460
And then the boundary
here is like this.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.260
And this top isn't flat,
you know, it could

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.890
be curved surface.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.420
I do a little like that,
but it's a curved surface.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.340
And we know in the example
we're about to do that the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.770
surface right here is z
is equal to x squared.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.430
So we want to figure out
the volume under this.

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.400
So how do we do it?

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.840
Well, let's think about it.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.790
We could actually use the
intuition that I just gave you.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.030
We're essentially just going to
take a da, which is a little

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.440
small square down here, and
that little area, that's the

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.490
same thing as the dx-- let me
use a darker color --as a dx

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.320
times a dy, and then we just
have to multiply it times f of

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.480
xy, which is this, for
each area, and then

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.110
some them all up.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.610
And then we could take a sum
in the x-direction first

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.540
or the y-direction first.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.440
Now before doing that, just
to make sure that you have

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.480
the intuition because the
boundaries are the hard part,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.270
let me just draw our xy plane.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.860
So let me rotate
it up like that.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.610
I'm just going to
draw our xy plane.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.020
Because that's what matters.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.790
Because the hard part here
is just figuring out our

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.745
bounds of integration.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.600
So the curve is just y is
equal to x squared, look

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.730
something like that.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.400
This is the point
y is equal to 1.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.840
This is y-axis, this is
the x-axis, this is the

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.050
point x is equal to 1.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.780
That's not an x, that's a 1.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.070
This is the x.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.770
Anyway, so we want to figure
out, how do we sum up this dx

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.100
times dy, or this da,
along this domain?

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.760
So let's draw it.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.590
Let's visually draw it and it
doesn't hurt to do this when

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.670
you actually have to do
the problem because this

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.200
frankly is the hard part.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.300
A lot of calculus teachers will
just have you set up the

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.670
integral and then say, OK,
well the rest is easy.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.360
Or the rest is Calc 1.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.810
OK, so this area, this area
here is the same thing

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.540
as this area here.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.730
So its base is dx and
its height is dy.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.020
And then you could imagine
that we're looking at

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.320
this thing from above.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.430
So the surface is up here some
place and we're looking

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.260
straight down on it, and so
this is just this area.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.580
So let's say we wanted to
take the integral with

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.850
respect to x first.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:28.250
So we want to sum up, so if we
want the volume above this

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.270
column, first of all, is this
area times dx, dy, right?

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.470
So let's write the volume
above that column.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.700
It's going to be the value of
the function, the height at

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:48.830
that point, which is xy
squared times dx, dy.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.170
This expression gives us the
volume above this area, or

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.540
this column right here.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.730
And let's say we want the sum
in the x direction first.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.980
So we want to sum that dx,
sum one here, sum here,

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.290
et cetera, et cetera.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.910
So we're going to sum
in the x-direction.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.540
So my question to you
is, what is our lower

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.330
bound of integration?

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.620
Well, we're kind of holding
our y constant, right?

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.700
And so if we go to the left, if
we go lower and lower x's we

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.040
kind of bump into
the curve here.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.600
So the lower bound
of integration is

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.530
actually the curve.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.780
And what is this curve
if we were to write x

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.040
is a function of y?

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.260
This curve is y is equal to
x squared, or x is equal

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.230
to the square root of y.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.320
So if we're integrating with
respect to x for a fixed y

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.130
right here-- we're integrating
in the horizontal direction

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:46.010
first --our lower bound is x is
equal to the square root of y.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.550
That's interesting.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.140
I think it's the first time
you've probably seen a

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.420
variable bound integral.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.510
But it makes sense because for
this row that we're adding up

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.210
right here, the upper
bound is easy.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.330
The upper bound is
x is equal to 1.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.860
The upper bound is x is equal
to 1, but the lower bound is

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.810
x is equal to the
square root of y.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.220
Because you go back like,
oh, I bump into the curve.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:10.800
And what's the curve?

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.760
Well the curve is x is equal to
the square root of y because we

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.720
don't know which y we picked.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.210
Fair enough.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:19.320
So once we've figured out the
volume-- so that'll give us the

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:23.470
volume above this rectangle
right here --and then we

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.510
want to add up the dy's.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.030
And remember, there's a
whole volume above what

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.330
I'm drawing right here.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:35.370
I'm just drawing this
part in the xy plane.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.590
So what we've done just now,
this expression, as it's

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:41.840
written right now, figures
out the volume above

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.520
that rectangle.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.300
Now if we want to figure out
the entire volume of the solid,

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.485
we integrate along the y-axis.

00:08:51.485 --> 00:08:53.710
Or we add up all the dy's.

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:55.870
This was a dy right
here, not a dx.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.780
My dx's and dy's
look too similar.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:04.860
So now what is the lower bound
on the y-axis if I'm summing

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.560
up these rectangles?

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.270
Well, the lower bound
is y is equal to 0.

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.580
So we're going to go from
y is equal to 0 to what--

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.910
what is the upper bound?

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.630
--to y is equal to 1.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.400
And there you have it.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.590
Let me rewrite that integral.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:26.250
So the double integral is going
to be from x is equal to square

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:35.810
root of y to x is equal to
1, xy squared, dx, dy.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:43.090
And then the y bound, y
goes from 0 to y to 1.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.580
