00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.200
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your
ears!

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:10.870
I come to bury Latin, not to praise it.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:11.960
Salve amicis!

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.959
Ego et Julius, hoc est DNuntii.

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.500
As you can tell by my pronunciation, grammar,
and word choice, I am among the select seven

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.240
or so billion people who do not speak Latin
as a primary language.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.720
In fact, everybody says that Latin is a dead
language, and nobody speaks it, outside of

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.679
extracurricular clubs really just designed
to show off how smart everyone in the club

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:32.679
is.

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:34.150
Pfft, buccones.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.100
But that’s not exactly true, as we in the
science, medicine, law, and education biz

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.010
know very very well.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.920
Latin is still regularly used in all of these
disciplines, mostly for descriptions of things.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.230
So, while Latin is definitely dead, it isn’t
extinct, which is the term we use for languages

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.370
which have no speakers or continued usage.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.910
In fact, Latin is kind of a “victus mortuus”,
or uhh… zombie language.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.510
It’s dead, but lives on in describing animal
species, parts of the body, legal principles,

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.350
debate tactics, and a lot more.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.350
But… why?

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.480
Why do we use “Ursus maritimus” instead
of “polar bear”?

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.399
Well, the answer is multifaceted, as these
things usually are.

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.009
But let’s start with Catholicism.

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:18.649
See, around the fourth Century, a craze was
sweeping the Ancient Roman Empire and

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:21.200
all the kids were calling it Christianity.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.310
This ultimately led to the formation of the
Roman Catholic Church.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.909
The Church was a huge fan of Latin, largely
because that’s what the common man spoke

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.390
and that was their target audience.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.829
Over time, Latin was promoted as being the
language of religion and knowledge, and since

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.840
it was before the age of tweeting, everything
written down was pretty dang important.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.189
Scientific and medical discoveries, laws,
and basically any source of information in

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.210
the Roman Empire was in Latin.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.299
This meant that in order to be part of the
educated or religious portion of society,

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.369
you had to speak, read, and write in Latin.

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.909
But, after the fall of the Roman Empire, Latin
was deformalized and broken down into what

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.549
we know today as the Romance languages, including
French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, and

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.549
Romanian.

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.790
So why don’t we use any of those languages
to describe laws or bears?

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.640
One big reason is that dead languages don’t
move around very much... cuz they’re dead.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.100
Latin is frozen in time, and without major
populations speaking it, the words in it don’t

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.720
change meaning anymore due to popular usage.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.000
For example, we used to use the word dank
to describe your cellar, not your memes.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.360
But “ursus maritimus” will likely always
be the Latin name for those carnivorous white

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.880
monsters roaming around the Arctic Circle,
whereas “polar bear” could be, and probably

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.430
is, a slang term for a weird sexual act.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.740
I don’t know, someone look it up on Urban
Dictionary.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.160
Actually, don’t.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.860
And this makes scientific naming and notation
particularly standardized, even when we discover

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.540
new things to be named.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.150
All species have a two-part scientific designation,
called "binomial nomenclature", or its “Latin

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.150
name”.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.140
The application of these names is governed
by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.600
(ICZN) and the International Code of Nomenclature
for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN).

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.320
The first name is called the “generic epithet”
and is usually the genus, while the second

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.980
is a “specific epithet” or the species.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.260
Sometimes there is even a third name for a
subspecies included.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.980
So, we, “homo sapiens” are of the genus
Homo, meaning “man”, which also includes

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.350
Neanderthals and other hominids, but specifically
we are “sapiens”, meaning “wise”.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.480
As a group, we are “wise men” and women,
of course.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.790
An advantage of using a dead language is that
it doesn’t favor any particular group; it

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.190
is decidedly neutral, which is great for things
like law and medicine.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.590
If we call a disease “grossitosis” while
another culture calls it “awesomeitis”

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.700
you’re going to end up with different reactions
by doctors and the public for the same disease.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.340
Calling it simply “pneumonia”, removes
any confusion or bias.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.300
Dead languages might be dead, but just ‘cause
something is dead doesn’t mean it isn’t

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.500
amazing, influential, and widely respected.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.040
Like Harambe, whose latin name is “gorilla
gorilla gorilla”.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.330
Rest In Peace.

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.690
If you want to know a little more about how
and why Latin turned into a bunch of other

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.110
languages, and what killed it in the first
place, you can keep watching me talk about

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:17.800
Latin in this video on Seeker Daily.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.800
If you found a new species, what would you name it?

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.800
