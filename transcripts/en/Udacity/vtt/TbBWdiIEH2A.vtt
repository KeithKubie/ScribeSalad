00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.380
Note that in all the examples we've done so far, we've always used the same

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.530
base for our logs. The 3 properties that you've learned about. The product

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.160
property, the quotient property, and the power property. Only apply when the

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.840
base of the logs that are being combined is the same. This is a super important

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.090
concept. And we really need to make sure to keep it in mind. That we don't do

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.790
anything that's illegal. Thinking about this important concept, which of these

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.320
pairs of logs down here can we combine using the product property?
