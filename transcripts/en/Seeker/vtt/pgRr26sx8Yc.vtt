00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.720
Toes are just so weird, I mean have you ever
looked at them, they’re so stubby and useless,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:12.710
why can’t we have cool grippy toes like
chimpanzees?

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.240
Hey guys Julia here for Dnews.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.450
This little piggie went to market and this
little piggie is...well, it makes no sense.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.760
It looks like nothing else in the animal kingdom.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.710
Seriously. have you ever just looked at your
toes and thought why?

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.650
Well, Hallo Pjotter asked us how our toes
evolved.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.160
And that’s a good question.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.340
Toes likely evolved from the same bones that
became fins, wings, or hooves in other species.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.470
The dominating scientific theories are that
fingers and toes are exclusive features of

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.930
tetrapods, or vertebrates with limbs.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.120
But according to one study, toes may have
evolved even before fish left the ocean.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.870
The study, published in the journal Nature,
found 385 million years ago, a fish named

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.510
Panderichthys, had homologous bones to our
fingers and toes.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.650
Either way, phalanges are over hundreds of
millions of years old.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.430
Human toes, specifically, are a little newer
to the scene.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.920
Of all the other living primates, we’re
the only ones that exclusively walk upright

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.220
on two legs.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.670
Other primates, like chimps, have little grippy
feet and ours are just kind of weird looking

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.320
in comparison, but research shows they used
to be grippy back in the day.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.010
According to a study published in the journal
Foot and Ankle International, our ancestors

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.140
Australopithecus afarensis, which lived 3.5
million ago years ago, had feet that looked

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.740
remarkably like a chimpanzee’s!

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.290
Fast-forward to homo habilis an ancestor who
lived 1.76 million years ago.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.670
And her feet looked a lot like ours do now.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.610
We traded in our opposable toe for shorter
toes overall, and gained an arch in our foot.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.610
What happened in that interim?

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.820
Well in short, our ancestors came down from
the trees and started walking on land.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.970
As our foot evolved to support walking on
the ground, we started moving faster and faster,

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.050
eventually learning to run.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.930
These changes forced our feet to evolve to
deal with both balance and propulsion in a

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.710
highly efficient way.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.250
Basically, our feet became more springy and
shock-absorbent.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.990
And there's a study to back this up in the
Journal of Experimental Biology, showing basically,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.900
these toes are made for running.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.420
The researchers created models which showed
that longer-toed individuals do more mechanical

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.180
work to stabilize their joints and ligaments.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.459
This means they use more energy to run the
same distance as shorter-toed people.

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.340
This supports what’s called the “endurance
running hypothesis” or the idea that our

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.710
ancestors were really good at running long
distances in order to chase down and wear

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.710
out prey.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.990
In this kind of hunting style, those with
long toes are evolutionarily selected against

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.160
because it takes them more work to do run
down the same prey.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.310
The researchers also found shorter toes might
reduce the risk of injury meaning, long-toed

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.530
people would expend more energy to run the
same distance, AND run a higher risk of injury

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.670
while doing it!

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.050
So, our toes, while short and stubby, maybe
have evolved to help us run, keep our balance,

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.190
and absorb impact.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.910
So, the next time you go for a jog thank your
toes, even though they can’t help you climb

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.130
trees anymore.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.739
The weird thing though I keep hearing about
toes, is that our pinky toe is going away,

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.209
that we’re evolving out of it.

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.660
It’s just a useless vestigial structure.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.650
But that’s more old wives tale than anything
else.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.099
As for one of our other useless lumps left
over from evolution: the appendix, it might

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:35.470
not be so useless after all, Tara has the
whole story, right here.
