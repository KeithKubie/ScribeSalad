00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.440
I want to bring everything we've
learned about linear

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.450
independence and dependence,
and the span of a set of

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.850
vectors together in one
particularly hairy problem,

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.850
because if you understand what
this problem is all about, I

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.640
think you understand what we're
doing, which is key to

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.120
your understanding of linear
algebra, these two concepts.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.230
So the first question I'm going
to ask about the set of

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.050
vectors s, and they're all
three-dimensional vectors,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:34.020
they have three components, Is
the span of s equal to R3?

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.070
It seems like it might be.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.160
If each of these add new
information, it seems like

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.680
maybe I could describe any
vector in R3 by these three

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.500
vectors, by some combination
of these three vectors.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.540
And the second question I'm
going to ask is are they

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.910
linearly independent?

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.700
And maybe I'll be able to answer
them at the same time.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.240
So let's answer the first one.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.600
Do they span R3?

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.760
To span R3, that means some
linear combination of these

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.540
three vectors should be able to
construct any vector in R3.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.340
So let me give you a linear
combination of these vectors.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:18.450
I could have c1 times the first
vector, 1, minus 1, 2

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.260
plus some other arbitrary
constant c2, some scalar,

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:28.890
times the second vector, 2, 1,
2 plus some third scaling

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.680
vector times the third
vector minus 1, 0, 2.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.070
I should be able to, using some
arbitrary constants, take

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.010
a combination of these vectors
that sum up to

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.990
any vector in R3.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.620
And I'm going to represent any
vector in R3 by the vector a,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.090
b, and c, where a, b, and
c are any real numbers.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.850
So if you give me any a, b, and
c, and I can give you a

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.140
formula for telling you what
your c3's, your c2's and your

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.640
c1's are, then than essentially
means that it

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.200
spans R3, because if you give me
a vector, I can always tell

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.850
you how to construct that
vector with these three.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.650
So Let's see if I can do that.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.790
Just from our definition of
scalar multiplication of a

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.810
vector, we know that c1 times
this vector, I could rewrite

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.380
it if I want.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.660
I normally skip this
step, but I really

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.370
want to make it clear.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.770
So c1 times, I could just
rewrite as 1 times c-- it's

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.950
each of the terms times c1.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.840
Similarly, c2 times this is the
same thing as each of the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.790
terms times c2.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.040
And c3 times this is the
same thing as each of

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.535
the terms times c3.

00:02:35.535 --> 00:02:37.760
I want to show you that
everything we do it just

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.220
formally comes from our
definition of multiplication

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.980
of a vector times a scalar,
which is what we just did, or

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.550
vector addition, which is
what we're about to do.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.500
So vector addition tells us that
this term plus this term

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.010
plus this term needs
to equal that term.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.100
So let me write that down.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:05.470
We get c1 plus 2c2 minus
c3 will be equal to a.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.950
Likewise, we can do the same
thing with the next row.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.160
Minus c1 plus c2 plus 0c3
must be equal to b.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:21.600
So we get minus c1 plus c2 plus
0c3-- so we don't even

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.240
have to write that-- is going
to be equal to b.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.940
And then finally, let's
just do that last row.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:43.390
2c1 plus 3c2 plus 2c3 is
going to be equal to c.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.430
Now, let's see if we can solve
for our different constants.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.810
I'm going to do it
by elimination.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.750
I think you might be familiar
with this process.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.160
I think I've done it in some of
the earlier linear algebra

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.480
videos before I started doing
a formal presentation of it.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.540
And I'm going to review it again
in a few videos from

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.190
now, but I think you
understand how to

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.260
solve it this way.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.150
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to first eliminate these

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.390
two terms and then I'm going
to eliminate this term, and

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.150
then I can solve for my
various constants.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.750
If I want to eliminate this term
right here, what I could

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.050
do is I could add this equation
to that equation.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.209
Or even better, I can replace
this equation with the sum of

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.750
these two equations.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.269
Let me do that.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.120
I'm just going to add these two
equations to each other

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.350
and replace this one
with that sum.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.140
So minus c1 plus c1, that
just gives you 0.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.380
I can ignore it.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.630
Then c2 plus 2c2, that's 3c2.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:42.910
And then 0 plus minus c3
is equal to minus c3.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.400
Minus c3 is equal to-- and I'm
replacing this with the sum of

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.900
these two, so b plus a.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.110
It equals b plus a.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.070
Let me write down that first
equation on the top.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.810
So the first equation, I'm
not doing anything to it.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:03.730
So I get c1 plus 2c2 minus
c3 is equal to a.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.120
Now, in this last equation, I
want to eliminate this term.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.260
Let's take this equation and
subtract from it 2 times this

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.510
top equation.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.810
You can also view it as let's
add this to minus 2 times this

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.090
top equation.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.890
Since we're almost done using
this when we actually even

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.900
wrote it, let's just multiply
this times minus 2.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:42.200
So this becomes a minus 2c1
minus 4c2 plus 2c3 is

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.300
equal to minus 2a.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.890
If you just multiply each of
these terms-- I want to be

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:47.540
very careful.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.600
I don't want to make
a careless mistake.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.700
Minus 2 times c1 minus 4 plus
2 and then minus 2.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.830
And now we can add these
two together.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.520
And what do we get?

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.380
2c1 minus 2c1, that's a 0.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.540
I don't have to write it.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.300
3c2 minus 4c2, that's
a minus c2.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:16.890
And then you have your 2c3 plus
another 2c3, so that is

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:26.710
equal to plus 4c3 is equal
to c minus 2a.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.820
All I did is I replaced this
with this minus 2 times that,

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.070
and I got this.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.580
Now I'm going to keep my top
equation constant again.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.160
I'm not going to do anything
to it, so I'm just going to

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.230
move it to the right.

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:48.440
So I get c1 plus 2c2 minus
c3 is equal to a.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.320
I'm also going to keep my second
equation the same, so I

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:59.040
get 3c2 minus c3 is
equal to b plus a.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.900
Let me scroll over a good bit.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.620
And then this last equation
I want to eliminate.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.520
My goal is to eliminate
this term right here.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.960
What I want to do is I want to
multiply this bottom equation

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:16.070
times 3 and add it to this
middle equation to eliminate

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.000
this term right here.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.840
So if I multiply this bottom
equation times 3-- let me just

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.190
do-- well, actually, I don't
want to make things messier,

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:30.010
so this becomes a minus 3 plus
a 3, so those cancel out.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:34.940
This becomes a 12 minus a 1.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:43.040
So this becomes 12c3 minus
c3, which is 11c3.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:49.690
And then this becomes a-- oh,
sorry, I was already done.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.570
When I do 3 times this plus
that, those canceled out.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.540
And then when I multiplied 3
times this, I get 12c3 minus a

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.810
c3, so that's 11c3.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:11.770
And I multiplied this times 3
plus this, so I get 3c minus

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:17.280
6a-- I'm just multiplying
this times 3-- plus

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:23.490
this, plus b plus a.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.280
So what can I rewrite this by?

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.600
Actually, I want to make
something very clear.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.810
This c is different than these
c1's, c2's and c3's

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:30.710
that I had up here.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:31.940
I think you realize that.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.010
But I just realized that I used
the letters c twice, and

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:36.490
I just didn't want any
confusion here.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.850
So this c that doesn't have any
subscript is a different

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:42.059
constant then all of these
things over here.

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:44.930
Let's see if we can
simplify this.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.550
We have an a and a minus 6a,
so let's just add them.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:53.500
So let's get rid of that a and
this becomes minus 5a.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.630
If we divide both sides
of this equation by

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:59.520
11, what do we get?

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:13.310
We get c3 is equal to 1/11
times 3c minus 5a.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.570
So you give me any a or
c and I'll already

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:16.810
tell you what c3 is.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:18.190
What is c2?

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.590
c2 is equal to-- let
me simplify this

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:22.960
equation right here.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.710
Let me do it right there.

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.250
So if I just add c3 to both
sides of the equation, I get

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:34.370
3c2 is equal to b
plus a plus c3.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:40.160
And if I divide both sides of
this by 3, I get c2 is equal

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:47.930
to 1/3 times b plus a plus c3.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:50.000
I'll just leave it like
that for now.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.190
Then what is c1 equal to?

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:58.000
I could just rewrite this top
equation as if I subtract 2c2

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:06.430
and add c3 to both sides,
I get c1 is equal to a

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:10.990
minus 2c2 plus c3.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:12.240
What have I just shown you?

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.580
You can give me any vector in
R3 that you want to find.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.040
So you can give me any real
number for a, any real number

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.760
for b, any real number for c.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:26.660
And if you give me those
numbers, I'm claiming now that

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.150
I can always tell you some
combination of these three

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.980
vectors that will
add up to those.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.160
And I've actually already solved
for what I have to

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.260
multiply each of those
vectors by to add up

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:38.620
to this third vector.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.770
So you give me your a's, b's
and c's, I just have to

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:45.240
substitute into the a's and
the c's right here.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.220
Oh, sorry.

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.780
I forgot this b over here.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.230
There's also a b.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.130
It was suspicious that I didn't
have to deal with a b.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:55.040
So there was a b right there.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:00.090
So this is 3c minus 5a plus b.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:01.860
Let me write that.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.300
There's a b right there
in a parentheses.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.720
But I think you get
the general idea.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.100
You give me your a's,
b's and c's, any

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.290
real numbers can apply.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.290
There's no division over here,
so I don't have to worry about

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:14.810
dividing by zero.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:16.600
So this is just a linear
combination of any real

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.950
numbers, so I can clearly
get another real number.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.050
So you give me your a's,
b's and c's, I'm going

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.800
to give you a c3.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.170
Now, you gave me a's,
b's and c's.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:26.070
I got a c3.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:28.290
This is just going to be
another real number.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.750
I'm just going to take that with
your former a's and b's

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:34.030
and I'm going to be able
to give you a c2.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:37.530
We were already able to solve
for a c2 and a c3, and then I

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.325
just use your a as well,
and then I'm going

00:11:40.325 --> 00:11:41.575
to give you a c1.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:47.490
Hopefully, you're seeing that no
matter what a, b, and c you

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:50.600
give me, I can give you
a c1, c2, or c3.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.200
There's no reason that any a's,
b's or c's should break

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.100
down these formulas.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.410
We're not doing any division, so
it's not like a zero would

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.070
break it down.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:02.380
I can say definitively that the
set of vectors, of these

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:06.930
three vectors, does
indeed span R3.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:07.980
Let me ask you another
question.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.120
I already asked it.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.530
Are these vectors linearly
independent?

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.570
We said in order for them to be
linearly independent, the

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:28.900
only solution to c1 times my
first vector, 1, minus 1, 2,

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:36.920
plus c2 times my second vector,
2, 1, 3, plus c3 times

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.670
my third vector,
minus 1, 0, 2.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.510
If something is linearly
independent that means that

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:51.970
the only solution to this
equation-- so I want to find

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:55.320
some set of combinations of
these vectors that add up to

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.830
the zero vector, and I did that
in the previous video.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.900
If they are linearly dependent,
there must be some

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.890
non-zero solution.

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.260
One of these constants, at least
one of these constants,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.440
would be non-zero for
this solution.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.670
You can always make them zero,
no matter what, but if they

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.120
are linearly dependent,
then one of

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.870
these could be non-zero.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:23.080
If they're linearly independent
then all of these

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:25.740
have to be-- the only solution
to this equation

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.570
would be c1, c2, c3.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:32.870
All have to be equal to
0. c1, c2, c3 all have

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.070
to be equal to 0.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.460
Linear independence implies
this, this implies linear

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.256
independence.

00:13:40.256 --> 00:13:44.770
Now, this is the exact same
thing we did here, but in this

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:48.330
case, I'm just picking my a's,
b's and c's to be zero.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:55.170
This is a, this is b and
this is c, right?

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:59.030
I can pick any vector in R3
for my a's, b's and c's.

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:01.030
I'm now picking the
zero vector.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:03.740
So let's see what our c1's,
c2's and c3's are.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:07.820
So my a equals b is equal
to c is equal to 0.

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.940
I'm setting it equal
to the zero vector.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.980
What linear combination of these
three vectors equal the

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.490
zero vector?

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:20.150
Well, if a, b, and c are all
equal to 0, that term is 0,

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.910
that is 0, that is 0.

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:26.350
You have 1/11 times
0 minus 0 plus 0.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:27.380
That's just 0.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:30.140
So c3 is equal to 0.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:33.320
Now, if c3 is equal to 0, we
already know that a is equal

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.210
to 0 and b is equal to 0.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:39.090
C2 is 1/3 times 0,
so it equals 0.

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:39.850
Now what's c1?

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.400
Well, it's c3, which is 0.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.240
c2 is 0, so 2 times 0 is 0.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.460
So c1 is just going
to be equal to a.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.960
I just said a is equal to 0.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:58.210
So the only solution to this
equation right here, the only

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.570
linear combination of these
three vectors that result in

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:05.690
the zero vector are when you
weight all of them by zero.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:11.600
So I just showed you that c1, c2
and c3 all have to be zero.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.820
And because they're all zero,
we know that this is a

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:22.240
linearly independent
set of vectors.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.610
Or that none of these vectors
can be represented as a

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.680
combination of the other two.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.750
This is interesting.

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.170
I have exactly three vectors
that span R3 and they're

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:37.820
linearly independent.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.810
And linearly independent, in my
brain that means, look, I

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:43.640
don't have any redundant
vectors, anything that could

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.340
have just been built with the
other vectors, and I have

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.190
exactly three vectors,
and it's spanning R3.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:51.970
So in general, and I haven't
proven this to you, but I

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:55.070
could, is that if you have
exactly three vectors and they

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.590
do span R3, they have to be
linearly independent.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.680
If they weren't linearly
independent, then one of these

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.930
would be redundant.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:05.490
Let's say that that guy
was a redundant one.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.150
I always pick the third one, but
let's say this guy would

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.580
be redundant, which means that
the span of this would be

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.790
equal to the span of
these two, right?

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.200
Because if this guy is
redundant, he could just be

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.730
part of the span of
these two guys.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.760
And the span of two of vectors
could never span R3.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.850
Or the other way you could go,
if you have three linear

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:29.950
independent-- three tuples, and
they're all independent,

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:31.960
then you can also say
that that spans R3.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.820
I haven't proven that to you,
but hopefully, you get the

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.450
sense that each of these
is contributing new

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:38.960
directionality, right?

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.220
One is going like that.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.510
They're not completely
orthogonal to each other, but

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:46.040
they're giving just enough
directionality that you can

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.190
add a new dimension to
what's going on.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:51.360
Hopefully, that helped you a
bit, and I'll see you in the

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.840
next video.
