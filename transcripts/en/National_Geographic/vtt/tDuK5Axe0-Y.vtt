00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:08.675
( music plays )

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:19.052
( music continues )

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:32.866
( drumroll )

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:40.239
In the Amazon,
Kayapo warrior culture,

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.643
they were only pacified
in the late sixties.

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:45.711
While other
indigenous groups around

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:47.813
they were already
pretty much vanished,

00:00:47.813 --> 00:00:51.718
they've managed to stand up
to the outside world.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:53.219
They're still
very much in touch

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.922
with their culture
and their traditions.

00:00:56.922 --> 00:00:59.259
They are not
like other indigenous cultures.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.464
( clapping )

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:07.900 line:0%
When National Geographic
calls with an assignment

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.438 line:0%
to go down to Brazil,
to the Amazon,

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:13.773 line:0%
first you're very excited,

00:01:13.773 --> 00:01:15.408
then there's
a problem with FUNAI,

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:16.542
with the authorization,

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:17.977
you don't know
if you actually can go.

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:19.445
Then it goes back and forth.

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:21.581
Then you are going
all of a sudden.

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:24.149
This is
all the equipment we took.

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.285
My approach
to photographing these cultures

00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:27.954
is that I treat them the same

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:30.356
as if they were
a famous person in Hollywood.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:33.158
I bring my lights
and my studio setup.

00:01:33.158 --> 00:01:34.660
I want to differentiate myself

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.797
from just a pure
journalistic photographer.

00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:39.732
I want to be
a documentary photographer

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:42.034
but I also want
to document their faces

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:43.969
and their bodies
against a plain background

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.704
so we have
quite a lot of equipment.

00:01:45.704 --> 00:01:48.341
Then we were told
we'll be going

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:51.277
with a woman named
Dr. Barbara Zimmerman.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.312
She sent us
this picture of herself.

00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:55.181
( laughing )

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:58.284
And we ended up in Maraba,
which is in the Amazon.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:02.555
We had to drive for six hours
to Tucumã,

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:07.826
the closest town in the north
of the Kayapo lands.

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:10.763
And on the way there,
you drive through a landscape

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:12.498
that looks like this.

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:16.068
I thought it looked beautiful.
It was very pretty.

00:02:16.068 --> 00:02:18.037
But basically it's all
cut down rainforest.

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:21.273
So, Barbara kept on telling me,
"No, this is ugly, horrible.

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:23.142
This is what
cut down rainforests look like.

00:02:23.142 --> 00:02:25.111
This is the enemy right here."

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:26.712
And this is where we went.

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:29.782
You see Brazil,
and you see the green area.

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:33.152
All that area
is indigenous territory.

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:35.721
It's a huge territory
that they have.

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:38.124
It's about a quarter
the size of France.

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:41.160
Or the same size
as South Korea.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.130
It's actually the largest piece
of protected rain forest

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.199
in the world.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.901
Protected
as long as they protect it.

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:51.837
As soon as you leave Tucumã,

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:53.539
which is right
on the border of the land,

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:55.808
you fly
over the rainforest and--

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:59.212
Our first village
was called Kendjam

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:01.914
and right next to Kendjam
is this beautiful rock

00:03:01.914 --> 00:03:04.583
that just comes
out of the rainforest.

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:07.186
This is
an aerial view of the village.

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:09.956
I feel like it's out of a movie.
It couldn't be any prettier.

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:12.224
This setting.

00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:15.595
The Kayapo warrior culture
where young men

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:18.864
at an early age would
learn how to fight and kill.

00:03:18.864 --> 00:03:22.902
They were only pacified
in the late sixties

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:24.937
while other
indigenous groups around

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:27.439
they were already
pretty much vanished,

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.443
a lot of the neighboring tribes.

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:32.811
But because they had
this strong warrior culture,

00:03:32.811 --> 00:03:37.116
they even raided
each other's villages.

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:40.686
There's stories where I met
one chief, Pukatire.

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:43.355
His village was raided
when he was about 5-6 years old,

00:03:43.355 --> 00:03:46.525
and he was taken hostage
by other Kayapo

00:03:46.525 --> 00:03:49.028
and grew up
with a different Kayapo family.

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:51.497
And his mother was killed
in front of his eyes.

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:53.766
They're a very fierce
warrior culture.

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:57.937
I think that's the main reason
they're still around today.

00:03:57.937 --> 00:04:01.573
This is now the beginning
of our first real day.

00:04:01.573 --> 00:04:04.510
The men were going hunting,
we asked if we could go along.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.881
This is Ynhire, my favorite
person I met in Kayapo lands,

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:11.884
because he's very traditional,
very tough and hardworking.

00:04:11.884 --> 00:04:14.988
He's constantly doing something
while we're driving the boat

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:17.023
down to a spot.

00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:20.926
He's shooting at fish
with a bow and arrow.

00:04:20.926 --> 00:04:25.398
Then we pull up at the sandbank
and he starts digging

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:30.069
and pulls out these little grubs
for fishing, it turns out.

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.171
They keep on
digging and digging.

00:04:33.171 --> 00:04:35.941
Take out a lot of turtle eggs.

00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:38.310
They took all of them out
and put one back in.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.247
It's in their culture
to always leave one egg behind.

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:45.284
So with that grub, it took him
five minutes to catch this fish.

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:47.220
This piranha.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.055
They're not good for eating,
so he would cut it up

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:51.824
and use it
as bait for other fish.

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:54.293
This is Okêt.

00:04:54.293 --> 00:04:57.863
They wear
their traditional bead jewelry.

00:04:57.863 --> 00:05:01.033
2010 I think was
the last World Cup.

00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:04.303
So they incorporate elements
from Brazilian culture

00:05:04.303 --> 00:05:06.405
into their jewelry.

00:05:06.405 --> 00:05:10.409
He was excited.
He heard a wild pig.

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:14.313
There he shot this.

00:05:14.313 --> 00:05:19.118
And they just use tree bark
to tie the animal up.

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:21.320
He doesn't have
any red paint on his legs,

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.322
but oftentimes they put
red paint on their legs

00:05:23.322 --> 00:05:25.024
before they go into the jungle

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:28.127
because that way they can
find their way home easier.

00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:32.732
The red paint stays behind
on leaves and grasses.

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:37.103
And while we were
maybe in the jungle,

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:39.171
Ynhire by himself
caught all this fish

00:05:39.171 --> 00:05:41.907
maybe in one hour and a half.

00:05:41.907 --> 00:05:45.644
With that one piranha
he caught earlier.

00:05:45.644 --> 00:05:47.680
Whenever you come
out of the jungle,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.983
everybody goes swimming.

00:05:50.983 --> 00:05:55.421
The mahogany boat paddle
turns into a plate.

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:57.990
For lunch.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.492
So he then cut up
the pig in different pieces

00:06:00.492 --> 00:06:04.430
and then traded with Ynhire
part of the pig for some fish.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.600
They had so much food,
so many fish and fruits

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.502
that it felt like they couldn't
even eat it all.

00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:13.739
I've seen rotting bananas.
Fish laying around, papayas.

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:17.377
The food was so plentiful.
I've never seen anything
like it.

00:06:19.244 --> 00:06:20.913
They still have bone arrows but,

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:24.216
ever since they encountered
the first white people,

00:06:24.216 --> 00:06:26.352
the first thing they got
was shotguns

00:06:26.352 --> 00:06:28.954
which are obviously
a lot easier to hunt with.

00:06:28.954 --> 00:06:31.323
Older people are allowed

00:06:31.323 --> 00:06:33.926
to get money
from the Brazilian government

00:06:33.926 --> 00:06:36.295
if you're over a certain age,
which is hard to prove

00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:39.898
because none of them have
a passport or any ID cards.

00:06:39.898 --> 00:06:42.568
But that's a way
to get a little bit of money

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:45.738
and they buy
shotgun shells with it.

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:48.507
The hunter who shot the pig,

00:06:48.507 --> 00:06:51.444
his wife has a pet pig at home.

00:06:51.444 --> 00:06:53.646
So--

00:06:53.646 --> 00:06:55.013
It was quite ironic.

00:06:55.013 --> 00:06:56.716
When they shoot a mother
that has a baby,

00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:59.284
and the baby doesn't die,
they take the baby home,

00:06:59.284 --> 00:07:02.355
and raise the baby pigs as pets.

00:07:02.355 --> 00:07:05.091
And while we were gone,
the women were sitting

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:10.930
right next to the men's house
hanging out, practicing a dance.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.299
The great chief Ropni
had agreed to meet us

00:07:14.299 --> 00:07:16.302
in Kendjam, in his village,

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:18.437
Metuktire.

00:07:18.437 --> 00:07:21.907
But he said he'd come up
to meet us with Mekaron,

00:07:21.907 --> 00:07:23.909
old friends of Barbara's.

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:26.779
So it turns out these women
were practicing a dance

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.381
for his arrival.

00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:33.552
This little baby already has
his huge earlobe pierced out

00:07:33.552 --> 00:07:37.056
right after they're born.

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:39.759
And that was Day one,
pretty much.

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:44.062
It was a long day.
This was our dinner.

00:07:44.062 --> 00:07:45.831
I skipped the eye.

00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:48.968
( laughing )

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:52.971
The women said they'd
take us out into the jungle.

00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:57.209
They've all worn these dresses
for the last 40 years.

00:07:57.209 --> 00:07:59.779
They have them custom made,
they have their own style

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:01.680
that they like.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.185
They trade beads,
fruit and other things

00:08:06.185 --> 00:08:08.454
to get these dresses.

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:11.023
This is
my other favorite subject.

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:14.460
You can see why.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:18.030
Some of them still have
traditional wooden boats,

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.499
then they have metal boats

00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:24.470
that they got
from the Brazilian government.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.039
It's a mixture of cultures
coming together

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:28.340
in these villages.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.510
Plastic and metal.

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:34.346
The women are
as hardworking as the men.

00:08:34.346 --> 00:08:35.580
Everybody has their job.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.082
They always take
one or two men with them

00:08:37.082 --> 00:08:38.217
when they go into the jungle

00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:41.387
so somebody has a shotgun
in case an animal comes,

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:42.488
a jaguar.

00:08:42.488 --> 00:08:44.223
But for the most part,
it's like twenty women,

00:08:44.223 --> 00:08:46.359
maybe one or two guys.

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:49.228
The boat's engine broke down
so we had to wait for them

00:08:49.228 --> 00:08:52.297
at the river
and it doesn't take long.

00:08:52.297 --> 00:08:53.799
And they're just settled in.

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:57.369
Anywhere in the jungle
they're as at home as at home.

00:08:57.369 --> 00:08:59.638
You know, they start smoking...

00:08:59.638 --> 00:09:03.275
or cutting their hair.

00:09:03.275 --> 00:09:05.610
The babies always come
with their mothers

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.847
no matter where they go,
all the time.

00:09:08.847 --> 00:09:11.516
And this young girl
climbing a tree

00:09:11.516 --> 00:09:14.186
with a big machete in her hand.

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:17.156
Very good idea to send
a six, seven year old up a tree

00:09:17.156 --> 00:09:20.092
with a machete.

00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:23.328
What she does is
she cuts out Açaí,

00:09:23.328 --> 00:09:28.034
which is a berry
that was very popular here.

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:32.037
After pomegranate,
I think before coconut water.

00:09:32.037 --> 00:09:34.473
( laughing )

00:09:34.473 --> 00:09:38.377
It's supposedly very high
in antioxidants

00:09:38.377 --> 00:09:43.382
and they grow in the wild
so they harvest a lot of it.

00:09:43.382 --> 00:09:45.685
They peel
a lot of bark off trees.

00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:49.254
Sometimes you wonder
if that's such a good idea.

00:09:49.254 --> 00:09:53.959
They strip many trees
for many different purposes.

00:09:53.959 --> 00:09:56.128
It was so nice to see
that after one day

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:58.030
everybody was
so comfortable with us

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:01.633
because we made a donation
for each village we went to.

00:10:01.633 --> 00:10:05.070
And we had two groups before
over the last four-five years.

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:07.172
And both times the money
went to the men.

00:10:07.172 --> 00:10:09.842
So the men got to decide
with that money.

00:10:09.842 --> 00:10:11.543
This time
it was the women's turn.

00:10:11.543 --> 00:10:15.814
So the women
were extremely friendly to us.

00:10:15.814 --> 00:10:18.650
Normally as a man,
it's hard in these cultures

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:22.955
to make
a connection with the women.

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:25.957
On that day,
we were expecting Ropni.

00:10:25.957 --> 00:10:30.228
Together with Mekaron, he's
the most famous Kayapo chief.

00:10:30.228 --> 00:10:33.999
After Ropni showed up,
this older lady came up to him

00:10:33.999 --> 00:10:35.868
and they started
crying hysterically.

00:10:35.868 --> 00:10:38.237
I was not prepared for it.

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:41.039
They literally started to wail
and I learned later

00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:43.142
it's a traditional
crying ceremony,

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:45.310
so when you see each other
again after a couple of years

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.314
you start crying hysterically
to remember the people

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:51.316
that you have lost
that you both have known.

00:10:51.316 --> 00:10:53.786
It went on
for literally five, ten minutes.

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:57.189
And then somebody else
comes and they cry again.

00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:59.825
It was very moving.

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:02.027
It was very moving.

00:11:02.027 --> 00:11:04.062
Then everybody's being greeted.

00:11:04.062 --> 00:11:07.633
They line up and everybody
comes, says hello to this chief.

00:11:07.633 --> 00:11:09.301
All the way on the right
is Mekaron,

00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:11.837
who lives
outside of Kayapo lands.

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:15.741
He speaks very good Portuguese
and he was also instrumental

00:11:15.741 --> 00:11:18.344
in getting
the Kayapo land demarcated.

00:11:20.012 --> 00:11:22.114
It's tradition
that when the new chief comes

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:24.116
the whole village
gathers in the men's house,

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:26.251
but a lot of the men
were out of town.

00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:30.222
They were at a soccer tournament
up the river.

00:11:30.222 --> 00:11:32.591
The Kayapo
are actually quite vain.

00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:34.226
They love
looking at themselves.

00:11:34.226 --> 00:11:36.195
They videotape themselves,
they photograph themselves,

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:37.796
they photograph
their ceremonies.

00:11:37.796 --> 00:11:39.465
Some of them have TVs.

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:43.202
They watch their own ceremonies
over and over again.

00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:45.137
So they love
looking at pictures.

00:11:45.137 --> 00:11:48.173
And then we set up
our studio in the schoolhouse.

00:11:48.173 --> 00:11:50.943
And I started
taking some portraits.

00:11:53.745 --> 00:11:55.347
I love the contrast
of the glasses

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:58.250
with their face paint.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.519
And they have
two different kinds of paint.

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:02.788
The black one
which stains your skin

00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:05.424
and it takes
about two weeks to come off.

00:12:05.424 --> 00:12:07.960
And the red one
is more oil-based

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.763
and rubs off very easily.

00:12:11.763 --> 00:12:14.066
Their sense of style is amazing.

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:18.370
This red paint with blue
feathers is spectacular.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:22.408
And then you have
the Brazilian flag on his arm.

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:27.513
And he's wearing a necklace
made out of river pearls.

00:12:27.513 --> 00:12:29.914
In the background you see
that rock on the right side

00:12:29.914 --> 00:12:31.951
that you saw in the beginning.

00:12:31.951 --> 00:12:34.787
We climbed that rock.
And then you get up on it,

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:38.156
and one of the Kayapo
pulls out his cell phone.

00:12:38.156 --> 00:12:43.061
And you're just, "Oh, my God,
this is wild, but--"

00:12:43.061 --> 00:12:45.431
They don't have
any cell phone service.

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:48.267
So where they are,
they don't talk with them.

00:12:48.267 --> 00:12:51.303
But I guess they get them
really cheap and they use them.

00:12:51.303 --> 00:12:56.508
They have songs on them.
They use them as cameras.

00:12:56.508 --> 00:13:00.212
They take a lot of pictures
of themselves and other
people with their phones.

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:01.947
They were
pacified in the sixties.

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:04.049
And in the seventies
they started having contact

00:13:04.049 --> 00:13:06.251
with the outside world.

00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:09.888
Ropni led a couple of raids

00:13:09.888 --> 00:13:13.458
against rubber tappers,
missionaries, farmers.

00:13:13.458 --> 00:13:17.329
Anyone infringing on territory
he thought was Kayapo lands.

00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:21.232
And in the process
they killed a lot of intruders

00:13:21.232 --> 00:13:24.136
because it was such a headache
for the Brazilian government

00:13:24.136 --> 00:13:26.638
killing all these intruders

00:13:26.638 --> 00:13:30.842
that in the 80s with the help
of Sting, James Cameron

00:13:30.842 --> 00:13:33.278
and other groups,

00:13:33.278 --> 00:13:36.414
they were given
this big piece of land.

00:13:36.414 --> 00:13:39.184
While their neighbors
have these tiny little parts,

00:13:39.184 --> 00:13:41.186
they have this huge territory.

00:13:41.186 --> 00:13:44.589
And there's only 7,000 Kayapo.

00:13:44.589 --> 00:13:46.424
Our next village,
our last village,

00:13:46.424 --> 00:13:50.996
Turedjam is
right on the edge of their land.

00:13:50.996 --> 00:13:54.399
This bridge was built a
couple of years ago by
the Brazilian government.

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:58.303
They decided on settling there.
It wasn't a Kayapo village,

00:13:58.303 --> 00:14:00.839
but the Kayapo wanted to be
closer to the outside world

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:03.041
and start a new village.

00:14:03.041 --> 00:14:07.646
And because they're
Brazilians, they can
vote in local elections.

00:14:07.646 --> 00:14:10.649
Whenever there's elections
coming up,

00:14:10.649 --> 00:14:12.885
they make new demands, so--

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:16.388
One of their first demands was
that they build them a bridge.

00:14:16.388 --> 00:14:20.793
So those 300 people
voted for this local official

00:14:20.793 --> 00:14:22.861
and they got their bridge.

00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:26.598
Because they have a bridge,
and they're close to Tucumã,

00:14:26.598 --> 00:14:28.199
the village where we started,

00:14:28.199 --> 00:14:31.469
they even have taxis
coming to this village.

00:14:31.469 --> 00:14:34.706
A couple of years later,
a new election was coming around

00:14:34.706 --> 00:14:37.141
and they demanded electricity.

00:14:37.141 --> 00:14:38.878
They're hooked up to the grid.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.847
This is their men's house.
It's even lit at night.

00:14:41.847 --> 00:14:46.584
It was pitch-black
in the other villages.

00:14:46.584 --> 00:14:50.956
As opposed to the outside world
the jungle there looks more

00:14:50.956 --> 00:14:54.259
like what you'd expect
with these tall trees,

00:14:54.259 --> 00:14:55.994
this old-growth tree.

00:14:55.994 --> 00:14:59.831
I liked their jungle better
than in Kendjam or Metuktire

00:14:59.831 --> 00:15:02.401
because they had
this grand feel to it.

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:06.505
They know how to find
some vines to get water
when they're thirsty.

00:15:06.505 --> 00:15:10.509
So, they're still very much
in touch with their culture.

00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:13.011
And their traditions.

00:15:13.011 --> 00:15:17.315
As long as you can walk,
you're doing some kind of work,

00:15:17.315 --> 00:15:21.920
there's no such thing
as retirement at a certain age.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.788
There's always
somebody getting painted

00:15:23.788 --> 00:15:27.293
no matter were you go,
any time of the day.

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:30.129
Young and old.

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:32.897
Kids looked
like they were suffering.

00:15:32.897 --> 00:15:35.133
( laughing )

00:15:35.133 --> 00:15:38.503
Some people you can only paint
when they're sleeping.

00:15:38.503 --> 00:15:41.807
( laughing )

00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:46.411
There was a lot more
chubby people in this village.

00:15:46.411 --> 00:15:49.915
Their closeness to a supermarket
has its effect

00:15:49.915 --> 00:15:51.850
and some even had a fridge.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.818
There were some TVs.

00:15:53.818 --> 00:15:58.289
Mind-boggling was that
Ecuadorian traders had come by

00:15:58.289 --> 00:16:00.425
and sold them DVDs

00:16:00.425 --> 00:16:04.897
with people
dressed like Sioux Indians

00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:06.131
playing flutes.

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:07.532
( laughing )

00:16:07.532 --> 00:16:12.271
They bought these DVDs
and they were running 24/7.

00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:15.374
They were looking at people
dressed like Sioux Indians

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:17.676
playing flutes and drums.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.046
He's still practicing
with his war club.

00:16:21.046 --> 00:16:24.249
The traditional Kayapo weapon
is not a bow and arrow.

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:25.951
It's a club.

00:16:25.951 --> 00:16:29.988
That's what Ropni used
on a lot of white guys too.

00:16:29.988 --> 00:16:34.292
They picked up the bow and arrow
from neighboring tribes.

00:16:34.292 --> 00:16:36.595
You see these guys
looking like this,

00:16:36.595 --> 00:16:38.230
watching a soccer game.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:41.466
And a couple of hours later
they looked like this.

00:16:41.466 --> 00:16:43.334
Getting ready
for a naming ceremony.

00:16:43.334 --> 00:16:48.140
We got very lucky. There was
a whole other village visiting.

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:52.444
Because in this new village
they wanted to show off

00:16:52.444 --> 00:16:55.113
what a great party
they can have.

00:16:55.113 --> 00:16:57.382
What a great ceremony.

00:16:57.382 --> 00:17:00.919
They prepared for months
for this naming ceremony

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:02.720
that goes on for days.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.190
And they invited
the neighboring village

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.291
to join them.

00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:09.494
So there was a lot of people
getting dressed up.

00:17:09.494 --> 00:17:12.197
That was very fortunate.

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:16.334
Suddenly, they would dance
and run off into the jungle.

00:17:16.334 --> 00:17:19.037
Stay in the jungle
for half an hour.

00:17:19.037 --> 00:17:22.807
This is a young boy
that's about to get a name.

00:17:22.807 --> 00:17:25.644
A couple of days later.

00:17:25.644 --> 00:17:31.750
They had to dance the
same dance for 24 hours.
They were going in a circle.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.920
It gets darker and darker.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.590
In the middle of the night,
they're still dancing.

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:40.125
Then they started
to take some breaks.

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:42.361
The whole village
sets up tents.

00:17:42.361 --> 00:17:47.465
And sleeping bags.
They start camping around.

00:17:47.465 --> 00:17:49.401
Alcohol is strictly forbidden.

00:17:49.401 --> 00:17:52.203
All the Kayapo chiefs
put a big ban on alcohol.

00:17:52.203 --> 00:17:54.706
So we didn't see
one drunk Kayapo, luckily.

00:17:54.706 --> 00:17:57.742
But they love their soda.

00:17:57.742 --> 00:18:00.812
It felt
like at a tailgating party.

00:18:00.812 --> 00:18:03.815
( laughing )

00:18:03.815 --> 00:18:07.519
The older people start sleeping.

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:12.491
And some people
totally pass out.

00:18:12.491 --> 00:18:15.860
This little boy is getting
his name by his grandfather.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:20.264
The man on the right
is his grandfather.

00:18:20.264 --> 00:18:22.935
And then everybody goes home.

00:18:25.937 --> 00:18:29.307
So here comes a little video
so you see a little bit

00:18:29.307 --> 00:18:31.977
about how these people move.

00:18:31.977 --> 00:18:34.413
( boat engine sound )

00:18:39.918 --> 00:18:42.688
( water flowing )

00:18:49.427 --> 00:18:51.663
( rustling )

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:00.806
( speaking in foreign language )

00:19:02.673 --> 00:19:05.244
( speaking in foreign language )

00:19:07.111 --> 00:19:09.515
( thumping )

00:19:10.648 --> 00:19:11.950
( indistinct vocal sounds )

00:19:12.951 --> 00:19:14.686
( indistinct vocal sounds )

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.755
( speaking in foreign language )

00:19:17.755 --> 00:19:18.823 line:0%
People still know?

00:19:18.823 --> 00:19:20.058
( speaking in foreign language )

00:19:20.058 --> 00:19:24.262 line:0%
The people -
our people still know.

00:19:24.262 --> 00:19:26.898 line:0%
They know the war dances
and the war songs.

00:19:26.898 --> 00:19:27.999
Oh.

00:19:27.999 --> 00:19:30.769
( singing in foreign language )

00:19:36.073 --> 00:19:40.779
( singing in foreign language )

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:46.785
( singing in foreign language )

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.925
( singing in foreign language )

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:03.802
( rain falling )

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.538
( crickets chirping )

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:08.740
Ah!

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.309
( laughing )

00:20:13.512 --> 00:20:15.113
( indistinct )

00:20:18.817 --> 00:20:20.351
( music plays )

00:20:20.351 --> 00:20:22.888
( clapping )

00:20:26.191 --> 00:20:28.427
( music continues )

00:20:39.604 --> 00:20:41.073
( drumroll )
