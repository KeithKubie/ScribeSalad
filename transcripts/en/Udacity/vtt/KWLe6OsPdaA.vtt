00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.680
You're almost done with the lesson.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.500
By now you should have a small ado
cluster ready to crunch some data.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.170
Next, I'll show you how to use
an automation tool to deploy

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.720
a larger cluster.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.090
Before you move on,
I provided a dataset for

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.810
you to analyze with your new cluster.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.360
See you in the next lesson.
