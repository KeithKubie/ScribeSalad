00:00:14.123 --> 00:00:16.328
Right now, trillions of chemical reactions

00:00:16.328 --> 00:00:18.543
are humming away in the cells of your body.

00:00:18.543 --> 00:00:19.735
You never feel them,

00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:20.828
but without these reactions,

00:00:20.828 --> 00:00:22.711
you wouldn't be alive.

00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:26.014
Unfortunately, each of those reactions needs some help.

00:00:26.014 --> 00:00:28.333
You see, most molecules are stable,

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.337
they are happy just the way they are.

00:00:30.337 --> 00:00:32.908
The atoms in them are all bound-up and friendly with one another

00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:35.022
and would prefer to stay that way.

00:00:35.022 --> 00:00:37.492
The problem is, for a chemical reaction to happen,

00:00:37.492 --> 00:00:39.551
the atoms that make up those stable molecules

00:00:39.551 --> 00:00:41.032
need to break away from their friends

00:00:41.032 --> 00:00:43.760
and go buddy up with another atom.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.795
This break-up is where the molecules need a hand.

00:00:46.795 --> 00:00:50.100
This initial kick-start is known as activation energy.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.671
It's used to destabilize the molecule,

00:00:51.671 --> 00:00:53.437
to push the bonds between the atoms

00:00:53.437 --> 00:00:55.333
to a place where they are ready to break.

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:58.787
This unstable state is known as the molecule's transition state.

00:00:58.787 --> 00:01:00.651
Once a transition state has been achieved,

00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:03.238
the atoms become willing to leave their current molecular friends

00:01:03.238 --> 00:01:05.243
and go make new friends elsewhere.

00:01:05.243 --> 00:01:07.760
Once they are convinced, it's a piece of cake.

00:01:08.482 --> 00:01:09.403
Bonds break,

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:10.379
atoms rearrange,

00:01:10.379 --> 00:01:12.948
and the rest of the reaction happens automatically.

00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:15.048
After that first push, the body doesn't need to put in

00:01:15.048 --> 00:01:17.354
any more energy to help the reaction along.

00:01:17.354 --> 00:01:20.057
Left alone, most of these reactions would be very slow

00:01:20.057 --> 00:01:21.785
because it takes quite a while to build up

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:25.294
the activation energy the molecules need to get started.

00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:26.357
Enter the enzyme.

00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:27.644
Enzymes are proteins that speed up,

00:01:27.644 --> 00:01:29.419
or catalyze, reactions

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:31.720
by lowering the activation energy.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.162
They make it easier for the molecule,

00:01:33.162 --> 00:01:34.719
also known as a substrate,

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.252
to get to the transition state.

00:01:37.252 --> 00:01:39.384
You can think of a reaction like a race.

00:01:39.384 --> 00:01:40.659
Some racers are running along,

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.552
while others have teammates to help them.

00:01:43.552 --> 00:01:45.106
Meet Sam the Substrate.

00:01:45.106 --> 00:01:46.435
His team is the MODS Squad.

00:01:46.435 --> 00:01:49.038
Together, his team is able to get to the finish faster,

00:01:49.038 --> 00:01:50.791
using less energy.

00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:53.458
There are four special enzymes in Sam's team.

00:01:53.458 --> 00:01:54.788
Each has a different strategy

00:01:54.788 --> 00:01:56.973
for lowering the energy it takes to get going

00:01:56.973 --> 00:02:00.024
and speeding up the pace to get the MODS to the finish line.

00:02:00.024 --> 00:02:02.550
The "M" stands for "microenvironment".

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.916
This enzyme creates a tiny, special environment for the substrate,

00:02:05.916 --> 00:02:08.183
resulting in a faster reaction time.

00:02:08.183 --> 00:02:09.286
He runs ahead of the pack,

00:02:09.286 --> 00:02:10.711
flattening out bumps in the road

00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:14.063
and misting cool water on his team of molecules.

00:02:14.862 --> 00:02:16.908
"O" is for "orientation".

00:02:16.908 --> 00:02:18.934
Sometimes two molecules must be positioned

00:02:18.934 --> 00:02:21.303
just right before they will react.

00:02:21.303 --> 00:02:22.558
Like a friend at the finish line,

00:02:22.558 --> 00:02:24.299
the O enzyme provides his molecules

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:25.809
with specially shaped spaces

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:29.519
that allow the substrates to interact in just the right way.

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.778
"D" stands for "direct participation".

00:02:31.778 --> 00:02:33.942
Every now and again, a little muscle is needed.

00:02:33.942 --> 00:02:36.153
And when his teammates are struggling to finish the race,

00:02:36.153 --> 00:02:37.893
Teammate D is there to pick them up

00:02:37.893 --> 00:02:39.969
and carry them over the line.

00:02:40.784 --> 00:02:43.325
Finally, "S" is for "straining bonds".

00:02:43.325 --> 00:02:44.294
This guy pushes the team

00:02:44.294 --> 00:02:46.930
through some serious flexibility exercises:

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.761
splits,

00:02:47.761 --> 00:02:48.494
lunges,

00:02:48.494 --> 00:02:49.110
backbends,

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.246
the works.

00:02:50.246 --> 00:02:51.401
Sometimes his substrate teammates

00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:53.511
just need to be stressed and flexed

00:02:53.511 --> 00:02:55.659
into their transition state.

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:56.709
So that's it.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.650
Remember that all reactions need energy to get going.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.862
This energy is known as the activation energy.

00:03:01.862 --> 00:03:03.479
Enzymes lower that activation energy

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:05.764
and speed the reaction through team MODS:

00:03:05.764 --> 00:03:06.766
microenvironment,

00:03:06.766 --> 00:03:07.756
orientation,

00:03:07.756 --> 00:03:09.250
direct participation,

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.378
and straining bonds.
