resentment and jealousy that's not you
that's a pattern and it's all triple

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810
that's a pattern and it's all triple
 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.410
that's a pattern and it's all triple
the question they would always say is

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420
the question they would always say is
 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.390
the question they would always say is
what are these patterns how do I shift

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400
what are these patterns how do I shift
 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.300

into so all of us are patterned

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709
into so all of us are patterned

into so all of us are patterned
creatures that just repeat these

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030
creatures that just repeat these
 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.210
creatures that just repeat these
patterns endlessly and addiction is

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220
patterns endlessly and addiction is
 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.449
patterns endlessly and addiction is
simply an extreme form of this what this

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459
simply an extreme form of this what this
 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.490
simply an extreme form of this what this
means therefore is in dealing with

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500
means therefore is in dealing with
 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.440

beings it's a very comparable concern

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400
beings it's a very comparable concern
 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.660
beings it's a very comparable concern
it's how do I break those patterns so

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670
it's how do I break those patterns so
 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.509
it's how do I break those patterns so
with the extreme one of addiction what

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519
with the extreme one of addiction what
 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.940
with the extreme one of addiction what
is it that's driving this endless

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950
is it that's driving this endless
 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.160
is it that's driving this endless
repetition just over and over and over

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170
repetition just over and over and over
 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.850
repetition just over and over and over
again

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860
again
 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.820
again
and oftentimes you begin with the breaks

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830
and oftentimes you begin with the breaks
 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.070
and oftentimes you begin with the breaks
at the little things the little things

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080
at the little things the little things
 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.530
at the little things the little things
that you can deal with oftentimes it can

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540
that you can deal with oftentimes it can
 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.300
that you can deal with oftentimes it can
be the little fears and anxieties to

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310
be the little fears and anxieties to
 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.820
be the little fears and anxieties to
begin to creep in I'm sort of in the

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830
begin to creep in I'm sort of in the
 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.199
begin to creep in I'm sort of in the
middle of the night when wakes up and

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209
middle of the night when wakes up and
 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.420
middle of the night when wakes up and
then in the morning again one wakes up

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430
then in the morning again one wakes up
 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.280
then in the morning again one wakes up
and it brings back those fears and just

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290
and it brings back those fears and just
 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.810
and it brings back those fears and just
sort of those begin escalating over the

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820
sort of those begin escalating over the
 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.270
sort of those begin escalating over the
course of the day leading one to return

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280
course of the day leading one to return
 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.300
course of the day leading one to return
to the object of one's addiction so

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310
to the object of one's addiction so
 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.370
to the object of one's addiction so
that's the place to start then

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380
that's the place to start then
 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.650
that's the place to start then
so why there's little fear setting in

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660
so why there's little fear setting in
 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.900
so why there's little fear setting in
why those anxieties are there little

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910
why those anxieties are there little
 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.270
why those anxieties are there little
things you can begin to do to break out

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280
things you can begin to do to break out
 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.819
