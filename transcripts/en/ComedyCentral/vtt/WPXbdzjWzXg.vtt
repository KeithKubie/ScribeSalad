He fucking made me

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:14.474

I had to change the channel,

- I'm from a family of 11, and--

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:33.826
I know.
That's what people always say.

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:37.930
"Wow."
Women always: "Wow."

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.600
And I'm not the first

00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:46.873
My brother, the safe-cracker...

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.777
He was the first celebrity,

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:52.945
'cause he was a really,
you know,

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:55.314
pretty good safe-cracker.

00:01:55.314 --> 00:01:57.183
So, anyways,
when you're doing that,

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:58.885
when you have that kind
of family member,

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:01.053

celebrities in their own right,
you know?

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.225
Like, my brother brought me
a brand-new bike.

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:08.227
And I'd never had a bike.

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:10.396
And he'd come, and he'd give
my parents money.

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:12.065
We were super poor.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:13.899
We were so poor
that I gave my mom

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:17.903
a coupon book for her birthday.

00:02:17.903 --> 00:02:20.573
I'll wash the dishes.

00:02:20.573 --> 00:02:23.075
I'll do the laundry.

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:27.079
I'll kill dad for you.

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.049
Louie, you wouldn't really kill
your father, would you?

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.251
I would for you, Ma.

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:36.722
There's no expiration date
on the coupon.

00:02:36.722 --> 00:02:38.057
And one day,
I came home from school.

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:40.426
I thought it was all over with.
My dad goes,

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:42.428
"There he is!

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:45.598

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.242
I was ten years old,
something like that,

00:02:57.242 --> 00:03:00.046
and the FBI came to our house.

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:02.348
And that's a weird thing
right there.

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:04.783
You know, 'cause,
the FBI...

00:03:04.783 --> 00:03:06.785
You just don't think
they're gonna show up.

00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:08.520
You just...

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.122
You just don't...

00:03:10.122 --> 00:03:11.457
You never think--
if somebody said,

00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:14.127
"Tell me who you think's
gonna show up."

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:17.730
It's way down on the list.
It's way...

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.300
After ATF. It's...

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.570
So...

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.771
So, I was home.

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:28.240
Ten.
You know.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.975
That's how I talked
when I was ten.

00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:34.280
What? What?

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.881
Shut up.

00:03:35.881 --> 00:03:39.485
And you know, when you're 10
in a family of 11,

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:42.255
you have--you're told to shut up
all the time.

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:45.325
What are you guys doing?
"Shut up!"

00:03:48.094 --> 00:03:50.163
They do that fake move
toward you.

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:52.131
Oh!

00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:54.800
You have to learn not to flinch.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.937
You have to go...

00:04:00.173 --> 00:04:01.573
'Cause, I don't know
why this is,

00:04:01.573 --> 00:04:04.810
but when you flinch,
they get to punch you.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.581
You realize they make up these
rules, that's the...

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:12.952
That's why I can't move
this arm up any higher.

00:04:12.952 --> 00:04:13.952
It's true.

00:04:13.952 --> 00:04:15.855
So, the FBI comes to our house.

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:17.490
[tapping]

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.492
And I go downstairs,
'cause I'm the door-answerer.

00:04:20.492 --> 00:04:22.862
My dad--"Oh, God!

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:26.632
I got to put some pants on!"

00:04:26.632 --> 00:04:29.869
He never had anything
but boxers.

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:31.804
And a T-shirt.

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:36.276
He was ready for...summer?

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.445

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:42.014

00:04:42.014 --> 00:04:43.215
"Son?"

00:04:43.215 --> 00:04:46.485
I'm not your son.

00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:50.623
"We'd like to talk
to your parents."

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.858
What about?

00:04:52.858 --> 00:04:53.859
"Son..."

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:56.329
I'm not your son.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.366
"Could you get your father?"

There's Mormons here!

00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:07.873
They come--
and then they go--

00:05:07.873 --> 00:05:10.509
they say to him, "Sir?"

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:11.878
"Yeah?"

00:05:11.878 --> 00:05:15.148
My dad: "Yeah?"

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.749
"We're the FBI."

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:19.018
"Is that so?

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.441
"We'd like to come in."

00:05:42.441 --> 00:05:44.777
"I'm sure you would.

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:47.113
I'm a Veteran, you know?"

00:05:47.113 --> 00:05:49.782
"Well,
thank you for your service."

00:05:49.782 --> 00:05:51.718
"Yeah.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.621
What do you want?"

00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:57.757
"We're here with
a search warrant.

00:05:57.757 --> 00:06:00.726
We...we're looking
for your son."

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:02.361
"Well, he's not here."

00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:05.430
Yeah.
He's not here.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.566
Why don't you leave him alone?

00:06:07.566 --> 00:06:09.568
That was my whole stance
for the whole thing.

00:06:09.568 --> 00:06:12.572
Why don't you leave him alone?

00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:15.107
He didn't do it.

00:06:15.107 --> 00:06:16.642
And then my mom comes out
of the kitchen,

00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:18.077
the sweetest person
in the world.

00:06:18.077 --> 00:06:19.478
You'd love her.

00:06:19.478 --> 00:06:22.482
"What's going on here?
Who's here?"

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:25.551
Then my dad goes,
"It's G-men."

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:27.786
That's who my dad was.
"It's the G-men."

00:06:27.786 --> 00:06:28.787
I'll never forget that.

00:06:28.787 --> 00:06:30.122
"G-men!"

00:06:30.122 --> 00:06:31.657
And she goes, "What?"

00:06:31.657 --> 00:06:33.558
"It's the FBI.
They want to--

00:06:33.558 --> 00:06:35.327
they're looking for your son."

00:06:35.327 --> 00:06:37.830
It's her son now.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.298
"Well, I haven't seen him.

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:41.567
"But come on in, boys.

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:44.303
Would you like
a nice cup of coffee?"

00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:47.573
My dad grumbles.
"Oh...[mumbling].

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:49.808
Why don't you ask 'em
to stay over?"

00:06:49.808 --> 00:06:52.811
"Well, maybe I will."

00:06:52.811 --> 00:06:53.846
So my mom brings 'em in.

00:06:53.846 --> 00:06:56.415
"Do you like Folgers?

00:06:56.415 --> 00:06:59.519
It's good to the last drop."

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:01.821
So they come in.

00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:03.422
My mom's very smart.

00:07:03.422 --> 00:07:06.626
"Now this must be
a terrible job, huh?

00:07:06.626 --> 00:07:11.297
'Cause nobody's ever happy
to see you, are they?"

00:07:11.297 --> 00:07:13.298
"Well, not really, ma'am."

00:07:13.298 --> 00:07:14.933
"Well, it must be terrible.

00:07:14.933 --> 00:07:18.471
"Would you like a nice piece
of chocolate cake?

00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:21.540
"It's Duncan Hines.

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.278
I make the frosting
from scratch."

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:31.150
And she'd shoot that face
at 'em.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.287
"I'm practically insane.

00:07:36.222 --> 00:07:38.891
"That's my husband.

00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:41.527
That's why."

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:43.228
So she cuts 'em the cake,

00:07:43.228 --> 00:07:45.731
and it was the best cake--
seriously.

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:48.967
She goes, "Can you guess what's
in the ingredients

00:07:48.967 --> 00:07:51.403
to the frosting?"

00:07:51.403 --> 00:07:52.371
Oh, God.

00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:56.374
We're playing the Feud.

00:07:56.374 --> 00:07:58.744
She--they go, "Well, chocolate?"

00:07:58.744 --> 00:08:02.348
"Oh, that's right."

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:05.684
"Sugar?"
"Mm-hmm."

00:08:05.684 --> 00:08:07.753
"And that's it, isn't it?"

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:09.087
"No.

00:08:09.087 --> 00:08:11.257
"You know what I put in there?

00:08:11.257 --> 00:08:15.661
"A tiny splash of Folgers.

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:21.366
"Tell your wives about it.

00:08:21.366 --> 00:08:23.436
They'll love it."

00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:25.371
So they're there.
My brother's there.

00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:27.873
My other brother's there.

00:08:27.873 --> 00:08:28.941
My dad's in there.

00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:31.911
[groaning]

00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:34.580
He was a noisy dad.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.517
[groaning]

00:08:39.785 --> 00:08:41.721
[imitates loud sneeze]

00:08:44.289 --> 00:08:46.024
"Well, we better get looking.

00:08:46.024 --> 00:08:50.295
We'd like to execute the warrant
right now."

00:08:50.295 --> 00:08:53.132
They're gonna kill him!

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:54.232
"No, son."

00:08:54.232 --> 00:08:56.736
I'm not your son.

00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:59.304
And--and then, so,
they start looking.

00:08:59.304 --> 00:09:01.540
Now, this is the thing
about our house.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.810
Like, my mom was a pack rat.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.111
You know, a bad one.

00:09:06.111 --> 00:09:09.982
Not a hoarder, though,
'cause we had aisles.

00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:12.885
"I'm coming down seven!"

00:09:14.319 --> 00:09:17.056
Anyway, so they go to
the basement first.

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:18.291
And my mom is the best.

00:09:18.291 --> 00:09:19.725
She goes,
"When you're down there,

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:23.328

00:09:23.328 --> 00:09:26.832
will you bring it up?"

00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:28.467
I love you, Ma.

00:09:28.467 --> 00:09:30.569
She was a lovely crazy.

00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:31.837
So they're down there.

00:09:31.837 --> 00:09:33.438
They're sweating
when they come up.

00:09:33.438 --> 00:09:36.976
You know, like I am right now.

00:09:36.976 --> 00:09:38.978
And they come up and,
honestly, they're just like,

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:40.513
"Oh, God."

00:09:40.513 --> 00:09:43.916
"Well, there's four more
bedrooms to look through."

00:09:43.916 --> 00:09:45.618
And they go, "Okay."

00:09:45.618 --> 00:09:47.420
So there--we start going,

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.754
and I'm be--
I'm right behind the FBI.

00:09:49.754 --> 00:09:52.524
What do you get paid for this?

00:09:52.524 --> 00:09:54.693
You make a lot of money?

00:09:54.693 --> 00:09:57.330
Uh...

00:09:58.197 --> 00:10:00.532
You ever shoot anyone?

00:10:00.532 --> 00:10:02.168
"I can't discuss that."

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:05.371
You did, then.

00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:08.607
I'm not stupid.

00:10:08.607 --> 00:10:12.310
You guys should take my dad.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:16.348
He steals napkins.

00:10:16.348 --> 00:10:17.549
That's what he used to do.

00:10:17.549 --> 00:10:19.184
He'd come out of a restaurant,

00:10:19.184 --> 00:10:22.855
and he'd go, "Ha, ha!"

00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:29.395
Now, my brother's there.

00:10:29.395 --> 00:10:31.229
He's upstairs.

00:10:31.229 --> 00:10:33.232
We hid him.

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:35.667
In the hall closet.

00:10:35.667 --> 00:10:39.338
Under about
a thousand pounds of clothes.

00:10:39.338 --> 00:10:41.006
Anyway, so they get through,

00:10:41.006 --> 00:10:42.742
they get to the closet.

00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:43.909
The big closet.

00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:47.046
There's a big, giant closet
in the hall.

00:10:47.046 --> 00:10:48.414
They open the doors.

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:50.582
He's not here!

00:10:50.582 --> 00:10:52.151
You know, I'm ten.

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:53.419
I'm nervous now.

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:55.421
He's not here!

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:56.989
I'm telegraphing
the whole thing.

00:10:56.989 --> 00:10:57.923
My brother is going...

00:10:57.923 --> 00:11:00.926
[quietly]
"Shut up, shut up."

00:11:02.194 --> 00:11:04.563
They start poking around
in there.

00:11:04.563 --> 00:11:06.365
He didn't do it.
I was with him.

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:08.066
We were fishing.

00:11:08.066 --> 00:11:09.268
"At night?"

00:11:09.268 --> 00:11:11.603
We were night fishing.

00:11:11.603 --> 00:11:13.072
So they're going through
the closet.

00:11:13.072 --> 00:11:15.073
And you know,
the clothes were up to there.

00:11:15.073 --> 00:11:17.243
And you know when
you dig through clothes,

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:20.178
there's something creepy
about it, don't you think?

00:11:20.178 --> 00:11:21.580
When they're not your clothes,

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.215
there's something
where you go...

00:11:23.215 --> 00:11:26.352
[cringing]

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.421
You know,
and they're moving it around.

00:11:29.421 --> 00:11:32.191
The guys look at each other
and go...

00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:33.793
[gagging].

00:11:35.194 --> 00:11:38.564
"Let's go down and have
another piece of that cake."

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:40.966
And they go downstairs
and have cake and coffee.

00:11:40.966 --> 00:11:42.968
And my mom's talking to 'em.

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:46.104
"Well, boys,
how's your mother doing?"

00:11:46.104 --> 00:11:47.639
She says to them.

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:49.141
"Oh, she's good."

00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:52.811
"Tell her I said hi."

00:11:52.811 --> 00:11:55.146
And they have another
piece of cake.

00:11:55.146 --> 00:11:57.916
And my dad whispers to
my other brother...

00:11:57.916 --> 00:11:59.484
[whispering]

00:11:59.484 --> 00:12:01.086
That's all I could hear.

00:12:01.086 --> 00:12:02.388
[whispering faintly]

00:12:02.388 --> 00:12:04.490
[coughs loudly]

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:09.227
And then my brother
gets in our Buick

00:12:09.227 --> 00:12:11.496
and screeches out of there.

00:12:11.496 --> 00:12:13.265
And of course, just reflex,

00:12:13.265 --> 00:12:16.936
the FBI jump up, run out,

00:12:16.936 --> 00:12:19.838
and get in their car
and go after him.

00:12:19.838 --> 00:12:23.142
And then my brother
throws the clothes off

00:12:23.142 --> 00:12:26.344
and comes down the stairs
and goes out the back door,

00:12:26.344 --> 00:12:28.514
and escapes.

00:12:28.514 --> 00:12:30.348
And my mom goes,

00:12:30.348 --> 00:12:33.352
"That cake is good, isn't it?"

00:12:33.352 --> 00:12:36.489
[cheers and applause]

00:12:37.856 --> 00:12:39.692
Thank you.

00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:44.363
And that's my family.

00:12:44.363 --> 00:12:46.364
And my brother,
the great thing is,

00:12:46.364 --> 00:12:48.634
that my brother
turned his life around

00:12:48.634 --> 00:12:51.103
and he started, you know,

00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:52.804
teaching the police.

00:12:52.804 --> 00:12:57.142
He started telling them,
basically...

00:12:57.142 --> 00:12:59.477
how dumb they were.

00:12:59.477 --> 00:13:00.846
That's what he explained to me.

00:13:00.846 --> 00:13:03.148
But I love my brother,
I miss him,

00:13:03.148 --> 00:13:04.550
and I dedicate this show to him.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:07.119
Love you.

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:08.120
Thank you.
