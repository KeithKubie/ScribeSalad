00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.399
&gt;&gt; There's been a question about what the
most significant innovation

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:11.900
or development are likely to be over the next
decade and I would hazard

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.140
that there are two areas that need this innovation
more than any other.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.230
The first is energy.
We aren't nearly sufficient in respect of

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.470
clean, sustainable forms of
energy.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.300
You know there's been broad discussions at
Copenhagen, unfortunately

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.670
insufficient to reach agreement on how to
bring down the level of CO2

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.260
emissions.
But it does lay the basis for innovation in

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.410
respect to energy.
I think that are still perceived risks that

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.540
aren't quite clear and for
some reason, solar is not quite there.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.180
And for many countries that have developed
a dependence on coal, wind

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.830
becomes a very expensive source of energy.
So the big innovation sort, if clean energy

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.489
at lower costs that focus
on costs and access to poor people.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.470
And the second has to be in respect to health
care and ensuring that

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.119
health care's available.
That pharmaceuticals are available to the

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.490
poor.
There's so much more spent on drug treatments

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.869
for wealthy people, for
diseases of the wealthy.

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.860
And yet diseases that impact on the poor include
HIV and AIDS malaria,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.920
blindness arising from black fly, a not being
properly treated because

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.240
there's too little innovation in research
and innovation for drug

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.410
therapies.
In respect to finance clearly to ought to

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.259
be finance for development,
finance for manufacturing, finance for change

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.659
and not as we've seen
over the past 15 years or so, a financial

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.329
sector that exists in
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.479
These are the big issues that will confront
us and as we deal with them

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.819
I'm sure that we will make significant improvements
in lifting more and

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:06.119
people people from the ravages of poverty.
