Hello, I'm with Nir Eyal,

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.470
the author of Hooked,
How to Build Habit Forming Products.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:06.360
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.910
&gt;&gt; My pleasure.
Good to be here.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.180
&gt;&gt; So,
tell me a little bit about the book.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.700
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.310
So, my book is really about
how do products engage users?

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.690
How do we build products and

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.710
services To keep people coming back, not
every business needs to form a habit.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.400
But every business that forms a habit
needs a hook, and so that's what

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.400
the book is really about, it's about
this pattern that I call the hook model.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.170
This four step process of trigger,
action, reward, investment

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.280
that keeps people coming back and using
these various products and services.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.250
And my hope here is that we
can use the psychology of

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.740
what makes products engaging to help
people live happier, healthier,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.880
more productive, more connected
lives by using habits for good.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.980
&gt;&gt; And now,
I as an entrepreneur use this model?

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:52.810
&gt;&gt; Right.
So

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.130
if you're building a product
that requires a habit, so

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.210
if you think about products.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.810
Some of the most successful companies
over the past several years.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.570
Companies like Facebook, and Google, and
Instagram, and WhatsApp and Snapchat,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.350
and Slack these companies have
all formed habits in users.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.400
Now that's not a requirement lot's of
businesses can do just fine without

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.780
forming a habit, but if you're the type
of company who's business model relies

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.290
upon a habit just like those companies
I just mentioned they would go out of

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.430
business if they had to send advertising
every time just to bring people back.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.910
So if you're that kind of company,

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.150
if you're an entrepreneur building
a product that requires people to

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.890
come back on their own, you can use this
framework to figure out, hey do I have

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.120
the fundamental elements that I need to
form, to build a habit-forming product?

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.990
&gt;&gt; Is this only for consumer products?

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.460
&gt;&gt; No.
So whether it's enterprise products or

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.830
consumer products, doesn't matter.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.790
What matters is,
is the product something that people use

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.480
throughout their day with little or
no conscious thought?

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.840
So if you're building an enterprise
application that, you know,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.150
might be some piece of software that's
put into some server farm somewhere and

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.620
nobody actually uses that piece
of software, that's fine.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.490
That's a great business, you know,
you should keep doing that,

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.370
but you just don't need to have it for
that, because that's not used regularly.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.140
On the other hand if you're building an
enterprise product like a communication

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.620
tool, like Slack, or GitHub, or
Stack Overflow, or Sales force.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.910
All of these are enterprise facing
products that necessitate habits.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.270
They require people to
come back on their own.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.780
And for those types of products,
you need a hook.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.650
So these hooks, this four step process,

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.480
starts with a trigger to an action and
a reward and then an investment.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.010
So every hook starts with a trigger.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.090
A trigger prompts the habit and
we have these two types of triggers,

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.120
an external trigger or
an internal trigger.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.970
External triggers are things in
our environment that tell us

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:37.670
what to do next.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.600
They give us some piece of information.

A friend telling you about this great

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.360
new app through word of mouth.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.560
All examples of external triggers.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.690
These external triggers
prompt us to action.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.160
That's the habit itself.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.570
Open an app, scroll through pinterest,
search on google,

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.000
push the play button on YouTube.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.480
These are these actions
that we do with little or

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.650
no conscious thought that
are these very simple behaviors

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.950
these very small behaviors
that we do seeking a reward.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.240
Which brings me to the third step
of the hook the reward stage.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.020
Is where the user's itch is scratched,
where they get what they came for.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.900
And yet there's a bit of mystery
around what they might find

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.120
next time they engage with the product.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.490
So it's not just a reward.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.240
It turns out that habit-forming
technologies integrate what's called

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.840
a variable reward.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.450
So this comes from
the classic work of B.F.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.810
Skinner, the father of
&lrm;operant conditioning.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.590
Skinner found that when he gave
rewards to his pigeons and

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.920
these little boxes on a variable basis.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.380
So, sometimes the pigeons
would peck at the disk,

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.730
they wouldn't receive a reward.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.550
The next time,
they would receive a reward.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.980
What Skinner observed was,
at the rate of response,

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.840
the number of times his pigeons
peck at the disk, increased

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.030
when the reward was given on an
intermittent schedule of reinforcement.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.040
And so in all sorts of products
that we find most habit-forming,

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.700
most engaging, we find this bit of
mystery, this bit of variability.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.330
So searching, and scrolling and
scrolling on a newsfeed, or what makes

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.300
sports fun to watch is the uncertainty
of will our team win the game.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.720
Or what makes for
a great TV show or a movie?

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.480
The uncertainty about how the happy
ending is going to unwind.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.460
All these are examples
of variable rewards.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.010
And finally, the investment phase,
the last step of the hook.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.620
The investment phase is where the user
is prompted to put something into

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.530
the product, to invest in the product
In anticipation of a future benefit.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.760
So, the purpose of investments
is to increase the likelihood fo

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.820
the next pass.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.360
That's what the investment phase is for,
and it does this in two ways.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.370
The investments load the next trigger.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.460
So, loading the next trigger, an example
of that would be, when I send someone

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.450
a message on WhatsApp I don't
get any immediate rewards.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.660
Right?
There's no leader boards,

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.540
there's not badges, there's no points,
nothing really happens.

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.730
What I'm doing is I'm loading the next
trigger because I'm likely to

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:55.550
get a reply.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.070
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; And that reply comes coupled with

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.170
an external trigger.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.580
Hey, here's a message from your friend
which prompts me to use the hook

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.880
once again.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.900
The second way that investments
increase the likelihood of an x-pass

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.560
is by storing value,
and this is a big deal.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.910
Storing value is when the product
gets better and better with use,

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.570
it appreciates in value.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.910
And it does this by storing data,
followers,

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.620
reputation, content
&gt;&gt; Photos.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.080
&gt;&gt; Right.
Anything that I'm putting into the app

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.800
that gets better and better over time.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.680
And so it's through successive cycles,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.140
through these hooks trigger
action reward investment

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.020
that now an association has built
with that second type of trigger.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.530
Remember I told you there was two types
of triggers: external triggers and

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.720
internal triggers.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.450
The internal trigger
are these things in our life

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:45.930
that prompt us to action like a place, a
situation, a routine, a certain person.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.850
And most frequently, emotions that
prompt us to do this next action,

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.500
this next habit with little or

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.870
no conscious thought, but
without any explicit information.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.550
So over time,

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.810
through successive cycles through
these hooks, now we use the product.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.320
Not with a message that tells us,
hey click here, but

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.920
&gt;&gt; With a need.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.830
&gt;&gt; With a need, exactly.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.320
We internally trigger ourselves.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.880
We have these associations, so,
I'm lonely, I check Facebook.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.640
I'm uncertain, I Google.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.570
I'm bored and
I'm on YouTube or Reddit or

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.620
checking stock prices or
sports scores, right?

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.110
We do these things instantaneously
because of the successive cycles

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.800
through these hooks.
