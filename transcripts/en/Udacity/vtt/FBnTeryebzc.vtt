00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.830
Honeypots can be deployed in
a variety of locations on a network.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.420
A honeypot outside the external
firewall is useful for

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.890
tracking attempts to scan or
attack the internal network.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.850
The main advantages of placing
the honeypot at this location are that.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.900
First of all,
it does not have any side effect.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.000
Second, since it attracts and traps
attacks to the honey pot, it reduces

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.190
the amount of traffic, in particular
the attack traffic to the firewall.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.840
Therefore, it reduces
the amount of alerts

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.840
produced by the external firewall.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.705
On the other hand,

00:00:34.705 --> 00:00:39.650
honeypot at this location does
not trap internal attackers.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.730
A honeypot can also be placed in a DMZ

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.150
to trap attacks to
the public facing service.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.110
On the other hand,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.320
a honeypot at this location may not
be able to trap interesting attacks.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.450
This is because a DMZ is
typically not fully accessible.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.150
That is, other than the well
defined public facing services,

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.160
no other services are supposed
to be available in DMZ.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.140
That is, if an attacker is
attempting to access the honeypot.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.650
And the service is not one
of these well-defined,

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.600
public facing services, the firewall
is going to block the traffic.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.800
What if you say, let the firewall
allow the traffic to the honeypot.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.160
But this would mean that we're
opening up the firewall.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.080
And this is a security risk.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.420
We can also place the honeypot
in the internal network

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.110
alongside with servers and workstations.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.840
The main advantages here are that
it can catch internal attacks.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.720
It can also detect
a misconfigured firewall

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.110
that forwards impermissible traffic from
the internet to the internal network.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.150
On the other hand,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.270
unless we can completely trap
the attacker within the honeypot.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.770
The attack may be able to reach other
internal systems from the honeypot.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.062
In addition,
in order to continue to attract and

00:01:56.062 --> 00:01:58.552
trap the attackers to the honeypot,

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:03.312
we must allow his attack traffic
from the internet to their honeypot.

00:02:03.312 --> 00:02:07.793
This means that we must open up the
firewall to allow the attack traffic to

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:11.025
come from the Internet to
the internal network, and

00:02:11.025 --> 00:02:13.240
this carries a huge security risk.
