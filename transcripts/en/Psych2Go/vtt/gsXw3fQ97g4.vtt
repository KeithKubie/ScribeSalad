Five signs and an ambivert likes you

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:16.019
With approximately two-thirds of a population being ambiverts, chances are you've crossed paths with your fair share throughout your life

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.539
Maybe you even fit this category an ambivert represents traits of both introversion and extraversion

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:29.699
meaning that while they enjoy social interactions imparting they also appreciate their time alone every once in a while and

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.899
Hey, maybe you don't fit this group, but you found yourself attracted to an ambivert and want to know if they return the feelings

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.349
Here are five signs and ambivert likes you

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.099
1) They single you out at large gatherings

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.320
While ambiverts can find enjoyment from being around other people. They usually felt more at ease among small groups or having one-on-one

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.439
Conversation if they've ever singled you out at a party

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.230
Chances are they are interested in interacting with you in a setting where they were most comfortable

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.019
2) Spontaneously asking you to hang out

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.069
Ambiverts attitudes can change depending on whether they're on a work or school setting as opposed to a more social one

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.000
Because of this you might at first think them to be very introverted

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.519
Only to be surprised later when they ask you to come along maybe even with a few of their friends

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.880
This is because while ambierts need their time alone

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.269
they might also find comfort in small groups in order to rest from there's more solitary work environment and

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.489
because of the sudden bursts of extroversion they might just work up the courage to ask you out

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.960
3) They seem to be hesitating around you even

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.659
If an ambivert ever seems to be fluctuating in the attitude with which approach you this might be why

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.219
Think of the introverted and extroverted sides of an ambivert arguing over

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:56.129
What's best for their social life while one side might shy away from the social interaction their

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.399
extroverted side really wants to stay and talk to you

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.349
It's not at all that they've changed their minds about you all of a sudden. In fact

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.519
it's such an important decision for them. They can't let themselves take you lightly

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.120
This translates into their online interactions as well

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.100
4) Inconsistent interactions online

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.979
An ambivert might stay up to talk to you until 5:00 a.m.. One day and then proceed to completely disappear from social media the next

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.839
Remember an ambivert needs their alone time as much as their social time. This behavior doesn't mean they've lost interest all of a sudden

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.469
Simply that they must recharge on their own with some alone time

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:43.660
If you can wait this out, they'll appreciate your patience as well as continue interacting with you once they're fully ready to be social again.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.910
5) They show you their playful side and their serious side

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.040
As your relationship with an ambivert deepens you start to discover more and more layers to their

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.779
personality. This means they're letting you into their own little world which can be a sight

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.440
completely different from the one you saw when you first met them perhaps

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.050
they were in very talkative before but as you got to know them they began to show their playful side.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.920
A side of them that in the end is all part of the same person

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.429
and they're letting you in on all of this because they're comfortable around you

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.390
These are some signs an ambivert might like you have you met someone who has shown one or more signs around you

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.209
Maybe this list has helped clear some things up

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.140
