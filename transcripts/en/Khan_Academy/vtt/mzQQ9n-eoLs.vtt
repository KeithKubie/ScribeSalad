00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.826
Voiceover:We have the vector A,

00:00:01.826 --> 00:00:04.173
being equal to five, negative six.

00:00:04.173 --> 00:00:05.647
If we wanted to visualize that,

00:00:05.647 --> 00:00:07.306
we could start at the tail of vector A,

00:00:07.536 --> 00:00:09.445
and we'd wanna move five,

00:00:09.445 --> 00:00:11.507
positive five in the X directions.

00:00:11.507 --> 00:00:14.000
That'd be five to the right
based on our conventions.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.058
We'd wanna move negative
six in the Y directions,

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:21.226
and based on our conventions
that would be six down.

00:00:21.226 --> 00:00:23.896
This length would be six.

00:00:23.896 --> 00:00:24.973
If this was a positive six,

00:00:24.973 --> 00:00:26.706
we would have moved six up, over here.

00:00:26.998 --> 00:00:29.664
This length over here is five.

00:00:30.725 --> 00:00:32.354
Going five to the right,

00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:35.660
and then six down would take us

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.656
from the tail to the head.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.851
Now we are at the head,

00:00:39.851 --> 00:00:45.304
or tip, or arrow side of the vector.

00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:48.022
Let's draw it just like that.

00:00:48.022 --> 00:00:50.829
That's a reasonable
representation for our vector A.

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:52.807
What else can we think about?

00:00:52.807 --> 00:00:55.120
How else could we think about this vector?

00:00:55.304 --> 00:00:58.595
What if we wanted to
figure out its magnitude?

00:00:58.595 --> 00:01:00.312
The magnitude of this vector

00:01:00.312 --> 00:01:02.254
is just the length of this arrow

00:01:02.254 --> 00:01:03.311
if we think of it visually,

00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:05.541
and this is a right triangle.

00:01:05.802 --> 00:01:07.763
We just need to figure out the length

00:01:07.763 --> 00:01:09.491
of the hypotenuse of this right triangle.

00:01:09.491 --> 00:01:11.776
Well we know the lengths
of the two shorter sides.

00:01:11.776 --> 00:01:14.711
The magnitude of vector A

00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:17.039
is just going to be
equal to the square root.

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.977
This is coming straight out

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:19.021
of the Pythagorean theorem.

00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:20.631
Square root of five squared.

00:01:21.323 --> 00:01:26.477
Five squared plus six squared.

00:01:26.908 --> 00:01:29.322
Which is equal to the square root of,

00:01:29.552 --> 00:01:35.047
25 plus 36 is 61.

00:01:35.047 --> 00:01:37.037
The length of this arrow, right over here,

00:01:37.037 --> 00:01:38.205
is square root of 61,

00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:39.931
which is a little bit under eight,

00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:42.207
which actually just makes visual sense.

00:01:42.207 --> 00:01:43.729
That was interesting.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:44.729
Let's say we wanna do something else.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.917
Let's say we wanted to
figure out some unit vector

00:01:46.917 --> 00:01:50.081
that goes in the same direction as A.

00:01:50.081 --> 00:01:51.530
It's a unit vector.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.276
That means that its length is one,

00:01:53.276 --> 00:01:55.113
but it goes in the same direction as A.

00:01:55.113 --> 00:01:56.787
We've seen this before.

00:01:56.787 --> 00:01:59.313
If we call this unit vector U,

00:01:59.313 --> 00:02:00.681
and I'll put the little hat on top of it

00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:01.915
to show that it's a unit vector.

00:02:01.915 --> 00:02:06.913
What we could do is,
we could take vector A,

00:02:06.913 --> 00:02:10.428
and divide it by,
essentially scale it down,

00:02:10.428 --> 00:02:15.070
by the magnitude, by the
magnitude of vector A.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.573
Another way of thinking about it,

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:17.931
this would be equal to.

00:02:18.223 --> 00:02:20.024
This part right over here,

00:02:22.177 --> 00:02:26.002
we could write it like this.

00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:29.216
We could say one over the magnitude

00:02:29.216 --> 00:02:32.337
of vector A, times vector A.

00:02:32.721 --> 00:02:34.290
This makes it pretty clear

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.018
we're just scaling vector A.

00:02:36.018 --> 00:02:37.745
This part, right over here,

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:41.775
that's going to be equal to
one over square root of 61,

00:02:41.775 --> 00:02:42.629
we already figured out that

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.713
this was already the square root of 61.

00:02:44.713 --> 00:02:46.249
We're gonna multiply it times vector A,

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:50.378
which is five, negative six.

00:02:51.285 --> 00:02:55.202
Five, negative 6.

00:02:55.202 --> 00:02:59.225
Now we can scale it up, or scale it down,

00:02:59.225 --> 00:03:01.025
in this case, by just multiplying

00:03:01.025 --> 00:03:03.148
the scaler times each of these components.

00:03:03.148 --> 00:03:15.008
U is equal to five over
the square root of 61,

00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:18.824
all I'm doing is I'm scaling
each of the components

00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:20.041
in the X direction and the Y direction

00:03:20.041 --> 00:03:22.912
by one over the square root of 61,

00:03:22.912 --> 00:03:26.525
negative six over the square root of 61.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.441
That was interesting.

00:03:29.087 --> 00:03:30.431
Let's ask ourselves another question.

00:03:30.431 --> 00:03:35.461
What would we have to
multiply U by to get A?

00:03:35.461 --> 00:03:38.143
What scaler could we
multiply it by to get A?

00:03:38.358 --> 00:03:41.236
Our answer is actually right over here.

00:03:41.236 --> 00:03:43.927
We see that the vector U
is equal to the vector A,

00:03:43.927 --> 00:03:47.240
essentially divided by this scaler.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.247
If you multiply both
sides times the scaler,

00:03:49.247 --> 00:03:52.808
you get the magnitude of A,

00:03:52.808 --> 00:03:54.141
which is just a number,

00:03:54.141 --> 00:03:55.479
it's just a length of the side,

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:59.551
times our unit vector U,

00:03:59.551 --> 00:04:04.381
is going to be equal
to our original vector.

00:04:04.381 --> 00:04:06.433
If we wanted to write our original vector,

00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:08.164
kinda broken up this way,

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:09.896
we could say that our original vector,

00:04:09.896 --> 00:04:11.823
is equal to its magnitude,

00:04:11.823 --> 00:04:15.949
is equal to the square root of 61,

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:20.894
times our unit vector, that makes sense,

00:04:20.894 --> 00:04:22.655
the length of this unit vector

00:04:22.655 --> 00:04:27.921
is one square root of 61th
of this entire length,

00:04:27.921 --> 00:04:29.938
right over here, and
this of course is going

00:04:29.938 --> 00:04:31.987
to be the same thing as the square root

00:04:31.987 --> 00:04:37.054
of 61 times all of this business.

00:04:38.376 --> 00:04:42.524
Copy and paste times all that business,

00:04:42.524 --> 00:04:44.800
and I think it might jump out at you

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.071
if you multiply the scaler,

00:04:46.071 --> 00:04:47.751
you're gonna multiply it times
each of these components,

00:04:47.751 --> 00:04:51.287
you're going to be left
with five, negative six.

00:04:51.287 --> 00:04:52.600
The whole reason why I did this

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.321
is just to make you a
little bit more comfortable

00:04:54.321 --> 00:04:55.527
with the different ways

00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:57.137
of manipulating these notations.

00:04:57.137 --> 00:04:58.792
Sometimes when you see this type of thing

00:04:58.792 --> 00:05:00.977
with these double lines on either side,

00:05:00.977 --> 00:05:02.275
it looks like something very fancy,

00:05:02.275 --> 00:05:04.056
but it's really just
talking about the magnitude

00:05:04.056 --> 00:05:06.344
of the vector, the length of the vector.

00:05:06.344 --> 00:05:08.538
The whole point of this is just to relate

00:05:08.538 --> 00:05:10.770
the vector itself to the magnitude

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.266
of the vector to a unit vector

00:05:13.266 --> 00:05:15.620
going in the same direction.
