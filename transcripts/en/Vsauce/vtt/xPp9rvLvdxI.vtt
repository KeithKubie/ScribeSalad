00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.899
The best way to play horseshoes and
Rihanna's butt sings a song.

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.579
It's episode 36 of IMG!

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.480
Mankind has come a long way

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.929
but this concept for an alarm clock that
slowly shreds money

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.730
until you wake up and stop it is genius.
Less genius

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.069
is this guy.
Kid, kid,

00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:24.599
shark kid.
And here's a cat with cat-shaped

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.659
fur.
Enjoy your summer with a Death Star melon

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:31.259
and once cold weather arrives, wear some
mittens that have a second pair of

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.019
mittens build into them,
so you can hold your child's hand

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:37.340
and give them gloves.
Is this the front or

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.199
the side of a man?
And this blurry face is both

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.589
one face and two faces kissing.
Can you see both?

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.519
But now a famous psychology experiment.
Which of these shapes is called

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.679
'bouba' and which is called 'kiki?'
It turns out

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:56.010
that because our brains so naturally assign
abstract concepts to sounds,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.710
around the world, no matter what language
or culture people come from,

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.159
nearly 98 percent call this one 'kiki,'

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.310
and that one 'bouba.'
However this is not how to use

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.380
doorknob.
So let's do triplets. Mariachi band,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.220
fried chicken, bathtub.
Man, monkey,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.140
parrot.
And now let's enjoy classic cartoon heroes

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.680
as pin-up girls.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.810
This cat can be made out of this cat
by doing this.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.970
And this goose is wearing sandals.
People don't always listen to

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.250
rules and they can't always see the
hidden dog.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.910
Once you find him, make a cooper and jump.
Reddit brought us Bruce Willis

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.040
loving Bruce Willis.
But here's a kid who is forever

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.350
alone.
Here's a photographer... oh.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.440
The only thing worse is sending mail to
this address.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.720
Clippy is just as annoying in real life,
but tattoing your Facebook friends

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.979
onto your real life arm

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.940
is awesome. On facebook.com/VsauceGaming
David showed us a

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:07.550
panda

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.250
dog, and Nicolas suggested a twisted
E = mc 2

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.610
that's more emo. A different guy named David
displayed some LEGO creations he's selling

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.610
on eBay.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.709
This toilet is creative,
but these are even scarier.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.820
Today's episode of IMG! was very
special because right now

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.950
I am in London.
In fact, check this out. That

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.580
bathtub, that is now a table,
used to belong and was used

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.709
by Douglas Adams.
A couple days ago I was in Dublin

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.320
and terminal 2 at the Dublin Airport is
very important.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.900
Let me show you what it looks like when
you drive in. Now, if you think of it in a

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.100
certain way it can kind of remind you

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.540
of being born, except in reverse.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.530
Think about that for a second.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.830
And as always,

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:56.930
thanks for watching.
