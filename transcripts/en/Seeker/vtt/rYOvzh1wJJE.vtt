00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.919
When it comes to sustaining life, some planets
in our solar system are too close to the sun

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.560
and some are too far away, but Earth is just
right.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.590
How did we get so lucky?

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.530
Turns out we may not be so special.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.900
Like, at all.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.530
Hello again, I’m Julian and this is DNews.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.530
Earth is pretty great.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.750
It’s got huge bodies of water just lying
all over it, and they allowed life as we know

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.980
it to exist and thrive.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.820
So when we’re looking for life out there
among the stars, liquid water is the holy

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.820
grail.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.129
Not all planets can have liquid water, it
depends on how far the planet is from its

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:36.129
star.

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.409
Too close and the water evaporates, too far
and it all freezes.

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:41.070
In between is the Habitable Zone.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.680
The zone’s size and location varies from
star to star depending on its luminosity.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.329
Luminosity is a function of the star’s temperature
and size.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.550
If it’s hot and/or big, it’s more luminous
and the habitable zone is farther away and

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.550
bigger.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.440
In 2009 NASA launched the Kepler space telescope
to scan the night sky for Goldilocks planets

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.729
orbiting other stars, and the numbers scientists
are extrapolating from its findings are pretty

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:05.729
staggering.

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.009
The problem with the way Kepler works is,
to find planets they need to be big, fairly

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.049
close to the star, and pass between us and
the star.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.119
If a planet is farther away in the habitable
zone, Kepler probably can’t see it.

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.869
To get around this problem researchers from
the Australian National University and the

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.049
Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen applied
the Titius-Bode law to a sample of 151 stars

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.619
Kepler had found with 3 to 6 planets.

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.909
The Titius-Bode law was proposed in 1766 by
Johann Daniel Titius and described mathematically

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.659
by Johann Ellert Bode in 1772.

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.509
Yes, everyone was named Johann back then.

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.270
It predicts the orbits of planets in stable
planetary systems, but “law” is a bit

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.890
of a strong word and it’s really more a
rule of thumb.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.899
It was used to predict the orbit of Uranus
before it was discovered in 1781, but overestimated

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.520
what Neptune’s orbit should be by about
10 AUs.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.009
Still, there’s a high probability that a
planetary system will follow the rule and

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.929
indeed 124 of the 151 systems researchers
looked at were bang on.

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:11.450
So if more planets were added following Bode’s
law, the stars should have between 1 and 3

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.810
each.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.380
To be more conservative, 31 of the star systems
either already had observable planets in the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.910
habitable zone, or only needed one more planet
to have one.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.860
Researchers predict an average of 2 planets
in the habitable zone around these stars,

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.300
and furthermore a “good share” of those
will be solid and could host liquid water.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.890
To see if the idea holds water the astronomers
are looking for 77 predicted planets that

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.080
Kepler should be able to see in 40 star systems.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.330
A “good share” of 62 planets out of 151
solar systems may not sound like much, but

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.150
remember the universe is a pretty big place.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.700
In just our galaxy, that translates to potentially
hospitable planets numbering in the billions.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:53.720
With a B.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.050
Once we find the planets though, the next
step is finding water.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.140
Trace covers how we do that down here.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.470
Check the description for the link if you’re
on your mobile.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.130
So, potentially billions of planets that could
sustain life right here in our back yard.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.400
Still think we’re alone?

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.440
