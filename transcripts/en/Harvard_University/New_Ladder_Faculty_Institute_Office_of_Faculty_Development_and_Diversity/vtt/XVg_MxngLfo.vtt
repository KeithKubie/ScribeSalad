00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.227
Thank you. So we are going to start
the panel sessions.

00:00:12.356 --> 00:00:14.754
And this year,

00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:17.678
as you will see from our schedule,

00:00:18.035 --> 00:00:23.220
the theme of the faculty panels is
Establishing Your Professional Identity.

00:00:23.258 --> 00:00:27.904
And I'm delighted in particular
to be able to introduce

00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:32.739
the panelists that we have
for this morning to you.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:40.167
They are individuals who have managed
to figure out the system that is Harvard

00:00:40.671 --> 00:00:47.059
and who have gone through the process
of being promoted here at Harvard.

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.485
And I hope that they will be able
to give you some insights

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:56.364
about the ways in which these
processes occur at this institution.

00:00:56.677 --> 00:01:00.800
So we have three associate
professors in the first panel

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.761
and I'd like to
introduce them briefly.

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:04.806
They will each have 10 minutes
to make remarks

00:01:04.915 --> 00:01:07.455
and then we will have plenty of time
at the end

00:01:07.765 --> 00:01:11.921
for conversation, discussion,
questions and answers, et cetera.

00:01:12.256 --> 00:01:14.909
So our first panelist
is Nonie Lesaux.

00:01:14.982 --> 00:01:19.656
She is the Marie and Max Kargman
Associate Professor in Human Development

00:01:19.656 --> 00:01:21.320
and Urban Education Advancement

00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:23.520
at the Harvard Graduate
School of Education.

00:01:23.753 --> 00:01:25.918
Dr. Lesaux leads a research program

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:29.772
that focuses on the reading development
and difficulties of children

00:01:29.773 --> 00:01:31.929
from linguistically diverse backgrounds.

00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:34.778
Her developmental and
instructional research

00:01:34.896 --> 00:01:38.829
has implications for practitioners,
researchers, and policy makers.

00:01:39.076 --> 00:01:43.662
From 2004 to 2006,
Nonie was Senior Research Associate

00:01:44.034 --> 00:01:47.152
of the National Literacy Panel
on Language Minority Youth

00:01:47.152 --> 00:01:48.400
and named one of five

00:01:48.401 --> 00:01:50.440
William T. Grant Scholars

00:01:50.441 --> 00:01:53.080
earning a $350,000 five-year award

00:01:53.272 --> 00:01:56.587
from the W.T. Grant Foundation
in support of her research

00:01:56.698 --> 00:01:59.610
on English language learners
in urban public schools.

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.000
Dr. Lesaux is a member
of the Society

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:03.600
for the Scientific Study of Reading,

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.864
International Academy for Research
in Learning Disabilities,

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:10.120
Society for Research in Child Development,

00:02:10.121 --> 00:02:14.000
and many other
distinguished organizations.

00:02:14.057 --> 00:02:17.165
She is also a member of the
Reading First Advisory Committee

00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:21.361
for the Secretary of Education,
the U.S. Department of Education.

00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:25.507
Dr. Lesaux received her PhD.
at University of British Columbia,

00:02:25.808 --> 00:02:27.920
and I'm pleased to say that

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.040
she recently received the
Presidential Early Career Award

00:02:31.003 --> 00:02:35.200
for Scientists and Engineers
awarded by the White House in 2009.

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.000
Our second panelist is
Dr. Juan C. Celedon

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:42.780
who is Associate Professor of Medicine
at Harvard Medical School

00:02:42.797 --> 00:02:46.536
as well as Associate Physician
at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

00:02:46.811 --> 00:02:51.075
Dr. Celedon's primary area of research
is to identify genetic factors

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.177
and environmental exposure
that influence the development

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:56.040
of obstructive airway diseases

00:02:56.041 --> 00:02:59.080
asthma and chronic obstructive,
pulmonary diseases

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.257
in general and among
Hispanics in particular.

00:03:02.777 --> 00:03:05.284
Juan currently leads
three NIH-funded studies

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:08.880
of the genetics of obstructive airway diseases

00:03:08.881 --> 00:03:10.840
in individuals of Hispanic descent.

00:03:11.276 --> 00:03:14.521
Two of these studies
employ a family-based design

00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:19.216
to examine the relation between
genetic factors and asthma and COPD

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:23.288
in an isolated Hispanic population
living in the central valley of Costa Rica.

00:03:23.533 --> 00:03:25.680
And the third study
uses a case control design

00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:27.280
to examine the relation
among genes,

00:03:27.804 --> 00:03:32.223
indoor allergen exposure and asthma
phenotypes among Puerto Rican children.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.543
Dr. Celedon has been leading a
study of the relation between--

00:03:36.746 --> 00:03:40.924
also between the maternal and neonatal
gut flora and asthma and allergic diseases.

00:03:41.258 --> 00:03:45.865
He received his medical degree
from Bogota, Columbia in 1988,

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.186
and then PH in Quantitative
Methods in 1999,

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:53.963
and a DPH in Genetic Epidemiology in 2001
from the Harvard School of Public Health.

00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:58.166
Our third panelist is Sarah
Stewart-Mukhopadhyay,

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.164
who is the John Loeb Associate Professor
of the Natural Sciences.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.036
Her research focuses on collisional processes
including planet formation,

00:04:07.073 --> 00:04:10.558
catastrophic disruption and
surface modification.

00:04:10.847 --> 00:04:12.960
Laboratory measurements
of the equation of state

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.160
and dynamic strength
of planetary materials

00:04:15.212 --> 00:04:16.930
using shockwave techniques,

00:04:17.001 --> 00:04:19.640
as well as experimental and computational

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.360
studies of impact processes

00:04:21.598 --> 00:04:25.640
to interpret the resurfacing
history, physical properties

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.795
and internal structure of planets,
moons, asteroids and comets.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.120
Dr. Stewart-Mukhopadhyay
is a Director

00:04:33.121 --> 00:04:35.320
of the Shock Compression
Laboratory at Harvard.

00:04:35.672 --> 00:04:38.917
She received her PhD in Planetary Sciences

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.837
with a minor in Astrophysics from
Caltech in Pasadena in 2002,

00:04:45.837 --> 00:04:48.800
and her AB in astronomy
and astrophysics

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.440
and physics here at
Harvard University.

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:55.476
Prior to coming to Harvard, she was a
Carnegie Post-Doc Fellow

00:04:55.644 --> 00:04:58.391
at the Carnegie Institution
in Washington, D.C.

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:01.972
And among her many numerous honors,
Dr. Stewart-Mukhopadhyay

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.080
also received the Presidential
Early Career Award

00:05:04.081 --> 00:05:06.280
for Scientists and Engineers in 2004,

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.687
and received most recently
the Harold Urey Prize in 2009.

00:05:12.071 --> 00:05:17.836
So we will first start with Dr. Lesaux
and we'll move forward from there.

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:18.942
Thanks.

00:05:18.942 --> 00:05:22.621
I heard somebody say
we figured out Harvard

00:05:22.621 --> 00:05:26.192
and I felt maybe I should go back
to that side of the room.

00:05:26.496 --> 00:05:28.885
But thanks for the invite.

00:05:28.885 --> 00:05:32.936
I think, you know,
I'll start with two kind of caveats

00:05:32.936 --> 00:05:36.030
that are really inherent
in this sort of exercise.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.640
And the first is there is
something extremely personal

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.520
about the experience
of being an academic,

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.193
of being a member
of an academic community.

00:05:45.193 --> 00:05:48.490
And so you do know yourself
and your circumstances best,

00:05:48.942 --> 00:05:51.363
and those are really in some ways
your best guides,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.960
so that's sort of one caveat.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.640
The second is that
the methodologist in me says,

00:05:56.645 --> 00:06:00.000
"Well, this retrospective
analysis, the sort of looking back,

00:06:00.064 --> 00:06:04.068
is always a kind of
dangerous venture."

00:06:04.068 --> 00:06:08.186
But with those caveats in mind,
I really just thought about three things

00:06:08.186 --> 00:06:10.716
that I think you might consider
as you go forward.

00:06:10.716 --> 00:06:14.364
And the first is really
that in some ways,

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.344
it's kind of the keep it
simple factor, which is

00:06:19.081 --> 00:06:22.640
--I'm sort of continually
struck by the fact

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.400
that the recipe for
early career success is sort of

00:06:25.505 --> 00:06:28.018
remarkably simple
and straightforward.

00:06:28.018 --> 00:06:29.560
And that's not that it's not difficult

00:06:29.561 --> 00:06:31.720
and that it doesn't
bear on level of effort,

00:06:31.776 --> 00:06:36.080
but that the actual ingredients that
kind of go into early career success

00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:39.661
are the same ones that probably
you heard about in grad school.

00:06:39.661 --> 00:06:43.085
They're the same ones
that drove your hire here,

00:06:43.085 --> 00:06:44.559
the reason that
you're sitting here.

00:06:45.081 --> 00:06:49.922
So my sort of sense is that you
just need to stay really caught up

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.976
in your personal professional plan

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.800
that you are people with strong
ideas about your professional life.

00:06:57.478 --> 00:07:00.184
You had a plan by
virtue of the doctorate

00:07:00.728 --> 00:07:02.720
and applying here, and that plan

00:07:02.721 --> 00:07:05.120
sells you and others around you.

00:07:05.546 --> 00:07:07.560
You've thought about
the way you teach,

00:07:07.581 --> 00:07:09.819
you've made a choice about
the academic routes.

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:11.884
So as you kind of move forward,

00:07:11.941 --> 00:07:15.250
sort of remember that
you do have that plan

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.920
and you have that in your
hand still as you begin your career.

00:07:19.018 --> 00:07:22.440
And at the same time,
what you don't want to do,

00:07:22.517 --> 00:07:24.240
so you want to get caught up
in your own plan,

00:07:24.347 --> 00:07:26.840
and what you don't want to do
is get totally caught up

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.071
doubting or second-guessing yourself

00:07:30.071 --> 00:07:32.582
by virtue of watching
those around you,

00:07:32.582 --> 00:07:35.880
by hearing about what's reportedly
working better for them.

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:38.441
You know, you want to
get some insights

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.628
but not to worry so much about
the roads that others are taking

00:07:41.684 --> 00:07:45.327
because in fact there are so many roads
to a successful career.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.920
And keep in mind that
as President Faust said,

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.080
there are so many
supports here to--

00:07:53.167 --> 00:07:56.476
that in some ways you do have
that advantage of really,

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:59.032
truly carrying out your plans

00:07:59.032 --> 00:08:02.293
because as you refine and develop
your skills and ideas,

00:08:02.293 --> 00:08:05.259
you've got these tremendous supports
around here to do that;

00:08:05.259 --> 00:08:08.365
both in the research realm
and in the teaching realm.

00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:13.648
So kind of concrete things about this
straightforward sort of recipe

00:08:14.527 --> 00:08:17.185
for high impact solid
work and good teaching:

00:08:17.593 --> 00:08:20.430
I'd say every now and again
reread the statement that you wrote

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:21.950
when you applied here.

00:08:21.989 --> 00:08:23.600
Every now and again just reread it

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.400
and see how it's working for you,
what's working for you.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.400
I've done that since writing
my statement for associate,

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.650
for promotion to associate.

00:08:31.703 --> 00:08:33.680
It's a very clarifying
experience, right,

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.760
when one sets out their plans
and their philosophy

00:08:36.761 --> 00:08:38.840
about their teaching
and their goals.

00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:41.200
And so reread that
every now and again.

00:08:42.305 --> 00:08:45.880
The second thing is, and this
sort of feeds into this slight

00:08:45.881 --> 00:08:50.480
tension between collaboration
and trying to carve out what's yours,

00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:53.800
but I personally looking back and again,
this is sort of the two cents -

00:08:53.801 --> 00:08:58.240
I think try to get
something that's truly yours

00:08:58.241 --> 00:09:00.320
in the first several years
that you're here.

00:09:00.441 --> 00:09:04.400
And I don't say that like it can't
be part of collaborative work

00:09:04.401 --> 00:09:08.320
but I do think that early on it
makes sense to have a project

00:09:08.321 --> 00:09:11.160
or some kind of initiative
that feels like yours.

00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:15.240
And I'm not--you know that might
be a grant to carry out a study,

00:09:15.241 --> 00:09:19.040
it might be a book contract, it might
be launching some kind of initiative.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.880
And here I'm really not
talking about the politics

00:09:21.881 --> 00:09:23.280
or sort of playing your cards,

00:09:23.201 --> 00:09:27.200
but I am sort of
thinking that there are

00:09:27.201 --> 00:09:30.520
things that you need to
do to establish yourself

00:09:30.521 --> 00:09:33.720
but also to give yourself that
added confidence to really say

00:09:33.721 --> 00:09:35.880
"This is kind of what
I'm working on."

00:09:35.881 --> 00:09:39.000
Even if it's a piece of an overall
collaborative endeavor

00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:43.160
it can kind of keep you,
pushing forward.

00:09:43.902 --> 00:09:48.000
And so even in a collaborative,
sort of, interdisciplinary approach,

00:09:48.001 --> 00:09:51.400
there are still ways to kind of carve
out pieces that are yours.

00:09:51.401 --> 00:09:56.480
And in so, in my case, for example,
I got a small grant from the NICHD,

00:09:56.481 --> 00:09:57.880
from the National Institute of Health

00:09:57.881 --> 00:10:00.480
in my second year,
late in my second year.

00:10:00.641 --> 00:10:03.440
And it just kind of practically speaking
gave me a boost.

00:10:03.441 --> 00:10:06.400
I hired some students
who were here on campus.

00:10:06.401 --> 00:10:10.360
The money was here at Harvard.
It was my account.

00:10:10.361 --> 00:10:12.680
But it was also just a
boost for my career.

00:10:12.681 --> 00:10:14.880
It was kind of a push
in the right direction.

00:10:14.761 --> 00:10:16.800
And so it doesn't have to be
all that you're doing,

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.240
it doesn't have to
be monumental,

00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:21.480
but it's something that you feel like
is yours early on.

00:10:21.481 --> 00:10:25.240
And finally, on this sort of
straightforward piece I'd say,

00:10:25.241 --> 00:10:29.680
you know, I think stay as close as
you can to your research and teaching.

00:10:29.681 --> 00:10:32.160
Presumably you didn't do a PhD

00:10:32.161 --> 00:10:36.160
to kind of think a lot about the
administration of the organization,

00:10:36.161 --> 00:10:40.680
and so I would say if you can
keep the politics at an arm's length

00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:45.320
and I actually, again, don't say this
so much with politics per se in mind,

00:10:45.321 --> 00:10:47.840
but I do say it with
your own time in mind;

00:10:47.841 --> 00:10:51.920
which is that, you know, in part
I can almost guarantee

00:10:51.921 --> 00:10:54.200
that in the next
several years somebody -

00:10:54.201 --> 00:10:57.440
a dean or a department chair
or a member of senior faculty -

00:10:57.441 --> 00:11:01.120
will tap you on the shoulder to do
something in particular,

00:11:01.121 --> 00:11:02.640
some additional service,

00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:05.680
your participation in a new initiative
that they're launching,

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.200
the development of
some kind of new course,

00:11:08.201 --> 00:11:12.640
kind of getting a course off out of the
brackets and back on to the books.

00:11:12.641 --> 00:11:17.520
And it is additional. Those kinds
of endeavors can be intensive.

00:11:17.521 --> 00:11:22.000
You will say yes when that
happens because you just will.

00:11:22.001 --> 00:11:26.640
And so what you want to do is feel
like that's actually time well spent

00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:29.440
and feel like that's sort
of your chance to be--

00:11:29.441 --> 00:11:32.800
to shape something new to contribute
to the organization, to be seen.

00:11:32.801 --> 00:11:35.040
And it ends up being
constructive and productive.

00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:37.800
And so keep that in mind
as you go forward,

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.640
is that probably there'll be a time

00:11:42.401 --> 00:11:45.080
into the administration
of the organization.

00:11:45.241 --> 00:11:47.920
So that's sort of a little
about the recipe.

00:11:47.921 --> 00:11:52.720
The second thing that I really
want to kind of push a little bit on

00:11:52.721 --> 00:11:56.600
is that this really is a marathon.
It's really not a sprint.

00:11:56.601 --> 00:12:01.760
And so don't come out of the gates and
empty the tank in a really short time

00:12:01.761 --> 00:12:03.760
because you are really
going to need to pace

00:12:03.761 --> 00:12:06.200
yourselves over
the next several years.

00:12:06.241 --> 00:12:09.480
And so I think that
can be really tricky

00:12:09.481 --> 00:12:10.720
particularly when, you know,

00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:12.600
by year two you're
preparing a package

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.000
that is for review.

00:12:15.001 --> 00:12:17.840
But ultimately, this is kind
of a long range enterprise.

00:12:17.881 --> 00:12:19.960
Whether you're here or
at any other institution,

00:12:19.961 --> 00:12:23.840
the academic enterprise is one
that sort of takes time.

00:12:23.881 --> 00:12:27.080
And to really develop good
ideas and do really solid work,

00:12:27.081 --> 00:12:30.320
you do need the time but you
also need to pace yourself.

00:12:30.321 --> 00:12:32.960
And so I sort of think of it two ways;

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:34.840
both practically, this isn't a marathon--

00:12:34.881 --> 00:12:39.360
or sorry, this is not a sprint--but
also intellectually it's not a sprint,

00:12:39.361 --> 00:12:42.440
which is that you don't want to spread,
you don't want to get so involved.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.680
It's very easy to kind of have this,
your hand in this and this and this,

00:12:46.681 --> 00:12:51.160
and not to be going sort of
deep in sort of one particular area

00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:53.760
or tackling one particular problem.

00:12:53.761 --> 00:12:57.520
So think not just about the next
one or two years

00:12:57.521 --> 00:13:00.680
but try to think even
five, seven, ten years out.

00:13:00.681 --> 00:13:02.840
Probably five or seven is really

00:13:02.841 --> 00:13:04.280
where you're going to
be most comfortable.

00:13:04.441 --> 00:13:08.240
And you want to think about
different priorities at different stages

00:13:08.241 --> 00:13:11.360
so that some semesters become
much more about your teaching

00:13:11.361 --> 00:13:12.680
than they do about your research,

00:13:12.681 --> 00:13:15.520
and other semesters become
much more about the

00:13:15.521 --> 00:13:18.320
funding for proposals
and that kind of thing.

00:13:18.441 --> 00:13:21.120
And you just want to be sort of

00:13:21.121 --> 00:13:22.240
pacing yourself so that you're not

00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:24.480
trying to work on
everything all at once.

00:13:24.521 --> 00:13:29.120
And, um, you know, it really does
work for me to liken my junior years.

00:13:29.121 --> 00:13:31.560
I'm now in year
seven to the marathon

00:13:31.561 --> 00:13:33.600
which is one of
the two big mistakes

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.880
one makes when
they run a race poorly.

00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:37.800
One is you start out too fast.

00:13:37.801 --> 00:13:40.960
The second is you start
to lose focus about half,

00:13:41.001 --> 00:13:42.320
two-thirds of the way through.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.720
You kind of have to dig deep,

00:13:43.721 --> 00:13:48.280
stay really focused
mentally and keep pushing.

00:13:48.201 --> 00:13:51.240
And ultimately, you need
something left in the tank.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.280
So if we take the
five or seven-year plan,

00:13:55.281 --> 00:13:58.840
I would say what
happens is over time,

00:13:58.841 --> 00:14:04.640
in some ways the years right
now can feel the most stressful

00:14:04.641 --> 00:14:05.440
at some level because
the place is new,

00:14:05.441 --> 00:14:08.080
because you're adjusting,
because it's--

00:14:08.361 --> 00:14:10.560
you're sort of you
haven't figured it all out,

00:14:10.561 --> 00:14:12.760
you're kind of getting a sense of

00:14:12.761 --> 00:14:15.480
the institution but also
the job of an academic.

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:18.160
So there is that stress
associated with the newness.

00:14:18.161 --> 00:14:22.160
But by virtue of your
advancing career over time,

00:14:22.161 --> 00:14:25.440
what happens is your load
kind of very gradually

00:14:25.441 --> 00:14:29.880
but very steadily increases and
becomes heavier and heavier, right?

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:35.440
And so in my case, for example,
right over there across the street,

00:14:35.441 --> 00:14:38.880
there's two post-docs, three
fulltime research associates,

00:14:38.881 --> 00:14:41.800
several doc students,

00:14:41.841 --> 00:14:44.920
two large federal grants,

00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:48.440
uh, big projects and research
assistants across the country

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.120
that we're working with. And that's
just a part of my picture, right,

00:14:52.121 --> 00:14:55.240
that's the research side,
which is fine beacause, you know,

00:14:55.241 --> 00:14:58.160
as most people advance their
careers, that's going to happen.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.800
The key is that in academia,

00:15:00.961 --> 00:15:05.680
you've got these mechanisms
where actually you can find time.

00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:07.920
And so my concrete suggestion

00:15:07.921 --> 00:15:11.720
is to be thinking ahead
about the grants and fellowships

00:15:11.761 --> 00:15:14.040
that really do buy out your time

00:15:14.041 --> 00:15:17.120
and let you focus because as part
of establishing your reputation

00:15:17.241 --> 00:15:20.200
is being able to carve out
the time to do the good work

00:15:20.201 --> 00:15:23.600
and be part of intellectual communities here and elsewhere,

00:15:24.001 --> 00:15:28.320
then the trick is to
find the time to do that.

00:15:28.321 --> 00:15:31.000
So I'm not really the
person to tell you all

00:15:31.001 --> 00:15:34.480
about the different fellowships
and grants in your particular fields,

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:39.800
but I will say to really think
through and do your research on

00:15:39.801 --> 00:15:42.680
those tailored to early
career scholars.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.440
So it doesn't mean that it has
to be practical money to do research.

00:15:47.441 --> 00:15:50.720
It's often just money
to buy out your time.

00:15:50.721 --> 00:15:53.360
And so what comes to mind for me

00:15:53.361 --> 00:15:56.480
are awards like the
NSF Early Career Award,

00:15:56.521 --> 00:15:59.360
the Robert Johnson Scholars
which is not for early careers

00:15:59.361 --> 00:16:02.120
but it can be really well
used in the early career.

00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:04.880
The W.T.Grant Foundation
Scholars Award,

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:07.760
which is one I have five--
that's a five-year award

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:12.320
that is sort of 50% of my time
every year which is significant.

00:16:12.321 --> 00:16:14.840
Foundation for Child Development,

00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:19.560
the Radcliffe Fellowships that
President Faust in part initiated.

00:16:19.641 --> 00:16:21.840
There are a number
of initiatives like that

00:16:21.841 --> 00:16:23.440
and folks around who know that.

00:16:23.561 --> 00:16:24.440
Some of them come with mentoring,

00:16:24.441 --> 00:16:26.400
some of them come with
networking opportunities,

00:16:26.441 --> 00:16:28.720
and that's good
visibility. But mostly

00:16:28.761 --> 00:16:31.160
you really want to stay
focused on finding the time.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.600
And as you develop
those applications,

00:16:34.601 --> 00:16:39.280
think a little bit about your timing
which is that it’s not--

00:16:39.281 --> 00:16:41.960
it is often the case that

00:16:41.961 --> 00:16:44.240
fellowships and
grants that kick in

00:16:44.241 --> 00:16:47.160
and give you more
time kind of midpoint,

00:16:47.281 --> 00:16:52.320
three--year three, four, five,
can be really, really valuable.

00:16:52.321 --> 00:16:56.120
It’s also the case
that what happens is,

00:16:56.121 --> 00:16:59.040
is sometimes the
time later actually

00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:02.720
is directly related to
really high impact work

00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:05.320
that’s going to affect, sort of,
your career going forward.

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:11.960
If you’re people with a
one-semester junior leave,

00:17:11.961 --> 00:17:14.200
think too about
the timing for that

00:17:14.201 --> 00:17:16.600
because it can be
tempting to use it early on

00:17:16.601 --> 00:17:17.840
but it’s also the case that,

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.360
talk with several folks,
and myself included,

00:17:20.361 --> 00:17:22.880
who are really happy
to have held on to that

00:17:23.161 --> 00:17:24.120
until a little later

00:17:24.121 --> 00:17:27.400
when it really does serve the
value of protecting your time.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.360
So it’s not to say the next couple
of years aren’t important ones

00:17:30.361 --> 00:17:32.680
because they are and you do
need to protect your time and

00:17:32.681 --> 00:17:33.680
get your things done.

00:17:33.681 --> 00:17:37.480
But think through not
exhausting all your, sort of,

00:17:37.481 --> 00:17:40.480
bio and fellowship
opportunities early on.

00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:43.040
Think about sort of pacing
yourselves in that sense.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:47.360
And finally, I’ll just
say one last thing

00:17:47.361 --> 00:17:50.640
which is the topic
for today is really

00:17:50.641 --> 00:17:52.520
this professional identity piece.

00:17:52.481 --> 00:17:55.280
And I think I’ll really
say two things here.

00:17:55.281 --> 00:17:58.800
One is that you’re always constructing
your professional identity.

00:17:58.801 --> 00:18:02.440
You’re always sort of casting yourself
in some kind of light here at Harvard

00:18:02.441 --> 00:18:07.720
but also equally as importantly and I
think sometimes that’s easy to forget,

00:18:07.721 --> 00:18:08.640
that you’re casting--

00:18:08.641 --> 00:18:10.920
you are creating a
professional identity

00:18:10.921 --> 00:18:13.400
outside of the
institution regularly -

00:18:13.481 --> 00:18:18.640
in print and informally and
formally in conversation.

00:18:18.641 --> 00:18:22.800
And so you want to be seen
as somebody who’s collegial,

00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:26.520
who’s doing not just high
quality work but is of high integrity,

00:18:26.521 --> 00:18:28.600
and who’s a good peer

00:18:28.601 --> 00:18:32.960
across different settings and in and
outside the institution.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.080
The concrete
suggestions, I mean, to be

00:18:36.081 --> 00:18:39.920
establish a positive personal
and professional identity,

00:18:39.921 --> 00:18:42.040
there are a few things.

00:18:42.081 --> 00:18:43.800
One is you need the
supports to do that.

00:18:43.801 --> 00:18:45.960
You need supports
professionally and personally.

00:18:45.961 --> 00:18:48.080
You need supports
inside of the institution

00:18:48.081 --> 00:18:50.280
but you also need supports
outside of the institution.

00:18:50.441 --> 00:18:53.680
So that in fact one of the
things I’d really recommend

00:18:53.681 --> 00:18:56.400
is talking with others
at other institutions

00:18:56.481 --> 00:18:59.560
about professional life
and kinds of issues

00:18:59.561 --> 00:19:02.480
because it can really bring
a lot more perspective

00:19:02.481 --> 00:19:05.320
to the way that you interpret
things that are happening here.

00:19:05.441 --> 00:19:07.520
It can also give you
some really good ideas

00:19:07.521 --> 00:19:09.640
about managing your
professional life.

00:19:09.721 --> 00:19:12.200
So other juniors here
on campus but also

00:19:12.201 --> 00:19:15.280
folks outside and at
other institutions.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.640
And finally on mentoring
because this came up,

00:19:18.641 --> 00:19:21.640
sort of, as one possible
topic for today:

00:19:21.681 --> 00:19:26.120
I think mentoring is a tricky
thing and I’ll say that right flat-out.

00:19:26.121 --> 00:19:30.040
I think it’s a human enterprise.
It’s one of relationships.

00:19:30.041 --> 00:19:33.000
I think you can’t always
force relationships

00:19:33.041 --> 00:19:35.960
as we know in our professional
and personal lives.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.520
So mostly I think of it this way:

00:19:38.521 --> 00:19:41.600
You have to be comfortable.
It has to be natural.

00:19:41.641 --> 00:19:43.720
It has to be something
that evolves over time.

00:19:43.721 --> 00:19:45.920
both the mentoring that you get

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.840
and your own mentoring
of others, right,

00:19:48.841 --> 00:19:52.040
because already you’re going
to start to mentor folks here.

00:19:52.081 --> 00:19:57.560
So I would say, you know, stay
with your plan, let it happen naturally.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:01.280
As things progress, there’s going to
be people that you gravitate towards,

00:20:01.281 --> 00:20:02.480
there’s going to be
people that you realize

00:20:02.481 --> 00:20:05.920
where it’s really quality,
not quantity,

00:20:06.001 --> 00:20:08.440
so you don’t need a lot of
contact with good mentors.

00:20:08.441 --> 00:20:11.560
Some of the best mentorship
I’ve had is actually from someone

00:20:11.561 --> 00:20:15.800
outside of the institution who’s a member
of the senior faculty elsewhere,

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.600
who I see very sporadically.

00:20:17.601 --> 00:20:20.600
But, you know, 20, 30 minutes,
a drink at a conference,

00:20:20.601 --> 00:20:24.360
a beer, can be really clarifying
and really helpful.

00:20:24.401 --> 00:20:27.600
That’s sort of nothing formal
about that relationship,

00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:30.360
nothing particularly
ongoing or frequent.

00:20:30.401 --> 00:20:33.840
But when it happens, those
conversations are really helpful.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.840
So I would really suggest

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:40.400
thinking about quality
and not quantity

00:20:40.401 --> 00:20:42.640
and sort of seeing what emerges.

00:20:42.601 --> 00:20:46.280
And you'll have a better sense
as time goes on of the kind of feedback

00:20:46.281 --> 00:20:48.720
that you really need
and how to get that.

00:20:48.921 --> 00:20:50.920
But it takes time.

00:20:50.921 --> 00:20:53.960
I think good mentoring relationships
do take time to develop.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:55.840
I’m going to stop there.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:07.760
So, good morning.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.680
It's truly an honor and a
privilege to be here.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.840
It's also quite humbling especially
to our members of the panel.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.080
I'd like to take a different path.

00:21:16.081 --> 00:21:18.720
[Laughter]

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.360
So, you know I'm going to start
with a very wise statement

00:21:21.361 --> 00:21:23.520
from the mother of Forrest Gump

00:21:23.681 --> 00:21:26.800
in that Oscar-winning movie
which is "Life is a box of chocolates.

00:21:26.841 --> 00:21:29.000
You never know what
you're going to get."

00:21:29.001 --> 00:21:30.600
That summarizes my life today

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.440
So, I'm going--I believe
that each faculty member,

00:21:36.441 --> 00:21:40.280
every one of you has a
unique set of life experiences

00:21:40.521 --> 00:21:43.400
that ultimately will,
if it hasn't already,

00:21:43.401 --> 00:21:46.560
profoundly influence
your academic career.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:51.280
I'll have to tell you a little bit
about my life and then some more.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.560
I was born in 1964 in
Barranquilla, Colombia.

00:21:55.121 --> 00:21:57.560
That's a town on the Caribbean coast

00:21:57.561 --> 00:22:01.560
of Colombia which is in Northwest-
most far of South America.

00:22:01.601 --> 00:22:06.400
People born in the Caribbean,
which is the general region of the sea,

00:22:06.401 --> 00:22:10.960
constitute one-third of the population
of Colombia which is about 40 million.

00:22:11.001 --> 00:22:18.240
The last president to be born in the
Caribbean to be elected was in 1886.

00:22:18.321 --> 00:22:22.520
We have over 122 years without
having a Caribbean president.

00:22:22.521 --> 00:22:27.520
We are quite different.
Our culture, our accent is different.

00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:30.400
The media, uh, often
reminds us of that.

00:22:30.401 --> 00:22:32.880
We're stereotyped on a daily basis.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.040
I was going to come
to the U.S. for college.

00:22:39.041 --> 00:22:40.120
Those were my plans.

00:22:40.121 --> 00:22:44.960
And when I was 15 my sister,

00:22:45.001 --> 00:22:50.080
who was an economist at Harvard
, died in a car accident.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.400
That was the first profound
event that influenced my life.

00:22:53.401 --> 00:22:56.760
I have to change my plans.
I was the youngest of five siblings.

00:22:56.761 --> 00:22:59.480
And instead of coming
here to the U.S.,

00:22:59.481 --> 00:23:04.520
I had to go to the heart of
the Andes in Bogota, Colombia.

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.240
This is the second oldest
university in the Americas.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:12.040
Yes, it is older than
Harvard University.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.840
[Laughter]

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.160
It's a different school.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:20.921
My class had 84 people; there were
only four people from the Caribbean.

00:23:20.961 --> 00:23:24.440
There were times when a
professor would make a joke

00:23:24.521 --> 00:23:26.840
which wasn't at all funny to us,

00:23:26.881 --> 00:23:31.240
and my friends and I had to
bide our time and walk away.

00:23:31.241 --> 00:23:33.600
We used that as motivation.

00:23:33.601 --> 00:23:36.520
You always have to channel
your anger for positive things.

00:23:36.521 --> 00:23:40.400
Of the four, three
graduated top of the class.

00:23:40.401 --> 00:23:42.120
Two of us are in the States.

00:23:42.161 --> 00:23:44.760
One of them is a world
authority in Straub.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.400
So I decided that I wanted to
come to this country to do research.

00:23:49.401 --> 00:23:52.920
And I sent 400
letters of application.

00:23:52.961 --> 00:23:57.120
I applied to every program
in the United States

00:23:57.121 --> 00:23:59.680
and territories including
one in Puerto Rico.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.760
After sending 400 letters,
I got seven interviews.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.080
One of these interviews
was at Lincoln Hospital

00:24:08.081 --> 00:24:09.880
which is in the South Bronx -

00:24:10.161 --> 00:24:12.920
that's the poorest congressional
district in this nation.

00:24:12.921 --> 00:24:16.080
I took a taxi from Manhattan
there, and there

00:24:16.081 --> 00:24:19.080
was this Dominican man
who was a philosopher.

00:24:19.121 --> 00:24:22.240
He looked at me--had a tie,
had an overcoat--and he said,

00:24:22.241 --> 00:24:25.360
"You look like a nice boy.
Why are you going to the Bronx?"

00:24:25.561 --> 00:24:28.360
And I said, "You know
, I'm a foreigner.

00:24:28.361 --> 00:24:31.120
There's a lot of very few places
who'd give me an interview.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.200
He paused, looked at
me again and said,

00:24:34.201 --> 00:24:37.680
"The whites are sending
you there to die".

00:24:37.681 --> 00:24:45.760
[Laughter]

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.120
Although I did survive.

00:24:48.121 --> 00:24:55.560
I saw firsthand the effects of
segregation, profound segregation.

00:24:55.561 --> 00:24:58.800
Americans often act horrified
about violence elsewhere

00:24:58.801 --> 00:25:03.360
but they don't look at places like
the Bronx, Harlem, the inner city.

00:25:03.401 --> 00:25:05.400
Look in your own house.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.160
I served an internship there

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.640
and then I went on to the
residency at Beth Israel New York.

00:25:14.721 --> 00:25:17.840
And then I always tell my mentees

00:25:17.841 --> 00:25:21.520
that you cannot control who your
parents are - that's a random event,

00:25:21.561 --> 00:25:23.640
one that is either blessed or not.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.480
But you can control who you
spend the rest of your life with.

00:25:27.481 --> 00:25:30.240
So the best decision of
my life was to marry my wife.

00:25:30.241 --> 00:25:31.241
[Laughter]

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.880
I say that without hesitation.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:40.760
Then in 1995, I wanted to the state
and I had a visa called a J-1,

00:25:40.761 --> 00:25:44.160
which is the worst visa you can have.
You're better off being an illegal alien.

00:25:44.161 --> 00:25:47.080
[Laughter]

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:51.080
So I mailed again 400
letters of application.

00:25:51.081 --> 00:25:57.320
I looked into every government
agency and I got one interview

00:25:57.321 --> 00:26:01.480
which was at the Veterans Administration
Hospital in Newark, Pennsylvania

00:26:01.481 --> 00:26:03.200
that's close to Toronto, Canada.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.720
It's in the lakes. And I
served two years

00:26:07.721 --> 00:26:11.080
for the government there as
an internist of pulmonologist,

00:26:11.121 --> 00:26:14.760
and then they granted me
permanent residency in this country,

00:26:14.761 --> 00:26:17.400
which is when I applied
to come to Harvard.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.000
When I came here
as a research fellow,

00:26:22.001 --> 00:26:27.360
I took a pay cut of 67%
before adjusting for cost of living.

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.800
My conservative estimation
was the pay cut was 80%

00:26:30.801 --> 00:26:31.760
after you adjust for that.

00:26:31.921 --> 00:26:33.760
My first child had been born.

00:26:33.761 --> 00:26:37.160
I moonlighted 16 weekends in a row

00:26:37.161 --> 00:26:40.760
to have the down payment for my
home which is still in Framingham,

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.840
far away from my place of work.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:49.920
In 1999, I was about to
submit an application

00:26:49.921 --> 00:26:52.840
for an entry level
grant to the NIH.

00:26:53.281 --> 00:26:55.440
That was August.

00:26:55.441 --> 00:26:58.720
I was taking a plane
to go to Costa Rica

00:26:58.721 --> 00:27:02.320
where two of my research
projects are when my wife called.

00:27:02.361 --> 00:27:04.720
And I said to my mentor, one
of my mentors who was with me,

00:27:04.721 --> 00:27:06.880
I said to him "Did somebody die?

00:27:07.121 --> 00:27:09.200
My wife would never call me
unless somebody died."

00:27:09.201 --> 00:27:13.360
I thought of my second child who had
been born two weeks earlier than that.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:18.160
But in fact my only brother had been
murdered by a psychopath

00:27:18.161 --> 00:27:20.400
in a mass murder suicide,

00:27:20.401 --> 00:27:24.320
a copycat of some of the events
in Atlanta and Seattle.

00:27:24.321 --> 00:27:27.880
He killed three or four people and then
the guy blew his head.

00:27:27.881 --> 00:27:34.560
And suddenly I had to deviate, go to
Colombia, and have two nephews,

00:27:34.561 --> 00:27:37.080
11 and 8, come and embrace me

00:27:37.081 --> 00:27:39.720
and realized that I was the
last male survivor of my family

00:27:39.761 --> 00:27:41.960
since I had lost my
father seven years earlier.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.000
I did submit my grant in any event.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.800
And the grant did not get
funded but I resubmitted the grant,

00:27:49.801 --> 00:27:53.400
and it was funded in 2001
when I also got my Doctorate

00:27:53.401 --> 00:27:54.720
from the School of Public Health.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.200
Subsequent to that, I
became an Assistant Professor.

00:27:59.201 --> 00:28:03.280
I got two large grants
funded from NIH.

00:28:03.281 --> 00:28:06.760
I was blessed getting
a mentoring award,

00:28:06.761 --> 00:28:08.200
a teaching award
from medical school,

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.600
and I became an associate
professor in April of 2007.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.040
So I'll give you my few
pieces of advice.

00:28:20.041 --> 00:28:23.120
Santiago Ramon y
Cajal was a Spaniard

00:28:23.121 --> 00:28:25.320
who won the Nobel Prize--
it was a Neural Science.

00:28:25.361 --> 00:28:29.080
He summarized this -
I modified the slide a bit.

00:28:29.081 --> 00:28:30.760
The first one is you have to have the capacity

00:28:30.761 --> 00:28:32.560
to criticize the work of others,

00:28:32.601 --> 00:28:34.160
but particularly your own.

00:28:34.201 --> 00:28:36.440
The best advice
that I ever got was

00:28:36.441 --> 00:28:40.480
"Never believe any data,
particularly your own."

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.040
Desire for originality -

00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:48.000
you have to find noble
things as a function of academia.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.320
Focus - that saved me.

00:28:51.321 --> 00:28:52.720
You have very limited time.

00:28:52.721 --> 00:28:54.720
You have to attend
to many different things.

00:28:54.761 --> 00:28:57.040
You have to focus.

00:28:57.041 --> 00:29:01.120
Honesty above all things even when temptations abound,

00:29:01.121 --> 00:29:02.640
you have to love the truth.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:09.560
Outstanding work habits.
Passion - you have to love what you do.

00:29:09.561 --> 00:29:12.720
There'll be no doubt of that.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.160
Spirit of service above all things.

00:29:15.201 --> 00:29:19.880
The should of a physician
above all will serve others.

00:29:19.921 --> 00:29:23.840
And perseverance,
the most important quality.

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.520
There are so many things
that I see for new faculty.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.720
There are great opportunities.

00:29:31.721 --> 00:29:36.680
There are outstanding educational
and training opportunities.

00:29:36.681 --> 00:29:38.400
I took advantage
of several of those.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.480
And that allows you to develop
a unique set of skills.

00:29:42.481 --> 00:29:44.680
You have to set yourself apart.

00:29:44.681 --> 00:29:48.880
At my place, most people go
for a Master's degree.

00:29:48.881 --> 00:29:50.680
Nobody had done a doctorate.

00:29:50.681 --> 00:29:52.520
But at the time I was doing that,

00:29:52.521 --> 00:29:54.960
with two children and doing
all this moonlighting,

00:29:55.041 --> 00:29:57.560
I realized that genetics was the
wave of the future.

00:29:57.561 --> 00:30:01.280
And the only way I could get additional
training was by doing a Doctorate.

00:30:01.281 --> 00:30:04.640
Many people thought I was crazy
and I am crazy. But I did it

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:10.160
Then you also have
outstanding trainees.

00:30:10.161 --> 00:30:14.240
Many people think these people
sort of as disposable,

00:30:14.241 --> 00:30:16.480
or people who can be recycled.

00:30:16.561 --> 00:30:19.520
I view them very differently.
They are the life blood of my program.

00:30:19.521 --> 00:30:21.960
If you treat your people well,

00:30:21.961 --> 00:30:24.160
many of these people are extraordinary bright;

00:30:24.201 --> 00:30:27.160
word of mouth will
bring more people to you.

00:30:27.161 --> 00:30:29.800
And they come to you and
they want to work with you

00:30:29.801 --> 00:30:32.080
because you provide a good environment
for them.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.680
Never take them lightly.

00:30:34.681 --> 00:30:39.840
You can also establish unbelievable
collaborations across campus.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.120
There are also huge challenges.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.400
When somebody's recruited here
particularly at the junior level

00:30:46.401 --> 00:30:47.680
and particularly at the medical school,

00:30:47.721 --> 00:30:52.200
the high cost of living in this city
cannot be forgotten.

00:30:52.201 --> 00:30:55.920
I told you how much moonlighting
I had to do - that's a daily reality.

00:30:55.921 --> 00:31:01.680
When you have somebody work for 30 hours
and then ask them to do something,

00:31:01.681 --> 00:31:03.160
it's just quite difficult for them.

00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:05.120
It's remarkable that they
can get to do something.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.360
The quality of mentorship
varies enormously.

00:31:09.361 --> 00:31:12.680
I'm talking about the
medical school again -

00:31:12.681 --> 00:31:15.880
varies across institutions,
varies across departments;

00:31:15.961 --> 00:31:17.960
it's highly variable
across divisions.

00:31:17.961 --> 00:31:20.680
There are some people who
are outstanding mentors,

00:31:20.681 --> 00:31:25.800
almost saints in their own way, but
there are also tormentors and dementors.

00:31:25.801 --> 00:31:27.680
[Laughter]

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:36.480
As a minority, I have to say this.
I have said this openly.

00:31:36.481 --> 00:31:40.440
There is a profound dearth of
under-represented minorities

00:31:40.441 --> 00:31:42.120
in senior leadership positions.

00:31:42.161 --> 00:31:45.440
It's appalling. It's depressing.

00:31:45.441 --> 00:31:49.880
There are no division chiefs or
department chiefs in my own institution.

00:31:49.881 --> 00:31:54.080
That has several negative effects.
It affects morale.

00:31:54.081 --> 00:31:56.240
The number of Hispanic colleagues

00:31:56.241 --> 00:31:59.600
that I've seen leaving in the last
ten years is extraordinary.

00:31:59.681 --> 00:32:05.040
They leave because they see no clear
path to a leadership position.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.120
It affects advocacy
and fundraising.

00:32:09.121 --> 00:32:11.800
It's very hard for me, you know,

00:32:11.801 --> 00:32:15.080
the people that I research on are
disproportionately

00:32:15.081 --> 00:32:16.360
represented among the poor.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.200
I don't have that constituency
that is rich.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.880
If I don't have
people at the top,

00:32:22.881 --> 00:32:26.520
I'm working for that who are truly and
generally and passionately interested.

00:32:26.561 --> 00:32:29.440
And it's not lip service -
that is a problem.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.840
Finally, there is conflict.

00:32:31.841 --> 00:32:34.000
Unfortunately, at the current time,

00:32:34.001 --> 00:32:35.000
most of the panels

00:32:35.001 --> 00:32:36.001
that would solve these conflicts
do not include minorities.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.280
And I can tell you that
I can attest to this,

00:32:42.281 --> 00:32:45.080
that there are instances
where I really had wished

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.760
that there was somebody
from the minority who was involved.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.400
The ultimate goal
of all these things,

00:32:52.401 --> 00:32:56.120
and this was very well articulated
by the previous speaker, is to establish

00:32:56.201 --> 00:33:00.880
an independent investigative
who you are, where you live.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.160
Finally, this is a highly
competitive environment.

00:33:05.161 --> 00:33:11.880
To say that any of you can do
this alone is delusional.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.680
We're all grains of sand.

00:33:14.681 --> 00:33:18.720
You have to find sources
of inspirational support.

00:33:18.721 --> 00:33:22.680
To me, that's been my parents
who gave me two precious gifts.

00:33:22.681 --> 00:33:26.480
One was my faith.
Faith takes you over everything.

00:33:26.481 --> 00:33:31.280
And the second one is the spirit of
service, again the desire to serve.

00:33:31.281 --> 00:33:33.720
The second is my wife.
In Latin America,

00:33:33.721 --> 00:33:36.680
people are told to pray
to the guardian angel.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.880
I did better than that.
I married mine.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:45.240
Third, you need mentors. You need
mentors within your institution,

00:33:45.241 --> 00:33:50.240
but mentors outside the
institution as previously mentioned,

00:33:50.241 --> 00:33:52.600
are unbelievably helpful.

00:33:52.641 --> 00:33:55.240
And I have three people,
senior people,

00:33:55.241 --> 00:33:58.520
who took an interest in my career
early on and whose advice I treasure.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.080
Finally, in my own circumstances,

00:34:02.081 --> 00:34:05.800
thousands of people have died in my
country as a byproduct of violence.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:08.880
There were many times
when I was in the Bronx,

00:34:08.881 --> 00:34:13.480
in New York, here where my will falter
and my spirit are weakened.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.560
Somehow I could see they're
angels urging me to go on.

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.920
I'm very fortunate
to lead a program

00:34:22.921 --> 00:34:24.240
trying to

00:34:24.241 --> 00:34:28.400
help elucidate causes of
respiratory diseases in Hispanics.

00:34:28.441 --> 00:34:29.960
I think this is a privilege--

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.640
the final thing is
when I have a mentee,

00:34:33.681 --> 00:34:36.240
and this is very important
in an environment like this,

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.560
many people thirst
for power and glory.

00:34:39.601 --> 00:34:42.440
And they get lost.
That's all they care about.

00:34:42.441 --> 00:34:46.840
I've seen this many times.
What for?

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.600
In Roman times when a general
came from a Turkish campaign,

00:34:51.601 --> 00:34:55.280
there were two
slaves in his chariot;

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.400
one to hold his laurels

00:34:58.401 --> 00:35:01.320
and the other one to whisper
that all glories are for him.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.160
Never forget that.

00:35:03.161 --> 00:35:09.040
So, my own belief - everybody has to
define what success is.

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:15.120
People are at their best when they are
able to see beyond themselves.

00:35:15.121 --> 00:35:19.080
Jackie Robinson was the first African American
to play in the major leagues

00:35:19.081 --> 00:35:20.680
said once that
"Life has no meaning

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.720
except for the impact that it
has on the lives of others."

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.800
I believe in that.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.960
So everyone we know who has
his own definition of success,

00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:31.240
to me you have to advance.

00:35:31.281 --> 00:35:35.480
You have to be promoted.
You have to aspire to leadership.

00:35:35.481 --> 00:35:39.280
But that is to help
others and to serve.

00:35:39.281 --> 00:35:45.360
That is not for
something or a reason.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.600
So to me, success is

00:35:48.601 --> 00:35:51.080
honoring the memory
of those peoples

00:35:51.081 --> 00:35:54.600
whom I lost by serving
those who remain.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.120
Motivating others,
the young people

00:35:58.121 --> 00:36:03.040
who will be here long after
we all leave, to serve others.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.120
Trying to be a positive influence

00:36:06.121 --> 00:36:09.800
and most of all supporting
along with my family.

00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:10.880
Thank you very much.

00:36:10.001 --> 00:36:17.160
[Applause]

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.160
Okay. What time is it?

00:36:22.161 --> 00:36:27.480
Well, I'll speak briefly about

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.920
some thoughts that reinforce some of the
things that have been said already

00:36:31.961 --> 00:36:33.840
and focus on some other issues.

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:38.480
Just...how many of you
know what your job is?

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.240
Do you feel like you know?

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:45.880
And it's not really a rhetorical
question. What ran through your mind?

00:36:45.881 --> 00:36:48.400
Because when I arrived I said

00:36:48.401 --> 00:36:52.040
"Where's the faculty handbook?"
And there wasn't one at that time.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.720
And I think there is one now.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:37:00.920
And there was one little workshop
which focused on teaching mostly

00:37:00.921 --> 00:37:03.640
and tried to explain what
Harvard undergrads were like.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:10.360
And I was one, so it really was
not a very good job orientation.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:16.320
And so the practical matter
is that you're a researcher,

00:37:16.321 --> 00:37:19.360
a teacher, a manager of money,

00:37:19.361 --> 00:37:22.280
of people, a psychologist
of those people.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:25.080
You have the service component

00:37:25.081 --> 00:37:29.520
which contributes to the governance
of this incredibly complex organization,

00:37:29.561 --> 00:37:33.360
and you've got one little cog
that you're helping turn

00:37:33.361 --> 00:37:34.840
in your department
at the beginning.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:38.040
And it's an impossible job
description and you've been trained

00:37:38.041 --> 00:37:41.600
in maybe the one researcher
aspect of it.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.000
And so you've quickly got to figure out
how to handle all these different hats.

00:37:45.001 --> 00:37:49.480
And you're not going to get
any formal education on it.

00:37:49.481 --> 00:37:52.600
You can ask for advice
from people around you,

00:37:52.601 --> 00:37:55.560
you can try and model the ones
that you think are most successful,

00:37:55.681 --> 00:37:58.680
but you yourself are going to
have to figure out how to divide

00:37:58.681 --> 00:38:00.320
your own abilities

00:38:00.361 --> 00:38:02.960
and what you're going to put some
effort into training yourself on.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.360
And I'm going to phrase it that way

00:38:06.361 --> 00:38:09.440
because the faster
you train yourself

00:38:09.441 --> 00:38:12.520
to wear these
different hats easily,

00:38:12.521 --> 00:38:15.040
the more effective
you're going to be

00:38:15.041 --> 00:38:19.120
in that you will spend less time
wasting time,

00:38:19.161 --> 00:38:21.240
mismanaging things

00:38:21.281 --> 00:38:25.000
or putting effort into places
where there's very little payoff.

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.560
And

00:38:28.561 --> 00:38:32.440
this question of how you manage
your time is huge.

00:38:32.641 --> 00:38:34.200
It's your most valuable resource.

00:38:34.201 --> 00:38:37.440
And you're going to have
to be extremely defensive

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.240
of the time that you
spend on scholarship.

00:38:40.241 --> 00:38:42.680
And everyone handles that
in a different way -

00:38:42.681 --> 00:38:45.320
they do all their work and writing
at home in the evening,

00:38:45.321 --> 00:38:48.440
which worked great for me until I had
kids and that became impossible.

00:38:48.481 --> 00:38:50.560
Some people have
on their calendars,

00:38:50.601 --> 00:38:54.560
you know, certain blocks that are
sacred - the door is closed,

00:38:54.601 --> 00:38:59.000
the phone is off, your email
program is closed, and you're working.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:04.280
And you don't let the
world distract you.

00:39:04.281 --> 00:39:07.640
Because all of your
other aspects of your job -

00:39:07.641 --> 00:39:09.160
especially teaching -

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:14.560
have shorter term deadlines that are
going to try and fill all available time

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:17.960
And the most common mistake
that I see junior faculty making,

00:39:17.961 --> 00:39:18.800
and I was guilty,

00:39:18.801 --> 00:39:22.520
is that you spend every
day in between lectures

00:39:22.521 --> 00:39:24.520
preparing for lectures
for your first course.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.920
And you prepare about
five times as much material

00:39:27.921 --> 00:39:29.640
as you can possibly
deliver in an hour.

00:39:29.681 --> 00:39:31.760
And you had wasted a day

00:39:31.761 --> 00:39:35.880
where you could have spent two hours
preparing the right amount of material

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.440
for one hour of lecture,

00:39:37.441 --> 00:39:40.040
and then the rest of your day
actually doing scholarship.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.200
And so I say this,
and some people say

00:39:45.201 --> 00:39:48.360
"You can't spend only two hours
preparing an hour lecture,"

00:39:48.401 --> 00:39:50.360
but there was actually a
study done at Princeton

00:39:50.361 --> 00:39:52.680
which I ran into in about
my second or third year

00:39:52.721 --> 00:39:57.480
where they had pooled all of the
successful mid-career faculty,

00:39:57.481 --> 00:40:00.560
extremely detailed survey on
how they spent their time.

00:40:00.561 --> 00:40:04.800
And there was a very strong correlation
between people who had limited

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.760
time spent away from research

00:40:07.761 --> 00:40:10.360
and then their eventual success,
which makes sense

00:40:10.401 --> 00:40:13.680
It's just very easy to get caught up
in short term deadlines.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:21.880
On navigating Harvard,
Harvard is a maze. It's impossible.

00:40:21.881 --> 00:40:23.720
I mean now at least there are
things like a handbook

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:26.560
that can help point you in
directions to find things.

00:40:26.601 --> 00:40:28.920
But resources are available
for almost everything

00:40:28.921 --> 00:40:30.880
and the hard part is
trying to find them.

00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:33.640
And so you'll ask
your senior colleagues

00:40:33.641 --> 00:40:35.320
and department chairs
but things change,

00:40:35.321 --> 00:40:39.200
and they won't know what's
available to you now today.

00:40:39.201 --> 00:40:43.360
And so then you start finding
administration people who are--

00:40:43.361 --> 00:40:45.160
you should get to know
who you should ask

00:40:45.161 --> 00:40:48.160
what things are out there
and I'll just list a few.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.760
There's a lot available
for child care,

00:40:51.761 --> 00:40:55.280
for travel; Parents in a Pinch
I used today with my sick baby.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.520
There's mortgage help.

00:40:57.521 --> 00:41:01.600
There's a publication
fund for junior faculty -

00:41:01.601 --> 00:41:07.760
$5000 to use towards publication
which I learned about this year,

00:41:07.761 --> 00:41:10.080
and none of the other people in the
department knew about.

00:41:10.081 --> 00:41:14.720
That's an FAS, yes,
so that is true.

00:41:14.721 --> 00:41:16.360
There are differences
between schools.

00:41:16.361 --> 00:41:18.320
And there's faculty aid.

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:23.440
So try and find out because these
things will make your life easier.

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:29.160
What you have at your advantage
by being here are the people.

00:41:29.161 --> 00:41:35.920
And you have an incredible quality
of colleagues, quality of students,

00:41:35.921 --> 00:41:40.400
quality of administrative
staff support that I know

00:41:40.401 --> 00:41:44.080
from talking to my colleagues at other
schools that they just simply don't have

00:41:44.121 --> 00:41:46.600
And it will save you time
if you learn how to use them.

00:41:46.601 --> 00:41:49.320
Learn how to use your
assistants effectively

00:41:49.321 --> 00:41:55.440
in management of your program
and in preparation for lectures.

00:41:55.481 --> 00:41:59.160
And the more you can do that, the more
you will save time for your scholarship.

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.400
In terms of--

00:42:04.401 --> 00:42:05.920
there's this question
about mentorships

00:42:05.921 --> 00:42:07.280
and I agree. I go back and forth.

00:42:07.281 --> 00:42:08.760
You're going to get
assigned a mentor

00:42:08.761 --> 00:42:12.800
by someone at some time, or offered a
mentor or offered to be a mentor.

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:16.720
And you have to think about what you
want to get out of that relationship.

00:42:16.721 --> 00:42:18.680
And you can get very good things

00:42:18.681 --> 00:42:21.280
and at times it's so
artificial that it's not useful.

00:42:21.281 --> 00:42:24.680
So what you want to do is keep your
eye out for the accidental mentor.

00:42:24.681 --> 00:42:28.560
And then once you've found that
person, nurture that relationship.

00:42:28.561 --> 00:42:32.000
But it won't come through one
of these arbitrarily assigned things.

00:42:32.001 --> 00:42:34.440
And ideally it would be
someone who's not in your--

00:42:34.441 --> 00:42:36.800
I go back and forth on
"in your department."

00:42:36.801 --> 00:42:39.480
It would be great to also have
someone outside of your department

00:42:39.481 --> 00:42:40.200
that you can talk to

00:42:40.201 --> 00:42:43.160
because at some point

00:42:43.161 --> 00:42:47.400
you will need help, and you will want
to admit to somebody that you need help.

00:42:47.401 --> 00:42:51.080
And you're going to need that other
person out there to help you refocus.

00:42:51.081 --> 00:42:56.640
And if you don't have that
person you'll spend a lot of time

00:42:56.641 --> 00:42:59.720
being lost before
you can get back on track.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.240
And I say that there's an
accidental mentor out there

00:43:04.241 --> 00:43:05.241
because in your research,

00:43:05.361 --> 00:43:09.200
in additional to
staying straight arrow

00:43:09.201 --> 00:43:12.480
in what you're doing so that you
will actually accomplish something,

00:43:12.561 --> 00:43:14.920
you want to keep yourself open -

00:43:14.921 --> 00:43:19.160
through accidental conversations in
the department, at conferences -

00:43:19.161 --> 00:43:25.000
for those seeds of new projects that
you could only do because you're here.

00:43:25.001 --> 00:43:27.200
And you do that
by talking to people.

00:43:27.201 --> 00:43:29.560
You ask people what they're doing;

00:43:29.561 --> 00:43:31.880
you have something that's on your
mind now that you tell them about.

00:43:31.881 --> 00:43:35.560
And every once in awhile it leads to a
click and you've got a whole new project

00:43:35.561 --> 00:43:38.240
in a new direction that you wouldn't
have gotten if you weren't at Harvard.

00:43:38.241 --> 00:43:41.360
And so keep yourself
receptive to that

00:43:41.361 --> 00:43:43.640
in addition to having
your focus program.

00:43:43.641 --> 00:43:45.680
But you're going to
have to make a decision

00:43:45.681 --> 00:43:47.240
and it needs to be
a conscious decision -

00:43:47.281 --> 00:43:50.080
are you changing your research
program to take advantage of it,

00:43:50.081 --> 00:43:54.360
or are you staying on track and saving
it for later or keeping it limited?

00:43:54.361 --> 00:43:58.320
But those kinds of decisions that
you make in these first few years

00:43:58.321 --> 00:44:00.440
need to be conscious and not--

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:05.120
What I'm trying to say is that
you don't let your career

00:44:05.121 --> 00:44:06.440
be a little bit of a random walk

00:44:06.721 --> 00:44:08.840
in these early stages.

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.520
My advice on

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.760
this getting to your
associate promotion

00:44:17.761 --> 00:44:20.160
is generally not to think about it

00:44:20.161 --> 00:44:24.520
in that thinking about tenure,
thinking about promotions

00:44:24.521 --> 00:44:28.440
is not in itself a good
use of your energy

00:44:28.441 --> 00:44:31.360
unless you're reviewing your focus

00:44:31.361 --> 00:44:34.240
which is going to help the
promotion process but not--

00:44:34.241 --> 00:44:36.960
don't do it because of a review.

00:44:36.961 --> 00:44:39.400
You're doing it because you're
keeping yourself focused.

00:44:39.401 --> 00:44:46.600
And the main reason why you
don't want to think about it

00:44:46.601 --> 00:44:48.160
is because the criteria is
something ridiculous.

00:44:48.201 --> 00:44:50.000
You need to be great.

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:55.480
My parents ask me
"What's involved in being promoted?"

00:44:55.481 --> 00:44:57.680
I have to be great in something.

00:44:57.681 --> 00:45:01.680
And that's an impossible
definition to work toward,

00:45:01.681 --> 00:45:05.880
and it goes to Juan's very
good point on why are you here.

00:45:05.881 --> 00:45:07.920
And it's not because you
want to get promoted,

00:45:07.921 --> 00:45:10.400
because it's an
impossible standard.

00:45:10.481 --> 00:45:14.080
There's no concrete definition
to measure yourself against.

00:45:14.081 --> 00:45:16.440
And so you're doing something
because of your passion

00:45:16.441 --> 00:45:20.320
for your research and your
other personal reasons.

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.560
And so,

00:45:23.561 --> 00:45:29.400
on being great means knowing
really what your contribution is,

00:45:29.401 --> 00:45:31.160
what your main questions are,

00:45:31.161 --> 00:45:35.000
and you're trying to develop
relationships internally

00:45:35.001 --> 00:45:37.000
so that people in the department
know why you're great.

00:45:37.001 --> 00:45:40.520
Because everyone's
in a different field

00:45:40.521 --> 00:45:41.800
they're not necessarily
going to appreciate

00:45:41.801 --> 00:45:44.720
what's so great about what you're
doing, and it's okay to tell them.

00:45:44.761 --> 00:45:49.200
And then nurturing your
relationships outside of Harvard,

00:45:49.201 --> 00:45:52.960
which will be the most important
when you come up for a review

00:45:52.961 --> 00:45:54.840
so that they know why you're great

00:45:54.841 --> 00:45:58.640
and that you have a good established
presence outside of Harvard,

00:45:58.641 --> 00:46:02.400
which means you have to balanc
e your time away from here

00:46:02.401 --> 00:46:04.000
at meetings as well as here.

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:11.600
And in regards to
thinking about money,

00:46:11.601 --> 00:46:16.280
raising money, recognition, trying to
get appointments on important panels,

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:21.680
committees those things follow good
research and having good relationships.

00:46:21.681 --> 00:46:23.960
And you don't seek
them out directly.

00:46:23.961 --> 00:46:27.160
You focus on your program and
being known for something.

00:46:27.161 --> 00:46:29.680
You focus on having good,
strong, professional relationships,

00:46:29.681 --> 00:46:32.000
and then things will
follow directly from that.

00:46:32.001 --> 00:46:33.001
The money follows the good work.

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:38.480
I'll say I had two kids
on tenure track;

00:46:38.481 --> 00:46:41.440
three-and-a-half years
old and a half-year-old.

00:46:41.441 --> 00:46:43.000
It's possible.

00:46:43.001 --> 00:46:47.000
My time management skills

00:46:47.001 --> 00:46:48.960
went through the roof
once I had kids.

00:46:48.961 --> 00:46:51.080
Before that it was a
waste of time everywhere,

00:46:51.081 --> 00:46:53.680
and after that I
really got focused.

00:46:53.681 --> 00:46:57.120
So that's one strategy but
maybe not the best strategy

00:46:57.121 --> 00:46:58.720
for learning how to manage your time.

00:46:58.721 --> 00:47:00.280
And I'll end there.
