Operating systems play a really
important role in computer systems.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.880
In fact, when we talk about computers,
we often say the operating system

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.970
running on a certain kind of computer,
a Windows machine, or an iOS device.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.870
We're going to see that operating
systems play an extremely important and

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.780
critical role when it
comes to protecting and

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.950
securing resources that we
have in our computer systems.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.900
So let's look at what
a computer system is actually.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.028
So we actually start with the hardware.

00:00:34.028 --> 00:00:39.510
Your hardware consists of a CPU,
perhaps you have memory,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.990
and other IO devices, so
that's the hardware that we have.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.440
Now if you wanted to use
the hardware directly,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.880
it's going to be pretty difficult.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.840
In fact no one does that.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.980
What we really do is run
a really important program,

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.760
actually operating system
is kind of a program,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.320
that handles the low level
hardware resources that we have.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.660
So your operating system
may be Windows or

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.440
Android, or
a number of these operating systems.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.020
What we generally start
with the hardware

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.150
run the operating system on
that device that we have.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:19.120
And the applications that we directly
deal with, that we run on our systems,

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:25.030
so this could be your browser, let's
say, or this could be your mail client.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.160
So these applications then actually
running on top of the operating system.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.420
One way to think about this picture
that we have for a computer system is

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.110
that hardware is where we have
the real or physical resources.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.490
We're going to run an operating
system to control access to those

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.040
hardware resources, and those resources
then are going to be made available to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.920
the various applications that we have.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.035
So, if any of the these resources
had to be protected in case

00:01:54.035 --> 00:01:56.315
we have different
applications running here.

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:59.335
The reason the operating system plays
a really important role is because

00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:02.875
the operating system gets
between these applications and

00:02:02.875 --> 00:02:04.515
how they can access the resources.
