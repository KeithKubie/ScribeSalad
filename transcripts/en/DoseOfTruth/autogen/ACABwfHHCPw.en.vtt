agreeableness and extraversion any tips
 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.859
agreeableness and extraversion any tips
on dealing with that yeah well if you're

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869
on dealing with that yeah well if you're
 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.900
on dealing with that yeah well if you're
really high in openness and you're

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910
really high in openness and you're
 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.700
really high in openness and you're
really high in neuroticism that could be

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710
really high in neuroticism that could be
 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.870
really high in neuroticism that could be
a rough combination the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
a rough combination the
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.550
a rough combination the
conscientiousness should actually help

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560
conscientiousness should actually help
 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.840
conscientiousness should actually help
with that although it might make you a

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850
with that although it might make you a
 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.020
with that although it might make you a
bit perfectionistic the problem with

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030
bit perfectionistic the problem with
 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.639
bit perfectionistic the problem with
being high in openness which is

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649
being high in openness which is
 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.709
being high in openness which is
creativity and interest in ideas and

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719
creativity and interest in ideas and
 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.990
creativity and interest in ideas and
high in neuroticism which is tendency

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000
high in neuroticism which is tendency
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.940
high in neuroticism which is tendency
towards anxiety and emotional pain is

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950
towards anxiety and emotional pain is
 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.729
towards anxiety and emotional pain is
that like open people like to break open

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739
that like open people like to break open
 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.220
that like open people like to break open
boxes conceptual boxes and see what's

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230
boxes conceptual boxes and see what's
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.889
boxes conceptual boxes and see what's
inside like Pandora's box but people are

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899
inside like Pandora's box but people are
 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.439
inside like Pandora's box but people are
high in neuroticism are are more likely

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449
high in neuroticism are are more likely
 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.680
high in neuroticism are are more likely
to respond negatively to complexity and

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690
to respond negatively to complexity and
 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.720
to respond negatively to complexity and
uncertainty and if you're an open person

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730
uncertainty and if you're an open person
 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.950
uncertainty and if you're an open person
and you're always thinking up new things

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960
and you're always thinking up new things
 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.630
and you're always thinking up new things
you you tend to saw off the branch that

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640
you you tend to saw off the branch that
 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.880
you you tend to saw off the branch that
you're sitting on on a regular basis and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890
you're sitting on on a regular basis and
 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.789
you're sitting on on a regular basis and
that can be pretty destabilizing any

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799
that can be pretty destabilizing any
 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.490
that can be pretty destabilizing any
tips on dealing with that well I would

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500
tips on dealing with that well I would
 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.950
tips on dealing with that well I would
repeat what I said earlier I think that

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960
repeat what I said earlier I think that
 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.140
repeat what I said earlier I think that
one of the things that you do if you're

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150
one of the things that you do if you're
 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.590
one of the things that you do if you're
high in anxiety is to stabilize your

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600
high in anxiety is to stabilize your
 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.440
high in anxiety is to stabilize your
sleep-wake cycles so get up at the same

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450
sleep-wake cycles so get up at the same
 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.300
sleep-wake cycles so get up at the same
time go to bed at the same time and eat

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
time go to bed at the same time and eat
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.190
time go to bed at the same time and eat
at the same time make sure that you eat

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
at the same time make sure that you eat
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.380
at the same time make sure that you eat
breakfast and a big breakfast too that's

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390
breakfast and a big breakfast too that's
 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.620
breakfast and a big breakfast too that's
heavy on fat and protein because if

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
heavy on fat and protein because if
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.380
heavy on fat and protein because if
you're hungry and then you stress

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
you're hungry and then you stress
 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.910
you're hungry and then you stress
yourself especially if you're high in

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920
yourself especially if you're high in
 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.910
yourself especially if you're high in
neuroticism you destabilize your your

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
neuroticism you destabilize your your
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.710
neuroticism you destabilize your your
insulin production system and it won't

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
insulin production system and it won't
 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.359
insulin production system and it won't
be stabilized till you go to sleep again

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369
be stabilized till you go to sleep again
 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.830
be stabilized till you go to sleep again
so I would say like two things one is

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840
so I would say like two things one is
 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.719
so I would say like two things one is
have a big breakfast and then also if

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729
have a big breakfast and then also if
 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.760
have a big breakfast and then also if
you're feeling particularly anxious try

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770
you're feeling particularly anxious try
 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.190
you're feeling particularly anxious try
eating something not carbohydrates and

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
eating something not carbohydrates and
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.800
eating something not carbohydrates and
see if that helps because you you might

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810
see if that helps because you you might
 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.950
see if that helps because you you might
be somewhat permanently dysregulated in

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960
be somewhat permanently dysregulated in
 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.280
be somewhat permanently dysregulated in
your insulin stress-related insulin

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290
your insulin stress-related insulin
 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.230
your insulin stress-related insulin
production that would be worth trying I

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240
production that would be worth trying I
 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.089
production that would be worth trying I
would also say that you should shield

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099
would also say that you should shield
 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.520
would also say that you should shield
yourself to some degree from news

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530
yourself to some degree from news
 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.130
yourself to some degree from news
sources and sources of bad

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140
sources and sources of bad
 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.370
sources and sources of bad
especially Kotak catastrophic news

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380
especially Kotak catastrophic news
 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.770
especially Kotak catastrophic news
because most of it isn't news it's the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780
because most of it isn't news it's the
 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.150
because most of it isn't news it's the
repetition of things that we already

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160
repetition of things that we already
 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.030
repetition of things that we already
know full well and there's reason to

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040
know full well and there's reason to
 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.760
know full well and there's reason to
protect yourself from an onslaught of

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770
protect yourself from an onslaught of
 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.800
protect yourself from an onslaught of
negative information especially when

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810
negative information especially when
 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.540
negative information especially when
it's not really necessary for you I mean

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550
it's not really necessary for you I mean
 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.070
it's not really necessary for you I mean
I don't think you should bury your head

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080
I don't think you should bury your head
 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.800
I don't think you should bury your head
in the sand but constant exposure to the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810
in the sand but constant exposure to the
 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.780
in the sand but constant exposure to the
catastrophes of the world especially

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790
catastrophes of the world especially
 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.220
catastrophes of the world especially
when there's nothing that you can do

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230
when there's nothing that you can do
 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.630
when there's nothing that you can do
about those catastrophes even

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640
about those catastrophes even
 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.610
about those catastrophes even
hypothetically is something that can

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620
hypothetically is something that can
 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.740
hypothetically is something that can
really destabilize people I often tell

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750
really destabilize people I often tell
 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.380
really destabilize people I often tell
people in my clinical practice which

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390
people in my clinical practice which
 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.530
people in my clinical practice which
isn't operating right now by the way to

isn't operating right now by the way to
shield themselves from news reports

shield themselves from news reports
 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.880
shield themselves from news reports

for you one of the things that people

for you one of the things that people
who are low and agreeableness can do is

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870
who are low and agreeableness can do is
 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.900
who are low and agreeableness can do is
to try to think of things they could do

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910
to try to think of things they could do
 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.190
