00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.268
All right.
So by last Friday we discovered

00:00:09.268 --> 00:00:12.137
the electron,
discovered the nucleus.

00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:16.920
And the problem then was how to
describe the structure of the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.072
atom.
They knew there was an

00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:24.094
electron, they knew there was a
nucleus, but exactly how did the

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:28.000
electron and the nucleus hang
together?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.664
And we talked about how the
scientists at that time proposed

00:00:32.664 --> 00:00:37.329
a classical model where the
interaction between the electron

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.649
and the nucleus was,
of course, the Coulomb

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.602
interaction, but where the
equations of motion were

00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:49.267
Newton's equations of motion to
describe this electron going

00:00:49.267 --> 00:00:52.587
around the nucleus,
F equals ma.

00:00:52.587 --> 00:00:57.252
And, although we didn't show
it, what we said was that if we

00:00:57.252 --> 00:01:00.414
used that force field,
the Coulomb force,

00:01:00.414 --> 00:01:05.000
coupled with Newton's equations
of motion.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.169
And, actually,
you also have to couple them

00:01:08.169 --> 00:01:10.886
with some classical
electromagnetism,

00:01:10.886 --> 00:01:14.735
which I may not have said but
which isn't important.

00:01:14.735 --> 00:01:18.962
But if you use those classical
ideas to describe how that

00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:21.905
electron goes around that
nucleus, well,

00:01:21.905 --> 00:01:26.433
you would find that in 10^-10
seconds, that electron would be

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:31.081
on top of the nucleus.
And you would no longer have

00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:35.690
what we know to be the structure
of the atom, in the sense that

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.928
you would no longer have some
volume where the diameter of

00:01:39.928 --> 00:01:43.496
that volume is on the order of
an angstrom or so.

00:01:43.496 --> 00:01:46.841
The bottom line is that these
classical ideas,

00:01:46.841 --> 00:01:50.856
classical mechanics and
classical electromagnetism just

00:01:50.856 --> 00:01:54.498
totally fail to explain the
structure of the atom.

00:01:54.498 --> 00:02:00.000
And that was the conundrum that
the scientists faced in 1911.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.187
This was quite a big problem
for the scientific community and

00:02:05.187 --> 00:02:08.040
was so for about 10,
12, 13 years.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.757
And, of course,
what fails are the classical

00:02:11.757 --> 00:02:15.129
equations of motion,
Newton's equations.

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.057
A new kind of mechanics is
going to have to be invented in

00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:24.553
order to understand how that
atom is bound or how the

00:02:24.553 --> 00:02:30.000
electron and the nucleus are
bond, how it's stable.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.207
But now, historically,
the actual clues for why the

00:02:34.207 --> 00:02:37.658
electron didn't collapse into
the nucleus.

00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:42.202
Those clues actually came from
a very different area of

00:02:42.202 --> 00:02:47.252
discussion, and that area of
discussion is this wave particle

00:02:47.252 --> 00:02:52.133
duality of light and matter.
It was certainly long believed

00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:55.836
that matter, with its
particle-like behavior,

00:02:55.836 --> 00:02:59.707
was distinct from light,
which was this kind of

00:02:59.707 --> 00:03:04.000
transmission of energy through
space.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.142
But in the late 1800s and early
1900s, there began to be made

00:03:09.142 --> 00:03:13.428
some observations that seemed to
suggest that well,

00:03:13.428 --> 00:03:17.800
you know, maybe this boundary
between matter and its

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.857
particle-like behavior and light
and its wave-like behavior,

00:03:22.857 --> 00:03:28.000
well, maybe that boundary
wasn't so rigid after all.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.076
And, in fact,
what we're going to see is that

00:03:32.076 --> 00:03:37.079
radiation or light exhibits both
wave-like behavior and

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.897
particle-like behavior.
And it depends on the kind of

00:03:41.897 --> 00:03:46.715
experiment that you do,
which one of those properties

00:03:46.715 --> 00:03:51.811
you see, and that consequently
matter also exhibits both

00:03:51.811 --> 00:03:57.000
particle-like behavior and
wave-like behavior.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.421
And, again, it depends on the
particular experiment that you

00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:05.843
do as to which one of those
properties you actually observe.

00:04:05.843 --> 00:04:10.264
What we are going to do right
now is we're actually going to

00:04:10.264 --> 00:04:14.236
set aside the discussion of the
structure of the atom,

00:04:14.236 --> 00:04:18.058
how the electron and the
nucleus are bound together,

00:04:18.058 --> 00:04:20.906
how in the world do they remain
stable?

00:04:20.906 --> 00:04:23.978
We are going to set that
discussion aside,

00:04:23.978 --> 00:04:29.000
and we are not going to pick it
up until next Monday.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.631
And the reason for it is
because in order to proceed with

00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:39.256
that discussion,
we actually have to go through

00:04:39.256 --> 00:04:45.391
this other set of observations,
this discussion about the wave

00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:50.921
particle duality of light and
matter in order to get the

00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:56.754
clues, in order for us to make
progress about what next big

00:04:56.754 --> 00:05:02.888
leap we've got to make in order
to talk about the structure of

00:05:02.888 --> 00:05:06.711
the atom.
We are going to change

00:05:06.711 --> 00:05:11.377
subjects, or it's going to look
like we're changing subjects,

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:15.655
but we're going to use the
results of our discussions in

00:05:15.655 --> 00:05:20.477
the next three days to come back
to talk about the structure of

00:05:20.477 --> 00:05:23.511
the atom.
Then the first thing we've got

00:05:23.511 --> 00:05:28.411
to talk about is we're going to
talk about light and we're going

00:05:28.411 --> 00:05:33.000
to talk about the wave-like
nature to radiation.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.750
And since that is really
probably most intuitive,

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.000
let's do that.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.333
Properties of waves.
Well, what are waves?

00:06:03.333 --> 00:06:05.934
Well, you are familiar with
that.

00:06:05.934 --> 00:06:09.756
Waves are a periodic variation
of some quantity.

00:06:09.756 --> 00:06:14.390
In the case of water waves,
we have the periodic variation

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.617
of the height of water.
At some points in space here,

00:06:18.617 --> 00:06:23.170
the height of the water is
high, at some point the height

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.317
of the water is low,
and there is some average level

00:06:27.317 --> 00:06:30.000
here.
A sound wave.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.555
Well, a sound wave is a
periodic variation of the

00:06:33.555 --> 00:06:36.444
density of air.
At some points in space,

00:06:36.444 --> 00:06:40.148
the air is very dense,
at other points in space the

00:06:40.148 --> 00:06:43.703
air is not so dense,
and then there is an average

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:46.814
level here.
Well, what we're going to do is

00:06:46.814 --> 00:06:50.666
we're going to set this average
level here to a zero.

00:06:50.666 --> 00:06:54.518
And then, consequently,
our waves are going to have a

00:06:54.518 --> 00:06:58.592
positive amplitude that is
measured from this zero level

00:06:58.592 --> 00:07:02.255
up.
That's a positive amplitude.

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:06.524
And measured from zero level
down, that's our negative

00:07:06.524 --> 00:07:09.666
amplitude.
These waves are going to have

00:07:09.666 --> 00:07:14.177
positive and negative amplitude.
That is going to be very

00:07:14.177 --> 00:07:17.158
important in how they actually
behave.

00:07:17.158 --> 00:07:21.105
Now, what we're going to do,
oh, so what is light?

00:07:21.105 --> 00:07:25.616
Well, light is a periodic
variation of an electric field.

00:07:25.616 --> 00:07:31.834
And that is what I plot here.
Electric field versus distance.

00:07:31.834 --> 00:07:35.766
And you can see,
it is varying in intensity.

00:07:35.766 --> 00:07:39.150
But what exactly is an electric
field?

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:43.356
Well, let's just think about
that for a moment.

00:07:43.356 --> 00:07:48.660
Suppose I take two parallel
plates, here is one and here is

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:54.330
another, and I am going to put a
negative potential on that top

00:07:54.330 --> 00:08:00.000
plate and a positive potential
on the bottom plate.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.873
And what is operating then
between this negatively charged

00:08:04.873 --> 00:08:09.318
plate and the positively charged
plate is the Coulomb

00:08:09.318 --> 00:08:12.909
interaction.
And the electric field then is

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:17.269
the space through which that
Coulomb force operates.

00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:22.398
So, that electric field here is
this space through which this

00:08:22.398 --> 00:08:26.331
Coulomb force is operating.
And, by convention,

00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:30.777
we are going to say that it is
operating here in this

00:08:30.777 --> 00:08:34.150
orientation.
In other words,

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:38.293
if I put a positive charge in
between these two plates,

00:08:38.293 --> 00:08:42.206
in this electric field,
this space through which the

00:08:42.206 --> 00:08:46.656
Coulomb force is operating,
well, what's going to happen is

00:08:46.656 --> 00:08:51.259
that this positive charge is
going to drift to the negatively

00:08:51.259 --> 00:08:54.328
charged plate.
But if I turn the geometry

00:08:54.328 --> 00:08:58.777
around, if I put the negatively
charged plate on the bottom

00:08:58.777 --> 00:09:04.211
using this coordinate system.
And I now put that positive

00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:08.799
charge in that electric field,
it's going to drift to the

00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:13.796
negatively charged plate again,
but it's going to move in this

00:09:13.796 --> 00:09:18.220
coordinate system down.
So, this electric field has not

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:22.562
only magnitude because you can
imagine, the larger the

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:26.248
potential difference between
these two plates,

00:09:26.248 --> 00:09:31.000
the larger the magnitude of the
electric field.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.460
But that electric field also
has direction.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.508
It is pointed in one way or the
other.

00:09:37.508 --> 00:09:41.875
And that is what represented
here on my diagram of the

00:09:41.875 --> 00:09:46.735
electric field versus distance.
You can see that right here,

00:09:46.735 --> 00:09:50.772
the electric field,
the magnitude of it starts out

00:09:50.772 --> 00:09:54.892
small, it increases,
continues to increase until we

00:09:54.892 --> 00:09:58.187
get a maximum,
and then it starts getting

00:09:58.187 --> 00:10:02.042
smaller.
It gets smaller and goes all

00:10:02.042 --> 00:10:05.251
the way to zero,
at which point then it turns

00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:09.482
around and the magnitude begins
to increase in the opposite

00:10:09.482 --> 00:10:11.962
direction.
And, again, it becomes a

00:10:11.962 --> 00:10:15.901
maximum in the opposite
direction and then turns around

00:10:15.901 --> 00:10:20.277
and goes to zero and continues.
So, it's a periodic variation

00:10:20.277 --> 00:10:24.362
here of an electric field.
And so what that means is that

00:10:24.362 --> 00:10:28.009
if we put some charge,
say, at this point in space,

00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:33.472
it will be pulled one way.
And if we put it at this point

00:10:33.472 --> 00:10:37.016
in space, it will be pulled yet
another way.

00:10:37.016 --> 00:10:41.961
And if we put it right here at
zero, it's not going anywhere.

00:10:41.961 --> 00:10:46.741
Now, what I've shown you here
is a periodic variation of an

00:10:46.741 --> 00:10:49.956
electric field.
It is also the case that

00:10:49.956 --> 00:10:54.736
whenever we have an electric
field, we also have a magnetic

00:10:54.736 --> 00:10:59.021
field that is actually
perpendicular to this electric

00:10:59.021 --> 00:11:03.456
field here.
But since that magnetic field

00:11:03.456 --> 00:11:08.538
is going to have all the same
characteristics as the electric

00:11:08.538 --> 00:11:11.926
field, from our point of
discussion here,

00:11:11.926 --> 00:11:16.669
I am not going to talk about
it, but you are going to see

00:11:16.669 --> 00:11:19.379
this a lot next semester in
8.02.

00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:23.953
So, we are just going to
characterize here the electric

00:11:23.953 --> 00:11:26.663
field.
And the way we're going to

00:11:26.663 --> 00:11:32.000
characterize it is to put a
functional form to it.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.569
I am plotting the electric
field here as a function of x.

00:11:37.569 --> 00:11:43.834
And the functional form that we
are going to use to characterize

00:11:43.834 --> 00:11:49.801
it is A times cosine (2 pi x
over lambda),

00:11:49.801 --> 00:11:55.668
a cosine function.
Now, what I want you to notice

00:11:55.668 --> 00:12:01.535
is that this field oscillates
between a positive amplitude A

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.810
This coefficient right out in
front, right here,

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:16.027
that coefficient physically is
the maximum amplitude.

00:12:16.027 --> 00:12:20.810
So, if you were to be given a
waveform that has a number out

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.945
here in front of a cosine x,
that number,

00:12:24.945 --> 00:12:29.405
immediately the physical
significance of it is that it's

00:12:29.405 --> 00:12:34.922
the maximum amplitude.
The other parameter besides the

00:12:34.922 --> 00:12:39.070
amplitude here,
the maximum amplitude that we

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:44.632
use to characterize this cosine
function, is the wavelength.

00:12:44.632 --> 00:12:50.478
The wavelength is the distance
between two successive maxima or

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:55.380
two successive minima.
And that wavelength here comes

00:12:55.380 --> 00:13:00.000
in the argument of that cosine
function.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.701
Again, if you were to be given
a form that had a number times

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:08.226
cosine times a number times x,

00:13:08.226 --> 00:13:12.771
well, that number is equal to 2
pi over lambda.

00:13:12.771 --> 00:13:15.670
And so almost by inspection,

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:19.901
you can figure out what the
wavelength is just from the

00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:22.956
functional form of that cosine
function.

00:13:22.956 --> 00:13:27.344
And because the argument is 2
pi x over lambda,

00:13:27.344 --> 00:13:30.948
well,
you can easily see that you get

00:13:30.948 --> 00:13:35.101
the maximum amplitude A here
whenever x is an integral

00:13:35.101 --> 00:13:40.074
multiple of lambda.
When x is lambda,

00:13:40.074 --> 00:13:46.176
2 lambda, 3 lambda or minus
lambda, minus 2 lambda,

00:13:46.176 --> 00:13:48.738
or zero.
Most of that,

00:13:48.738 --> 00:13:55.084
I think, you're familiar with.
But not only is light,

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:59.722
or formally,
electromagnetic radiation,

00:13:59.722 --> 00:14:07.166
simply a periodic variation of
the electric or magnetic field,

00:14:07.166 --> 00:14:14.000
but light is also a period
variation in time.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.576
That is, light propagates,
it moves.

00:14:18.576 --> 00:14:23.676
For example,
here is a cosine functional

00:14:23.676 --> 00:14:31.000
form at some snapshot in time,
t equals 0.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.735
And I put a star here on the
maximum of one of these maxima.

00:14:37.735 --> 00:14:42.415
Now, what happens is that this
wave moves.

00:14:42.415 --> 00:14:47.552
It propagates.
And the time it takes that wave

00:14:47.552 --> 00:14:53.488
to move one wavelength,
just like it did in that very

00:14:53.488 --> 00:14:58.993
short clip, --
-- the time it takes to move

00:14:58.993 --> 00:15:04.767
one wavelength so that this
maxima that was here is now

00:15:04.767 --> 00:15:11.503
there, is what we call a period.
One period is the time it takes

00:15:11.503 --> 00:15:17.918
the wave to move one wavelength.
And we can also characterize

00:15:17.918 --> 00:15:22.088
the period by the frequency of
the wave.

00:15:22.088 --> 00:15:27.540
That frequency is nu, here,
and the period is 1 over.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:31.764
And the frequency,

00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:35.686
then, is the number of cycles
per second.

00:15:35.686 --> 00:15:40.196
In other words,
if I were sitting right here at

00:15:40.196 --> 00:15:45.294
x equals 0,
and I am just watching the wave

00:15:45.294 --> 00:15:51.274
come by me, the frequency is the
number of times that a maxima

00:15:51.274 --> 00:15:57.254
passes by me per second or the
number of times a minima passes

00:15:57.254 --> 00:16:02.076
by me per second.
That is the frequency.

00:16:02.076 --> 00:16:07.646
I will make that a little bit
more obvious in just a moment.

00:16:07.646 --> 00:16:11.893
Frequency, I said,
is the number of cycles per

00:16:11.893 --> 00:16:15.103
second.
But the unit that we use to

00:16:15.103 --> 00:16:19.445
convey frequency is something
called the Hertz,

00:16:19.445 --> 00:16:22.654
Hz.
And formally it is just inverse

00:16:22.654 --> 00:16:26.147
seconds.
We drop the number of cycles,

00:16:26.147 --> 00:16:32.000
but the number of cycles in
that unit is implied.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.885
Now suppose the following.
I said that this electric field

00:16:38.885 --> 00:16:43.597
has magnitude and it also has
direction.

00:16:43.597 --> 00:16:50.000
Suppose I take an electric
field or an electromagnetic

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:57.248
radiation that has a frequency
of 1 Hz, one cycle per second.

00:16:57.248 --> 00:17:04.255
And right here at x 
equals zero, somehow I pin an

00:17:04.255 --> 00:17:10.067
electron right there.
It cannot move anywhere.

00:17:10.067 --> 00:17:14.116
It's just stuck.
What is going to happen to that

00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:19.112
electron as this radiation of
one Hertz passes by?

00:17:19.112 --> 00:17:24.367
Well, what's going to happen is
that that electron is going to

00:17:24.367 --> 00:17:29.191
be now, since it's starting at
the top, it is going to be

00:17:29.191 --> 00:17:33.240
pulled down.
And then it is going to be

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.978
pushed back up to its original
position every one second

00:17:37.978 --> 00:17:43.147
because this frequency here is
one Hertz and because

00:17:43.147 --> 00:17:48.230
this electric field has both
magnitude and it has direction.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:52.452
Now, we're going to let this
electric field go by,

00:17:52.452 --> 00:17:57.449
the electron gets pushed down
and pulled back up once every

00:17:57.449 --> 00:18:02.960
second.
Hopefully that makes the idea

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:08.696
of frequency a little bit more
real to you.

00:18:08.696 --> 00:18:15.660
Not only do we have this
periodic variation in time,

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:22.352
but we also have the wave
propagate here in space.

00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:30.000
That wave moves this way or
this way or this way.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.792
And so what we want to know is
the speed of that propagation.

00:18:37.792 --> 00:18:45.584
Now, speed is always distance
traveled over the time elapsed.

00:18:45.584 --> 00:18:53.246
And what we have already seen
is that this wave will move by

00:18:53.246 --> 00:19:00.000
one wavelength in the time
period of a period.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.005
That is, we already saw that
this wave will move here one

00:19:05.005 --> 00:19:10.368
wavelength, from here to here,
in the time period of a period

00:19:10.368 --> 00:19:14.659
or 1 over nu.
That's the time elapsed.

00:19:14.659 --> 00:19:18.860
So the speed of this
propagation, the speed with

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.703
which it's moving,
is the distance traveled,

00:19:22.703 --> 00:19:26.547
which is lambda divided by the
time elapsed,

00:19:26.547 --> 00:19:32.000
which is 1 over nu.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.614
And, therefore,
the speed of that propagation

00:19:35.614 --> 00:19:39.065
is lambda times nu.
These are the important

00:19:39.065 --> 00:19:42.186
concepts here.
We have the speed of the

00:19:42.186 --> 00:19:46.869
propagation, lambda times nu,
we characterized our wave in

00:19:46.869 --> 00:19:50.977
terms of amplitudes,
in terms of wavelengths and in

00:19:50.977 --> 00:19:54.920
terms of frequency.
Those are the quantities that

00:19:54.920 --> 00:20:01.000
are important that you really do
have to understand very well.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:08.850
Now, I think that you are all
familiar with the fact that all

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:14.869
electromagnetic radiation has a
constant speed.

00:20:14.869 --> 00:20:22.327
That is, the wavelength of
electromagnetic radiation times

00:20:22.327 --> 00:20:29.000
its frequency is always equal to
this number.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.392
It's about 3x10^8 meters per
second.

00:20:32.392 --> 00:20:36.464
And we abbreviate it c,
the speed of light.

00:20:36.464 --> 00:20:40.923
No matter what frequency you
have of radiation,

00:20:40.923 --> 00:20:46.836
the corresponding wavelength is
such that the wavelength times

00:20:46.836 --> 00:20:51.683
the frequency is this constant,
is this value of c.

00:20:51.683 --> 00:20:56.142
And, of course,
it is the different frequencies

00:20:56.142 --> 00:21:02.056
or the different wavelengths of
electromagnetic radiation that

00:21:02.056 --> 00:21:07.000
gives it its different
characters, --

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.278
-- even though it all has the
same speed of propagation.

00:21:13.278 --> 00:21:19.214
And those different kinds of
properties, so to speak,

00:21:19.214 --> 00:21:24.465
are this spectrum of
electromagnetic radiation.

00:21:24.465 --> 00:21:32.000
So electromagnetic radiation is
an infinitely wide spectrum.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:39.580
At very long wavelengths,
we have what are known as radio

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:43.912
waves.
At very short wavelengths,

00:21:43.912 --> 00:21:50.816
we have what are known as gamma
rays or cosmic rays.

00:21:50.816 --> 00:21:55.825
The long wavelengths,
the radio waves,

00:21:55.825 --> 00:22:03.000
are going to have a relatively
low frequency.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.905
The short wavelengths are going
to have a relatively high

00:22:08.905 --> 00:22:10.381
frequency.
Why?

00:22:10.381 --> 00:22:16.287
Because the product of lambda
times nu always has to be c.

00:22:16.287 --> 00:22:21.032
Well, we're not going to go

00:22:21.032 --> 00:22:26.621
very much in detail here,
except maybe to tell you the

00:22:26.621 --> 00:22:32.000
following.
See this microwave range here?

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.126
Well, molecules,
when they absorb microwave

00:22:36.126 --> 00:22:41.038
radiation, they rotate.
See the infrared radiation?

00:22:41.038 --> 00:22:46.245
When molecules absorb infrared
radiation they vibrate.

00:22:46.245 --> 00:22:49.880
See the visible and ultraviolet
range?

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.301
When molecules absorb visible
or UV radiation,

00:22:54.301 --> 00:23:00.000
they put an electron into a
higher energy state.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.603
And oftentimes,
once you do that,

00:23:02.603 --> 00:23:07.078
of course, the electron wants
to relax to a lower energy

00:23:07.078 --> 00:23:10.740
state, and so it relaxes by
emitting a photon.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:15.133
And that's how you see
fluorescence or phosphorescence.

00:23:15.133 --> 00:23:19.934
But it's usually a result of
the absorption of visible or UV

00:23:19.934 --> 00:23:23.107
radiation.
Although, it is also possible

00:23:23.107 --> 00:23:27.745
for a molecule to absorb some
X-ray radiation and see that

00:23:27.745 --> 00:23:31.000
kind of fluorescence,
too.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.617
And we will talk about it.
But a little bit later on we're

00:23:35.617 --> 00:23:40.315
going to talk about molecules
absorbing X-ray radiation and

00:23:40.315 --> 00:23:44.770
kicking out an electron.
And we are going to use that to

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:49.469
figure out how strongly bound
electrons are in atoms or how

00:23:49.469 --> 00:23:52.385
strongly bound they are in
molecules.

00:23:52.385 --> 00:23:56.192
But that is all I will say
about that right now.

00:23:56.192 --> 00:24:00.000
What you are responsible for
is, --

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.860
-- you are responsible in
knowing that microwaves have

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:09.355
longer wavelengths than gamma
rays or cosmic rays.

00:24:09.355 --> 00:24:15.133
You are responsible for knowing
the relative wavelengths here of

00:24:15.133 --> 00:24:18.251
these different kinds of
radiation.

00:24:18.251 --> 00:24:21.369
Every MIT student should know
that.

00:24:21.369 --> 00:24:26.322
Of course, there is a very
narrow range here of visible

00:24:26.322 --> 00:24:31.000
radiation that our eye is
sensitive to.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.027
At the very long wavelengths is
red.

00:24:34.027 --> 00:24:38.178
At the very short wavelengths
is blue and purple.

00:24:38.178 --> 00:24:43.367
Again, you need to know that
red has a longer wavelength than

00:24:43.367 --> 00:24:47.172
blue or purple.
What I have done right now is

00:24:47.172 --> 00:24:51.929
really just to tell you that
light is an electromagnetic

00:24:51.929 --> 00:24:54.956
radiation characterized at the
wave.

00:24:54.956 --> 00:24:59.886
I put a functional form to it,
cosine, characterized it by

00:24:59.886 --> 00:25:05.143
frequency, wavelength.
We talked about speed of

00:25:05.143 --> 00:25:08.717
propagation.
What I haven't done yet is I

00:25:08.717 --> 00:25:14.166
haven't proved to you that light
is, in fact, or light behaves

00:25:14.166 --> 00:25:17.828
like a wave.
And that is what we are going

00:25:17.828 --> 00:25:21.491
to do now.
And the experiment we are going

00:25:21.491 --> 00:25:26.583
to do is the same experiment
that a gentleman called Young

00:25:26.583 --> 00:25:31.496
did in the late 1800s that
seemed to really demonstrate,

00:25:31.496 --> 00:25:35.069
without a question,
that light is a wave,

00:25:35.069 --> 00:25:41.214
or light behaves like a wave.
We are going to do what's

00:25:41.214 --> 00:25:45.996
called the two-slit experiment.
And in this experiment,

00:25:45.996 --> 00:25:50.690
we are going to take radiation
of a single wavelength,

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:55.118
so we're going to make the
radiation monochromatic.

00:25:55.118 --> 00:26:00.608
And that wavelength that we are
going to use is 6,330 angstroms

00:26:00.608 --> 00:26:05.279
or 633 nanometers.
And we are going to put in

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:09.399
front of that source,
we are going to put a thin

00:26:09.399 --> 00:26:13.168
piece of metal,
or it could be any material,

00:26:13.168 --> 00:26:16.675
but we are going to poke two
holes in it.

00:26:16.675 --> 00:26:19.831
We're going to make two little
slits.

00:26:19.831 --> 00:26:23.074
And naively,
what you might expect is,

00:26:23.074 --> 00:26:27.808
if you have a screen back here
that kind of images this

00:26:27.808 --> 00:26:32.314
radiation --
What you might expect is that

00:26:32.314 --> 00:26:36.784
the spots on the screen right
directly opposite these two

00:26:36.784 --> 00:26:41.732
slits, well, these are the two
spots that are going to light up

00:26:41.732 --> 00:26:45.164
on the screen.
That is where you're going to

00:26:45.164 --> 00:26:49.075
see the image because,
after all, light travels in

00:26:49.075 --> 00:26:52.427
straight lines.
That's where you should see

00:26:52.427 --> 00:26:55.779
those two spots.
If the slits here are 0.02

00:26:55.779 --> 00:26:59.769
inches from each other,
these two spots ought to be

00:26:59.769 --> 00:27:04.000
0.02 inches separated from each
other.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.900
But, of course,
when you do that experiment,

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:15.966
and Christine is actually going
to do that experiment right now

00:27:15.966 --> 00:27:19.158
for us, I think,
there it is,

00:27:19.158 --> 00:27:23.830
on the side board.
You can sort of see it.

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:29.301
She is holding it.
Well, what you can see here is

00:27:29.301 --> 00:27:35.000
that we don't see just two
bright spots.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.115
But what we see is a bunch of
spots here.

00:27:38.115 --> 00:27:43.021
The brightest one happens to be
right in the center of these two

00:27:43.021 --> 00:27:45.825
slits.
And then there is darkness and

00:27:45.825 --> 00:27:50.420
then there is a bright spot and
darkness, and a bright spot,

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.146
etc.
We see lots of different bright

00:27:53.146 --> 00:27:57.040
spots on the screen,
not just two directly opposite

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:03.875
the openings of the slits.
And this is just then a cartoon

00:28:03.875 --> 00:28:09.750
of approximately what it is we
see in real life.

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:15.375
Christine is up there in the
projection booth,

00:28:15.375 --> 00:28:22.750
holding a helium-neon laser
behind these two slits separated

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:29.000
by 0.02 inches.
Well, what's going on here?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.200
Can we understand what the
origin is of these lots of

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:39.200
different bright spots in this
two-slit experiment?

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:45.299
Actually, if we were to measure
that, the distance here should

00:28:45.299 --> 00:28:49.299
be about 3 cm between those
bright spots.

00:28:49.299 --> 00:28:54.500
Well, what's going on?
Well, what's going on is this.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:29:00.000
Waves have the property called
superposition.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.294
That is, if I take one wave,
but then I take a second wave

00:29:05.294 --> 00:29:09.380
and I put that second wave in
the same space,

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:14.674
the actual same space as the
first wave, and I arrange the

00:29:14.674 --> 00:29:20.433
two waves such that the maximum
of both waves or the minimum of

00:29:20.433 --> 00:29:24.148
both waves is at the same
position, well,

00:29:24.148 --> 00:29:30.000
the property of waves is that
these two waves add up.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.433
They superimpose.
They superimpose to make a wave

00:29:34.433 --> 00:29:39.882
that now has the amplitude of
twice the amplitude of each of

00:29:39.882 --> 00:29:43.761
those waves.
And that is the condition that

00:29:43.761 --> 00:29:46.808
we call constructive
interference,

00:29:46.808 --> 00:29:52.257
but we have to have the two
waves at the same place in space

00:29:52.257 --> 00:29:59.000
and the two maxima have to be in
the exact same place in space.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.815
But conversely,
we can also take the wave and

00:30:02.815 --> 00:30:07.410
bring in another wave,
but we can move that other wave

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:12.612
over such that the maximum of
one of the waves is at the same

00:30:12.612 --> 00:30:16.687
place in space as the minimum of
the other wave.

00:30:16.687 --> 00:30:20.069
In this case,
these two waves are out of

00:30:20.069 --> 00:30:22.670
phase.
And when we add them up,

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:26.225
there will be nothing.
This is destructive

00:30:26.225 --> 00:30:29.000
interference.
Why?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.392
Well, because we have positive
amplitudes and negative

00:30:35.392 --> 00:30:40.459
amplitudes.
They cancel to give us nothing.

00:30:40.459 --> 00:30:47.093
Destructive interference.
And there is a website here at

00:30:47.093 --> 00:30:54.089
the University of Colorado that
lets you take two waves and

00:30:54.089 --> 00:31:00.000
superimpose them.
I need to play with it.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:06.679
What I am going to do is I am
going to make it so that these

00:31:06.679 --> 00:31:12.905
two waves have the same
frequency or the same wavelength

00:31:12.905 --> 00:31:18.679
and the same amplitude.
What I am doing here is I am

00:31:18.679 --> 00:31:23.660
adding this wave,
I am adding this wave right

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:30.000
here to this wave,
and the result is shown here.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.881
And what you cannot see is that
the amplitude down here,

00:31:34.881 --> 00:31:38.520
that amplitude is twice that of
these two.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.715
There is a two there.
But, of course,

00:31:41.715 --> 00:31:46.952
what I can do is I can move
this wave over such that the two

00:31:46.952 --> 00:31:51.301
waves are now at the same place
in space, sort of,

00:31:51.301 --> 00:31:56.272
where the maximum and the
minima are at the same place in

00:31:56.272 --> 00:32:02.091
space and exactly cancel them.
And I am not having such a

00:32:02.091 --> 00:32:06.193
great time doing this here,
but I know you can do it

00:32:06.193 --> 00:32:10.536
because I have done it before.
And you can see that the

00:32:10.536 --> 00:32:13.994
resulting amplitude is zero.
And, of course,

00:32:13.994 --> 00:32:18.820
then you can go home and you
can play all you want with this,

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.796
make all kinds of different
waveforms.

00:32:21.796 --> 00:32:25.013
I am trying to change the
amplitude here,

00:32:25.013 --> 00:32:30.000
which I have done before,
but I cannot right now.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.603
You can do whatever waveform
you want to.

00:32:33.603 --> 00:32:37.207
You get the idea here with
superposition.

00:32:37.207 --> 00:32:40.450
So, that's a characteristic of
waves.

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:44.234
They have positive and negative
amplitudes.

00:32:44.234 --> 00:32:48.648
They add and they cancel
depending on the relative

00:32:48.648 --> 00:32:52.882
positions in space.
But now, let's talk a little

00:32:52.882 --> 00:32:57.747
bit more about this pattern that
we saw in the two-slit

00:32:57.747 --> 00:33:02.839
experiment.
This kind of row of bright

00:33:02.839 --> 00:33:05.897
spots.
And, to talk about it,

00:33:05.897 --> 00:33:12.013
what we are going to do is
we're going to use water waves

00:33:12.013 --> 00:33:17.692
to try to explain it.
Here is a picture of the beach.

00:33:17.692 --> 00:33:21.515
Here is the water,
here is the sand,

00:33:21.515 --> 00:33:26.320
and here is where I wanted to
be all weekend.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:32.000
And the waves are coming in to
the beach.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.753
These straight blue lines are
the crests of the waves rolling

00:33:37.753 --> 00:33:42.164
into the beach.
And suppose I get ambitious and

00:33:42.164 --> 00:33:47.630
I erect a barrier right here at
the shore, a sand barrier,

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:53.000
but for whatever perverse
reason I poke two holes in that

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.027
sand barrier.
Well, what is going to happen

00:33:57.027 --> 00:34:02.291
as the waves roll up?
Well, what is going to happen

00:34:02.291 --> 00:34:07.032
is that a little bit of the wave
here, this is kind of like a

00:34:07.032 --> 00:34:09.640
pinhole, is going to leak
through.

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:13.354
When it leaks through,
it is going to spread out

00:34:13.354 --> 00:34:17.779
equally in all directions.
And so the wave front is going

00:34:17.779 --> 00:34:20.386
to look like this semicircle
here.

00:34:20.386 --> 00:34:24.258
That is the wave crest.
It is going to look like a

00:34:24.258 --> 00:34:27.498
semicircle.
And that is going to propagate

00:34:27.498 --> 00:34:31.304
out.
And when it propagates out to a

00:34:31.304 --> 00:34:34.872
distance of 2 lambda,
well, then another wave has

00:34:34.872 --> 00:34:38.812
snuck in here through this hole
and it propagates out.

00:34:38.812 --> 00:34:42.752
Again, the distance between
these two semicircles is a

00:34:42.752 --> 00:34:46.990
lambda, is the wavelength,
because these are the maxima of

00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:49.592
the two waves.
And, as time goes on,

00:34:49.592 --> 00:34:53.978
that propagates further and
another wave sneaks through that

00:34:53.978 --> 00:34:58.067
hole and another wave sneaks
through and the whole thing

00:34:58.067 --> 00:35:02.675
propagates.
Meanwhile, while that is

00:35:02.675 --> 00:35:09.252
happening, there is also a part
of the wave sneaking through

00:35:09.252 --> 00:35:16.052
this hole and it emanates out in
all directions and propagates

00:35:16.052 --> 00:35:21.849
out in all directions.
And let me, for the purpose of

00:35:21.849 --> 00:35:26.419
talking about this,
call this slit slit 1.

00:35:26.419 --> 00:35:34.000
All the green waves are the
waves that came through slit 1.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.552
And I am going to call this
slit 2.

00:35:36.552 --> 00:35:40.831
And all the blue waves are the
waves that came out slit 2.

00:35:40.831 --> 00:35:44.960
And, again, the distance
between any of these two crests

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.564
is the wavelength.
And the wavelength is the same

00:35:48.564 --> 00:35:51.792
for the waves coming from slit 1
and slit 2.

00:35:51.792 --> 00:35:56.072
Now what I want you to do is I
want you look at this point

00:35:56.072 --> 00:35:59.000
right here.
See that point?

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.569
Well, right at that point,
what we have is we've got the

00:36:03.569 --> 00:36:08.553
wave crest, the wave maximum
from slit 2 at the same point in

00:36:08.553 --> 00:36:11.544
space as the wave maxima from
slit 1.

00:36:11.544 --> 00:36:15.698
If we've got two maxima at the
same point in space,

00:36:15.698 --> 00:36:20.018
hey, we've got constructive
interference right there,

00:36:20.018 --> 00:36:23.424
because those amplitudes are
going to add.

00:36:23.424 --> 00:36:26.914
Look at this point.
Well, again,

00:36:26.914 --> 00:36:31.407
we've got the wave maxima from
this blue wave coming through

00:36:31.407 --> 00:36:35.673
slit 2 at the same point in
space as the wave maxima from

00:36:35.673 --> 00:36:39.710
the wave coming from slit 1.
Again, this is a point of

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:43.366
constructive interference.
And we can keep going.

00:36:43.366 --> 00:36:47.936
Again, we have two maxima right
here, a point of constructive

00:36:47.936 --> 00:36:50.373
interference.
And, you know what,

00:36:50.373 --> 00:36:54.867
everywhere along this line we
are going to have constructive

00:36:54.867 --> 00:36:59.118
interference.
We are going to have a

00:36:59.118 --> 00:37:03.354
resultant wave,
a water wave that is going to

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:07.975
be twice as high as each of the
individual waves.

00:37:07.975 --> 00:37:12.211
Look at this.
What I want you to notice here,

00:37:12.211 --> 00:37:15.099
for this point:
for this point,

00:37:15.099 --> 00:37:20.972
the wave that is constructively
interfering, that has traveled

00:37:20.972 --> 00:37:28.000
from the slit a distance
r two, because this is slit 2.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.557
But the distance from here to
here is 4 lambda.

00:37:32.557 --> 00:37:35.925
It is 1 lambda,
2 lambda, 3 lambda,

00:37:35.925 --> 00:37:40.582
4 lambda, right?
The radius r two of this

00:37:40.582 --> 00:37:45.535
circle is 4 lambda.
And it is interfering with this

00:37:45.535 --> 00:37:49.696
wave crest.
And the distance that that wave

00:37:49.696 --> 00:37:54.154
traveled from slit 1,
I am going to call r one,

00:37:54.154 --> 00:37:58.414
and that is equal to 3
lambda, 1, 2,

00:37:58.414 --> 00:38:01.851
3.
This interference here is

00:38:01.851 --> 00:38:05.555
between this wave that has
traveled out a distance,

00:38:05.555 --> 00:38:09.703
4 lambda, and this wave that
has traveled out a distance,

00:38:09.703 --> 00:38:12.222
3 lambda.
And the difference in the

00:38:12.222 --> 00:38:16.592
distance traveled by those two
waves that are constructively

00:38:16.592 --> 00:38:20.592
interfering is 4 lambda minus 3
lambda equals 1 lambda.

00:38:20.592 --> 00:38:24.000
Is there a question over here?
Yes?

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.174
I think I am coming to that.
That was a snapshot of the next

00:38:37.174 --> 00:38:38.430
slide.
Sorry.

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:41.883
Yes?
Because we are treating these

00:38:41.883 --> 00:38:45.127
as regular waves,
ordered waves.

00:38:45.127 --> 00:38:49.313
Real waves on an ocean are not
like that.

00:38:49.313 --> 00:38:55.279
And then, you won't see this
diffraction pattern that I am

00:38:55.279 --> 00:39:00.971
erecting here.
But, if you had pretty regular

00:39:00.971 --> 00:39:05.527
waves coming in,
in principle you could see it.

00:39:05.527 --> 00:39:10.875
And I am going to show you,
in a tank, some water waves

00:39:10.875 --> 00:39:15.629
that do just this.
Now I want you to look at this

00:39:15.629 --> 00:39:20.185
point right here.
Right here we have a point of

00:39:20.185 --> 00:39:25.533
constructive interference
because we have two maxima at

00:39:25.533 --> 00:39:31.293
the same point in space.
And at this point we've got

00:39:31.293 --> 00:39:35.964
constructive interference.
So everywhere along this line

00:39:35.964 --> 00:39:40.380
here, we are going to have
constructive interference.

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:45.391
And now I want you to look at
the difference in the distance

00:39:45.391 --> 00:39:50.402
of the waves that yield this
constructive interference along

00:39:50.402 --> 00:39:53.460
this line.
I want you to look at this

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:57.621
green wave that is
constructively interfering with

00:39:57.621 --> 00:40:02.205
this blue wave.
This green wave has traveled

00:40:02.205 --> 00:40:07.009
out a distance r one or 2
lambda, and it is interfering

00:40:07.009 --> 00:40:11.577
with this blue wave here that
has traveled out a distance 4

00:40:11.577 --> 00:40:14.412
lambda, r two equals 4
lambda.

00:40:14.412 --> 00:40:18.587
So, the difference in the
distance traveled for all of

00:40:18.587 --> 00:40:22.603
these points that lead to
constructive interference,

00:40:22.603 --> 00:40:27.329
the difference in the distance
traveled here is r two minus r

00:40:27.329 --> 00:40:33.000
one or 4 lambda
minus 2 lambda equals 2 lambda.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.484
Does that agree with the
snapshot in your picture?

00:40:37.484 --> 00:40:40.230
Yes.
I just didn't show you the

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:43.708
other one.
Now I want you to look here.

00:40:43.708 --> 00:40:47.735
Here is a point of constructive
interference.

00:40:47.735 --> 00:40:52.311
Here is another point of
constructive interference.

00:40:52.311 --> 00:40:57.711
Everywhere along this line we
are going to have constructive

00:40:57.711 --> 00:41:02.628
interference.
And, if we check out what the

00:41:02.628 --> 00:41:07.613
difference in the distance
traveled is between the waves

00:41:07.613 --> 00:41:11.329
that are constructively
interfering there,

00:41:11.329 --> 00:41:17.039
you are going to see that r two
minus r one is equal to 0.

00:41:17.039 --> 00:41:20.574
Now, what you would predict is

00:41:20.574 --> 00:41:25.377
we would have along this angle
some very bright spots,

00:41:25.377 --> 00:41:30.000
along this angle some very
bright spots.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.897
And along this angle some very
bright spots.

00:41:33.897 --> 00:41:39.336
And you also can see that this
is going to be symmetric about

00:41:39.336 --> 00:41:43.596
the center, so you would have
bright spots here,

00:41:43.596 --> 00:41:47.766
bright spots there.
Well, let's look at this in

00:41:47.766 --> 00:41:52.479
real life, in a water tank,
where we have plain waves

00:41:52.479 --> 00:41:57.918
coming into a barrier and then
we have two little slits right

00:41:57.918 --> 00:42:07.014
there and right there.
And what you can see is that

00:42:07.014 --> 00:42:18.614
these bright semicircles are,
in fact, the crest of the

00:42:18.614 --> 00:42:26.133
waves.
But what I want you to see is

00:42:26.133 --> 00:42:31.808
right here --
What I want you to see,

00:42:31.808 --> 00:42:34.953
is right here:
These are this bright row,

00:42:34.953 --> 00:42:38.255
here is a bright row,
here is a bright row.

00:42:38.255 --> 00:42:42.972
And in between there is kind of
just a muddy diffuse pattern.

00:42:42.972 --> 00:42:45.882
Well, this diffuse pattern is
nothing.

00:42:45.882 --> 00:42:48.869
This is a bright row.
You get the idea.

00:42:48.869 --> 00:42:53.272
You are going to have an angle
which there is going to be

00:42:53.272 --> 00:42:57.597
constructive interference,
several angles of which there

00:42:57.597 --> 00:43:02.000
is going to be constructive
interference.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.352
And in between those places
where there is constructive

00:43:08.352 --> 00:43:12.235
interference,
there is destructive

00:43:12.235 --> 00:43:17.176
interference,
and you are not going to have

00:43:17.176 --> 00:43:22.000
any light.
How does that relate to what we

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000
saw in the two-slit diffraction
experiment?

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.711
Along this line we have waves
that have constructively

00:43:32.711 --> 00:43:37.333
interfered, and they
constructively interfere so that

00:43:37.333 --> 00:43:41.599
on the screen right there you
have a bright spot.

00:43:41.599 --> 00:43:46.044
And along this line,
the difference in the distance

00:43:46.044 --> 00:43:50.933
traveled by the waves that
constructively interfere is 1

00:43:50.933 --> 00:43:54.222
lambda.
And then we've got another row

00:43:54.222 --> 00:43:57.599
or another line,
points of constructive

00:43:57.599 --> 00:44:02.151
interference.
That is going to image as a

00:44:02.151 --> 00:44:05.019
bright spot.
And if you analyze that,

00:44:05.019 --> 00:44:09.958
the difference in the distance
traveled by these two waves is 2

00:44:09.958 --> 00:44:12.747
lambda.
And then we're going to have

00:44:12.747 --> 00:44:16.651
another bright spot here.
For all the constructive

00:44:16.651 --> 00:44:21.351
interference along this line,
the difference in the distance

00:44:21.351 --> 00:44:23.901
traveled is zero.
And, of course,

00:44:23.901 --> 00:44:29.000
I said before this was
symmetric around the center.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:35.145
And so this is what gives rise
to the different bright spots on

00:44:35.145 --> 00:44:39.705
the screen when we did the
two-slit experiment.

00:44:39.705 --> 00:44:41.886
Bright spot.
Dark spot.

00:44:41.886 --> 00:44:44.067
Bright spot.
Dark spot.

00:44:44.067 --> 00:44:48.626
The bright spots are
constructive interference.

00:44:48.626 --> 00:44:53.384
The dark spots here are
destructive interference.

00:44:53.384 --> 00:44:59.530
Now, let me just tell you that
the general condition for having

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:05.332
these bright spots --
The general condition that has

00:45:05.332 --> 00:45:10.230
to obtain is that the difference
in the distance traveled has to

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:13.262
be equal to N,
an integer, times lambda.

00:45:13.262 --> 00:45:16.916
This bright spot,
the difference in the distance

00:45:16.916 --> 00:45:20.337
traveled, N is 0.
We call that the zero order

00:45:20.337 --> 00:45:22.048
spot.
This bright spot,

00:45:22.048 --> 00:45:25.857
the difference in the distance
traveled is lambda,

00:45:25.857 --> 00:45:28.268
or N times lambda,
where N is 1,

00:45:28.268 --> 00:45:32.000
first order interference
feature.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.963
Here, the difference in the
distance traveled is 2 lambda,

00:45:36.963 --> 00:45:41.839
N times 2, called the second
order interference features.

00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:47.151
And the condition for that is
this, r2 minus r1 equals N times

00:45:47.151 --> 00:45:50.460
lambda. There is

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:54.379
also a condition for destructive
interference,

00:45:54.379 --> 00:45:59.603
which I ask you to think about,
and we will talk just briefly

00:45:59.603 --> 00:46:03.890
about its origin next time.
All right.

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:05.290
See you on Wednesday.
