00:00:06.076 --> 00:00:08.566
&gt;&gt;Asia: This chair
is for the presenter.

00:00:08.606 --> 00:00:10.586
This is for the person
who created the trailer.

00:00:11.146 --> 00:00:14.306
You're going to say how you
decided to do your trailer.

00:00:14.876 --> 00:00:16.866
Then we'll do warm and cool feedback.

00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:18.936
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In this
digital storytelling class

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:22.506
at Carter G. Woodson Middle School
on the south side of Chicago,

00:00:22.676 --> 00:00:25.796
students are learning to
express themselves using new

00:00:25.796 --> 00:00:27.266
media technologies.

00:00:27.396 --> 00:00:30.256
&gt;&gt;Student: I liked how you
incorporated everything together

00:00:30.256 --> 00:00:32.446
and made it dramatic.

00:00:32.796 --> 00:00:35.136
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And learning how
to critique what they see.

00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.386
&gt;&gt;Student: Because it seemed
like the sound effects took over

00:00:37.386 --> 00:00:39.116
and you really couldn't
hear yourself.

00:00:40.156 --> 00:00:43.216
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Carter G. Woodson
is one of four schools that make

00:00:43.216 --> 00:00:48.846
up the Digital Youth Network or DYN,
a sixth through twelfth grade program

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:52.246
that was created in
2003 by the University

00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:54.766
of Chicago's Urban
Education Institute.

00:00:55.116 --> 00:00:58.326
&gt;&gt;Nichole: The Digital Youth Network
takes up the challenge preparing kids

00:00:58.326 --> 00:01:00.726
for the year 2020 and beyond.

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:04.166
And we do that in trying to create
partnerships between all the spaces

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:07.386
where kids spend their time
during the school day, in school,

00:01:07.736 --> 00:01:11.136
after school, and after-school
programming, at home through the use

00:01:11.226 --> 00:01:13.396
of online tools and social networks,

00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.496
and in the communities
that surround them.

00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:17.446
&gt;&gt;Akili: If you could if you
know your account, log in.

00:01:17.446 --> 00:01:22.666
&gt;&gt;Nichole: So we've tried to allow
kids to sort of learn on demand.

00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:25.526
&gt;&gt;Jared: Through Digital
Youth Network and presence

00:01:25.626 --> 00:01:30.526
of DYN classes inside the school
day our students are gaining access

00:01:30.526 --> 00:01:35.866
to software and skills that really
push the envelope on what we think

00:01:35.936 --> 00:01:38.036
or what teachers think
they're capable of doing.

00:01:38.036 --> 00:01:39.276
&gt;&gt;Student: What did you
guys do with those pictures?

00:01:39.276 --> 00:01:41.136
&gt;&gt;Student: They're all right there.

00:01:41.256 --> 00:01:45.686
&gt;&gt;Narrator: During the school day
DYN staff teach mandatory media

00:01:45.686 --> 00:01:46.716
arts classes.

00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:50.646
There students acquire
basic tech literacy skills

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:52.586
that allow classroom teachers

00:01:52.586 --> 00:01:55.776
to integrate digital tools
into their curriculum.

00:01:55.776 --> 00:01:58.426
&gt;&gt;Akili: So again, you can
upload the music y'all are doing,

00:01:58.556 --> 00:02:01.966
and you can also make blog posts and
start discussion forums etcetera.

00:02:02.276 --> 00:02:05.146
&gt;&gt;Narrator: After school,
students can pursue their passions

00:02:05.146 --> 00:02:10.186
in a variety of DYN classes that
meet for two hours once a week.

00:02:10.476 --> 00:02:12.956
They include digital
video production.

00:02:12.956 --> 00:02:14.246
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yeah, make sure you're
moving your play head

00:02:14.246 --> 00:02:16.276
and then play from the beginning.

00:02:16.406 --> 00:02:18.806
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Digital audio
production, robotics,

00:02:19.076 --> 00:02:21.726
graphic design, and game design.

00:02:21.886 --> 00:02:24.256
&gt;&gt;Student: I made it based on
[inaudible] game so I tried

00:02:24.256 --> 00:02:26.246
to make it like with
some type of fortress-

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:30.886
&gt;&gt;Jalen: DYN is just like one of the
awesomest, sickest programs ever.

00:02:31.886 --> 00:02:36.516
It's like technically it's just
like all these awesome sick programs

00:02:36.516 --> 00:02:38.686
like gaming all the way to poetry.

00:02:39.016 --> 00:02:41.236
And after that we have
something called Freedom Friday

00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:44.926
and there sometimes we talk about
topics that need to be talked

00:02:44.926 --> 00:02:46.856
about around the world
like global warming.

00:02:46.856 --> 00:02:49.266
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We have many
perspectives, not just one.

00:02:49.966 --> 00:02:52.116
And you could add to
that perspective.

00:02:52.176 --> 00:02:55.986
&gt;&gt;Narrator: There's also a Digital
Queendom offering just for girls.

00:02:55.986 --> 00:02:57.336
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Alright,
ladies, thank you.

00:02:57.336 --> 00:02:59.326
&gt;&gt;Akili: Digital Queendom
is an initiative

00:02:59.406 --> 00:03:01.126
to really support gender equity.

00:03:01.126 --> 00:03:03.256
Girls often thought that they
couldn't necessarily do the work

00:03:03.256 --> 00:03:05.176
to the same level that
the boys would,

00:03:05.466 --> 00:03:07.966
so we brought the Digital Queendom
pod in giving the girls kind

00:03:07.966 --> 00:03:10.466
of a safe space and in
a more engaging kind

00:03:10.466 --> 00:03:12.206
of context that's focused
on their own issues.

00:03:12.276 --> 00:03:12.936
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Think about the kind

00:03:12.936 --> 00:03:14.466
of advertising too that
you've seen before.

00:03:14.466 --> 00:03:17.876
What is it they try to
tell you to get you to-

00:03:18.136 --> 00:03:21.036
&gt;&gt;Asia: We discuss and analyze
and critically break down images

00:03:21.036 --> 00:03:24.846
of females in the media, anything
that has the female presence in it,

00:03:24.846 --> 00:03:28.686
we break it down to see what is
empowerment, what isn't empowerment,

00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:32.116
and how they can create media
that better reflects themselves.

00:03:32.686 --> 00:03:35.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The DYN
network is accessible 24/7

00:03:36.196 --> 00:03:39.946
through its closed social
network site called Remix World.

00:03:40.446 --> 00:03:44.646
Students post their work, take
part in critiques and discussions

00:03:44.846 --> 00:03:46.776
and receive online mentoring

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:50.316
which expands learning beyond
the school and program day.

00:03:50.316 --> 00:03:52.526
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Did you put sound to this?

00:03:52.526 --> 00:03:54.526
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, yes and
no, I don't like it anymore.

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:58.046
&gt;&gt;Akili: If you want them to really
be a sophisticated game developer

00:03:58.046 --> 00:04:00.676
or a graphic designer
or a videographer.

00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:04.416
It's hard to do that with once a
week so we use the online space

00:04:04.416 --> 00:04:07.266
as an extension and an opportunity
for the kids really on their own time

00:04:07.266 --> 00:04:09.236
to really delve a little
bit deeper into the work.

00:04:09.486 --> 00:04:13.116
&gt;&gt;Student: We just talked about
the presidential election.

00:04:13.116 --> 00:04:14.596
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Once in high
school, DYN students begin

00:04:14.596 --> 00:04:17.396
to focus their development
on an individual medium.

00:04:17.396 --> 00:04:18.286
&gt;&gt;Terrence: And action.

00:04:19.386 --> 00:04:20.996
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Oftentimes
youth who excelled

00:04:20.996 --> 00:04:24.446
in the middle school program are
given internship opportunities

00:04:24.446 --> 00:04:26.706
to serve as mentors for
middle school students.

00:04:26.706 --> 00:04:28.416
&gt;&gt;Terrence: Okay, I'm not sure
if we're going to get that shot.

00:04:28.416 --> 00:04:30.806
&gt;&gt;Terrence: Being a mentor you
know really teaches me skills

00:04:30.806 --> 00:04:32.996
about working in a
productive environment.

00:04:32.996 --> 00:04:35.386
You know, it teaches me
how to be professional,

00:04:35.386 --> 00:04:38.386
how to take those skills that I have
already and enhance them and how

00:04:38.386 --> 00:04:40.836
to teach another generation
how to use those

00:04:40.836 --> 00:04:43.936
and so hopefully there can be kids
that I'm teaching who could wind

00:04:43.936 --> 00:04:47.436
up being bigger and more famous
than I hope to be, you know?

00:04:47.586 --> 00:04:50.926
&gt;&gt;Right now I'm editing the clip
shorter so that it kind of looks more

00:04:50.926 --> 00:04:52.736
like a movie and not like just

00:04:52.896 --> 00:04:55.576
like pictures just
floating out of the air.

00:04:55.576 --> 00:04:57.706
So I'm going to see how
that works out first.

00:04:57.706 --> 00:05:02.186
&gt;&gt;Jared: We know that the world is
shifting and that there are a number

00:05:02.486 --> 00:05:06.016
of new ways of thinking, new
ways of learning and working

00:05:06.016 --> 00:05:08.626
and socializing that won't go away.

00:05:09.036 --> 00:05:10.136
It's not a fad.

00:05:10.396 --> 00:05:11.426
It's not a trend.

00:05:11.806 --> 00:05:13.956
And the way people connect,
the way people work,

00:05:14.296 --> 00:05:15.656
the way people learn
is very different

00:05:16.166 --> 00:05:19.656
so we think our kids need
the ability to use technology

00:05:20.146 --> 00:05:22.676
in their personal development
and in their learning.

00:05:22.676 --> 00:05:22.886
&gt;&gt;Hi, this is:

00:05:22.886 --> 00:05:25.436
&gt;&gt;The Random Show!

00:05:26.206 --> 00:05:39.996
&gt;&gt;And you are watching it on DYN TV.

00:05:46.266 --> 00:05:48.226
