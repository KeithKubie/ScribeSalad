00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.350
With the question “what is life?”

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.540
largely addressed at the molecular level—and with
companies setting up labs to test how thousands

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.500
of chemicals affect living things—and with
new technologies like immortalized cell lines

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.970
and somatic-cell “cloning”—humanity
could finally cure all disease and live forever…

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.869
Except that didn’t happen, because—as
usual—the natural world is a lot more complicated

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.210
than humans first thought.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.860
Today, we’ll tell the story of the Human
Genome Project.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.160
It’s really cool, you guys!

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:43.180
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.720
Epistemically, the amount of information contained

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.909
within even the smallest organism is simply
mind-boggling.

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:52.820
There is lots and lots of DNA.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.549
Molecular biologists had figured out some
genetic sequences in bacteria and the viruses

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:58.909
that hijack them.

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.480
But mapping the human genome?

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.390
That seemed like mapping every star in the
universe.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.170
Technologically, scientists in the 1950s and
60s could barely sequence DNA and RNA at all.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.690
One major breakthrough came in 1977, when
British biochemist and double Nobel Prize

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.940
winner Frederick Sanger developed a new, reliable
way of decoding DNA that became known as Sanger

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.940
sequencing.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.191
Sanger’s method became the standard way
to sequence DNA until the late 1990s, when

00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:29.630
“next-gen,” high-throughput sequencers
became available.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.080
It’s complicated, but Sanger sequencing
cleverly works by chopping up an unknown sequence

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.190
of DNA, tagging them with four different fluorescent
dyes that bond to the four different nucleic

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.380
bases, and then sorting out the segments by
length.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.479
You can repeat the process many times to decode
an entire genome.

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.500
One of the main issues is that decoding one
sequence of DNA requires lots of copies of

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.730
that sequence.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.040
And copying DNA, up until the 1980s, took
lots of time.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.610
Like… weeks to months, and it was expensive… and, even

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.430
then, it didn’t always work!

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.869
Enter American biochemist and avid surfer
Kary Mullis.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.370
In 1983, while working at the biotech firm
Cetus in California, Mullis developed polymerase

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.569
chain reaction, or PCR.

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.090
This was an automated way of taking advantage
of a natural process for copying DNA.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.840
In PCR, cycles of heating and cooling alternate
between melting DNA and copying it using enzymes.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.530
PCR can make billions of copies every hour,
helping scientists quickly replicate strands

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:37.760
of DNA for study.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.340
Mullis and his bosses published a paper on
PCR in 1985, and he went on to win the Nobel

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.340
Prize.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.430
You could say Mullis didn’t fit the mold
of a traditional Nobelist.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.030
For one, he admitted to using LSD frequently
in his youth.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:58.620
And—for a really weird two—in 1998, Mullis
wrote an autobiography denying AIDS is a thing.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.099
Which is just… really?

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.940
That’s like “denying” pigeons!

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.940
Anyway.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.450
Modern science doesn’t rely on individuals.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.540
It’s a team sport.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.849
And the teams keep getting bigger.

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.099
By the late 1980s, some biologists began to
discuss what had seemed impossible a decade

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.590
before: completely decoding the human genome.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.220
The stated idea was to understand the different
versions of genes that seem linked to cancers

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.599
in order to develop better cancer-fighting
drugs.

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.959
Another goal was political: this would be
the Manhattan Project of biology.

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.340
The U.S. would fund the future of medicine
and attract the top biologists… hopefully

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.770
no bombs, though.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.690
Planning began in 1988, when the U.S. National
Institutes of Health, or NIH, and the Department

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.840
of Energy agreed to work together.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.610
And the federal government created the Office,
later the Center, for Human Genome Research.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.410
The Center’s first director was the famous
James Watson.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.520
But he resigned early on,
and physician and geneticist Francis S. Collins

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.520
took over.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.940
Collins, by the way, has a rock band called
The Directors!

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.660
The Human Genome Project officially began
on October 1st, 1990, with the goal of sequencing

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.440
a representative “working draft” of ninety
percent of a human genome—a model blueprint

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.830
for a human body.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.090
There was no central hub: instead, many labs
participated, all over the world.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.480
So planning the project took years.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.490
But in 1996, DNA sequencing for the draft
genome finally began at six U.S. universities.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.599
ThoughtBubble, prime us.

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:30.800
Humans are complicated.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.229
So many geneticists began by sequencing related
organisms.

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:39.360
In 1996, an international team finished a
draft sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.949
, the yeast humans use to make beer, bread,
and biotechnologies.

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.800
Although Saccharomyces is a microbe, it was
still the first eukaryotic organism—with

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.949
a membrane-bound nucleus, like humans!—to
have its genome sequenced.

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:59.840
Also in 1996, scientists revealed a “map”
of sixteen thousand human genes.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.990
Critics thought HGP would be a gargantuan
waste of money.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.060
But the project was moving much faster than
predicted.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.080
In 1997, the Center became the National Human
Genome Research Institute, or NHGRI.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:18.439
And then, in 1998, American biotechnologist
J. Craig Venter, entered the competition.

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:23.409
Earlier, Venter had worked at NIH, where he
became an expert in making short synthetic

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:27.589
bits of DNA called "Expressed Sequence Tags."

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:30.110
These were useful for identifying genes…

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.699
And Venter and the NIH controversially tried
to patent them.

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:39.110
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office said
no in 1992, but this battle introduced Venter

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.539
to the scientific limelight.

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:45.779
So later, when Venter disagreed with the manner
in which HGP was being managed, he decided

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:47.720
to compete with it—privately.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.970
That’s right: one dude said, I’ll beat
the entire United States government at science!

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:59.930
Venter believed that HGP should switch from
reliable but slow Sanger sequencing to a much

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.289
faster but more expensive new method called
shotgun sequencing.!

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:09.589
Sanger sequencing only works on DNA strands
up to ten thousand base pairs, which is very

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:10.589
small.

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:15.629
“Shotgunning” a genome involves fragmenting
it into bits, several times in a row, and

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:19.249
then letting a computer try to piece the blueprint
back together.

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:24.219
Each pass is flawed, but collectively, they
add up to a whole sequence.

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:25.219
Thanks, ThoughtBubble.

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:30.159
Venter wasn’t shy about letting the other
HGP leaders know they were doing their job

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:31.159
wrong.

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:35.599
He officially quit HGP and started a for-profit
company, Celera Genomics, that planned to

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:41.970
use shotgunning and automation to sequence
the human genome in three years—seven years

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:42.970
fasters than HGP.

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.050
He would pay for this by holding the sequenced
genes as intellectual property.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.479
That is, he’d continue his decade-long fight
over whether or not human genes can be owned.

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:58.680
This rush to make money from human genes paralleled
the pre-HGP rush to patent cell lines, like

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.639
the University of California’s ownership
of Mo, from last episode.

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:04.099
And other companies followed suit.

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:11.830
In 1998, the government of Iceland controversially
licensed the health data of all 275,000 Icelanders

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:17.300
to a private U.S.–Icelandic company called
deCODE Genetics, who were looking for genes

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.919
linked to illnesses.

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:23.680
deCODE declared bankruptcy in 2009 and has
since been acquired by different companies.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.139
In early 1999, sequencing of the human genome
at a large scale began, about a decade after

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:30.690
the project started.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:35.660
This was slow compared to the rapid development
of the atomic bomb, but arguably that’s

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.699
like comparing one dangerous apple to billions
and billions of oranges.

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:43.970
And HGP had effects even before it finished.

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.659
In 2000, President Clinton signed an Executive
Order to prevent genetic discrimination in

00:07:48.659 --> 00:07:50.389
federal workplaces.

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:54.400
The same year, both a public group and Celera
released the genetic sequence of the fruit

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.270
fly—one of biology’s rockstar model organisms.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:01.580
And then, also in 2000, with Venter about
to scoop them, the leaders at the National

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.569
Human Genome Research Institute called a truce.

00:08:04.569 --> 00:08:07.940
President Clinton, British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, Venter, and Collins collectively

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:13.139
announced the completion of eighty-five percent
of a draft human genome.

00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:15.059
Collins and Clinton both invoked religion.

00:08:15.059 --> 00:08:20.800
In Collins’ words: “We have caught the
first glimpses of our instruction book, previously

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.659
known only to God.”

00:08:22.659 --> 00:08:25.729
The complete draft was finished in 2003.

00:08:25.729 --> 00:08:27.149
Everybody was a winner.

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:31.610
Private industry had fought the government
to a stalemate and secured serious investment.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.020
The government had spent less than three billion
1991 dollars.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.960
Which, if you think about, really is not much!

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:44.190
And medical researchers, evolutionary biologists,
and bioengineers now had more data than they

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.520
knew what to do with!

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:50.000
Within thirteen years, hundreds of scientists
around the world had mapped the roughly three

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
billion base pairs of DNA that code for a
single human body.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.980
But they understood very little of it.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.830
Originally, they predicted there would be
about one hundred thousands genes, or regions

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.420
that code for proteins, in a human genome.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:08.510
But there are only twenty thousand to twenty-five
thousand.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.440
In fact, most DNA doesn’t “code for”
anything!

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:16.420
Some DNA serves important regulatory functions,
turning coding genes on and off.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.550
Some may be “junk.”

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:25.590
So in 2003, NHGRI launched ENCODE—The Encyclopedia
of DNA Elements Project—in order to understand

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.980
all “functional elements” in human DNA.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.250
ENCODE published results in 2012.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:36.400
On the technology side, the race to map the
human genome drove the price of sequencing

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.230
DNA way down.

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.880
Sequencing cost continues to fall exponentially:
The first human genome cost three billion

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.880
dollars.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.780
Today, sequencing one human genome only costs
about a thousand.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.770
Lots of companies are doing just that.

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:53.880
There are over fifteen hundred biotech companies
in the U.S. today and more than ten thousand

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.820
labs that conduct genetic sequencing.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:02.250
And since 2009, community biology labs have
supported the rise of “DIY bio,” a movement

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:07.860
wherein amateurs can sequence DNA and practice
bioengineering in nonprofit labs.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.390
So what has all this DNA discovery led to?

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:11.390
Immortality?

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.390
Flying cats?

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.920
I don't... I don't want flying cats.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.110
Sadly, human genetics remain really, really
complicated today.

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:23.561
Medical researchers are still working out
ways to reprogram certain genes to, say, not

00:10:23.561 --> 00:10:28.510
give rise to cancer, or to reprogram immune
cells to fight cancer better, without the

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.280
need for toxic drugs.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:35.810
One day, healthcare may be specifically tailored
to your unique genome and we’ll talk about

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.810
this vision for personalized medicine in two
episodes.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:45.750
What HGP and cheap genome sequencing did in
the 1990s and 2000s, however, was change criminal

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.410
law and not-change popular understandings
of race.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.770
At first, defense lawyers were suspicious
of DNA evidence.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:56.310
What if the lab made an error and sent the
wrong person to jail?

00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:01.050
But they soon realized that DNA evidence could
be used to exonerate the wrongfully convicted.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.680
Today, DNA is a cornerstone of forensics.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.610
It’s seen as more reliable than fingerprint
evidence.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:11.230
Of course, some people find it super creepy
that authorities can “profile” someone

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:12.470
using their DNA…

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:17.130
Outside of the courtroom, the Human Genome
Diversity Project, or HGDP, was organized

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.250
at Stanford in the 1990s.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:25.090
Its mission: to collect DNA samples from thousands
of different populations to understand human

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.090
diversity.

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.820
Its founder, Luca Cavalli-Sforza, was a prominent

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:33.480
geneticist who thought HGDP would fight racism
and celebrate different cultures.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:39.520
Yet some critics accused HGDP of being racist
by exploiting indigenous people for potential

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.650
commercial gain: the World Council of Indigenous
People’s called it “the Vampire Project.”

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:45.680
Ouch.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.460
Recently, genetic ancestry testing has become
commonplace.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:54.890
These could have highlighted how incredibly
similar all humans are, and how artificial

00:11:54.890 --> 00:12:00.580
groupings based on so-called “races” are:
they are the products of imperial census-taking,

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:01.580
not science.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:05.650
But instead, many ancestry tests reinforce
census race terms.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:11.750
According to pioneering historian of biology
Evelyn Fox Keller, the twentieth was the “century

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:17.780
of the gene”: the concept was born, explored,
and finally understood to be much more complex

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.360
than anyone had first thought.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.320
“Genes” aren’t necessarily the best
or even very good ways of thinking about traits

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.810
in the blueprints of organisms.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:30.180
DNA isn’t a computer language; it’s a
kind of molecule.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.230
And knowing more about it may lead to better
medicine one day, but it’s going to take

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.500
a long time.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.010
Next time—we’re headed back to the world
of data.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.560
It’s time for the birth of everyone’s
absolute favoritest place, the Internet!

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:49.480
Crash Course is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula, MT. And it's made with the help of all these nice people.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.480
And our animation team is Thought Cafe.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.760
Crash Course is a Complexly production. If you want to keep imagining the world complexly with us
