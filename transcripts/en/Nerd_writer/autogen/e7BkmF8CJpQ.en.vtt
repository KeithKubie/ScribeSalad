00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.440
 Before you see a single image in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.380
 you hear a choir singing in a little worrying harmonic minor key on a black background. 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.920
 This is the music theme that is related to the Lothlorien elves. 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.600
 This is Galadriel's theme, which will tell the story not the Only Ring in Prologue. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.440
 But not before the topic spills over to the Ring with the first title. 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.400
 When the prologue ends and the minor key passes to the majorette 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.620
 the story also goes from Galadriel to Bilbo when the mood changes 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.200
 and the theme goes to the lighter music theme of the Shire, as Bilbo puts us on the map. 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.220
 Finally, after Bilbo puts us in time, the theme of the Fellowship is full 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.600
 after which her subtitle is introduced, encompassing the start of the film. 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:24.320
 If this masterful intertwining of topics is not enough to prove to you that composer Howard Shore is a genius 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.000
 everything is fine, because there is something else to say. 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.420
 First, these 4 topics I mentioned are called leitmotifs. 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.340
 Technique popularized by Richard Wagner 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.280
 which combines music themes with specific people, events and places 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.900
 to help and even improve the development of drama and plot. 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.180
 To show how Shor develops his leitmotifs 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.280
 I will isolate one - the theme of the Fellowship that has the most variations. 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.460
 And I will focus on her development in the first film. 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.600
 Before the theme of the Fellowship is fulfilled in its full heroic glory 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.600
 Shore introduces it with several variations. 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.700
 For the first time after the title, we hear it when Frodo and Sam leave the County on the way to Lomidol. 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.640
 Shore presents us a small part of the subject of the Shire, a notice of the final version of the film's end. 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.060
 Then he moves to a slight hint of the subject of the Fellowship 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.960
 using only a horn and an English horn. 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.800
 This is almost immediately contrasted by a more bleak variation 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.760
 while Gandalf rides to Isengard to advise Saruman. 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.680
 Shore adds cinemas and combines the theme with the rhythm of Gandalf's galloping horse. 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.260
 In this tense variation, Saruman is betraying the betrayal. 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.720
 The two themes are supported in anticipation of the eventual disintegration of the Fellowship, later in the film. 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.800
 The next time we hear the subject when Frodo and the hobbits have adopted the Speedo or Aragorn as their temporary leader. 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.620
 Fellowship grows, so the copper section of the orchestra also grows. 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.760
 We started with a brass horn, now we hear three. 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.520
 But the melody of the subject is pressed by the sound of tympani, which gives urgency. 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.740
 The Fellowship Light does not appear again until Frodo is injured by the spirits of the Ring. 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.020
 While Arven was in a hurry to take Frodo to Lomidol 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.680
 the theme of the Nazgulls is mixed with that of the Fellowship, threatening to conquer her. 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.620
 The fellowship can fall apart before even having a chance to form. 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.440
 In the middle of the movie Fellowship finally gathers. 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.480
 And Shor supports this with three separate variations on the theme of Fellowship 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.420
 In their full orchestration and fame. 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.980
 First, as Elron announces the Fellowship 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.800
 and thirdly, as the Fellowship heroically sets off on its mission. 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.660
 But the second is the most interdisciplinary for me. 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.920
 Just before the Fellowship leaves, Shore slightly hints at the subject of the Shire 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.820
 Before being conquered by the subject of the Fellowship, suggesting that the priorities of the Hobbits have shifted 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.700
 and they now have to live with the consequences of this. 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.480
 Ends with unique harmony in the second half of full performance. 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.760
 It's like planting a seed of doubt in the group when it gathers. 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.560
 We will hear another exciting full performance in Moria's mines 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.620
 The only time when all the members of the Fellowship are together in action. 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:50.560
 But 3/4 rhythm of the Fellowship is quickly swallowed by the 5/4 rhythms of the Orcs. 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.500
 And from now on, after Gandalf is lost, the subject of Fellowship will appear only as fragments 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.740
 to the very end of the trilogy. 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.160
 For example - after the remainder of the Fellowship leaves from Lothlorien 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.500
 the subject can barely collect violins and an English horn. 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.960
 Shore crushes this already weak variation as soon as it begins. 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:23.640
 Later, as they rest on the shore, the leitmotif can not "find a beach," until uncertainty and doubt slip. 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.860
 These uncertain variations of the subject tell of the fellowship of the Fellowship. 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.380
 First, with Boromir's death, and then with Frodo and Sam's departure. 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:45.800
 In fact, Shore connects these two moments with a very weak but poignant variation of the theme that fades into silence. 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.420
 Like the Fellow, the theme of Fellowship is built to its full fame 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.480
 and then unravels while it's just a memory of his previous heroism. 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.480
 Shore does this with instrumentation, tempo and harmony. 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.640
 And it does for several other leitmotifs in the Trilogy 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.780
 interlacing them one another. 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:23.180
 The result is a complex network paired with history. 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.840
 I think we rarely realize the importance of music in film art. 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.500
 It is an invisible layer of pure emotion that drives or provokes us. 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.500
 Or leads and provokes the story itself. 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:47.200
 In The Trilogy, Howard Shore has given us the most complete and complicated study of leitmotifs in the history of cinema. 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:54.720
 And the result is a musical arrangement that is as alive as the world created by Tolkien. 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.840
