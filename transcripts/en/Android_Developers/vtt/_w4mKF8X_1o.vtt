00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:02.810
&gt;&gt;Ian: Hey there.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.150
Welcome to another version of the Friday Review.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.370
Now, we promised that we would do a sound
check today.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.050
And instead, we totally got drunk.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.350
So, let's do a sound check right now.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.689
Reto, you should be seeing levels that are
about a half-inch below the red zone on the

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:20.730
audio meter.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.710
Are you seeing anything?

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.710
It's too high.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.710
&gt;&gt;Dan: Too high.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.710
&gt;&gt;Ian: I'm too hot.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.710
Again.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.710
&gt;&gt;Dan: You speak loudly.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.710
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.710
So, probably.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.710
Well.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.710
&gt;&gt;Dan: I almost jumped out of my seat.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.710
&gt;&gt;Ian: What the hell?

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.710
&gt;&gt;Dan: Dude, I was like, I was like.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.710
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, no.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.710
I just did that to screw with you.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.710
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, OK.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.710
&gt;&gt;Ian: What?

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.710
OK.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.710
Are we there now?

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.710
You should be adjusting the main volume, probably.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.710
&gt;&gt;Male: Yeah, I was just gonna say, you should
be a little bit--.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.370
&gt;&gt;Dan: Just if you had any question whether
or not this was actually live, you can tell

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.370
because we would never do this.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.370
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.370
Great.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.370
Oh, yeah.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.370
Well, because we have a sign on behind us
saying, "On Air."

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.370
Come on.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.370
Oh, what the hell?

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.760
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, I know.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.760
Exactly.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: Aah.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.760
Aah.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.760
There we go.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.760
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.760
That's the way it should be here.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: Now we're on air.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.760
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's right.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: Can you guess?

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.760
So.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.760
&gt;&gt;Dan: What to do when you have an extra zoom
lying around.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.760
All right.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.659
&gt;&gt;Ian: Welcome back to the Friday Review of
Games.

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.600
I, as always, am Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.400
&gt;&gt;Dan: I'm Dan Galpin, as the sign underneath
me says.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.400
So.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.140
&gt;&gt;Ian: And not as always, that came as a complete
surprise to me.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.140
What the hell?

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.140
&gt;&gt;Dan: No.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.140
&gt;&gt;Ian: All right.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.829
So, today, we're drinking something reasonably
special.

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.979
This is something that I have no idea how
to pronounce.

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:26.979
Traquair, maybe?

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.179
&gt;&gt;Dan: Sounds good to me.

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:29.179
&gt;&gt;Ian: Traquir?

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:30.179
No.

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:31.179
It's certainly not that.

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:37.350
This is a handmade ale brewed in the ancient
brew house of the oldest inhabited house in

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.350
Scotland.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.880
So, it's 1930 or something.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.039
&gt;&gt;Dan: And according to a not particularly
reputable source, it is one of the, if not

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.399
the rarest beer in the world.

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.789
&gt;&gt;Ian: Actually, I think that reputable source
was a dude in San Jose, California.

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:51.789
Not Scottish.

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:52.789
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh.

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:53.789
All right.

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:54.789
Sorry.

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:55.789
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:56.789
Nice hat, though.

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:57.789
&gt;&gt;Dan: Thank you.

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:58.789
Thank you.

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:59.920
Yeah, I know this does not actually fit the
crazy hat standard that I've been setting

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.920
lately.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.909
Oh, if you don't mind opening this for me,
I'd be honored.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:03.909
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, sure.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:04.909
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.399
So, today we have five games that we are looking
at.

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:16.200
All of these, fortunately, do run on our testbed
device here, which is, as always, the Transformer

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.200
Prime.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.530
&gt;&gt;Ian: ASUS Transformer Prime.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.850
HDMI Stand-by.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.620
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.280
And yes, and that does, the cool thing about
it, is they have really cool HDMI features.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.280
So, we like that and we're actually trying
to put this on the air for you guys.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.049
And four of these were actually nominated
by you out there in the audience.

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.590
And we did throw in one additional one as
a wild card just 'cause I really like it.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.090
&gt;&gt;Ian: But before we get to our games, we
need to talk a little bit about changes coming

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.090
to the Friday Review.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.930
&gt;&gt;Dan: Am I gonna stop wearing hats?

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.930
&gt;&gt;Ian: No.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.930
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, OK.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.709
&gt;&gt;Ian: Although, I don't know what your hat
budget is, but it must be gargantuan.

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.610
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's almost as big as the beer budget,
but not quite.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: You know I'm actually buying this beer
myself now.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:55.950
&gt;&gt;Dan: Are you really?

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:56.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.120
If you wanna try to chip in, I stopped expensing
it because of, you know.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.120
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, yeah.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.120
OK.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.120
&gt;&gt;Ian: Anyway.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.120
&gt;&gt;Dan: Why?

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.120
No.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.120
&gt;&gt;Ian: No, 'cause I--.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120
Anyway.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.120
[Ian and Dan laugh]

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120
We'll go into that later.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.120
So, here's what we're doing.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.270
Now, we've gotten a lot of comments asking,
"What is it about the votes?"

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.240
"Does the voting suck?"

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.090
Or, "Do you even look at what we vote for,
and if you do look at what we vote for, aren't

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.140
you being just biased by people who have a
lot of friends?"

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.140
Etc., etc.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.030
&gt;&gt;Dan: That is true, actually.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.049
Do game developers have lots of friends?

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: Apparently not.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.170
&gt;&gt;Dan: OK.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.739
&gt;&gt;Ian: Based on the number of votes people
are getting, no.

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:34.739
&gt;&gt;Dan: OK.

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:35.739
&gt;&gt;Ian: Developers have no friends at all.

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:36.739
&gt;&gt;Dan: OK.

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:37.739
Just wanted to verify.

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.750
I wanted to clear that up because most of
the game developers I know work a lot.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.250
So, outside of their local team.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's true.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.720
&gt;&gt;Dan: I guess if they have a large team.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.720
Anyways.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.720
&gt;&gt;Ian: No, no, because they hate those other
guys.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.720
They're always screwing them with the code.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.720
&gt;&gt;Dan: Right.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.720
Exactly.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.720
&gt;&gt;Ian: Anyway.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.720
Here's the deal.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.860
We thought it would be a lot more interesting
if we broke things up a bit.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.621
Instead of having one master list of everything
to vote for, we're going to actually have

00:03:58.621 --> 00:04:00.599
a different list for every week.

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.629
And every week we're gonna pick a theme.

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.939
Now, next week's theme is tower defense games.

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.019
So, you know I'm gonna be playing this stuff.

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.700
I'm a huge tower defense fan.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.700
&gt;&gt;Dan: Mm-hmm.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.579
&gt;&gt;Ian: After that, we have driving games.

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.030
And then, on August 10th, we're going to be
talking about Asian RPG's.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.160
So, JRPGs, KRPGs, any, that stuff that you
used to play on your PSP, that's what we're

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.160
gonna talk about.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.540
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, nominate those really soon because
those take a while to get into.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.740
And it'd be cool if we actually got a chance
to play them for more than a couple of hours.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.740
So, lets.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.039
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, if you go to the old moderator
link, you'll now see each of those categories

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.590
and all of them are open.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.220
And you can vote on any of them, but the voting
closes the Wednesday before the Friday that

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.830
we're gonna review them.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.560
So, next week on the 25th, you're going to
be, or until the 25th, you're gonna be able

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.350
to vote on the tower defense games you'd like
us to review on the 27th.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.840
&gt;&gt;Dan: And, you know, this is a dangerous
week.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.960
I think the other good thing about this is
that we've made this the shortest week, so

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.819
we'll be playing the least amount of time.

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:10.030
'Cause I tend to find that tower defense games
really do suck away all of my free time rather

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.030
impressively.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.030
So.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.030
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, yeah.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.030
Yeah.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.169
If you watched the review last week, you know
that Radiant Defense basically became my life

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.389
for a great deal of June and May.

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:23.389
Yeah.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.550
I'm finally, I finally kicked that habit,
but it took a while.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.039
I had to go to Betty Ford for a bit.

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:31.039
Rehab.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:32.039
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes, exactly.

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:33.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: But we love tower defense games.

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.490
&gt;&gt;Dan: Now we can focus on our other bad habits,
so.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.580
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think we're gonna nominate some games,
too.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.350
I'm definitely gonna nominate Sentinel 3:
Tower Defense.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.350
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.370
Yeah, there are so many good games in this
category.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.949
I'm tempted to actually give Guns and Glory
another look through.

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:49.949
&gt;&gt;Ian: Really?

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:50.949
Guns and Glory?

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:52.380
&gt;&gt;Dan: Not Guns and Glory.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.380
Wait.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.380
I'm blanking out.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.800
I'll get into other games later.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.180
So, all right, so.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.410
Let's go actually to what we're gonna be doing
here today, which is looking at five games.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.430
Now, I'm gonna start off by looking at Auralux.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.770
And the reason why is because it's the first
in the order of icon stashed on the screen.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.229
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think you went alphabetically.

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:14.520
&gt;&gt;Dan: I did, yeah.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:15.520
That's true.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.520
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.000
Well, this is your wild card choice, right?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.230
&gt;&gt;Dan: This is my wild card choice.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.639
I also, I just wanted to give you a call out.

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.979
The live wallpaper that is actually on the
screen is actually being generated by one

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.850
of our five games this week.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.130
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, my goodness.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.130
Really?

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.319
That's a good live wallpaper.

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:32.319
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's not bad.

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:36.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: You know, we keep telling people, "If
you want a great live wallpaper, you should

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.100
totally do an aquarium app because people
love aquarium live wallpaper.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.259
But quite honestly, a lot of the aquarium
apps out there, they do live wallpaper.

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:46.550
They're not graphically impressive.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.550
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, no.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.550
This ends up--.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.550
&gt;&gt;Ian: This one, yeah.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:50.819
&gt;&gt;Dan: This ones got a nice puny fish.

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:53.360
But we'll talk about this later when we get
into looking at fish farms.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.410
But let's talk about Auralux.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:02.319
So, Auralux is a real-time strategy game.

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:06.610
&gt;&gt;Ian: I remember, now the developer showed
us this when?

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.610
When was it?

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.720
Was it at a conference or something?

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.919
&gt;&gt;Dan: It was a GDC.

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:11.629
Again, it was a few months ago.

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:16.450
And I looked at it and without actually having
a chance to play it, I was, "I know, it's

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:17.450
kinda cool looking."

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.409
But, of course, you actually start playing
it and you realize that it's actually very,

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:21.849
very cool.

00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:25.970
And this is--, I like to consider this a preview
of what's to come because currently, the game

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:32.081
is only available on Tegra devices and only
available, I believe, only on tablets.

00:07:32.081 --> 00:07:36.680
But he is rapidly adding, the developers,
rapidly adding more devices.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.940
So, in the game, it plays fairly straight-forward.

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.620
It actually used a control scheme that if
you've played the game Osmos, you're familiar

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.620
with.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:46.479
So, use two fingers in order to scroll around.

00:07:46.479 --> 00:07:50.389
You can hit zoom and then I can actually go
and I can take individual ones of my little

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:54.439
guys, draw around them with a circle, and
I wanna send them on to somewhere else.

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:56.130
So, I'll send them to here.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.130
Like that.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.240
And we'll send us another.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.280
&gt;&gt;Ian: They just go, like little mosquitoes.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.280
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.280
Exactly.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.280
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK, cool.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.280
&gt;&gt;Dan: And what's cool about the game is--

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.280
&gt;&gt;Ian: There's a lot of them.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.610
I think that's why they've restricted it to
certain number of devices, trying to make

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.530
sure that they've got the CP power to--.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.460
&gt;&gt;Dan: And I can also send them into my own
star.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.699
And this upgrades the power of that star.

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:20.080
The number of rings around the star actually
determines how upgradable it is.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.569
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, you're like, sacrificing your dudes
for more power?

00:08:22.569 --> 00:08:26.970
&gt;&gt;Dan: I would say that they're actually becoming
part of the fabric of the stars.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:28.930
So, they're colonizing that star.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.210
That's the way I look at it.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:31.270
&gt;&gt;Ian: Sacrificing your dudes.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.270
Just like some bosses.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:33.270
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.270
Yeah, that's true.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.550
Not like our boss, though.

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.750
He would never do that.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:39.669
&gt;&gt;Ian: No, not at all.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:40.669
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, umm.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:42.659
You sounded sincere when you said that.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:43.659
So,--.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:44.659
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, actually, no.

00:08:44.659 --> 00:08:48.130
We should give a shout out to our boss, Billy
Rutledge, who earned an honorable mention

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.640
as Best Manager of the Year here at Google.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.640
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.279
&gt;&gt;Ian: Why an honorable mention?

00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:56.240
Because the man wouldn't let him get first
place.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.730
&gt;&gt;Dan: I think the good news about it being
an honorable mention is that he gets some

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:04.730
acclaim, but he doesn't have to actually do
any work, like the people who actually forward

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.910
the award, like the people the award have.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:07.910
So, but anyways.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.180
A good shout out to him around that.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.550
And so, this is the game.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:14.120
One of the funny things about this game is
you can accelerate time, but you have to buy

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.190
it in the store, which I think is awesome.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:19.180
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, that's an interesting strategy
for monetization.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:20.220
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.260
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.820
We talked a lot about monetization strategies
last week.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.260
This isn't my favorite one.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.250
And the reason is that I don't feel like I'm
getting a lot for--.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:34.459
&gt;&gt;Dan: Do you want my money, Ian?

00:09:34.459 --> 00:09:39.750
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think that, for me personally, I
like to buy things that I feel like they could

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:40.750
effort.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:41.750
&gt;&gt;Dan: OK.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.750
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, if the developer meant--.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.589
Like, we talked about Radiant Defense and
their additional packs.

00:09:45.589 --> 00:09:46.589
&gt;&gt;Dan: Mm-hmm.

00:09:46.589 --> 00:09:48.470
&gt;&gt;Ian: And those are simple things.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:52.940
You can make an argument that those packs
should have been included with the original

00:09:52.940 --> 00:10:01.060
game, but they contained extra units, extra
weapon types, extra animations, extra strategy.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.450
All of these things took time to design, create,
program, and balance.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:06.450
&gt;&gt;Dan: Mm-hmm.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:12.500
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, I feel like I paid two bucks, three
bucks, five bucks for something that people

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.560
worked on.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.760
When I'm buying time, I don't know.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.190
It doesn't feel the same way.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:21.529
I think there's a lot of people who will pay
for things like that.

00:10:21.529 --> 00:10:27.921
And certainly, I'm one to talk 'cause I pumped
plenty of quarters into arcade machines in

00:10:27.921 --> 00:10:37.500
my youth, but when you're buying something
that doesn't have an obvious labor associated

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.190
with it, you're definitely gonna be attracting
a different demographic.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.820
&gt;&gt;Dan: Now, the other thing you can't really
tell--unfortunately, you can't play sound

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.420
here--but although, strangely enough, the
music in this game, a lot of it is creative

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.930
commons licensed, but--.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.000
&gt;&gt;Ian: But try getting the man to understand
that.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.730
&gt;&gt;Dan: Which man are we talking about here?

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.170
Not our boss, right?

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:58.240
&gt;&gt;Ian: No, no.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.220
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, in any case, the, but actually,
a lot of these flashes and pulses in my world

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.029
is now getting completely obliterated.

00:11:05.029 --> 00:11:06.260
&gt;&gt;Ian: What happened?

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.260
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.529
I just got attacked by the green guys.

00:11:08.529 --> 00:11:09.529
I'm basically screwed.

00:11:09.529 --> 00:11:11.769
The green guys and red guys are both gonna
go after my world now.

00:11:11.769 --> 00:11:12.769
&gt;&gt;Ian: You sold the blue guys out is what
happened.

00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:13.769
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:11:13.769 --> 00:11:16.440
So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get these
guys out of there because by getting them

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.700
out of there, they'll attack each other.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.190
And so, that's another good strategy in the
game.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.930
Now, so, the game actually plays music in
line with the pulses and there's actually

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:25.980
sort of a beat going on.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.980
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, OK.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:27.990
&gt;&gt;Dan: There's a synthesasia--.

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:29.160
&gt;&gt;Ian: Synesthesia.

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.570
&gt;&gt;Dan: Synesthesia, yeah, thing going on.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:32.570
Thank you.

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:33.570
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's pretty cool.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:34.570
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.380
So, that's actually a fun part of the game
that unfortunately, you're missing out on.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.180
So, that's an example of the kind of strategy
that one might use.

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:43.320
Unfortunately, I'm kind of weak to be using
any strategy right now.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.890
The other thing I would want to point out
here is that the game actually does not do

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:50.130
a bunch of things correct with the back key.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:53.440
And so, the developer already knows this 'cause
here, the back key--

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.440
&gt;&gt;Ian: Woah.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.510
Dude, you're gone.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.290
Did it take you back into the game?

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.550
&gt;&gt;Dan: I think I might've hit the home key
there.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.860
What is cool about the game is that you have
a resume right here at the beginning.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:04.860
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:05.949
That's nice, but you know, what's not nice?

00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:07.220
It's that splash screen.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.690
So basically, if I hit a button that I didn't
mean to hit, boom.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:14.120
I gotta wait and watch your logo for about
15 seconds.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.120
&gt;&gt;Dan: Well, no.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.120
That's only when I relaunched it.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.120
But admittedly, yeah.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.120
The splash screen doesn't really--.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.120
&gt;&gt;Ian: So show me.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.120
Yeah.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.120
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.570
So, if I click home, and then I go back, it's
not, it's not--.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:24.570
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, OK.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.220
&gt;&gt;Dan: But admittedly, it doesn't need to
be there.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.250
The game's already running.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:29.850
It's already actually running in that other
case, potentially.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.180
Although technically, if you hit the back
key to exit, it's the process you expect when

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.660
you go back into it, it's gonna do whatever
it does and start.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.300
So, yeah, it's one of those things where it
sort of missed.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.550
But you can certainly multitask quite effectively
with it.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.720
And I love the fact they put a resume in there.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.709
I mean, this is, this is exactly what I would
like to see.

00:12:44.709 --> 00:12:45.709
It makes it very clear.

00:12:45.709 --> 00:12:46.709
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yep.

00:12:46.709 --> 00:12:47.709
That is very cool.

00:12:47.709 --> 00:12:48.709
&gt;&gt;Dan: Look.

00:12:48.709 --> 00:12:49.709
It's a game in progress.

00:12:49.709 --> 00:12:50.709
It's right there on the front screen.

00:12:50.709 --> 00:12:51.709
&gt;&gt;Ian: Hey, let me move this to the center.

00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:52.709
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:12:52.709 --> 00:12:53.709
Sorry.

00:12:53.709 --> 00:12:54.709
I don't wanna break the HDMI connection.

00:12:54.709 --> 00:12:55.709
&gt;&gt;Ian: We'll break the HDMI connection.

00:12:55.709 --> 00:12:56.709
&gt;&gt;Dan: OK.

00:12:56.709 --> 00:12:57.709
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's weird.

00:12:57.709 --> 00:12:58.709
We have better HDMI connection.

00:12:58.709 --> 00:12:59.709
This show is brought to you by Doctor HDMI.

00:12:59.709 --> 00:13:01.550
&gt;&gt;Dan: [laughs] That's right.

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:02.620
All right.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.459
So, that's Auralux.

00:13:04.459 --> 00:13:07.899
Again, there's a lot of really great stuff
in this game.

00:13:07.899 --> 00:13:09.100
And I really enjoy playing it.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.100
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.149
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, it runs great on the Transformer
Prime.

00:13:12.149 --> 00:13:15.390
So, we'll probably take another look at that
one when they actually get a build out maybe

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:17.420
for a minute or two on a future show.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.820
&gt;&gt;Ian: We're excited about this.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:19.820
It's good stuff.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.560
Now, before we move to the next game, let
me just ask you, what do you think of this

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.560
beer?

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.560
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.560
You know, it's funny.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.890
I like it.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:29.890
Yeah.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:30.890
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's different.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:31.890
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's different.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:34.959
It didn't like, strike me as being, I don't
know.

00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:35.959
It's good.

00:13:35.959 --> 00:13:36.959
I mean, what's your opinion?

00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:38.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: Maybe we should have Reto taste it.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:39.649
He has an accent.

00:13:39.649 --> 00:13:41.279
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, that's a good point.

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:42.440
&gt;&gt;Ian: Here you go, Reto.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.290
Reto, why don't you introduce yourself to
the guys here?

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.149
You can picture-in-picture yourself now.

00:13:48.149 --> 00:13:50.100
&gt;&gt;Reto: Can I?

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.950
Because I don't think you've set me up with
the thing.

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:52.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: No, you got the Hangout dealy-bobber?

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.350
&gt;&gt;Reto: It doesn't look like there's a Hangout
setup.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:56.350
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:57.350
&gt;&gt;Ian and Dan: No way.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:58.350
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh well.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.350
&gt;&gt;Reto: I'm right online.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:03.180
You can tune in an hour before these guys
have the app review, and I have an accent.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:08.089
So, apparently that makes me best suited.

00:14:08.089 --> 00:14:09.550
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:17.080
&gt;&gt;Ian: I found that a British slash Australian
accent is absolutely best game review accent

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.080
in the world.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.080
&gt;&gt;Reto: Really?

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.040
I thought it was the way you got onto House,
but I guess [ ].

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.040
&gt;&gt;Ian: That, too.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.040
&gt;&gt;Dan: [laughs] Yeah, exactly.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.040
&gt;&gt;Ian: All right.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.070
So, let's take a look at our next--.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:27.070
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:30.899
I'm not gonna look at Crates on Deck because
Crates on Deck required, yes.

00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:32.800
'Cause Crates on Deck requires rotating this.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.959
Let's go to the ones that all work in landscape
first.

00:14:34.959 --> 00:14:37.889
So, now we're gonna look at Drive with Zombies.

00:14:37.889 --> 00:14:43.680
And Drive with Zombies is a perfect example
of a game that kind of works on tablets.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.320
And what I mean is that a lot of the touch
areas are actually sized in a way that's really,

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.320
really appropriate.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.320
&gt;&gt;Ian: No.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.320
Hang on.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.320
Hang on.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.320
It's the Welcome app for Android.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.320
That's our account, right?

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.320
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.320
Yes.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.320
So, it actually uses account manager on this--.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.320
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's so cool.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.320
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.320
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's great.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.320
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, yeah.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.320
So now, we select our vehicle.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.730
And the goal with this game is to avoid zombies.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.850
You may not be able to tell by looking at
it, the graphics are low res and you actually,

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:09.850
the game--.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.170
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, they're not bad.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.060
Well, the title screen I like, but yeah.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.180
This one, it reminds me of Desert Bus.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.180
&gt;&gt;Dan: Mm-hmm.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.870
So, you've got some choices.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.149
You can run over zombies now.

00:15:21.149 --> 00:15:23.110
You see, there's a little icon there on the
side.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:26.410
It wants me to shoot that zombie and try not
to--.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:27.769
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh.

00:15:27.769 --> 00:15:33.620
&gt;&gt;Dan: And so, for the most part, the biggest
problem with this game is that it is probably

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:40.690
that it's looking at this device, this is
an MDPI device rather than as a tablet device.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:41.690
&gt;&gt;Ian: Wait.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:42.690
Really?

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:43.690
You think that's the problem?

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:44.690
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:45.690
So, these--.

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:46.690
&gt;&gt;Ian: Why do you think that's the problem?

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:47.690
&gt;&gt;Dan: 'Cause the resources are really small.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.520
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, you're talking about the size,
like up in the left hand corner.

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.520
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:52.520
Exactly.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.520
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:55.700
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, my suspicion is that, you see how
small that little arrow is on the right?

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.639
So, my feeling is that on a phone, all this
would be fine.

00:15:58.639 --> 00:16:00.709
I didn't have time to play this on a phone,
so I actually don't know.

00:16:00.709 --> 00:16:01.709
So--.

00:16:01.709 --> 00:16:04.339
&gt;&gt;Ian: I think the real problem with this
game is there's like this great concept, but

00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:05.339
it could be ten times more awesome.

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:06.339
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:16:06.339 --> 00:16:07.339
It just, it really--.

00:16:07.339 --> 00:16:14.350
&gt;&gt;Ian: And I'll tell you, part of it would
be just actually going back and doing a demolition-style

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.389
version, like some crash physics.

00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:17.389
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:20.850
&gt;&gt;Ian: What's that game where you just have
to crash everything in an intersection?

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:23.250
We looked at it a while back.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.230
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:26.230
I don't remember, but I know.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.800
&gt;&gt;Ian: Or that game for the Xbox 360.

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.800
Burnout.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.800
Right?

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.800
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.149
&gt;&gt;Ian: Was it Burnout?

00:16:32.149 --> 00:16:33.149
No.

00:16:33.149 --> 00:16:34.329
I can't remember.

00:16:34.329 --> 00:16:35.329
Anyway.

00:16:35.329 --> 00:16:36.329
&gt;&gt;Reto: It was.

00:16:36.329 --> 00:16:37.329
It was Burnout.

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:38.329
&gt;&gt;Ian: Ok.

00:16:38.329 --> 00:16:39.329
&gt;&gt;Reto: PSP though.

00:16:39.329 --> 00:16:40.329
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:16:40.329 --> 00:16:41.329
Right.

00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:42.329
Yeah.

00:16:42.329 --> 00:16:43.329
&gt;&gt;Reto: Three or four of the intersection
crashes.

00:16:43.329 --> 00:16:44.329
&gt;&gt;Ian: Exactly.

00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:45.329
Yep.

00:16:45.329 --> 00:16:46.329
And now, when I hit a bus there, I'd like
something to happen.

00:16:46.329 --> 00:16:47.329
I'm just saying.

00:16:47.329 --> 00:16:48.329
I think it would be cool.

00:16:48.329 --> 00:16:49.329
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:16:49.329 --> 00:16:54.540
And so you know, you'll see a lot of things
in this game are, a lot of the graphics are

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:59.100
just a little bit low resolution, which means
certainly low res for a Galaxy Nexus or a

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.199
lot of the devices that are out there.

00:17:01.199 --> 00:17:04.150
So, that's just one more note about the game.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:07.150
Also, you'll see that things like the numbers
aren't actually centered.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.810
Like, if we actually take a look here.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:09.810
I guess I don't have touch enabled.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.450
&gt;&gt;Ian: See, I thought that was just avant
garde.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:12.690
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, no, no.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.320
It's actually, it's throughout the--.

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.330
&gt;&gt;Ian: DPI problem?

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:16.330
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:17.670
It's right throughout the entire app.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:22.340
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, the main lesson here is test on
multiple devices.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:28.900
And one of the reasons that we do this show
is because we're good friends with the people

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:33.020
that do game reviews for Google Play.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.440
And here's a tip.

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:41.080
Google Play, the Google Play game review team,
the people that decide which games get featured

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.130
or not, care a lot.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.930
Now, this may come as a surprise.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.450
They care a lot about the Nexus 7.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:52.850
Now what we're looking at here is essentially
identical to the Nexus 7.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:58.310
It's a little bit different, but the hardware
and the screen resolution are pretty much

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.310
exactly the same.

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.250
The DPI's a little different.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:07.190
If you're not working on this class of tablet,
it's very, very unlikely that you'll get featured.

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:13.340
And the reason is we, as Google and especially
the Google Play guys, care a lot about the

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:14.460
success of the Nexus 7.

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.460
We're super.

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.690
If you watched our show last week--

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:17.900
&gt;&gt;Dan: We care about all of our--.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.560
&gt;&gt;Ian: you know that we're just insanely excited
about this.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.170
But we care about all Android.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:22.710
&gt;&gt;Dan: All of our Android children, really.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.710
I mean,--.

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.990
&gt;&gt;Ian: But they have a special place in our
heart.

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:27.510
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.460
Mostly 'cause it's really fun to game on.

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:37.050
&gt;&gt;Ian: Now, if you're on this tablet, if you
work on this, Asus Transformer Prime, Galaxy

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:42.730
Tab, all of those things, you have to work
on that class of device if you wanna be featured.

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:43.730
&gt;&gt;Dan: Sure.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:44.730
Yeah.

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.980
I mean, I think everyone should make sure
their app looks good on a ten inch tablet,

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:51.060
a seven inch tablet, and a five inch phone,
unless there's some--a four to five inch phone--unless

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:56.110
there's some really, really strong reason
why your app doesn't make sense.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.110
And even then, probably make it look good
anyways because even if it doesn't make sense,

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.110
someone's gonna want to play with it.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:05.810
Even if your primary reason is doing hundred
mile an hour photography with the phone strapped

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:07.560
to your head, make it run on a tablet.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.560
OK?

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.560
&gt;&gt;Ian: That would be awesome.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.560
A tablet strapped to your head?

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.630
&gt;&gt;Dan: I know.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:12.630
Exactly.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.220
Not only that, it also works as a deflector.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:22.280
So, in any case, it's like that iPad YouTube
video where she gives the iPad to the grandfather

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.100
and he uses it as a chopping block.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:29.350
So, in any case, Drive with Zombies.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:33.040
So mostly I wanna see higher resolution textures.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:38.140
I wanna see the control just being a lot more
solid.

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.760
The control is, it feels like semi-analog,
but not really.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:45.730
Like, you have to tilt it, then you get this
immediate woo.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:50.080
And I really wanna have much tighter control
if I tilt it a little bit, I get a little

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.930
of accelerometer, rather than a jolt as if
I've now pushed the left arrow key.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:56.660
That's sort of what it felt like when I was
playing the game.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:57.860
&gt;&gt;Ian: Now, one tip that we get.

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:04.570
So, we actually had a really fun summit meeting
with a bunch of, all of the leading game engines

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:10.530
and hardware manufacturers, right before Google
I/O. And one of the things that came up was

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:15.610
the fact that very few games are correctly
using the gravity sensor.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:22.910
Now, that's understandable because we've improved
it recently and it wasn't that good earlier,

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:28.900
but if you use the gravity sensor, A, it gives
you a quaternion.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:33.310
See, now, it's fun because we're doing the
game review and I can say quaternion without

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:34.760
having to explain what it is.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.300
&gt;&gt;Dan: I think you should explain it anyway.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:37.300
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:38.780
Well, a quaternion is like a rotation matrix.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:39.780
Good enough?

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.780
OK.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:41.780
&gt;&gt;Dan: Good enough.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.690
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, the thing is, it gives you back
a quaternion that you can plug directly into

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:45.690
your engine.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:51.440
It's really precise, especially compared to
the other sensors.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:56.140
It brings together all of the data from all
of the sensors on the device to try and distill

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:58.590
it in the most precise sensor you can get.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:01.700
And not only is it precise, it reacts really
fast.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:07.010
So, people that have used the gravity center,
and I think Vector Unit was there and they

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:10.290
switched over to the gravity sensor just a
couple days later.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:11.290
And they're like, "Wow.

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:15.240
We can't believe how awesome it is to play
Rip Tide with this now that we've switched

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.240
over.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.240
It just feels so much better."

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:20.250
&gt;&gt;Dan: And it was pretty awesome to play Rip
Tide in the beginning.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:21.250
Let's just make that clear.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:22.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, yeah.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:23.250
It wasn't a bad game to begin with.

00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.250
&gt;&gt;Dan: Rip Tide was great, but it made it
even better.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:25.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: Exactly.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:26.250
&gt;&gt;Dan: In the gravity sensor.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:27.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: You know what?

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:28.250
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah?

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:29.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: I've decided--

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:30.250
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah?

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:31.900
&gt;&gt;Ian: that I hate the bags under my eyes.

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.170
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, OK.

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:34.440
&gt;&gt;Ian: All right.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.440
Now.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.440
&gt;&gt;Dan: So.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.440
That was good.

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.440
&gt;&gt;Ian: Excellent.

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.460
&gt;&gt;Dan: Now we need to make sure that one of
these ones with the sunglasses actually is

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.130
the one that's used for the preview frame
on YouTube.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:46.830
'Cause that's just the way it should be.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:47.830
All right.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:48.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: All right.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:49.830
&gt;&gt;Dan: Let's go to the next game.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:50.830
So, the next game I wanted--

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:55.860
&gt;&gt;Reto: --cause if we combine the two of you,
we almost have a Blues Brother.

00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:00.000
&gt;&gt;Dan: We actually need to come in wearing
Blues Brothers outfits at some point.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
I think that would--.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.730
&gt;&gt;Ian: I do have a Jake mask that I wore for
Halloween the other--.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:08.660
&gt;&gt;Dan: I think just a suit with a hat would
work with the black tie.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.960
So, in any case, all right.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.760
So the next game I wanted to look at was Nosferatu.

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:19.380
Nosferatu is in the endless runner class.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.420
And it says "Nosferatu, Run from the Sun."

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:27.160
And actually, the biggest problem with this
game is actually its market listing page,

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.670
which has probably one--.

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:29.670
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, yeah.

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:30.670
Let's bring that up.

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:31.670
This is, yeah.

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:33.980
&gt;&gt;Dan: Actually, I don't know about, the problem
is is that you don't see the feature graphic

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:34.980
on the tablet.

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.270
I guess I could go into Chrome.

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:37.570
&gt;&gt;Ian: You do, don't you?

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:38.570
&gt;&gt;Dan: No.

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:39.570
No, it doesn't show up.

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:40.570
That's the problem.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:41.570
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:42.570
We'll go into Chrome then.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.590
&gt;&gt;Dan: We're going into Chrome.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:46.590
Let's see.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:47.590
[Dan sings]

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:48.590
All right.

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:49.590
While I'm going into Chrome, let's cut to
something else.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:51.000
But however this game is, this game is really
fun.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.870
And I thought I had Chrome on here.

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:55.870
Do I not actually have Chrome on here?

00:22:55.870 --> 00:22:56.870
&gt;&gt;Ian: There's a browser, I think.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:57.870
&gt;&gt;Dan: I know.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:58.870
I know.

00:22:58.870 --> 00:22:59.870
All right.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:03.670
Well, let's go to play dot Google dot com.

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:07.210
&gt;&gt;Ian: Dan is now using the keyboard.

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:08.300
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.390
That's good.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:12.790
You can be the voice of Dan.

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:17.790
Dan is now using this amazing attachment,
which someone said was totally irrelevant

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:20.790
on tablets, but is actually quite useful.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.660
So, [coughs].

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.530
&gt;&gt;Ian: Nice.

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:25.530
Perfect.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:26.530
OK.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.910
&gt;&gt;Dan: This is the, all right.

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:30.310
Now we're pointing at the camera.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:32.970
Now, let's go to Nosferatu.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.740
Now, I can't guarantee.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:36.740
Nose candy free.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:37.830
That was kind of awesome.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:38.970
&gt;&gt;Ian: Nose candy?

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:41.010
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's what it said.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:43.300
That must be a game.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.380
So here we are.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.940
Nosferatu, Run from the Sun.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:47.940
So, yeah.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:53.100
So, to look at this game.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.100
That was the feature [inaudible].

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.540
Now, I do love the inclusion of the Google
Play logo as if we didn't already know we

00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:58.830
weren't already on Google Play.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.180
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's a serious issue.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:05.280
Not because we don't love Google Play because
of course we do.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:08.740
And props to you guys for representing.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:14.100
But it doesn't belong in your feature graphic
because we can't actually put this on the

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:15.100
feature page.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:16.100
We'd look silly.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:17.100
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:21.810
So, the second thing is obviously, your text
is really, really small.

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:25.710
No one's gonna really be able to read that
if it actually does get featured.

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:26.710
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:32.390
The important thing is you take this, you
back up about 20, 25 feet from your average

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:35.210
size monitor and if you can still read your
text, boom.

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:36.210
You're good.

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:37.210
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:41.450
&gt;&gt;Ian: Because the thing is, we will shrink
that down until it's about an inch wide.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:47.660
And that's an inch wide being held probably
about 18 inches away from someone's face on

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.540
a phone.

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:56.050
And you've got to have some pretty good eyes
to read "Run from the Sun" off of that graphic

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:57.220
when it's that size.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.220
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.040
I mean, "Run from the Sun" is useful because
it actually tells you what the game is, which

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.040
is a runner.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.660
So, let's go back to the game itself.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:08.420
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, and it distinguishes you from
all the other Nosferatu titles out there.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:09.420
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.420
Right.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.250
&gt;&gt;Ian: I'm not sure we have enough.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:13.370
We need some more--.

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.840
So, this is a one control endless runner.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.150
&gt;&gt;Dan: It is.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.890
[coughs] Yes.

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:21.600
It actually, I think, might eventually get
more than one control, but initially that's

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.890
your goal is your one control.

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:26.570
And you basically, you can do different kinds
of jumps.

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.770
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, nice.

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:32.180
Are your ears actually acting as wings in
this case, or?

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:37.410
&gt;&gt;Dan: Well, I should say that there is, so
what is interesting is that there actually

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:38.490
are two modes to this game.

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:39.640
There is running and flying.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.640
And--.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.640
&gt;&gt;Ian: Wait.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.970
Did you just eat that girl?

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:44.810
&gt;&gt;Dan: I think so.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:45.810
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:46.810
&gt;&gt;Dan: I'm not positive.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:49.090
Oh, I completed my daily mission.

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.660
I'm sure I get some bonus for that.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:52.660
No.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:55.170
And I've fallen and then I get fried by the
sun.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:56.510
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's really pretty though.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:57.620
I love the graphics on this.

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.070
I think it's really, really cute.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.720
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, it's really well done.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.960
I mean, I was really pleased with this.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.510
I actually played with the game a lot.

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:08.250
There isn't anything that I found that was
wrong other than again, like in this particular

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.840
case, the back key doesn't do anything.

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:10.840
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.840
Bad.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.940
&gt;&gt;Dan: But for the most part, that's the biggest
problem with the game.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:18.270
&gt;&gt;Ian: By the way, so let me just take one
moment.

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:21.750
I wanna pimp our Google+ presentation, or
Google I/O presentation.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:22.750
&gt;&gt;Dan: OK, yeah.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.610
&gt;&gt;Ian: We did a presentation called "Ten Things
Every Game Developer Should Know."

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:26.650
And it was fun.

00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:27.650
&gt;&gt;Dan: And it was funny.

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:28.650
I was half asleep when I was presenting it.

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:30.270
&gt;&gt;Ian: We wanted to do another take.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:34.130
OK, so we weren't super happy with the video
team on it.

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:35.710
It was streamed live.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:36.710
Or no, it wasn't streamed live.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:37.710
It was recorded live.

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:42.020
There's a few slides that were super funny
that didn't make it on there.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.970
But the important thing is, there's a lot
of really good information there.

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:48.010
And it's not unentertaining.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:53.050
&gt;&gt;Dan: And you get to see what we look like
when we're wearing ugly cyan shirts.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:54.650
&gt;&gt;Ian: Exactly.

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:58.710
And when I'm not wearing my girdle, which
apparently you were that day as I recall.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.620
&gt;&gt;Dan: [laughs] I was wearing your girdle?

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:01.710
I didn't know that.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:02.710
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:03.710
Thanks a lot.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:05.110
Never share a hotel room with this guy.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.970
Your clothes will disappear and not the good
clothes.

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:10.160
Here's the thing.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:15.010
There are a small number of things that a
lot of game developers get wrong.

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:21.260
We mention it on the show here, but the important
thing is if you get these things wrong, you

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.240
won't get featured on Google Play.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:29.450
And if you do them right, your chances of
getting featured rise astronomically because

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:34.100
if you do them right the first time, you get
to go to the front of the line.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.640
Whereas all the people that got them wrong
go to the back of the line till they get retested.

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:44.010
&gt;&gt;Dan: So basically, if you do something wrong,
even if people like your game, someone has

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:47.260
to go, "You did something wrong in your game."

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.900
Is it actually worth spending the time to
contact you?

00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:52.980
Is your game good enough that it's worth fixing?

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.600
While if you get everything right, then the
only question is, is it good enough to get

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.880
on the featured list on some day when, perhaps,
there aren't many things in the queue.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.390
Then, your chances of getting featured are
much higher.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:06.100
So, definitely these are really important
things we're talking about.

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:08.930
In this case, the back key is actually the
biggest problem with the game.

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:12.140
I actually didn't see any other issues with
this game other than that key doesn't play

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:13.760
music on the lock screen.

00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:14.760
The game is fun.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.960
The feature graphic does need to change if
we were gonna feature it.

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.210
There's no question about that.

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:20.670
But the game is cool.

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:21.670
And I would say yeah.

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:22.670
Make some of those changes.

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:23.670
Let us know.

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:25.720
I hope you've been watching and we'll watch.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:27.820
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, we do like the game.

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:28.820
Great work.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:29.820
&gt;&gt;Dan: Definitely like the game.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:30.820
&gt;&gt;Ian: All right.

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:31.820
&gt;&gt;Dan: All right.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:32.820
So, next game.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:33.820
Fish Farm.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:34.820
&gt;&gt;Ian: Woohoo.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:35.820
&gt;&gt;Dan: Now, Fish Farm is what you guys have
been watching on the background if you've

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.840
been watching what's going on it.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:43.380
And I would say the other thing, you can't
really see from here that the tank is slightly

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.040
lower resolution than I want it to be.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.330
There's a little bit of artifacting.

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:49.070
You can tell that it's compressed.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:53.050
But for the most part, it looks pretty good.

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:54.050
And--.

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:55.740
&gt;&gt;Ian: No, no.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.090
Hang on.

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:58.090
[pause]

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:01.380
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's very a scientific study.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:03.300
&gt;&gt;Ian: Hard to tell.

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.300
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.570
It's a little blurry.

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:10.700
And you can see here up in the corner, you
can see actually some very nice artifacting

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.450
from of the background.

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.120
But other than that, it's pretty good.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.760
My feeling is if you're gonna have one screen
of your game that is as important as this

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:22.380
one, in this particular case, it may make
sense to upgrade the quality just a little

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.520
bit of that one image.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:34.590
So, but what I do like about the game is that
it has 3D fish, which is so cool.

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:40.100
It's very, the fish are actually modeled and
you can see they can spin in any direction.

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:41.420
And they do have behaviors.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:42.900
You can do stuff like, I wanna.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:47.100
So, first of all, this is the way the menus
work, by the way, is I tap here.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.850
There's this little plus sign that brings
up the actual menu.

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:51.810
And then you can do things like feed the fish.

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:56.170
All of my fish are mostly full, but you can
see that I can give them food.

00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:58.010
And the ones that aren't still hungry--.

00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:01.930
&gt;&gt;Ian: See, they've got like, RTS-style meters
over them to tell them how much they've been

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:02.930
fed.

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:03.930
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:04.930
&gt;&gt;Ian: This makes me want to shoot them.

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:05.930
&gt;&gt;Dan: And the free--.

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:08.630
&gt;&gt;Ian: I wanna send my marines out and see
if I can eat them.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:13.090
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, the food, the thing about the food
is that I'm giving them cheap food.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:14.910
This food only lasts for eight hours.

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:17.860
You can also get more expensive food that
will last longer.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.560
And some of it requires slow currency, or
real money.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.800
And some of it can be purchased with in-game
currency.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.800
&gt;&gt;Ian: Slow currency.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:25.800
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:26.800
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.010
The type that takes a long time to earn.

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:29.010
&gt;&gt;Dan: Or that you cannot earn.

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:31.240
&gt;&gt;Ian: Unless, of course, you're Dan or Reto.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.240
&gt;&gt;Dan: [laughs]

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: You pretty much earn it very quickly.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:35.830
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:39.230
So, or unless you just spend a dollar or two
on the game.

00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:40.230
But--.

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:41.230
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.450
Sorry, I'm no good at spit takes.

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:45.170
We really need to get Alex back.

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:46.170
&gt;&gt;Dan: We do.

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:47.170
We do.

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:53.510
The spit take when he was drinking the beer
that had gone through a cat's gut was pretty

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:54.510
amazing.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:55.510
&gt;&gt;Ian: And I wish we'd had him on video.

00:30:55.510 --> 00:31:03.560
Last week, I served Dan the one thousand IBU
Mikkeller beer, which was quite bitter.

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.530
Not impossibly bitter, but pretty damn bitter.

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:08.510
No reaction.

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:09.530
I was extremely disappointed.

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:10.530
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:11.530
Well, I--.

00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:12.880
&gt;&gt;Ian: I wanted to find another co-star at
that point.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.010
&gt;&gt;Dan: The problem is, is that I've been working
with Ian for a while and I've spent the last

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:21.100
six months building up a resistance to bitter
before the game.

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.100
&gt;&gt;Ian: Exactly.

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.100
&gt;&gt;Dan: And before I got to try this one.

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.540
So, it really didn't mean much.

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:25.540
I'm like, "Oh, bitter.

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:26.540
I'm used to it."

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:27.540
&gt;&gt;Ian: Pretty much.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:28.540
But--.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.540
&gt;&gt;Dan: We drink a lot of IPAs.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.270
&gt;&gt;Ian: But when we fed that to Alex, oh my
God.

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:32.270
It was like a Keystone ad.

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:34.400
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, that's because Alex shares his
cube with me.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.670
So, really he's not used to bitter.

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:38.810
&gt;&gt;Ian: Don't we actually all share a cube?

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:39.810
&gt;&gt;Dan: We do actually.

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:41.750
&gt;&gt;Ian: Isn't Alex bitter all the time about
your, you know?

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:42.750
&gt;&gt;Dan: So true.

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:43.750
&gt;&gt;Ian: Habits.

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:44.750
Yeah.

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:45.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, in any case, but I'm not bitter.

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.490
He's the one who's bitter, you see?

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:48.770
&gt;&gt;Ian: Good point.

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:49.770
OK.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:51.990
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, why would I be bitter?

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:56.430
&gt;&gt;Ian: Can we get anyone, anything other than
these blue fish, though?

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:57.430
I mean, these--.

00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:58.920
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, these are the starter fish.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.960
Now, if I want to--.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.970
&gt;&gt;Ian: Can we get a red fish?

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:03.970
&gt;&gt;Dan: I'll show you.

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:04.970
So, we can go "edit" "fish," first of all.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:07.230
And I select a fish here.

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:09.190
And I can make it bigger.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:10.190
&gt;&gt;Ian: Wait.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:11.780
You can just make the fish bigger?

00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:15.030
What kind of a bizarre eugenics program are
you running?

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:16.030
&gt;&gt;Dan: Well, no, no, no.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.440
You see, like, the problem is it takes a while.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.580
So, I can rename it.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:19.580
I can move it.

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.110
I can breed it or sell it.

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:22.550
There's really not much I can do.

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:23.550
&gt;&gt;Ian: Nice.

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:24.960
Is that Japanese below?

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.650
&gt;&gt;Dan: I don't know.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:29.590
And then, but I can go to the store and that
will say one.

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:33.200
And if I go to the store, you'll see that
I can buy this fish.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:38.030
Or for slow currency, I can get another boring
fish.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:44.310
So, until we get much farther up the list
here with experience points and in-game currency,

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.480
I can't buy most of the cool fish.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:50.160
Now, this is one of the things I noted about
the game is this is a really, really slow,

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.140
slow scrolling thing.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:53.140
&gt;&gt;Ian: Wait now.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.140
What is going on there?

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.140
&gt;&gt;Dan: I don't know.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.600
This is running out of Transformer Prime.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.600
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK, yeah.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:01.320
You're running on a very fast machine and
you're getting terrible scroll performance.

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.400
Now, given this is ICS and not Jellybean,
but still.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.810
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, no, no, no.

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:08.460
This is, something bad's going here.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:11.560
I'm pretty sure the entire background is being
drawn as this thing is going.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:15.710
So, first of all, what I would do is given
that this takes up almost the full screen,

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:17.710
pause the screen behind it.

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:19.760
There's no reason to have that continuing
to draw.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.760
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right, right, right.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.950
Now, they don't have that alpha-d out either,
right?

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:23.950
I mean, it's a--.

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:24.950
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:25.950
It's--.

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:26.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:31.500
I would say for the couple millimeters of
aquarium we've got on the side there, totally

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.500
not worth it.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:33.500
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.500
No.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.500
&gt;&gt;Ian: Let's maybe just make that a full screen.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:36.761
&gt;&gt;Dan: Or just pause it behind it.

00:33:36.761 --> 00:33:38.490
It doesn't even have to draw.

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:41.450
It's so sad watching that thing scroll.

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:45.280
So, that is one of the important things that
I noticed.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.260
But you can buy decor.

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:52.810
You can get change the size of your tank,
which allows you to, you can also buy new

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:53.810
tanks.

00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:54.810
So, there's a lot of stuff you can do.

00:33:54.810 --> 00:34:00.630
And it's split between currency that is again,
slow currency, as well as currency that you

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:01.630
can get in the game.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:02.630
&gt;&gt;Ian: Let's buy a fish.

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:03.630
Let's buy a cool fish.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:05.780
&gt;&gt;Dan: I don't have any cool, there's only
one other fish.

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:07.790
&gt;&gt;Ian: Buy a cool fish.

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:08.790
What?

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:10.430
&gt;&gt;Dan: I don't have enough experience points
to buy a cool fish.

00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:11.790
&gt;&gt;Ian: I'll give you some money.

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:12.790
&gt;&gt;Dan: I can't.

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:13.800
I have to actually get experience points.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.950
You have to play the game.

00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:16.280
&gt;&gt;Ian: You can't even just use money?

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.800
I can't go in here and say, just plop down,
"Look.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.250
I got a hundred bucks."

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:22.800
I mean, "Google has a hundred bucks.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:28.040
Actually, my buddy Ian Armstrong, he has a
hundred bucks on his Google card and we're

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.340
just gonna buy a great fish."

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:30.750
Can I do that?

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:32.159
&gt;&gt;Dan: Not that I know of.

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:33.380
I think you have to actually get experience.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:34.380
&gt;&gt;Ian: You know what?

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.380
I like that actually.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.380
That's cool.

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:37.380
You actually have to play the game.

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:38.430
It's not just about how much money you have.

00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:39.430
So, kudos.

00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:40.430
&gt;&gt;Dan: You have to play it.

00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:41.430
I also think, yeah, exactly.

00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:45.020
So, in any case, in fact, these fish I think
are already bigger than when I first purchased

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.020
them.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:49.360
I'll purchase a new one just so you can see
what a new fish would look like 'cause--.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:53.020
&gt;&gt;Ian: Can we at least get that gold-tail
thing?

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.260
&gt;&gt;Dan: Well, I wanted to purchase one of these
guys here.

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.260
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh, OK.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.560
Oh, is it the little tiny one there?

00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.560
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.560
See that one's smaller?

00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.560
So, they do actually get bigger.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.820
&gt;&gt;Ian: You're an excellent fish keeper.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:02.820
&gt;&gt;Dan: Thank you.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:06.140
Yes, you can see my fish are all relatively
happy.

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:08.610
That being said I should feed this new guy
'cause--.

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:11.630
&gt;&gt;Ian: You're better to the fish than you
are to me.

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:12.630
&gt;&gt;Dan: Hey.

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:14.650
&gt;&gt;Ian: Dan's a gardener, by the way.

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:17.260
He's one of those guys that brings produce
in and you're like, "Awesome."

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:18.260
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's good.

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:19.660
Today I brought tomatoes in.

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.060
&gt;&gt;Reto: I haven't received any of this produce.

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.060
&gt;&gt;Ian: Really?

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.780
You didn't get any of his cape gooseberries?

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:25.780
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:28.630
&gt;&gt;Ian: You know, the French enjoy cape gooseberries.

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:29.630
Apparently.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:30.760
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, they're, anyways.

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.040
I brought tomatoes.

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.400
They're in the micro-kitchen today.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.400
So, enjoy.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.400
&gt;&gt;Ian: You put them in the micro-kitchen?

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.710
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:38.090
&gt;&gt;Ian: What?

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:39.320
You didn't give us first dibs on those?

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.320
&gt;&gt;Dan: No.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.320
I just put them in the micro-kitchen.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.320
So.

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:45.440
&gt;&gt;Ian: But everybody goes into the micro-kitchen,
even people that we hate.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.730
&gt;&gt;Dan: Well, yeah.

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:47.730
So, anyways.

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:50.810
That's, so, but this game does a lot of things
right.

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:55.330
And one of them is it actually has a great
list of settings here, which also is very

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:56.390
slow to scroll.

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:57.710
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:01.310
But that's not a great list of settings because
it doesn't use the settings.

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:03.780
&gt;&gt;Dan: It doesn't use the settings.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.340
For a game, it's better.

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:06.340
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's true.

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:10.720
We do give you a pass on your game if you're
trying to fit into something, but the truth

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:14.020
is I'm not buying it here.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:15.020
&gt;&gt;Dan: No.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:16.020
Well, they're using standard controls.

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.570
But the other thing is they're not using common
theme.

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:20.350
They've got the menu of shame.

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:22.020
They've got the zoom control of shame.

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.280
In fact, let's see if, does it die.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.280
Hold on.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:28.480
&gt;&gt;Ian: This doesn't feel like a game settings
menu.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:34.240
This doesn't say, "Hey, I did something different
from normal settings because I had a cool

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:35.240
artistic vision."

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.240
&gt;&gt;Dan: I have it stretched to fill the screen.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.240
&gt;&gt;Ian: This is saying, "I did something--."

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.240
What?

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:41.160
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's so much faster if I have it stretched
to fill the screen at low res.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.880
&gt;&gt;Ian: [whistles] Well, yeah.

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:43.880
That does sort of make sense, right?

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:44.880
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, of course.

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.610
I just, I actually, but good.

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:47.860
Kudos on their part.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:50.441
They actually change correctly and they don't
crash, which really is--.

00:36:50.441 --> 00:36:53.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: That is good, but they probably shouldn't
have the button of shame.

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:55.000
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, they shouldn't have the button
of shame.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's a pointing compatibility button
of shame.

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:58.060
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's running out there.

00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.740
The menu of shame and a button of shame.

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:06.330
&gt;&gt;Ian: But so, just to clarify what I was
talking about.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:09.600
So, obviously, we have design guidelines in
Android.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.800
We have things that we want you to follow.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:19.030
And that applies to most apps and many things
that aren't just normal apps.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:21.680
&gt;&gt;Dan: And mostly, we actually have write
guidelines now.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.680
And that's really awesome.

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.650
Now for games, we usually give them a pass
'cause usually games are trying to do their

00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:26.650
own thing.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:28.900
They're trying to like, have this really cool
custom look.

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.590
This is not cool, custom look.

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:34.140
You'd be better off using our guidelines.

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.120
There's a whole bunch of Android controls
sitting here.

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.530
&gt;&gt;Ian: This goes for apps as well.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:42.530
Like, if you have a very cool custom look
of some kind, and we don't really care what

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:47.230
it is, but if you've got some sort of art
direction where you're saying, "Look, we have

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:48.580
our own special look."

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:54.210
Now, one thing that we don't buy is when people
say, "We have our own special look," and then

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:59.930
we boot it up and it looks like somebody else's
phone OS, we're not buying that.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:00.930
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:01.930
What's up with that?

00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:04.540
&gt;&gt;Ian: But you've got your own special artistic
vision?

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:05.750
Of course.

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:06.750
Do that.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:12.520
We love that, but if you're not bringing anything
to the table, how about just using our normal

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.080
controls, because people like that?

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.080
&gt;&gt;Dan: Well, these are normal controls, but
one, these--.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.080
&gt;&gt;Ian: I'm sorry.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.170
Well, in this case, these are normal settings.

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:19.170
&gt;&gt;Dan: Normal settings.

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:20.170
Well, I would say--.

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:22.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: We don't have any normal controls that
have that gradient.

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:23.830
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:24.830
Part of the problem with these--.

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:25.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: No.

00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:26.830
I'm sorry.

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:27.830
That gradient, I'm, no.

00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:29.930
&gt;&gt;Dan: Part of the problem with these controls
is that there are, if you look at it, they

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:33.820
are, as you know, as you can see, the Gingerbread
version of the controls.

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:35.220
And it would be so much nicer--.

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:37.270
&gt;&gt;Ian: Did we ever ship that gradient?

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:38.270
&gt;&gt;Dan: No.

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:39.660
&gt;&gt;Ian: That's what I thought.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.190
&gt;&gt;Dan: But these controls, the on and of--

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:45.960
&gt;&gt;Ian: Even when we were shipping really bad
UI, we never went that far.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:46.960
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:47.960
So, anyways.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.301
So it would be nice to actually see these
things themed with the theme of the device

00:38:50.301 --> 00:38:51.830
and that's very easy to fix.

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:57.220
And if you target SVK Version 14, it'll just
boom, happen automatically.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:00.430
So, that's one thing I'd love to see this
game do is make all the buttons of shame go

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:01.430
away.

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:02.810
It would probably make this look a little
bit better.

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:07.400
Even better is just use a standard settings
pane if you're gonna make it this much like

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.700
the RR stuff, but not quite.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.700
&gt;&gt;Ian: It'll save a ton of time.

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:14.120
It's really, I mean, did you just have an
intern that needed work or what?

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.120
Come on.

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.260
&gt;&gt;Dan: This, anyways.

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:17.260
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:18.260
Now I'm being mean.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.350
I apologize.

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:23.900
But part of the reason I can be mean here
is because you guys have a great aquarium.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:24.900
It really looks nice.

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:25.900
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:26.900
We like it.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:31.190
One thing I would just like to see is when
you're actually on live wallpaper, there's

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:33.620
really not much feeling that I'm swiping between
screens.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:34.620
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.950
&gt;&gt;Dan: It'd be cool if it actually did something.

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:37.950
You're already gearing--.

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:40.120
&gt;&gt;Ian: If you could move the camera just slightly,
that would be awesome.

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.120
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.450
You're already rendering things kind of in
3D, and I know you have this cool like, this

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:48.140
edge of the glass effect blur thing going
there, but actually, honestly, I'd much rather

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:50.400
see the screen just move a couple of pixels
as you did that just to make you feel like

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.400
it was doing something.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.400
&gt;&gt;Ian: It would be more typical of live wallpaper.

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.490
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, that would be my only complaint
of the live wallpaper.

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:55.960
Other than that, it's really cool.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.060
It actually looks like an aquarium.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.360
I kind of wanna keep it around.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.160
Maybe it'll stay around for a few weeks on
this machine.

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.160
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.160
&gt;&gt;Dan: Unless someone else comes up with--.

00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.500
So, one more game to look at.

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:04.570
&gt;&gt;Ian: No, no, no.

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:05.570
Hang on.

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:06.570
Hang on.

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.320
What happens if you like, tap the back of
the screen right now?

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.010
So that's one other thing that you can do
with live wallpaper.

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:12.970
&gt;&gt;Dan: I want the fish to react, man.

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:13.970
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:14.970
Yeah.

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:16.560
Make the fish react.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:18.770
Get your taps to actually do something.

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:20.870
Maybe it takes you into the game.

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:23.830
Maybe you tap on a fish and it says, "Do you
wanna feed it?"

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:26.030
I mean, live wallpapers are very, very powerful.

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:28.731
You can put pretty much anything you want
in it.

00:40:28.731 --> 00:40:31.220
And why not use it to drive a little bit more
user engagement?

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:35.330
Of course, you don't want to go overboard,
but hey, why not a little bit?

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:36.330
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:37.330
Yep.

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:38.330
Sounds good to me.

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:39.330
All right.

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:40.580
Final game is Crates on Deck.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:45.070
And this game has a distinct visual style,
which is fun.

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:47.630
Although this title screen is kind of cheeseball.

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:51.490
&gt;&gt;Ian: Can we just take the keyboard off,
'cause damn, that looks kinda dumb?

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:52.490
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, I know.

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:53.490
But we're only showing the HDMI.

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:54.490
For right now, that's working--.

00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:55.490
Yeah, I know.

00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:56.490
I know.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:57.490
Go back to the screen.

00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:58.490
&gt;&gt;Ian: Oh no.

00:40:58.490 --> 00:40:59.490
No.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:00.490
Shame him, Reto.

00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:07.380
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, Crates on Deck is a game that is
in the landscape of mode by default.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:10.180
Play Gravity Galleon, which is the first series
of levels.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:13.850
And so it's cool and it tells you which, you
start off with that side up and you'll see

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:20.460
why that's important because rotating the
screen actually does change the physics.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:21.720
It does change.

00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:24.000
So, we rotate the screen to the side.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.630
Now what we have to do is drag our crates
over to get that.

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:29.840
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, you just change the gravity.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:30.840
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.630
&gt;&gt;Ian: But the ocean is still in the same
place.

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:34.830
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's right.

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:36.540
That's just a backdrop.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:37.751
So, the problem is--.

00:41:37.751 --> 00:41:39.330
&gt;&gt;Ian: Just saying the world doesn't make
sense.

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:41.400
&gt;&gt;Dan: The world doesn't make sense.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:45.200
&gt;&gt;Ian: Also, this game doesn't make sense
is what I'm saying.

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.300
&gt;&gt;Dan: Oh, well that might be true.

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:50.120
But the world definitely doesn't make sense.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.800
All you have to do is see what happened in
a movie theater this week and you realize

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:53.800
the world doesn't make sense.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:54.800
&gt;&gt;Ian: Too soon.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.800
&gt;&gt;Dan: Too soon?

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:56.800
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.110
&gt;&gt;Dan: I don't, I really, I think it's clear
that doesn't make sense.

00:41:58.110 --> 00:41:59.110
All right.

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:03.940
So now we can do, is we can drag these over
and of course, I did that completely wrong

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:05.590
'cause yeah.

00:42:05.590 --> 00:42:08.900
So, actually it sucks.

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:10.312
Actually, this is, I don't know how to solve
this puzzle.

00:42:10.312 --> 00:42:12.240
&gt;&gt;Ian: I don't understand what we're--.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:14.580
Oh, you need to get the red crate onto the
X?

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:15.580
&gt;&gt;Dan: Right.

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:16.580
Yeah.

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:17.580
See, if I drag one underneath it, physics
doesn't actually work.

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:18.970
They don't drag together.

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:20.050
So I can drag it like that.

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:22.020
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, maybe they're just frictionless
crates.

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.520
&gt;&gt;Dan: They are frictionless crates.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.710
So I've gotta get it all the way over there.

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:26.780
So what I need to do is actually move, go
like that.

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:28.790
I think I like this.

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:30.330
Thinking outside of the box.

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:32.830
So, that's the way the game actually works.

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:33.830
And each one is a little puzzle.

00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:34.830
And I think it's really fun.

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:35.830
I think it's a really fun game.

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:36.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's not bad.

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:40.520
&gt;&gt;Dan: And it's fun where you have to deal
with two things, rotating the screen and moving

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:41.520
boxes.

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.520
Oh, sorry.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.750
We lost HDMI again.

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:46.420
the whole reason we're having this plugged
into the keyboard and looking lame, as you

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:52.300
can see, there we are, is so that I wouldn't
pull out the HDMI too terribly as I rotated

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:53.300
the screen.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:54.300
&gt;&gt;Ian: It didn't help all that much, but OK.

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:55.300
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, exactly.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.300
It really doesn't.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:59.370
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah, we need to have like, I would
love to have an HDMI connecter that works

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:00.590
like a BNC connecter.

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:01.590
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:02.830
I would, too.

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:07.600
These, all of these frictionless connecters
are just--.

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:12.970
&gt;&gt;Ian: So, everything that you're doing here
seems to be oriented around 90 degree rotations.

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:13.970
Is that--

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:14.970
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yes.

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:16.200
&gt;&gt;Ian: do you actually rotate it in different
ways?

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.200
&gt;&gt;Dan: No, just 90 degree rotations.

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.200
So--.

00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:19.570
&gt;&gt;Ian: I don't know how I feel about it.

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:21.280
I feel like, "Wow.

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.860
You're making me rotate my device, but--."

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.630
&gt;&gt;Dan: Which normally is not this painful
on most devices.

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:29.540
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, but, you know, still.

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.720
I mean, I feel like a little bit of an idiot.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:32.720
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.360
Well, only if you've got this keyboard attached
to it like I do.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:36.360
I mean, realistically--.

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:37.360
&gt;&gt;Ian: I don't know.

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:44.250
I mean, I have to say I'm a big fan of things
that take advantage of device rotation when

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:45.610
it's a relatively small rotation.

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:49.010
I think driving games, for instance, are,
make a lot of sense.

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:55.540
Other ones, like I remember one of my favorite
games, Bag It, you rotate the device around

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:59.760
a little bit, just shake your bag, just make
all the contents settle.

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:06.020
But when it's rotating fully all the way around,
I don't know.

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:10.580
It's a little bit tough because to tell the
truth, I actually played a lot of games with

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:13.270
the power plugged in.

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:19.700
'Cause I'll sit in bed at night and I'm charging
my device and I wanna play a game or read

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.300
some news or something and so, I've got a
cable on it.

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:25.470
And it kinda gets in the way if I'm doing
something like this.

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:26.470
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:27.470
I like it.

00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:28.470
I mean, I think that this is the kind of game
you play in a train.

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:30.980
I don't think it's the kind of game you sit
in bed and necessarily play.

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:31.980
It's really--.

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:32.980
&gt;&gt;Ian: It's not a bed game.

00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:33.980
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's not a bed game.

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:34.980
This is a puzzle game.

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:35.980
&gt;&gt;Ian: A train game.

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:38.390
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's like, each, you want to solve
each puzzle in a reasonably small amount of

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:42.520
time and make the fewest number of moves and
rotations to do that.

00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:43.520
And anyways, I think it's a clever game.

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.570
I think they're presentation is cool.

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:52.930
I would like to see them, even though I think
that this is cool, I think that their Crates

00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:56.483
on Deck could look a little bit, the title
screen here, could look a little--.

00:44:56.483 --> 00:44:58.300
&gt;&gt;Ian: Let's just show that on the screen
actually.

00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:00.160
I don't know.

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.161
I mean, let me get a closer look here.

00:45:04.161 --> 00:45:06.910
&gt;&gt;Dan: You've got the shades on.

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:10.210
&gt;&gt;Ian: That just makes things better.

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:11.350
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's true.

00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:12.500
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, OK.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:16.000
I mean, this is not, I think that this game--.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.950
&gt;&gt;Dan: It has a distinct artistic style.

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:18.950
&gt;&gt;Ian: Right.

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:23.820
It's not like, the most professional artistic
style, but that may be intentional.

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:24.940
&gt;&gt;Dan: I'm sure that it is intentional.

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.540
I actually mostly wish the logo was a little
bigger.

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:28.540
&gt;&gt;Ian: I'm not sure.

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:31.470
I'm not sure because you got all this stuff
that's a little bit playful and then you got

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:32.470
drop shadows.

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:36.270
And I asked myself, "What professional designer
would've said, 'You know what?

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:38.710
Crates on Deck needs a drop shadow.'"

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:39.910
I would've done that.

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:40.910
&gt;&gt;Dan: It's true.

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:45.040
&gt;&gt;Ian: I would've totally put a drop shadow
there, but I'm not a professional designer.

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.040
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:49.090
Also, just having buttons that don't actually
react.

00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:51.220
&gt;&gt;Ian: You have a button that doesn't do anything?

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.120
&gt;&gt;Dan: I guess it does do something.

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.280
I just didn't, I couldn't tell.

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.610
It's just turning subtle colors.

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:56.610
&gt;&gt;Ian: OK.

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:57.830
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, it is.

00:45:57.830 --> 00:45:58.830
But yeah.

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:02.830
&gt;&gt;Ian: So there's a little bit of polish that
probably could be done.

00:46:02.830 --> 00:46:10.430
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, is there anything else we wanna
talk about, other than making sure that people

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:13.160
know, if you didn't tune into the beginning,
that we're gonna be changing the format of

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.160
this show.

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.160
&gt;&gt;Ian: Yeah.

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.160
&gt;&gt;Dan: So, if--.

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.160
&gt;&gt;Ian: Well, not the format exactly.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.160
&gt;&gt;Dan: Well, not the format.

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.060
&gt;&gt;Ian: But we're still gonna drink beer, even
though I'm paying for it now and Dan isn't.

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.230
&gt;&gt;Dan: That's right.

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:22.500
And that's the way we like things.

00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:27.900
And also, so most importantly, we're gonna
be nominating different categories of games.

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:31.720
So, next week is going to be tower defense
games.

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.560
Week after that are driving games.

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.870
And week after that are J and KRPGs.

00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:37.560
&gt;&gt;Ian: And you can vote for these now.

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:43.530
You can vote for them all the way up to the
Wednesday before the day they get reviewed.

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:44.530
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:50.560
&gt;&gt;Ian: And what you should do is we would
prefer that the developer of the game nominate

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:58.110
the game and we would, we definitely encourage
you to add a Google+ link to link to your

00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:00.660
own Google+ profile.

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:04.760
Don't just put your Google+ name because a
lot of those names are duplicates.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.150
We don't know necessarily who you are.

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:10.960
If you get the URL of your Google+ profile
and put it in there, then we'll be able to

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:14.390
find you and we'll let you know if your game
is being reviewed or not.

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:18.360
And hopefully, get you on air with us live
and have a bunch of fun with you.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.020
Anyway, that didn't come out right.

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:24.750
But the other thing that we want, though,
and this is quite important, is please do

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:30.940
make sure that you have the Play store link
in your title.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.820
Don't make us guess what it is.

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:39.460
Just link to it in the Play store, link to
your Google+ profile, and then, anyone that

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:41.020
likes it please vote it up.

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.940
If you don't like it, vote it down.

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:47.731
Either way, our moderator page does allow
you to leave comments and we'd really, really

00:47:47.731 --> 00:47:52.440
appreciate it if you could leave comments
saying why you do or don't like each particular

00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:53.440
game.

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.550
&gt;&gt;Dan: Yeah.

00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:56.390
It's enough to say, "This guy is not my friend."

00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:59.520
At least that explains your one-star vote.

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:01.710
And so, but at least put that in there.

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:06.900
&gt;&gt;Reto: So, I was listening to the beginning
of the show and there was some pretty funky

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:08.810
tunes playing over the title screen.

00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:09.830
Who picked them?

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:11.200
&gt;&gt;Dan: Very good point.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:16.340
&gt;&gt;Ian: That was actually a song that I wrote
back when I had time to do such things.

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.540
It's called "Lithium."

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:21.110
And you can't get it anywhere, but maybe I'll
put it online.

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:22.110
&gt;&gt;Dan: Exactly.

00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:24.710
So, you'll at least get to hear a little bit
of it.

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:29.370
If you wanna hear it again, of course you
can replay this when the live stream goes,

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:31.680
when the archive stream goes up.

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.470
And so yeah.

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:35.910
That's another episode the Friday Review of
Games.

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:37.210
&gt;&gt;Ian: Thanks for joining us.

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:40.130
We will be back next week when we review tower
defense games.

00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:44.150
Please visit our moderator and let us know
what you think we should review.

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:46.850
Go ahead and leave comments on the YouTube
stream.

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:50.610
When we decide that we're good and drunk and
we wanna hate ourselves some, we will totally

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:51.630
read them.

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:52.770
&gt;&gt;Dan: Absolutely.

00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:55.590
&gt;&gt;Ian: Either way, we'll see you next week.

00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:56.280
Thanks a lot.
