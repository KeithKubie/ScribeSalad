1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,720
Imagine. Imagine what Eugene Sledge
that we talked about tonight.

2
00:00:05,721 --> 00:00:10,721
Imagine what he went through on Pella
in the tens of thousands of marines

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,270
that suffered debt, unimaginable horror

4
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,270
in any imagined Hackworth
who we talked about here,

5
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,150
who wrote about face assaulting
enemy positions in Korea.

6
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:31,151
And he was wounded over and over again
and all in the line and still went back

7
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:32,264
for more.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,040
And then you got Alan Seeger, the poet

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,320
who in World War One went over the
top over and over again to make his

10
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:49,680
rendezvous with death.

11
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:55,310
And there's been thousands and hundreds,

12
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:57,260
thousands,

13
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:02,260
millions of warriors that have been in
very stressful situations and faced evil

14
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:10,040
and face death much
worse than the situation

15
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,950
I'm in or urine that we
might consider stressful.

16
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,400
And I even did this when I was
overseas, when I was on deployment,

17
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:23,990
when I was a combat leader,
I was feeling stress.

18
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,640
And you know what? We took casualties and
it was awful and it was heartbreaking,

19
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,800
but there were other soldiers and warriors
throughout time that had been in much

20
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:42,530
worse situations.

21
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,790
Gettysburg or Vicksburg
or the battle, the bowls.

22
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,053
Okay.

23
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,200
In, in all those horrible situations,

24
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,640
they prove really that humans can
withstand almost lost unimaginable stress,

25
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,700
which meant to me that I could too.

26
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,470
And you can't. And,

27
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,110
and the first step for me is doing that,

28
00:02:15,111 --> 00:02:19,310
taking that look to gain some perspective.

29
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,350
And then in order to gain perspective,

30
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:27,620
you got to do something that we already
talked about. You've got to detach.

31
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,700
You've got to detach from the problems
or the stress that you're experiencing

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,440
so that you can get that
perspective of them.

33
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,463
Now

34
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,570
there's a couple of different
types of stress. Now,

35
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,410
if it's something that you can
control that's causing you stress,

36
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,490
well why aren't you getting control of it?

37
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,950
Generally it's a lack of discipline.

38
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:00,460
So you got to have the discipline
to grab control and make it happen.

39
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,800
And when I say you need
discipline for that,

40
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,750
what that means is these
stresses that you're avoiding,

41
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,780
they're not going to go
away if you avoid them.

42
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,750
So take the discipline to face the
stressful situation. Get ahead of it.

43
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:21,620
Don't be afraid of it. Now,

44
00:03:21,621 --> 00:03:24,650
there's also stress that's caused
by things that you cannot control.

45
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,540
And if you remember talking earlier
about artillery and how horrible that was

46
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:35,770
and what made it so horrible was
that there was no control over.

47
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:42,290
So if you can't control something
and you can't get control of it,

48
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,400
yeah,

49
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,400
I have to at least embrace
what you can and not,

50
00:03:49,731 --> 00:03:52,220
and I'm not saying you're going
to embrace artillery shelling,

51
00:03:52,221 --> 00:03:53,150
but I'll tell you what,

52
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,170
when it comes to things like artillery
or for us in Ramadi was ids and we could

53
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:03,650
do everything we could
do to mitigate that risk.

54
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,780
But eventually there's only so much
you can do and you cannot completely

55
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:13,460
eliminate it, but you can't control
it. So why you going to worry about it?

56
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,410
Why you going to stress about it?

57
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,810
If there's something that's completely
beyond your control, you cannot.

58
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:25,500
You've got to detach from it and not
let yourself get stressed about it.

59
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,220
And on top of that,

60
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,580
if it's something that you can't control,

61
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,710
how can you look at it
in a different light?

62
00:04:34,711 --> 00:04:38,610
How can you see it in a way that you
could actually take advantage of it?

63
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,650
How can you take

64
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,070
that stress and make it into
some kind of ally? You know, the,

65
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,870
the chaos of combat is something
that I couldn't control,

66
00:04:53,871 --> 00:04:57,320
but I had to embrace it so I could try
and figure out how to take advantage of

67
00:04:57,321 --> 00:05:00,990
it. So when it comes to stress,

68
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,410
don't fight it,

69
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,470
turn it on itself and use it. Use it.

70
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,620
Use it to make yourself sharper and more
alert and use it to make yourself think

71
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:18,720
more in, learn more, and get better.

72
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,990
And use that stress

73
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,390
as a catalyst to make yourself better.
