00:00:01.767 --> 00:00:03.633
NARRATOR: What causes
bicephaly, also

00:00:03.633 --> 00:00:06.333
known as the condition when an
animal is born with two heads?

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.233
It is fairly uncommon,
and occurs when two

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:14.734
conjoined twins never split.

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:17.533
[music playing]

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:23.734
Although the reasons
aren't clear,

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:25.967
it is most common in
turtles and snakes.

00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:28.633

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:40.066
Animals rarely
survive being born

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.967
with bicephaly, although
reptiles seem to do better.

00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:48.567
[music playing]

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:50.967
Many bicephalic
animals die young,

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:53.834
even if they do survive
birth, by attacking themselves

00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:55.100
or struggling over food.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.367
[music playing]

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.300
However, these two,
or four, reptiles

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.166
seem to be getting along,
and their internal organs

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:08.834
are normal.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.233
So they may hope to have
a long, if usual, life.
