00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
We all know we're unique individuals but

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.710
the important question is, are you normal?

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.640
For example if you're right-handed,

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.220
then yes you're in the norm.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.480
85% of the global population is as well

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.180
and even if both of your parents

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.500
are left-handed there's only a 25%

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.280
chance that you will be too but,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.740
if you can't roll your tongue you're not normal.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.700
65% to 81% of the population can.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.720
Have dark hair? Normal and only 0.5% of people have red hair.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.580
Had your wisdom teeth removed?

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.160
Around 65% of people worldwide need this done.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.180
And if you wear glasses, you

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.630
may be part of the growing norm

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.860
affecting around 2.5 billion people worldwide.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.399
It's believed that increased

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.280
indoor activity in childhood plays a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.680
major role in the risk of being nearsighted.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.440
If you're single in the U.S you're normal as well.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.120
"Phew", 50.2% of adults in America are single

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.240
which is a big shift from 1970

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.160
when only 37.4% were unwed.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.960
Worldwide however, 80% of adults have married.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.940
Regardless of marital status the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.680
average age to have a baby in the U.S

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.440
is 22.8 for women and 25.4 for men

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.500
where as somewhere like Chad the average is 17.9

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.860
while Greece is 31.2 years old.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.040
And if you just had a baby and its name is

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.140
Sophia or a variant of that,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.720
so did most other normal parents given that it's the

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.120
top baby name in nine countries.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.380
If you're having safe and protected sex you're normal too.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.920
65.8% of men between 15 to 44 report

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.060
using a condom the first time they had sex,

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.000
compared to 2006 where only 47.7% used one.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.860
This trend is even more prevalent among

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.280
teens between 15 to 19 years old with

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.300
78.1% using condoms their first time.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.320
But what age is normal to lose your virginity?

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.540
When sexual intercourse is

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.189
defined as penile to vaginal sex, the CDC

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.040
found an average age for American women

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.020
to be 17.2 years old and 16.8 for men.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.520
Have a job?

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.579
61.3% of people are employed with

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.590
the most common or normal occupation in

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.689
America being; retail jobs followed by,

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.939
cashier's, office clerks, food prep, and

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.640
serving, registered nurses, and wait staff.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.920
But if you're serving somebody who

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.140
enjoys dairy past childhood, they aren't normal.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.790
Approximately 75% of

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.530
adults in the world have some form of

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.270
lactose intolerance, meaning they

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.000
experience unpleasant digestive symptoms

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.400
from dairy products.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.640
And if they're a vegetarian, they're in the minority too,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.720
with only 4-5% in North America

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.300
and a little over 30%

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.140
in India excluding meat from their diet.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.300
Have a birthday in February? Weirdo!

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.560
Most people are born around August and September.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.320
Statisticians theorize that as

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.990
the temperature drops, people spend less

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.000
time outside, causing things to heat up

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.830
in the bedroom and nine months later,

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.080
lots of babies are born and these babies

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.150
are feeding from an average bra size in

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.820
America of 36C, an increase from the

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.020
34B, fifteen years ago.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.940
And the average erect penis size?

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.000
13 centimeters or 5 inches.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.380
Which is smaller than initial studies found

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.660
but, most of those relied on self-reporting

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.760
as opposed to actual studied measurements.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.280
If you're not exactly feeling normal now.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.920
Don't worry!

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.700
We have a whole video on why humans are weird as well.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.100
Like why does water leak

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.040
from our eyes when we're sad?

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.140
Or why do we bang our hands together to show approval?
