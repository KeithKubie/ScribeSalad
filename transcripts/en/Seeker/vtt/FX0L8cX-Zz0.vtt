00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.049
When it comes to planets, there’s a lot
more than meets the eye. Thankfully false

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.190
colour images show us what our eyes are missing.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.190
Hey guys!

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.570
Amy with you on DNews talking pretty things
in space.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.440
Thanks to decades of science missions, we’ve
learned a lot about what the planets are made

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.680
of, and that has let us figure out what their
true colours are. Mars is red because the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.390
rocks are rusty. Venus’ surface is actually
grey but we can only see the thick sulphuric

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.020
acid atmosphere that envelops the whole planet.
Uranus and Neptune are both primarily made

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.930
of methane, a gas that absorbs red light and
bounces back blue-green light. That’s why

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.559
both planets have a rich, blue tone to them.

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.340
So if these are the planets’ true colours,
why do we sometimes see them looking like

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.649
a psychedelic vision?

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.800
Because false colour is a thing that scientists
love.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.190
Across the whole electromagnetic spectrum,
the human eye can only see a small section,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.539
the so-called visible light spectrum from
violet to red that corresponds to a wavelength

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.949
range of 400 - 700 nanometers. The human eye
can’t see longer or shorter wavelengths

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.920
outside the visible range, infrared and radio
on the longer end of the spectrum and ultraviolet

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.939
on the shorter end. So scientists use tools
to see in these wavelengths.

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.080
In some cases, imaging a body in a different
wavelength reveals things we can’t see.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.430
This composite image of Saturn’s moon Titan
was taken in infrared light by the Cassini

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.790
spacecraft’s visual and infrared mapping
spectrometer. In visible light, Titan only

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.939
shows is hazy atmosphere, but in the near-infrared
we can see through the clouds to the surface.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.860
Radar is another way to look through what
we can’t in visible light. This image of

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.430
Venus was made using radar data from the Magellan
spacecraft. The radar penetrated through the

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.150
dense atmosphere to reveal Venus’ surface
topography, and this colour-coded map makes

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.750
the information easy to read.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.920
Sometimes looking in different wavelengths
is a way to see more detail. On the left is

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.869
Jupiter in true colour. On the right is a
false colour image made from three separate

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.270
pictures taken through filters focussing on
specific spectral regions: two were taken

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.290
through filters looking for the absorption
of the gas methane and one taken in a red

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.869
continuum that wouldn’t show any absorption.
The result shows details in Jupiter's atmosphere

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.560
that are invisible to the naked eye.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.420
Some false colour images are designed to highlight
differences in surface material, like this

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.760
one of Mercury. Grey in visible light owing
to the iron rocks that litter its surface,

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.730
Mercury looks vibrant when colour is used
to enhance the separation between chemical,

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.160
mineralogical, and physical variation within
the surface material.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.420
Another striking image is this one of the
dwarf planet Pluto. Red in visible light because

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.459
of tholins, this false colour image was made
using a technique called principal component

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.300
analysis that highlights the subtle color
differences between regions on the planet’s

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.300
surface.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.610
There’s a lot to learn about the planets
from all kinds of stunning images, but it’s

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.580
not the case that whoever sees something first
can claim it as their own. There is such a

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.480
thing as space law, and TestTube News talks
about it in this video right here.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:03:04.230
And there’s a lot more to space than just
planets!
