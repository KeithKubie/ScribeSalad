gonna get much more out of it if they
actually<00:17:04.809><c> do</c><00:17:05.140><c> perform</c><00:17:05.470><c> these</c><00:17:05.589><c> actions</c><00:17:05.860><c> so</c><00:17:06.730><c> we</c>

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:06.910 align:start position:0%
actually do perform these actions so we
 

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:09.419 align:start position:0%
actually do perform these actions so we

00:17:09.419 --> 00:17:09.429 align:start position:0%
wondered if we could leverage that's
 

00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
wondered if we could leverage that's
that<00:17:10.000><c> that</c><00:17:10.600><c> experience</c><00:17:11.079><c> once</c><00:17:11.439><c> we</c><00:17:11.559><c> got</c><00:17:11.709><c> to</c>

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:11.829 align:start position:0%
that that experience once we got to
 

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
that that experience once we got to
onboarding<00:17:12.189><c> so</c><00:17:12.370><c> we</c><00:17:12.490><c> turned</c><00:17:12.730><c> onboarding</c><00:17:13.270><c> into</c>

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:13.510 align:start position:0%
onboarding so we turned onboarding into
 

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
onboarding so we turned onboarding into
a<00:17:13.540><c> card-based</c><00:17:13.839><c> experience</c><00:17:14.470><c> so</c><00:17:14.890><c> the</c><00:17:14.980><c> most</c>

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:15.130 align:start position:0%
a card-based experience so the most
 

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
a card-based experience so the most
important<00:17:15.490><c> thing</c><00:17:15.640><c> it</c><00:17:15.730><c> does</c><00:17:15.850><c> is</c><00:17:15.970><c> it</c><00:17:16.150><c> focused</c><00:17:16.660><c> it</c>

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:16.870 align:start position:0%
important thing it does is it focused it
 

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
important thing it does is it focused it

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:19.150 align:start position:0%
focused them in on an a.1 experience at

focused them in on an a.1 experience at

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:20.890 align:start position:0%
the TAT a time so right so there their

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
four things and we obviously were able
 

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
four things and we obviously were able

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:26.110 align:start position:0%
to prioritize them in Torreon in order
 

00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:29.909 align:start position:0%

00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
of benefit to them and to us but the
 

00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
of benefit to them and to us but the

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:31.030 align:start position:0%
second thing is just because it was
 

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
second thing is just because it was

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:32.650 align:start position:0%
cautious because it looked card based
 

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.409 align:start position:0%
