00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:09.742
(coughing)

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:12.678
- I can't smoke the bongs,
dude, I'm too old for bongs.

00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:14.547
Okay, so we have the same exact
deck,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.084
in the same exact order, so
your top two cards should be,

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:20.720
10 of clovers and king of black
tears.

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:21.888
- I have clubs.

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:23.856
- I guess you say clubs, I
say clovers, tomato, tomato.

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:26.426
- And then a king of
black tears, what's that?

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:27.293
You mean the spade?

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:28.127
- What's a spade?

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.762
- A spade like it's like the
shape.

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:31.297
- Yeah it looks like a black
tear,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.334
or a Hershey Kiss fucking
somebody's nose.

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:37.236
- That is weirdly accurate.

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.439
- Let's deal it out, baby.

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:41.841
Okay, I hope we did it right.

00:00:41.874 --> 00:00:43.476
Do you have the king of black
tears and I have the jokers?

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:45.278
- I took all the jokers out of
my deck,

00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:46.512
that's just a rule in my family,

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:49.782
because those are like wild,
and no I have the 10 of clubs.

00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:50.616
- What's clubs?

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:51.451
- Clovers.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:53.786
- Right. Tomato tomato, again.

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:55.155
- Toma'o toma'o.

00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:57.424
Wait who's this?

00:00:58.424 --> 00:00:59.792
Tomato.

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:00.893
- Tim Curry?

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:01.861
- Nanny McPhee.

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:03.229
- Oh, Nanny McPhee, yeah.

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:05.398
- Can we just like play
solitaire individually

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:06.332
and just talk?

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.233
- I really can only play
solitaire online.

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.001
- Oh because of the like--

00:01:09.034 --> 00:01:10.603
the cards go nuts!
- Yes! The cards are like

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:11.537
Cumming.

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:12.338
You know what I mean?
- It's the most--

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:13.372
Satisfying thing.
- They're like,

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:16.175
- Just jizzing out
- Yes.

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:19.145
You just actin' out like what
that makes you feel like?

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:21.114
- Don't be mad, dude, but I
just,

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:23.816
I'm just sitting here with my
vibrator.

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:25.518
I'm not vibrating, it's not
inserted.

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:27.453
- We've had this conversation
before,

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:30.256
about how I would like to
know when that was going on.

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:31.691
- I'm not building up to
something,

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.326
this does not have a narrative
to it.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.128
It's the same as if I had a
heating pad.

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:37.663
- I have a heating pad on the
small of my back right now.

00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:39.065
- Well you're also a pervert.

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:42.935
- I think we need a second
to think about this.

00:01:42.968 --> 00:01:45.571
- Okay I'm really sorry
I betrayed your trust.

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:47.306
- It's all right, I'll text
you in like a little bit.

00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:48.341
- I hope your not mad at me.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:49.775
All right, bye.

00:01:49.808 --> 00:01:50.877
- Bye McPhee.

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:58.351
(vibrating)
