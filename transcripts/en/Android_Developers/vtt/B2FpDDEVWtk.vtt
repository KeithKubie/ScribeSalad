&gt;&gt; GRACE: Hi. My name is Grace. I work on
the Android Browser. Today, I'm going to show

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.570
you some tricks on Android Browser. You want
to go visit your friend via Google. You found

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.720
that address on the website but it's not highlighted,
so you cannot click it. Don't worry. This

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.630
is Android Browser. You just need to click
the address. It will take you directly to

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:30.380
the map. Hit the back, you're back to the
browser. Type the phone number, you go to

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.960
the dialer. You can call the phone number.
Now, you know, in the bottom of the browser

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.760
you want to scroll to the top. Instead of
skip scrolling, you can use a quick zoom.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.810
Just tap here and then move this window all
the way up to here and then release your finger.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.350
Walla, you're on the top. There, you notice
your paragraph, half of it is off the screen.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.109
Don't worry. Tap on the text, it will move
to the middle of the screen.
