00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.530
Do you ever get that feeling in your gut that something is the right or wrong decision-

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.549
But you don’t know why? Our intuition is often deemed as mysticism or linked with telepathy

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:15.259
and premonitions, but is there a science behind it? Should you trust your intuition?

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.870
Understanding something immediately without conscious reasoning is less about seeing into

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.810
the future and more to do with pattern recognition.
If I showed you this layout of an actual chess

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:32.230
game for 5 seconds, could you reproduce it?
Studies show that most chess novices can recreate

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.730
25% of it, but chess masters do it with 95%
accuracy. However, if the task is repeated

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.719
with the pieces in completely random positions,
both the novices and masters only recall 25%.

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.610
The masters don’t have photographic memory
- they simply use their knowledge and intuition,

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.750
based on patterns they have seen over years
of practice!

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.051
Our brain processes information through both
slow and fast thinking. For example, this

00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:02.390
math problem with cause a stress response,
and your brain will kick into slow thinking

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.619
to solve it. But this picture involves fast
thinking; understanding the emotion of sadness

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.820
is an immediate brain response. And this fast
thinking is where intuition lies.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.210
In a similar study on the Japanese board game
Shogi, participants were asked to solve a

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.509
checkmate move within one second. With no
time for conscious analysis, brain scans showed

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.090
no activation of the cortex in expert Shogi
players, the part of the brain responsible

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.670
for conscious thought. Instead, the basal
ganglia, which is linked to habit formation

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.880
and automatic behaviours was triggered.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.060
Interestingly, when it comes to complex decisions
like buying a house, while many believe careful

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.140
thought with a pro’s and con’s list is
best, one study actually found that participants

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.189
made better choices when they went with their
snap decision. It turns out we often only

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.700
take into account a subset of relevant information
which can lead to us weighing the importance

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.310
of each attribute inaccurately. The study
also found that those who trusted their gut

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.119
were more satisfied with their decisions in
the long run than those who thought through

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.939
the process carefully. However, when making
simple purchases like what toothpaste to buy

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.280
- where variables are not as complex - the
study found intentional thought and research

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.479
to be helpful.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.641
Think you can identify the sound of your own
voice? Surprisingly, after listening to a

00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:18.100
recording of many voices in succession, including
their own, 75% of participants in a study

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.950
made a mistake recognizing their own voice.
But the most fascinating part is that their

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.290
skin conductance was also measured, and these
levels went much higher when their own voice

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.540
came on - even though they didn’t consciously
recognize their voice, suggesting they had

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.590
ignored their intuition which knew the correct
answer first.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.290
This same phenomenon was shown in a card game
that uses 4 decks of cards. The participants

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.450
would select a card from any pile which would
either be good or bad. Without them knowing

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.360
at first, decks A&amp;B had more bad cards, while
C&amp;D had more good cards. After choosing 10

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.159
cards, the participants had no idea what was
happening, but by 50 cards most would suspect

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.819
that some decks were better than others. Finally
after 80 cards, they could articulate that

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.340
decks A&amp;B were bad and C&amp;D were good. But
again, even before they knew it consciously,

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.010
their skin conductance levels would rise as
early as the first 10 cards in response to

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.290
reaching for pile A&amp;B. Their skin was already
making unconscious signals about the right

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.910
choice before their conscious mind did. Of
course, their skin didn’t KNOW the correct

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.269
answer, but their unconscious mind began understanding
patterns before their conscious mind had.

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.739
So is following your intuition always the
route to go? Not in cases of empathy, it turns

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.769
out. A study involving over 900 participants
found that when it came to accurately interpreting

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.500
and understanding the feelings of others,
systematic thinking or carefully analyzing

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.819
the information available before making a
decision was more successful than going with

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:45.970
what feels right.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.860
Relying on our past experiences is essentially
how our intuition is formed and it has helped

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.269
our ancestors determine friend from foe. However
we were given two systems of thinking - fast

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.770
and slow, and we recommend that it’s best
to follow them both.
