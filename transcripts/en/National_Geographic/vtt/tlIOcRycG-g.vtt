( intro music )

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:12.278
Voiceover: Nyiragongo is a real
dangerous volcano.

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:14.848
2 million people
living around there

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:18.084
could suffocate
of carbon dioxide,

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:20.052
but in the night you realize

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:22.154
there's more behind that curtain

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:25.124
of steam and organic smoke.

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:26.559
For me there were no doubts

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.360
I wanted to go down there

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.929
and it was a very special moment

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.464
to be so close to hell.

Carsten: Thank you for
your interest this evening

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:43.776 line:0%
and I would say we
just begin.

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:46.846
This is me in the
tender age of 15 years

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:50.316
and I was already
obsessed with volcanoes.

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:52.218
I bugged my parents

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:55.455
until they went with me
to Etna in Sicily.

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:59.225
When I looked in
the big<i> fucina grande</i>

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:00.994
I was kind of lost.

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:03.996
I changed my life
and I got the desire

00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:07.266
to always climb down
into these craters.

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:10.403
And it took me until '99

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.371
for my ultimate volcano kick

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:14.907
when I directed
an expedition to Vanuatu

00:01:14.907 --> 00:01:17.810
into a deep, live abyss
was probably

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.314
the most violent lava
lake in the world.

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:24.983
It's about 1500 feet deep

00:01:24.983 --> 00:01:26.452
and it was a very special moment

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:28.621
to be so close to hell.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:29.956
( laughter )

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:34.627
You felt like directly
on the magma chamber.

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:37.864
You felt the vibrations,
the shocks.

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:39.632
It was like a big
washing machine

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:41.534
and a heavy gear.

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:43.002
It was just amazing

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:45.705
and bombs were
flying around you,

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:47.306
so I got so addicted

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:48.508
I always wanted to see

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:50.643
the biggest lava
lake in the world.

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:54.180
And this is the travel
I want to take you on.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.917
I would take you now
into the heart of Africa.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:00.953
Into the Democratic
Republic of Congo

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:05.524
and worse, into the
war-driven Kivu Province.

00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:08.661
Now I will do
an excursion to 2002.

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:11.931 line:0%
There was a big
eruption of Nyiragongo.

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:16.135 line:0%
8 mile fissure opened
and the lava lake drained

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:18.537 line:0%
and flooded Goma City

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:22.141 line:0%
and 4500 houses were destroyed,

00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:26.579
14 villages, 170 people
lost their lives

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.515
and we had 400,000 refugees,

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:31.250
so that means Nyiragongo

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.987
is a real dangerous volcano

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:36.255
and it has very
little monitoring

00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:37.890
because the Congolese,

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.627
they love to recycle the
instruments of the scientists.

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:44.430
There are solar
panels and batteries.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.102
All things they can
use in a better way.

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:52.471 line:0%
A few parts of the city
are life threatening.

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:54.406 line:0%
Invisible gas springs

00:02:54.406 --> 00:02:57.476 line:0%
become like natural traps
for kids and animals

00:02:57.476 --> 00:02:59.345
and this is strictly unmarked.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:02.581
You have these gas traps
filled with carbon dioxide.

00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:05.251
These are called<i> mazukus</i> .

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:08.187 line:0%
Even worse are the dangers
of the Lake Kivu.

00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:11.057 line:0%
It's one of the world's
exploding lakes.

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:12.625
There are only 3 of them

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:15.428
and Lake Kivu is
by far the biggest.

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:17.864
In its steps there
are huge quantities

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:21.300
of gases of carbon
dioxide and methane.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.905
Over half a billion
tons are stored there

00:03:25.905 --> 00:03:29.842
and an earthquake
or a volcanic eruption

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:32.445
might destroy the equilibrium

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:34.981
and it could pop up
like a shaken bottle

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:36.748
of carbonated water.

00:03:36.748 --> 00:03:38.951
So, it's very, very dangerous.

00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:42.154
So you could fear
tsunamis or the people--

00:03:42.154 --> 00:03:44.557
2 million people
living around there

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:46.960
could suffocate
of carbon dioxide.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.695
A limnic catastrophe
of the lake

00:03:49.695 --> 00:03:53.233
would be really unimaginable.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:56.969
It happens every thousand years,
every millennium,

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:00.873
that all life
is extinct around that lake.

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:03.008
But the surrounding
of the volcano

00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:05.244
is very fertile, so you find

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:07.480
almost everything
you can imagine;

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.584
wood, fruits, all
sorts of vegetables.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:14.887
People already cut
the wood in the fields

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:17.689
and then this is
transported down

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:20.960
with very strange wooden bikes.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.029
They are called<i> tshukudus</i>

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:26.398
and they are loaded
up to 1500 pounds.

00:04:26.398 --> 00:04:30.603
And so they race down these
gentle slopes of these volcanoes

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:34.340
and provide the markets
with all you can imagine.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.043
So, A<i> tshukudu</i>
can do quite a good living.

00:04:38.043 --> 00:04:41.146
It's like a truck
driver in our society.

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:43.749
They carry down everything
like this charcoal.

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:46.152
It's a wanted commodity in Goma

00:04:46.152 --> 00:04:47.753
because they cook with it,

00:04:47.753 --> 00:04:51.123
but there are uncounted
illegal charcoal kiln

00:04:51.123 --> 00:04:54.160
in the forest and it's
an immediate threat

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.062
to the trees down there.

00:04:57.062 --> 00:05:00.132
Despite, there are these layers
of methane

00:05:00.132 --> 00:05:02.301
in the depths of the lake

00:05:02.301 --> 00:05:04.003
so if that would
be better organized,

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:05.538
you could directly save

00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:09.341
the mountain gorillas living
around these volcanoes

00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:12.144
because these
forests are the last wild

00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:16.182
remaining areas where
these mountain gorillas survive.

00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:19.385
Here you see the giant
flanks of this volcano.

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:21.453
It's a huge caldera

00:05:21.453 --> 00:05:24.256
with a diameter
of 3 quarters of a mile.

00:05:24.256 --> 00:05:26.325
These are the 1st
views for us down there

00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:27.693
to the biggest lava lake

00:05:27.693 --> 00:05:29.728
so we have to make our thoughts

00:05:29.728 --> 00:05:31.897
how we get down there,

00:05:31.897 --> 00:05:34.900
but 1st we have to get up there.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.006
So, Nyiragongo is more
than 11,000 feet high

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:41.841
and we had to carry a lot.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:43.709
We have to carry
everything up there;

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:48.180
water, food, scientific
gear, climbing gear.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.117
So we needed 107
porters to do all that.

00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:53.786
They were very happy.

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:56.055
For them it's
a great opportunity

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:58.224
and they were amazing.

00:05:58.224 --> 00:06:00.192
They could do, in a day,

00:06:00.192 --> 00:06:02.395
a months salary so these jobs

00:06:02.395 --> 00:06:05.564
were really seeked
by the porters.

00:06:05.564 --> 00:06:07.567
And we had, of course, guards

00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:10.470
because this is kind
of a conflict area

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.407
and the mountain is always
taken again by rebels

00:06:15.407 --> 00:06:18.378
and it happened
short after our expedition

00:06:18.378 --> 00:06:21.914
that the mountain was taken
by the rebels again

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:24.550
and I think it's still
not freed.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.617
I mean, the national park

00:06:25.617 --> 00:06:28.320
doesn't have control over it

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.358
and more than 130 rangers
have been killed

00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:34.894
in the last 15 years.

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:37.663
So, it's a big problem.

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:40.600
But our porters have
been in a very good mood

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.635
up to the top where
it was quite cold.

00:06:43.635 --> 00:06:46.171
It's getting down to
freezing temperatures

00:06:46.171 --> 00:06:47.806
because of the altitude

00:06:47.806 --> 00:06:51.143
and then you see, in the first
moment, not very much.

00:06:51.143 --> 00:06:53.546
I mean, everything is
filled up with gas

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:54.513
and we thought,

00:06:54.513 --> 00:06:57.450
"Well, that's not
a nice surprise."

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.386
I expected to see something
glowing and whatever,

00:07:01.386 --> 00:07:03.455
but in the night you realize,

00:07:03.455 --> 00:07:06.058
"Well, there's more
behind that curtain

00:07:06.058 --> 00:07:08.394
of steam and organic smoke."

00:07:08.394 --> 00:07:10.997
And then it opens
and then you see

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:13.466
it's like a giant theater.

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:15.801
You see this
incredible lava lake

00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:20.339
illuminating the steep walls
of that caldera

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:24.110
and we built up
our base camp on the summit.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.611
This is our cooking tent.

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:28.180
Always was this
incredible view down there

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.516
and it's always
changing the surface

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:32.617
of that lava lake so it's

00:07:32.617 --> 00:07:34.921
a really incredible spectacle.

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:37.990
This is Ken Sims
our volcanologist

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:41.227
and he was a former
mountain guide

00:07:41.227 --> 00:07:44.363
and he was doing
all the rope work

00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:45.664
to get down there.

00:07:45.664 --> 00:07:47.566
We looked to the 1st terrace,

00:07:47.566 --> 00:07:50.135
which is only a small relict.

00:07:50.135 --> 00:07:52.104
The 2nd one was much bigger

00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:54.707
and the 3rd one was a lava lake

00:07:54.707 --> 00:07:56.675
situated in the midst.

00:07:56.675 --> 00:07:59.345
And this is where we aim to.

00:07:59.345 --> 00:08:01.213
We wanted to stay there
one week.

00:08:01.213 --> 00:08:04.216
The scientists had a lot
of experiments lined up

00:08:04.216 --> 00:08:06.318
and here we constructed Tyrolean

00:08:06.318 --> 00:08:09.355
to get all the scientific
gear down there.

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:13.525
So, we made a campsite
on the 2nd terrace

00:08:13.525 --> 00:08:16.461
which had its advantages

00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:18.263
because it had ground heating.

00:08:18.263 --> 00:08:20.499
It was quite warm
( audience laughing )

00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:23.736
and very pleasant
compared to the summit

00:08:23.736 --> 00:08:26.038
and, of course, we were
closer to the lava lake.

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:29.108
So it was absolutely
mesmerizing.

00:08:29.108 --> 00:08:33.245
So I knew that would be my home
for the next week

00:08:33.245 --> 00:08:35.013
and I was really happy

00:08:35.013 --> 00:08:39.518
to finally be so close
to the volcanism

00:08:39.518 --> 00:08:42.321
and we observed this
kind of miniature

00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:45.057
plate tectonics in the lake,

00:08:45.057 --> 00:08:47.292
so it was really amazing

00:08:47.292 --> 00:08:50.495
just to observe what's going on.

00:08:50.495 --> 00:08:52.264
The hottest lava in the world,

00:08:52.264 --> 00:08:54.399
2400 degree Fahrenheit.

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:56.735
That's probably the reason why

00:08:56.735 --> 00:08:59.571
this lava lake is so big.

00:08:59.571 --> 00:09:02.174
And here the scientists
are measuring

00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:05.077
the radon which comes
from really big taps

00:09:05.077 --> 00:09:07.313
from the magma chamber

00:09:07.313 --> 00:09:10.749
and has a decay
rate of 3.8 days.

00:09:10.749 --> 00:09:13.785
So they can make very
valuable analysis

00:09:13.785 --> 00:09:16.755
about the lava of this volcano,

00:09:16.755 --> 00:09:19.357
but suddenly
the scientists realized,

00:09:19.357 --> 00:09:21.627
"Wow! There could be overflows

00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:23.896
off that lava lake
( audience laughing )

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:25.830
and it could flood
the 3rd terrace

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.066
and it could flood quite hefty

00:09:28.066 --> 00:09:30.402
and you don't know
exactly how stable

00:09:30.402 --> 00:09:33.238
these cinder cones of
that lava lake are."

00:09:33.238 --> 00:09:36.341
And that kind of a relative way

00:09:36.341 --> 00:09:39.044
that their will to go down
to the 3rd terrace.

00:09:39.044 --> 00:09:40.879
( audience laughing )

00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:42.715
So, for me, there were no doubts

00:09:42.715 --> 00:09:45.317
I want to go down there
and that was my goal,

00:09:45.317 --> 00:09:47.552
but the discussions came up

00:09:47.552 --> 00:09:51.757
and the scientists decided to go

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:55.627
already after 1 day and
I couldn't believe that

00:09:55.627 --> 00:09:57.229
so I have a little sequence

00:09:57.229 --> 00:09:59.632
with the scientists.

00:10:00.966 --> 00:10:02.501
Carsten on the radio:
Well, I still would like

00:10:02.501 --> 00:10:04.136
go down to the 3rd terrace

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:06.605
and I just wonder
what you are up to

00:10:06.605 --> 00:10:08.574
and what your plans are.
( beep )

00:10:08.574 --> 00:10:11.110
Man: Probably won't be
going down

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.744
to the 3rd terrace.

00:10:12.744 --> 00:10:13.846
( whispering ) Jesus,
he really wants me

00:10:13.846 --> 00:10:14.946
to go down, doesn't he?

00:10:14.946 --> 00:10:16.582
Man 2: I'm staying out of it.

00:10:17.549 --> 00:10:18.884
Carsten: Well, you need a lot of

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:21.453
ingredients for a good
volcano picture.

00:10:21.453 --> 00:10:22.555
You need good activity.

00:10:22.555 --> 00:10:24.056
You need good visibility.

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:25.858
You have to have patience

00:10:25.858 --> 00:10:29.695
and you have to have to
outsit the right situations.

00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:32.298
Well, I had a big problem

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.533
and you see, I mean.

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:37.103
It was really not
a nice weather situation.

00:10:37.103 --> 00:10:40.272
I admit the weather
was really poor the 1st day.

00:10:40.272 --> 00:10:42.574
It was acid rain and you almost

00:10:42.574 --> 00:10:44.710
couldn't breathe because that's

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.212
the so-called rock,
the volcanic smoke.

00:10:47.212 --> 00:10:49.348
Usually you take gas masks,

00:10:49.348 --> 00:10:51.617
but if you are
hard work like here

00:10:51.617 --> 00:10:53.985
and you have to
carry up equipment

00:10:53.985 --> 00:10:56.755
you can't breathe through
the gas mask all the time

00:10:56.755 --> 00:10:58.491
because of the resistance.

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:01.827
But everyone left
after that 1 day

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:04.195
and even my friend
and assistant,

00:11:04.195 --> 00:11:07.132
he became ill and had to go up,

00:11:07.132 --> 00:11:10.035
so I had no other choice
than to stay down there.

00:11:10.035 --> 00:11:12.404
( audience laughing )

00:11:12.404 --> 00:11:15.040
Well, and I had
nothing better to do

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.575
than to photograph myself.

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:18.744
( audience laughing )

00:11:18.744 --> 00:11:20.379
But then I looked up

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:22.114
and looked at this beautiful

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:26.552
kind of vague lit
clouds in the moonlight

00:11:26.552 --> 00:11:28.320
and I thought, "Well,
this is wonderful

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.022
to have the whole
crater for myself."

00:11:31.022 --> 00:11:34.393
But these were my only
buddies down there.

00:11:34.393 --> 00:11:36.528
Two white necked ravens

00:11:36.528 --> 00:11:38.697
and they immediately
stole my food

00:11:38.697 --> 00:11:41.266
when they realized
my tent was open,

00:11:41.266 --> 00:11:43.002
but I was glad for them

00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:46.505
because otherwise it's
kind of a death zone.

00:11:46.505 --> 00:11:48.941
Insects fly in the night
to the lava lake

00:11:48.941 --> 00:11:50.209
attracted by the light

00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:51.944
and then they burn somehow
their wings

00:11:51.944 --> 00:11:53.478
and then they fall down.

00:11:53.478 --> 00:11:55.747
Everything is covered
by dead animals.

00:11:55.747 --> 00:11:57.115
( audience laughing )

00:11:57.115 --> 00:11:58.951
So the next day I climbed up

00:11:58.951 --> 00:12:01.286
to the 1st terrace
to discuss with Ken.

00:12:01.286 --> 00:12:03.622
Voiceover: Unwilling to
take the risk himself,

00:12:03.622 --> 00:12:06.925
Ken asks Carsten to
collect the 0H sample

00:12:06.925 --> 00:12:08.427
from the 3rd terrace.

00:12:08.427 --> 00:12:12.164
They will need
to set two lines.

00:12:12.164 --> 00:12:13.632
One to get in,

00:12:13.632 --> 00:12:16.035
( music )

00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:19.471
the other one to get out
if the lava overflows.

00:12:19.471 --> 00:12:22.741
( music )

00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:23.909
Up on the summit,

00:12:23.909 --> 00:12:25.811
Ken will spot
the levels of the lava

00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:28.414
for the climbers
on the final terrace

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:31.016
who can't see the surface
of the lake themselves

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:34.286
because they are below it.

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:35.387
( radio chatter )

00:12:35.387 --> 00:12:38.323
Ken: Do you see him?

00:12:38.323 --> 00:12:42.762
The activity is over on
your side of the wall there.

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:47.533
He's going back down.

00:12:52.104 --> 00:12:53.139
Whoa!

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.041
Good job. Good job.

00:12:56.908 --> 00:12:58.843
Carsten on the radio:
It's incredible.

00:12:58.843 --> 00:13:02.481
I love it. I love it. I love it.

00:13:04.816 --> 00:13:07.786
Carsten: I have been very,
very lucky

00:13:07.786 --> 00:13:09.588
as you saw in the film.

00:13:09.588 --> 00:13:12.124
We climbed down to
the 3rd terrace.

00:13:12.124 --> 00:13:14.760
That's the view if you are
down on the 3rd terrace.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.396
Actually you can't
see into the lava lake

00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:19.397
up there so it's
kind of mandatory

00:13:19.397 --> 00:13:21.266
that you have to
climb that cinder cone.

00:13:21.266 --> 00:13:23.869
( audience laughing )

00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:26.104
And then you have
these surprises

00:13:26.104 --> 00:13:28.073
because there's something like

00:13:28.073 --> 00:13:32.544
and infra-sound and it
shakes your whole body,

00:13:32.544 --> 00:13:34.246
but you can't listen to it.

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:35.314
It's very, very strange.

00:13:35.314 --> 00:13:36.915
I have never
experienced that before.

00:13:36.915 --> 00:13:38.750
I imagine the whole crater

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.319
is like a loud speaker

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:42.354
and the membrane
is the lava lake

00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:44.622
and if there are
big bursts of gas

00:13:44.622 --> 00:13:46.892
you get the kind of resonance

00:13:46.892 --> 00:13:48.527
and it shakes your body.

00:13:48.527 --> 00:13:49.894
So very, very strange

00:13:49.894 --> 00:13:51.930
and you feel tiny, tiny, tiny.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.765
I mean, you see here my friend

00:13:53.765 --> 00:13:55.867
on the cinder cone

00:13:55.867 --> 00:13:58.703
and the lava lake is
huge compared to that

00:13:58.703 --> 00:14:02.240
and the energy going
away from that lava lake

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.311
is unbelievable and
hard to imagine.

00:14:06.311 --> 00:14:08.480
So it's a huge energy source

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.048
and there are these gas bubbles

00:14:10.048 --> 00:14:12.517
coming out of that
lake and ripping apart

00:14:12.517 --> 00:14:14.186
this liquid stone.

00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:16.421
Bubbles maybe 80 feet high

00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:18.823
and one day later Ken
came really down

00:14:18.823 --> 00:14:20.825
and brought us the thermal suit.

00:14:21.192 --> 00:14:23.161
I was testing it first.

00:14:23.161 --> 00:14:24.796
I have to say
these thermal suits

00:14:24.796 --> 00:14:26.331
are quite uncomfortable

00:14:26.331 --> 00:14:28.267
because they are insulating.

00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:31.803
It's very warm even if
it's not warm outside,

00:14:31.803 --> 00:14:35.074
and you have a very
restricted view,

00:14:35.074 --> 00:14:36.708
so very limited.

00:14:36.708 --> 00:14:39.344
So if there is lava flow

00:14:39.344 --> 00:14:42.447
or if bombs are flying
it's quite dangerous,

00:14:42.447 --> 00:14:44.616
but you won't
believe the next day,

00:14:44.616 --> 00:14:46.952
although Ken came down
to the 3rd terrace,

00:14:46.952 --> 00:14:48.987
actually that's him here

00:14:48.987 --> 00:14:50.823
on the top of the cinder cone

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:53.359
and he probably
won't forget that

00:14:53.359 --> 00:14:54.759
for his life.

00:14:54.759 --> 00:14:56.261
( laughing )

00:14:56.261 --> 00:14:58.664
I would have loved to
stay a much longer time.

00:14:58.664 --> 00:15:00.666
Unfortunately, we
were restricted

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:02.935
and we had to go up again

00:15:02.935 --> 00:15:05.303
and made it up to
the 2nd terrace

00:15:05.303 --> 00:15:08.607
to all these kind of
very difficult parts

00:15:08.607 --> 00:15:11.676
with the 2nd
terrace taking apart

00:15:11.676 --> 00:15:13.545
and there's a lot of rock fall.

00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:15.948
This is my last picture of this

00:15:15.948 --> 00:15:19.084
nasty volcanic smoke walk

00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:21.987
as beautiful as it can be.

00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:24.790
I hope to
see you maybe again

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.058
in the future.

00:15:26.058 --> 00:15:27.425
Thank you very much.

00:15:27.425 --> 00:15:29.728
( applause )

00:15:29.728 --> 00:15:31.697
( music )
