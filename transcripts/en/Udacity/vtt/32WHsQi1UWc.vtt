00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.160
When I look at this graph, one of my takeaways is just sort of,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.170
just looking at the, the slopes and

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.680
I can see that, you know, five of the seven categories are doing really well.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.060
And so, the team's doing really well in those.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Compared to the company, let's say overall.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.608
But, for two of them.

00:00:15.608 --> 00:00:19.408
Looks like management and career development not so much.

00:00:19.408 --> 00:00:23.380
so, I think it's really interesting how you mention that there's so

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.822
few data points, yet the rankings are there and it's really easy to see sort of

00:00:27.822 --> 00:00:31.170
like how the team is doing in comparison to the company.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.433
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's actually a whole lot of information.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.338
&gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In a relatively straightforward manner.

00:00:35.338 --> 00:00:35.838
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
