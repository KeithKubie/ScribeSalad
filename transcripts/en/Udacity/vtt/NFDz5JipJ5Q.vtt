00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.910
The problem here is that the scale used

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.860
here is inconsistent. Four stick people are originally used

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.280
to represent 43,000 nurses. However, 28 stick people

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.565
are then used to represent an increase of just

00:00:12.565 --> 00:00:17.040
3,000 nurses. And then, just after that, about

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.300
eight stick people are used to represent an increase

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.300
of only about 1,000 nurses. As you can see,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.870
this growth doesn't follow a linear or logarithmic scale.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.620
It's just kind of random, and it's very confusing to the reader.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.460
You'd look at this and think that the number of nurses exploded, but

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.460
it really only increased by 3,000. We can only assume that some kind

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.670
of mistake was made here, that

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.400
this doesn't efficiently communicate what's actually happening.
