00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.566
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good morning.

00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:05.616
&gt;&gt;Dr Darling-Hammond: We respond to the
environment in which we find ourselves

00:00:05.886 --> 00:00:08.356
in a variety of ways
that affect our learning.

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:16.626
When children are in a calm, peaceful
environment with aspects of nature

00:00:16.626 --> 00:00:19.596
around them, it builds
brain architecture

00:00:19.596 --> 00:00:21.096
and enables them to learn more.

00:00:21.826 --> 00:00:28.316
We are barraged with information
and emotion all of the time

00:00:28.316 --> 00:00:31.936
and our brain is trying to sort
things out and figure out how

00:00:31.936 --> 00:00:34.086
to put all of that in place.

00:00:34.986 --> 00:00:39.046
And in order to be able to learn,
we need a certain amount of routine

00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:44.456
and consistency and calm so that our
brain can focus on what's important

00:00:45.026 --> 00:00:48.756
and not have to focus on
everything that is new

00:00:48.756 --> 00:00:51.116
and engaging all at the same time.

00:00:56.866 --> 00:00:59.836
&gt;&gt;Michelle: The environment has a
large impact on student learning.

00:00:59.836 --> 00:01:01.000
&gt;&gt;Resource Officer: Good morning.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.096
&gt;&gt;Michelle: We want school
to be a safe, welcoming place

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:08.146
where kids want to come here every day.

00:01:08.316 --> 00:01:09.016
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Hi.

00:01:09.346 --> 00:01:10.996
&gt;&gt;Michelle: They could be
coming in in the morning

00:01:10.996 --> 00:01:12.926
with lots of different emotions--

00:01:12.976 --> 00:01:15.706
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We're so glad that
you're here this morning.

00:01:15.706 --> 00:01:18.976
&gt;&gt;Michelle: -- that we
want to help mitigate

00:01:18.976 --> 00:01:21.366
so that they feel safe
and secure at school.

00:01:21.636 --> 00:01:23.556
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good morning, Jolene.

00:01:23.986 --> 00:01:26.286
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We're glad you're here.
Let me tell you what's happening

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:26.846
this morning.

00:01:26.846 --> 00:01:28.716
We have pancakes for
breakfast and pears.

00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:33.006
&gt;&gt;Dr Darling-Hammond: It's very
important that school be a reliable,

00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:37.276
consistent routine place where
you know what to count on,

00:01:37.276 --> 00:01:39.016
where things are somewhat predictable.

00:01:39.096 --> 00:01:42.426
Not so much that they become boring
but so much that they give you

00:01:42.426 --> 00:01:47.496
that calm feeling that I know what
it's about, I know how to participate.

00:01:47.576 --> 00:01:51.046
And that actually opens up the
opportunity for more learning.

00:01:56.926 --> 00:02:00.866
&gt;&gt;Michelle: So some of the ways that we
do that are creating a calm environment

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:02.386
where breakfast is ready for them.

00:02:02.386 --> 00:02:05.506
The teacher's at the door
with a greeting, a hug.

00:02:05.506 --> 00:02:07.750
I missed you, I'm so happy 
you're here.

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:12.936
We also include a lot of natural
elements in our classrooms.

00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:18.176
We have lots of plants,
which keeps the air purified.

00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:23.936
We use essential oils to help
students have calm, relaxed bodies.

00:02:24.576 --> 00:02:26.386
People want to come into
a room that smells great.

00:02:26.886 --> 00:02:29.386
And so, we turn that on in the morning
before they get here and that's part

00:02:29.386 --> 00:02:31.716
of creating that welcoming environment.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.316
&gt;&gt;Lindsey: Meeting students'
needs for, like,

00:02:38.316 --> 00:02:40.716
releasing physical energy is important.

00:02:41.336 --> 00:02:46.276
Making sure that kids' bodies feel
good is a really important step

00:02:46.276 --> 00:02:48.746
to making sure they're brains
are in a good place for learning.

00:02:48.956 --> 00:02:51.456
Water's available to all of
our students all the time.

00:02:51.456 --> 00:02:53.246
They all get breakfast.
They all get lunch.

00:02:53.246 --> 00:02:54.686
They're going to movement class.

00:02:54.726 --> 00:02:57.016
They're having time outside
in the backyard,

00:02:57.016 --> 00:03:01.416
doing a lot of gross motor play so that
their bodies are getting what they need.

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:03.316
&gt;&gt;Student: Oh, yeah.

00:03:03.446 --> 00:03:07.416
&gt;&gt;Dr Darling-Hammond: We also know now
that the environment matters greatly

00:03:07.936 --> 00:03:10.956
to the evolution of individual
human beings.

00:03:11.476 --> 00:03:14.256
And we can create environments
that are productive,

00:03:14.826 --> 00:03:19.386
that have lots of opportunities
for exploration and learning,

00:03:19.386 --> 00:03:22.116
because that's how human
beings grow their brains,

00:03:22.116 --> 00:03:23.846
as well as grow their knowledge.

00:03:23.956 --> 00:03:25.986
&gt;&gt;Michelle: We want them to
be engaged and to love it

00:03:25.986 --> 00:03:27.456
and to not want to go home.

00:03:27.966 --> 00:03:32.146
So we have incredible opportunities
and provocations at centers for them

00:03:32.146 --> 00:03:35.816
to have agency and use
their hands, create,

00:03:35.816 --> 00:03:38.606
iterate on their creations,
fail, and keep trying.

00:03:39.216 --> 00:03:42.076
And part of that helps
keep them both engaged and,

00:03:42.076 --> 00:03:44.046
at the end of the day,
man, school is really fun.

00:03:44.046 --> 00:03:45.816
I can't wait to come back tomorrow.

00:03:46.046 --> 00:03:49.040
That's the feeling that we
want the students to have.
