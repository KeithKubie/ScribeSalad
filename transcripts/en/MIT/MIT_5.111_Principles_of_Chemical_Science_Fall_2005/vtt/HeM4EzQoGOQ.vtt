00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.773
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon,

00:00:18.773 --> 00:00:23.050
everybody.
I am going to start this

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:30.094
morning, or this afternoon,
with a question we had at the

00:00:30.094 --> 00:00:35.000
bottom of last lecture's
handout.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.644
But we are not going to
actually answer this question

00:00:38.644 --> 00:00:40.886
until the end of today's
lecture.

00:00:40.886 --> 00:00:44.951
Let's look at what the question
is, and you can be thinking

00:00:44.951 --> 00:00:47.894
about it during today's lecture.
All right.

00:00:47.894 --> 00:00:49.857
The question is,
vitamin B12,

00:00:49.857 --> 00:00:53.431
which we have already mentioned
once in this course,

00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:56.164
it has a large negative redox
potential.

00:00:56.164 --> 00:01:01.000
The standard reduction
potential is large and negative.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.489
How does it get reduced in the
body?

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.879
Let's think about the problem
here.

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:13.163
As we learned last time,
compounds with large negative

00:01:13.163 --> 00:01:17.051
reduction potentials are hard to
reduce.

00:01:17.051 --> 00:01:22.534
They are easy to oxidize,
which makes them good reducing

00:01:22.534 --> 00:01:26.024
agents, but they are hard to
reduce.

00:01:26.024 --> 00:01:30.211
And vitamin B12 has a large
negative value,

00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:35.208
so it is hard to reduce.
But, in the body,

00:01:35.208 --> 00:01:38.977
it needs to be reduced to be
active for one particular

00:01:38.977 --> 00:01:41.536
enzyme.
It needs to be reduced but it

00:01:41.536 --> 00:01:44.736
is hard to reduce,
so what does the body do to

00:01:44.736 --> 00:01:46.869
compensate?
How does this work?

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.068
I am going to answer this at
the end of class,

00:01:50.068 --> 00:01:54.263
but let me first tell you in
the beginning of class why this

00:01:54.263 --> 00:01:57.961
is an important question.
The proper functioning of a

00:01:57.961 --> 00:02:01.942
particular enzyme requires
reduced B12 and also another B

00:02:01.942 --> 00:02:07.217
vitamin called folic acid.
And this particular enzyme is

00:02:07.217 --> 00:02:11.423
believed to be important in
preventing heart disease and

00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:16.011
also important in preventing
birth defects and also important

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:19.452
for maintaining mental health.
This September,

00:02:19.452 --> 00:02:22.894
Laura Philips,
who is a recitation instructor,

00:02:22.894 --> 00:02:27.099
and I went to Oxford to attend
a meeting on vitamin B12.

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.000
And it was a very medical-based
meeting.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.064
And a large number of the talks
were by physicians talking about

00:02:35.064 --> 00:02:38.419
treating people with B12
deficiencies that had mental

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:40.870
illnesses.
And they told one story of a

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.032
man who was sort of a
middle-aged man who couldn't

00:02:44.032 --> 00:02:47.387
really function at work.
He couldn't remember what he

00:02:47.387 --> 00:02:50.870
was supposed to be doing,
and so he was having trouble.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.612
He was having trouble driving.
He couldn't remember all the

00:02:54.612 --> 00:02:56.677
rules of the road.
And of course,

00:02:56.677 --> 00:02:59.838
it seems like in England,
this guy was in England,

00:02:59.838 --> 00:03:04.618
that was even more complicated.
And he would leave his house

00:03:04.618 --> 00:03:06.700
and couldn't remember where he
lived.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.822
He had all these symptoms that
were sort of Alzheimer's

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:11.903
disease, but he was not an older
man.

00:03:11.903 --> 00:03:14.678
And it did not seem like
Alzheimer's was right so

00:03:14.678 --> 00:03:18.321
eventually he ended up with this
physician who diagnosed that he

00:03:18.321 --> 00:03:20.980
had a B12 deficiency.
And it was great for this

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.698
particular individual,
because when they started

00:03:23.698 --> 00:03:27.109
giving him vitamin B12 in high
doses, he actually recovered.

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.000
He got his driver's license
back.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.400
He got his job back.
And he was able to get back and

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.933
forth from home without any
challenges.

00:03:35.933 --> 00:03:39.599
I think a lot of the time one
cannot point to B12 as the

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.866
source of any mental
forgetfulness.

00:03:41.866 --> 00:03:44.733
And people do ask me.
People advertise this.

00:03:44.733 --> 00:03:48.866
Like in health food stores you
can buy vitamin B12 and it talks

00:03:48.866 --> 00:03:52.133
about improving one's memory and
things like that.

00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:55.533
I think that if you had a
vitamin B12 deficiency you

00:03:55.533 --> 00:03:59.906
should be taking B12.
But I think if you do not have

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:02.830
a B12 deficiency,
taking excess is not going to

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.516
help you do better on exams.
Although, I guess they do have

00:04:06.516 --> 00:04:10.521
squirt B12, just a little extra
dose squirted in the nose before

00:04:10.521 --> 00:04:14.080
the exam just to be on the safe
side, in case that helps.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.639
I won't vouch for anything like
that with memory and B12,

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.372
but nonetheless these enzymes
are important.

00:04:20.372 --> 00:04:24.059
And it is important to figure
out how the B12 gets reduced,

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:28.000
so the enzyme can function.
What is the enzyme?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.185
The enzyme's name is methionine
synthase, and it uses these two

00:04:32.185 --> 00:04:34.751
B vitamins, vitamin B12 and
folic acid.

00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:38.464
It converts an amino acid
called homocysteine to another

00:04:38.464 --> 00:04:41.907
one called methionine.
And it also converts one form

00:04:41.907 --> 00:04:45.350
of the folic acid to another
form of the folic acid.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.253
And, as I said,
inhibition of this enzyme is

00:04:48.253 --> 00:04:51.088
believed to be involved with
heart disease,

00:04:51.088 --> 00:04:54.531
it has been linked to birth
defects and also anemia.

00:04:54.531 --> 00:04:57.164
And, perhaps,
a real deficiency has been

00:04:57.164 --> 00:05:01.541
linked to mental issues.
This is a pretty important

00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:04.860
enzyme, but there are only two
enzymes in humans that use

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.290
vitamin B12.
Birth defects in one of those

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.906
enzymes can lead to this problem
I talked about with buffering

00:05:10.906 --> 00:05:13.217
the blood.
And that can lead to death in

00:05:13.217 --> 00:05:16.478
infants if it is not corrected,
if it is too severe of a

00:05:16.478 --> 00:05:19.856
problem, because the blood
cannot handle the change in pH.

00:05:19.856 --> 00:05:22.642
And this one is also quite
important, medically.

00:05:22.642 --> 00:05:25.250
At this point,
I think I may have scared you,

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.806
that you want to know if you
are getting enough B12 and folic

00:05:28.806 --> 00:05:33.623
acid in your diet.
So I thought I would share with

00:05:33.623 --> 00:05:37.769
you where you get B12 and folic
acid in your diet.

00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:42.592
At the end of class we will
talk about how B12 is reduced.

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.553
Where do you get these in your
diet?

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:48.938
Well, for vitamin B12,
does anybody know,

00:05:48.938 --> 00:05:51.815
in your diet?
I have heard spinach.

00:05:51.815 --> 00:05:53.000
No.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.241
Total, yeah,
cereal that is supplemented

00:06:01.241 --> 00:06:04.815
with vitamins,
that is a good way to get it.

00:06:04.815 --> 00:06:08.223
But naturally occurring,
it comes in meat,

00:06:08.223 --> 00:06:10.883
red meat and other forms of
meat.

00:06:10.883 --> 00:06:15.537
This is the one vitamin that
vegetarians say they need to

00:06:15.537 --> 00:06:19.361
have supplemented.
And it is not a huge problem

00:06:19.361 --> 00:06:22.935
because, as I said,
cereal and other things.

00:06:22.935 --> 00:06:26.509
But in the natural diet,
it comes from meat.

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:30.000
And what about folic acid?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.980
Vegetables, yeah.
Folic from foliage,

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.615
so green leafy things work.
Also I was at another meeting

00:06:42.615 --> 00:06:46.754
with medical doctors,
talking about vitamin B12 and

00:06:46.754 --> 00:06:49.321
folic acid.
These were Norwegian

00:06:49.321 --> 00:06:52.466
physicians.
They informed me of another

00:06:52.466 --> 00:06:56.771
source of folic acid that I was
unaware of, which is,

00:06:56.771 --> 00:07:01.891
apparently, Norwegian beer.
I cannot vouch for this,

00:07:01.891 --> 00:07:06.540
but that is what they told me.
Also, perhaps a better source

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:11.269
would be leafy green vegetables.
And orange juice is actually

00:07:11.269 --> 00:07:14.500
quite good.
Some of you may have seen this

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.361
commercial, raise your hand if
you have seen this,

00:07:18.361 --> 00:07:21.750
with orange juice,
and it says orange juice,

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.532
it is good for your heart?
Have you seen that ad?

00:07:25.532 --> 00:07:31.087
That actually is probably true.
And that is true because you

00:07:31.087 --> 00:07:33.995
get a lot of folic acid in
orange juice.

00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:37.649
Anyway, here are some dietary
suggestions for you.

00:07:37.649 --> 00:07:40.631
All right.
But you actually don't have to

00:07:40.631 --> 00:07:44.881
worry too much about folic acid
anymore, because now it is

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:48.087
fortified in bread.
In addition to breakfast

00:07:48.087 --> 00:07:50.995
cereals, bread now has extra
folic acid.

00:07:50.995 --> 00:07:55.543
And this started as a campaign,
because if you are a woman who

00:07:55.543 --> 00:07:59.942
is pregnant, you need a lot of
folic acid or the baby can be

00:07:59.942 --> 00:08:04.830
born with birth defects.
Now, the problem is that often

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.553
you need the folic acid before
you know that you are pregnant.

00:08:08.553 --> 00:08:10.751
You need the folic acid from
day one.

00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:14.474
And so a lot of scientists have
been campaigning in Washington

00:08:14.474 --> 00:08:18.136
for a long time saying we need
to put the folic acid in bread

00:08:18.136 --> 00:08:21.981
because the woman need the folic
acid before they know that they

00:08:21.981 --> 00:08:24.544
are pregnant.
This argument did not go very

00:08:24.544 --> 00:08:29.000
well, and it was years and years
and years of this argument.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.263
And then all of a sudden some
studies came out that really

00:08:32.263 --> 00:08:35.584
linked folic acid and heart
disease through the activity of

00:08:35.584 --> 00:08:38.848
this B12 dependent enzyme,
and all of a sudden the climate

00:08:38.848 --> 00:08:42.341
in Washington changed and they
say, oh, this may prevent heart

00:08:42.341 --> 00:08:43.372
disease.
All right.

00:08:43.372 --> 00:08:46.235
Let's fortify bread.
That is a good example of sort

00:08:46.235 --> 00:08:49.327
of science and politics,
where political decisions that

00:08:49.327 --> 00:08:52.648
are made about science are
really based on politics and not

00:08:52.648 --> 00:08:55.110
on the science,
but at this point things are

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:59.098
looking better.
Although, some recent studies

00:08:59.098 --> 00:09:03.296
have shown there are still
issues for some women in getting

00:09:03.296 --> 00:09:05.322
enough folic acid.
All right.

00:09:05.322 --> 00:09:08.072
Then we need to know how it is
reduced.

00:09:08.072 --> 00:09:12.125
We are going to come back to
this at the end of today and

00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:15.960
look at how all the things we
have been learning about

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.592
oxidation-reduction apply to not
only the batteries that you buy,

00:09:20.592 --> 00:09:24.500
but to the reactions such as
the reaction of methionine

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.480
synthase, which is actually
happening in your body right

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.541
now.
All right.

00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:33.408
Today we are going to talk
about this final lecture of

00:09:33.408 --> 00:09:36.276
oxidation and reduction,
and we're going to talk about

00:09:36.276 --> 00:09:38.549
adding and subtracting half-cell
reactions.

00:09:38.549 --> 00:09:41.525
This is listed as a topic,
but I decided to remove this,

00:09:41.525 --> 00:09:44.663
so it is not actually in your
handout, although it is still

00:09:44.663 --> 00:09:48.072
listed as being in your handout.
You can cross that out just for

00:09:48.072 --> 00:09:50.615
interest of time.
And we are going to talk about

00:09:50.615 --> 00:09:53.158
the Nernst equation,
which is one of my favorite

00:09:53.158 --> 00:09:55.430
equations, so I am looking
forward to that.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.935
All right.
A couple other announcements

00:09:58.935 --> 00:10:01.146
before we get into this
material.

00:10:01.146 --> 00:10:04.464
I want to remind people there
is a forum tonight.

00:10:04.464 --> 00:10:08.680
We had a great forum last week,
and so I encourage you to sign

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.550
up and come to these forums.
Also, the problem set is due

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.075
this Friday, as usual.
And then the next problem set

00:10:16.075 --> 00:10:19.946
is a really short problem set
that will be due Wednesday.

00:10:19.946 --> 00:10:23.954
That problem set just covers
material on Friday's class and

00:10:23.954 --> 00:10:26.995
Monday's class,
so it is actually really very

00:10:26.995 --> 00:10:29.000
short.
Okay.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.153
Down to some business.
All right.

00:10:31.153 --> 00:10:33.979
Adding and subtracting
half-cell reactions.

00:10:33.979 --> 00:10:37.814
Suppose you needed to know
something about this particular

00:10:37.814 --> 00:10:41.313
equation and the standard
reduction potential for the

00:10:41.313 --> 00:10:44.744
reaction of copper two
with one electron

00:10:44.744 --> 00:10:47.167
going to copper plus one.

00:10:47.167 --> 00:10:50.733
But it wasn't given,

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:54.232
and you are looking in the
table and it is not given.

00:10:54.232 --> 00:10:58.000
However, other things related
are given.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.288
Suppose you do find in the
table copper plus two

00:11:01.288 --> 00:11:04.692
with two electrons going to
copper zero, copper solid.

00:11:06.653 --> 00:11:10.173
And, you find copper solid
going to copper plus one

00:11:10.173 --> 00:11:13.288
plus one electron.

00:11:13.288 --> 00:11:16.519
That information about
both of those reactions is

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:19.634
provided, so you see the
relationship between these two

00:11:19.634 --> 00:11:21.769
equations.
You can use the information

00:11:21.769 --> 00:11:25.115
about these to calculate a
standard reduction potential for

00:11:25.115 --> 00:11:27.365
this one.
If you add these two reactions

00:11:27.365 --> 00:11:31.000
together, you get the reaction
of interest.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.428
You get copper two and
one electron going to copper,

00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:38.071
one electron cancels,

00:11:38.071 --> 00:11:42.071
and the copper solid cancels,
and you get the reaction of

00:11:42.071 --> 00:11:44.642
interest.
If you can add together two

00:11:44.642 --> 00:11:49.000
reactions to get the reaction of
interest, what do you do with

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.857
the standard reduction
potentials to get the answer for

00:11:52.857 --> 00:11:55.785
the reduction potential for this
reaction?

00:11:55.785 --> 00:12:01.328
This all comes back to delta G.
Most things are related in some

00:12:01.328 --> 00:12:03.431
ways to delta G,
free energy.

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:07.412
The free energy in the standard
state, delta G nought,

00:12:07.412 --> 00:12:11.843
for that new reaction that you
are interested in is equal to

00:12:11.843 --> 00:12:16.199
the delta G nought for the
reaction that was a reduction in

00:12:16.199 --> 00:12:20.405
the added equations minus the
delta G information for the

00:12:20.405 --> 00:12:23.710
oxidation reaction.
You notice we are doing a

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:25.663
derivation here?
All right.

00:12:25.663 --> 00:12:30.169
Then we know something about
the relationship between delta G

00:12:30.169 --> 00:12:34.000
and standard reduction
potentials.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.336
We talked about this last time,
that delta G nought equals

00:12:38.336 --> 00:12:42.597
minus N, which is the moles of
electrons, times Faraday's

00:12:42.597 --> 00:12:45.869
constant times standard
reduction potential.

00:12:45.869 --> 00:12:50.510
If we substitute that into all
of these, we get this equation,

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:54.619
and we can cancel out the
Faraday's constant and solve,

00:12:54.619 --> 00:12:58.652
then, for the standard
reduction potential for the new

00:12:58.652 --> 00:13:03.693
reaction, which is what we want.
If we get rid of Faraday's

00:13:03.693 --> 00:13:07.079
constant it cancels out.
Bring the number of moles of

00:13:07.079 --> 00:13:09.683
electrons for the new reaction
down here.

00:13:09.683 --> 00:13:12.679
We get this equation,
which tells you about the

00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:16.325
number of moles of the reaction
in the standard reduction

00:13:16.325 --> 00:13:19.906
potential for the reduction
reaction, number of moles of

00:13:19.906 --> 00:13:23.162
electrons, the standard
reduction potential for the

00:13:23.162 --> 00:13:27.069
reaction that is in oxidation,
that is added to the reduction

00:13:27.069 --> 00:13:31.841
to give you this new reaction.
And that is divided by the

00:13:31.841 --> 00:13:35.877
number of moles of electrons
involved in that new reaction

00:13:35.877 --> 00:13:38.851
that you are interested in.
Let's use that,

00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:40.693
then.
If we go and we look,

00:13:40.693 --> 00:13:44.729
these were, are two reactions
that we are adding together.

00:13:44.729 --> 00:13:47.491
One is an oxidation.
One is a reduction.

00:13:47.491 --> 00:13:51.457
And we can look up what the
standard reduction potentials

00:13:51.457 --> 00:13:54.502
are that are related to those
two equations.

00:13:54.502 --> 00:13:58.326
The standard reduction
potential, copper two

00:13:58.326 --> 00:14:03.000
to copper, copper plus one
to copper.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.511
Again, we are looking up
reduction potentials.

00:14:06.511 --> 00:14:11.115
And we can find out what those
are and then we can plug them

00:14:11.115 --> 00:14:13.456
in.
Here is our equation again.

00:14:13.456 --> 00:14:17.202
For the reduction,
we have two electrons involved

00:14:17.202 --> 00:14:21.728
in the reduction and a standard
reduction potential of plus

00:14:21.728 --> 00:14:25.005
0.340 volts.
Then we put in the information

00:14:25.005 --> 00:14:30.000
about the reaction that was
written as an oxidation.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.074
And so that is minus.
There is one electron involved

00:14:34.074 --> 00:14:36.790
in that.
And a reduction potential.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:40.785
Again, it is entered in as the
reduction potential.

00:14:40.785 --> 00:14:45.179
According to the equation,
this is a reduction potential

00:14:45.179 --> 00:14:48.134
of 0.522 volts.
And then, in the final

00:14:48.134 --> 00:14:51.969
reaction, there is one electron
involved in that.

00:14:51.969 --> 00:14:56.922
And so we put the one here and
we can get out an answer of plus

00:14:56.922 --> 00:15:01.264
0.158 volts.
And so now we found out a new

00:15:01.264 --> 00:15:05.246
standard reduction potential for
this half reaction,

00:15:05.246 --> 00:15:08.837
knowing information about other
half reactions.

00:15:08.837 --> 00:15:12.117
And so this would be,
then, the copper two,

00:15:12.117 --> 00:15:16.099
copper one,
reduction potential.

00:15:16.099 --> 00:15:19.924
What about the cells we were
talking about before,

00:15:19.924 --> 00:15:25.000
the electrochemical cells with
the balanced equations?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.886
Well, in that case,
for an electrochemical cell,

00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:31.142
the number of moles of
electrons released at the anode

00:15:31.142 --> 00:15:34.643
is going to be equal to the
moles taken up at the cathode,

00:15:34.643 --> 00:15:38.144
which is equal to the overall
moles that get balanced out.

00:15:38.144 --> 00:15:41.769
When you balance the equation,
you always want to cancel out

00:15:41.769 --> 00:15:45.331
your electrons and have none
left in your balance equation.

00:15:45.331 --> 00:15:47.972
Otherwise, it is not balanced.
In that case,

00:15:47.972 --> 00:15:52.035
you don't use this.
It simplifies to the equation

00:15:52.035 --> 00:15:56.035
that we talked about before,
where the reduction potential

00:15:56.035 --> 00:15:58.982
for the cell now,
it is the cell potential,

00:15:58.982 --> 00:16:02.631
not another half potential,
is equal to the reduction

00:16:02.631 --> 00:16:06.842
potential for the reaction at
the cathode minus the reduction

00:16:06.842 --> 00:16:09.578
potential for the reaction at
the anode.

00:16:09.578 --> 00:16:13.578
You use this for balanced
cells, and you use this for half

00:16:13.578 --> 00:16:15.614
cell reactions.
And so, again,

00:16:15.614 --> 00:16:18.561
for a half cell reaction you
must use this.

00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:21.228
Otherwise, it is not going to
work out.

00:16:21.228 --> 00:16:25.298
You can recognize a half cell
reaction because it still has

00:16:25.298 --> 00:16:30.000
electrons in it.
That is a half cell reaction.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.393
Okay.
That is just sort of a little

00:16:32.393 --> 00:16:36.124
side thing that will come in
handy in finishing up the

00:16:36.124 --> 00:16:40.136
problem set and on the test.
And now we can talk about one

00:16:40.136 --> 00:16:44.078
of my more favorite topics,
which is the Nernst equation.

00:16:44.078 --> 00:16:48.161
A lot of you have probably
experienced the ramifications of

00:16:48.161 --> 00:16:52.244
the Nernst equation without
realizing that is what you have

00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:54.356
done.
I assume that pretty much

00:16:54.356 --> 00:16:58.509
everybody has had an occasion
where you to use your favorite

00:16:58.509 --> 00:17:01.888
gadget and discover that the
battery is no longer

00:17:01.888 --> 00:17:05.575
functioning.
A few people say yeah,

00:17:05.575 --> 00:17:09.657
maybe that has happened to me.
And so then you start doing

00:17:09.657 --> 00:17:13.023
things like this,
where you either get some kind

00:17:13.023 --> 00:17:16.604
of recharger or you go out and
stockpile batteries,

00:17:16.604 --> 00:17:20.687
which then if you keep them
long enough it seems like they

00:17:20.687 --> 00:17:24.124
don't work either.
Anyway, that is all the Nernst

00:17:24.124 --> 00:17:27.633
equation in action.
An exhausted battery is a sign

00:17:27.633 --> 00:17:31.000
that equilibrium has been
reached.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.332
At equilibrium the cell
generates zero potential across

00:17:35.332 --> 00:17:38.862
its electrodes,
so it is not working anymore.

00:17:38.862 --> 00:17:43.355
And so to understand this
problem, we need to think about

00:17:43.355 --> 00:17:47.687
how the composition of that cell
is changing over time.

00:17:47.687 --> 00:17:52.742
This gets back to all the other
things that we have talked about

00:17:52.742 --> 00:17:57.315
with chemical equilibrium.
What do we know about this kind

00:17:57.315 --> 00:18:00.977
of stuff?
What do we know about

00:18:00.977 --> 00:18:04.933
equilibrium and components of
the reaction?

00:18:04.933 --> 00:18:10.772
We know that delta G changes as
the composition of the reaction

00:18:10.772 --> 00:18:15.576
changes, and we know that it
changes until we reach,

00:18:15.576 --> 00:18:18.872
at equilibrium,
delta G equals zero.

00:18:18.872 --> 00:18:24.240
We know that delta G at some
given time, at some different

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.385
reaction mixture,
is equal to delta G nought,

00:18:28.385 --> 00:18:33.000
the delta G at standard
conditions--

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.466
--Plus RT, the gas constant
times temperature,

00:18:37.466 --> 00:18:41.536
times the natural log of Q.
And Q is what?

00:18:41.536 --> 00:18:46.202
Reaction quotient.
The delta G at any particular

00:18:46.202 --> 00:18:52.455
time depends on the composition,
depends on the reaction that is

00:18:52.455 --> 00:18:56.525
going on, the components of that
reaction.

00:18:56.525 --> 00:19:02.803
We have seen this before.
Last time we talked about the

00:19:02.803 --> 00:19:07.346
relationship between delta G and
cell potential,

00:19:07.346 --> 00:19:12.470
delta E, so we know something
about that relationship.

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:18.366
We know that delta G nought is
equal to the number of moles of

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:23.683
electrons times Faraday's
constant times delta E nought,

00:19:23.683 --> 00:19:29.000
the change in cell potential
for the reaction.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.812
And also, this could be applied
if this was delta G to delta E.

00:19:34.812 --> 00:19:39.031
It holds if you are under
standard conditions,

00:19:39.031 --> 00:19:41.843
delta G nought,
delta E nought,

00:19:41.843 --> 00:19:44.750
or under nonstandard
conditions.

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:49.812
If we combine those things,
we get the Nernst equation.

00:19:49.812 --> 00:19:55.437
If we take what we already knew
about delta G from before and

00:19:55.437 --> 00:20:00.687
now plug in, instead of delta G
nought, minus N Faraday's

00:20:00.687 --> 00:20:07.483
constant times delta E nought --
-- And also we are going to

00:20:07.483 --> 00:20:13.279
substitute in for delta G minus
N Faraday's constant times delta

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:17.327
E, over here,
and we substitute over here and

00:20:17.327 --> 00:20:22.571
we keep this part the same.
And then if we divide by N and

00:20:22.571 --> 00:20:26.711
Faraday's constant,
we get the Nernst equation

00:20:26.711 --> 00:20:29.830
here.
The delta E at some given

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:33.491
point, for some different
reaction quotient at some

00:20:33.491 --> 00:20:37.446
different time in the cell,
is going to be equal to the

00:20:37.446 --> 00:20:41.693
standard cell potential under
standard conditions minus RT,

00:20:41.693 --> 00:20:45.501
gas constant temperature,
over the number of moles of

00:20:45.501 --> 00:20:49.528
electrons times Faraday's
constant times the natural log

00:20:49.528 --> 00:20:53.556
of Q, the reaction quotient.
What the cell potential is,

00:20:53.556 --> 00:20:56.704
at some given time,
depends on the reaction,

00:20:56.704 --> 00:21:02.201
where you are in the reaction.
What the composition of

00:21:02.201 --> 00:21:06.316
products to reactants is at that
given time.

00:21:06.316 --> 00:21:11.867
This way we can calculate how
close the battery is to being

00:21:11.867 --> 00:21:17.036
dead, sort of where we are in
the trajectory of things,

00:21:17.036 --> 00:21:22.874
what kind of potential we are
getting at that particular given

00:21:22.874 --> 00:21:26.033
time.
Let's do an example of using

00:21:26.033 --> 00:21:31.259
the Nernst equation.
Here is a particular reaction.

00:21:31.259 --> 00:21:35.402
We have copper plus two
plus zinc solid 

00:21:35.402 --> 00:21:39.319
plus copper.

00:21:39.319 --> 00:21:43.914
And we are told that

00:21:43.914 --> 00:21:48.509
the zinc ion's concentration is
0.10 molar and copper plus two

00:21:48.509 --> 00:21:52.802
is 0.0010 molar.
And so these are not standard

00:21:52.802 --> 00:21:58.000
conditions, so we know we want
to use the Nernst equation.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.254
The first step in doing this is
we will write down the Nernst

00:22:04.254 --> 00:22:07.902
equation.
The cell potential at some

00:22:07.902 --> 00:22:13.947
given time is equal to the
standard cell potential minus RT

00:22:13.947 --> 00:22:19.993
over N times Faraday's constant
times the natural log of Q.

00:22:19.993 --> 00:22:25.413
We will have step one being to
find the standard cell

00:22:25.413 --> 00:22:30.000
potential, so find delta E
nought.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.173
All right.
To do this we need to look at

00:22:33.173 --> 00:22:36.997
both the reactions.
We need to know the standard

00:22:36.997 --> 00:22:40.089
reduction potential for both
reactions.

00:22:40.089 --> 00:22:44.728
One reaction involves copper
plus two going to

00:22:44.728 --> 00:22:48.796
copper solid.

00:22:48.796 --> 00:22:52.539
And this reaction involves
two electrons.

00:22:52.539 --> 00:22:57.096
The other reaction that is
going in the forward direction

00:22:57.096 --> 00:23:01.490
is that zinc solid is
going to zinc plus two

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:05.965
plus two electrons.

00:23:05.965 --> 00:23:11.010
We have a reduction and an

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:14.715
oxidation.
This reaction would be

00:23:14.715 --> 00:23:19.810
occurring where,
at the cathode or the anode?

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:25.021
At the cathode.
And so that must mean that the

00:23:25.021 --> 00:23:30.000
other one is happening at the
anode.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.881
Now we need to know the
standard reduction potential for

00:23:34.881 --> 00:23:38.875
the two couples.
We need to know the reduction

00:23:38.875 --> 00:23:44.201
potential of copper two plus
to copper solid,

00:23:44.201 --> 00:23:49.260
and we need to know the
potential for zinc two plus

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.455
to zinc solid.

00:23:52.455 --> 00:23:55.562
And we can look those up in a
table.

00:23:55.562 --> 00:24:00.000
They are up here,
if you can see them.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.230
I am actually going to write
them down to a couple more

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:11.884
significant figures.
One is 0.340 and the other is

00:24:11.884 --> 00:24:16.038
minus 0.7628,
and those are in volts.

00:24:16.038 --> 00:24:19.500
Okay.
We have that information.

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.538
And now this is a balanced
reaction.

00:24:23.538 --> 00:24:30.000
There were no extra electrons
floating around.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.910
This is a cell.
We are trying to find a cell

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:39.935
potential here.
We can calculate that for the

00:24:39.935 --> 00:24:47.243
particular cell in question from
the standard reduction potential

00:24:47.243 --> 00:24:53.981
for the reaction at the cathode
minus the standard reduction

00:24:53.981 --> 00:24:58.435
potential for the reaction at
the anode.

00:24:58.435 --> 00:25:04.830
And so that is going to be
equal to 0.34 minus a negative

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:09.019
0.7628.
Which is going to give you

00:25:09.019 --> 00:25:12.126
1.103 volts.
This is the reaction we use.

00:25:12.126 --> 00:25:17.019
And, again, we are not changing
the sign, because we are looking

00:25:17.019 --> 00:25:20.514
up and entering standard
reduction potentials.

00:25:20.514 --> 00:25:25.174
But you need to know which is
the reaction at the cathode and

00:25:25.174 --> 00:25:29.679
which is the reaction at the
anode to put them in the right

00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:32.518
place.
All right.

00:25:32.518 --> 00:25:41.476
We have our first thing there.
Now, what do we need to know?

00:25:41.476 --> 00:25:49.371
Well, we also need to know Q.
Step two, let's find Q.

00:25:49.371 --> 00:25:56.356
What is Q going to be equal to?
What is on top?

00:25:56.356 --> 00:26:02.232
Concentration of?
Yeah, zinc two plus

00:26:02.232 --> 00:26:05.329
and nothing else,
because it's products over

00:26:05.329 --> 00:26:08.210
reactants.
But we don't include solids in

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:11.019
our equation,
so it's just zinc two plus.

00:26:11.019 --> 00:26:13.612
And that is going to be,

00:26:13.612 --> 00:26:16.349
then, over copper 
two plus.

00:26:16.349 --> 00:26:18.797
Again, we are not including
solids.

00:26:18.797 --> 00:26:21.390
We are not including the zinc
solids.

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:26.000
Products over reactants,
and we can plug this in.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.589
We have 0.1 over 0.0010,
and that gives us 1.0x10^2 for

00:26:32.589 --> 00:26:36.128
Q.
Step three, we also need to

00:26:36.128 --> 00:26:40.766
know N.
How many moles of electrons are

00:26:40.766 --> 00:26:44.427
involved in this reaction?
Two.

00:26:44.427 --> 00:26:49.674
N equals two.
We have from a copper two plus

00:26:49.674 --> 00:26:57.484
to copper solid,
zinc two plus

00:26:57.484 --> 00:27:03.282
to zinc solid.
There are two electrons

00:27:03.282 --> 00:27:05.289
evolved.
They are not in the equation

00:27:05.289 --> 00:27:07.855
because they canceled out.
This one is obvious.

00:27:07.855 --> 00:27:11.033
Sometimes they are harder,
and you actually really have to

00:27:11.033 --> 00:27:14.434
think about how that equation
was balanced to come up with the

00:27:14.434 --> 00:27:17.000
right answer for the number of
moles.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.328
All right.
Now we can plug all that

00:27:26.328 --> 00:27:29.000
information into the Nernst
equation.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.593
We are looking for what the
cell potential is at a

00:27:33.593 --> 00:27:37.718
particular time,
so that will be equal to the

00:27:37.718 --> 00:27:42.500
standard cell potential that we
calculated minus RT.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:47.750
And R is the gas constant,
so write the gas constant out,

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:52.718
times the temperature.
And the temperature for all the

00:27:52.718 --> 00:27:58.437
problems that you are going to
do in this unit is always going

00:27:58.437 --> 00:28:05.050
to be at room temperature.
Times the natural log of Q.

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:11.263
And that is going to be over 2
times Faraday's constant.

00:28:11.263 --> 00:28:17.702
And I am writing all this out
because we are going to talk

00:28:17.702 --> 00:28:23.238
about units in a minute.
Times Faraday's constant.

00:28:23.238 --> 00:28:29.000
Now we can cancel out.
We will cancel moles.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.781
And we are going to cancel
Kelvin.

00:28:31.781 --> 00:28:36.081
And we are going to be left
with joules per coulomb.

00:28:36.081 --> 00:28:40.212
Is that a good thing?
What does joules per coulomb

00:28:40.212 --> 00:28:41.898
equal?
A volt, right.

00:28:41.898 --> 00:28:46.366
That will do very well,
because we are going to have a

00:28:46.366 --> 00:28:51.171
volt here and we are going to
subtract something in volts.

00:28:51.171 --> 00:28:56.145
That will leave us with joules,
and a volt equals joules per

00:28:56.145 --> 00:29:00.463
Coulomb.
That gives us 1.103 volts

00:29:00.463 --> 00:29:04.602
minus, this calculates out to
0.0592 volts.

00:29:04.602 --> 00:29:09.924
And, if we worked this out,
this would give us a number

00:29:09.924 --> 00:29:15.049
with two significant figures
after the decimal point.

00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:20.666
And so that leaves us with
these significant figures here.

00:29:20.666 --> 00:29:26.481
We are actually going to lose
one in the subtraction anyway.

00:29:26.481 --> 00:29:32.000
And we come up with an answer
of 1.044 volts.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.699
I will mention,
in terms of significant

00:29:35.699 --> 00:29:39.787
figures, this is like the
nastiest problem.

00:29:39.787 --> 00:29:43.000
Yeah?
Do you have a question?

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.437
Sometimes when you look at the
equation, there is a lot of

00:29:51.437 --> 00:29:54.633
different things going on,
and you actually have to do

00:29:54.633 --> 00:29:57.708
sort of a step backwards to
think what were the half

00:29:57.708 --> 00:30:01.367
reactions and what was canceled.
A lot of times it is very

00:30:01.367 --> 00:30:04.049
obvious, but some of them are a
little bit longer.

00:30:04.049 --> 00:30:06.949
There may be one in the problem
set, I don't remember,

00:30:06.949 --> 00:30:09.411
but you will know what I mean
when you see it.

00:30:09.411 --> 00:30:12.037
Sometimes it will be just very
obvious like that,

00:30:12.037 --> 00:30:14.773
that it will be two.
Other times it is a little bit

00:30:14.773 --> 00:30:17.126
harder to see,
and you sort of want to think

00:30:17.126 --> 00:30:20.409
backwards to what those half
reactions were and how you would

00:30:20.409 --> 00:30:21.996
have balanced them.
All right.

00:30:21.996 --> 00:30:24.732
In terms of significant
figures, these problems are

00:30:24.732 --> 00:30:29.000
probably some of the worst in
terms of significant figures.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.136
Acid-base is pretty bad,
too.

00:30:31.136 --> 00:30:35.028
You notice we started with a
subtraction, and in the

00:30:35.028 --> 00:30:38.538
subtraction you often lose
significant figures.

00:30:38.538 --> 00:30:41.666
Then we had a division.
Then we had a log.

00:30:41.666 --> 00:30:46.168
And then we had multiplication
and division and then another

00:30:46.168 --> 00:30:49.220
subtraction.
The only thing I can say for

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:53.875
these problems is that it helps
to really write out every step

00:30:53.875 --> 00:30:58.530
and to put a line under where
your significant figure is after

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:02.803
each calculation to make sure
that you aren't getting the

00:31:02.803 --> 00:31:07.000
wrong significant figures at the
end.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.912
You cannot, in this case,
go back and say how many

00:31:09.912 --> 00:31:13.299
significant figures did I have
in the information that was

00:31:13.299 --> 00:31:15.795
given to me?
That is how many I have at the

00:31:15.795 --> 00:31:17.757
end.
That is not going to work for

00:31:17.757 --> 00:31:19.777
you.
These are a little bit tricky.

00:31:19.777 --> 00:31:23.403
A lot of the time you will have
a break because there won't be

00:31:23.403 --> 00:31:25.720
many significant figures in this
answer.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.395
And so when you do the
subtraction you kind of

00:31:28.395 --> 00:31:32.018
compensate.
Sometimes it doesn't matter how

00:31:32.018 --> 00:31:35.534
many you really have here
because you are going to lose

00:31:35.534 --> 00:31:39.311
them in that subtraction step
anyway, but just to warn you,

00:31:39.311 --> 00:31:42.697
there is a lot of different
significant figure stuff.

00:31:42.697 --> 00:31:46.539
This actually would be a great
significant figure problem if

00:31:46.539 --> 00:31:50.316
that was all you were testing,
because you have to do every

00:31:50.316 --> 00:31:53.962
kind of significant figure
situation in this one problem.

00:31:53.962 --> 00:31:58.000
But I am going to make your
life slightly easier.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.658
What I am going to do is do
some of the steps for you.

00:32:01.658 --> 00:32:05.939
If we talk about constants for
a minute, we are always going to

00:32:05.939 --> 00:32:10.219
be at room temperature in this
unit, because that is just where

00:32:10.219 --> 00:32:12.705
we are.
It is going to make it harder

00:32:12.705 --> 00:32:15.052
to anything else.
Unless specified,

00:32:15.052 --> 00:32:17.744
assume room temperature.
If you do that,

00:32:17.744 --> 00:32:21.403
you will find that this is
always going to be the same

00:32:21.403 --> 00:32:23.682
number.
You have the gas constant,

00:32:23.682 --> 00:32:26.374
the temperature,
and Faraday's constant,

00:32:26.374 --> 00:32:31.000
and so there is one number that
that is equal to.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.083
And so you can use this number.
Or, if you prefer to use log

00:32:36.083 --> 00:32:41.252
base 10 rather than natural log,
you can take this number and

00:32:41.252 --> 00:32:46.335
multiply it by the conversation
factor, and you have sort of

00:32:46.335 --> 00:32:49.867
another constant,
which you can use in the

00:32:49.867 --> 00:32:52.021
problem.
And, on the test,

00:32:52.021 --> 00:32:56.759
I will actually give the
equations in this format to you

00:32:56.759 --> 00:33:00.586
on your sheet.
And so you can pick one of

00:33:00.586 --> 00:33:02.661
these.
If there is room I will give

00:33:02.661 --> 00:33:04.614
both.
Otherwise, I will just give

00:33:04.614 --> 00:33:06.444
one.
But it is the same type of

00:33:06.444 --> 00:33:08.763
problem.
You just have to pay attention

00:33:08.763 --> 00:33:11.753
to which log to use.
And I will make sure that the

00:33:11.753 --> 00:33:15.171
number of significant figures
here is not limiting in the

00:33:15.171 --> 00:33:17.978
problem, so you don't have to
worry about that.

00:33:17.978 --> 00:33:20.968
I highly recommend that if I
provide these to you,

00:33:20.968 --> 00:33:23.897
save those extra steps of
multiplying things out.

00:33:23.897 --> 00:33:27.009
It will save you some time and
maybe a little bit of

00:33:27.009 --> 00:33:33.332
significant figure headache.
Those will be available just to

00:33:33.332 --> 00:33:38.706
simplify these problems.
I am sure that you can all

00:33:38.706 --> 00:33:44.833
multiply RT over Faraday's
constant, so I am just going to

00:33:44.833 --> 00:33:50.745
provide that for you and not
require you to do it on the

00:33:50.745 --> 00:33:54.185
test.
What happens at equilibrium

00:33:54.185 --> 00:33:57.517
then?
At equilibrium what does Q

00:33:57.517 --> 00:34:00.957
equal?
Q equals K at equilibrium,

00:34:00.957 --> 00:34:05.129
right.
What about delta G?

00:34:05.129 --> 00:34:09.387
What does delta G equal at
equilibrium?

00:34:09.387 --> 00:34:13.198
Zero.
Do you see where we are going

00:34:13.198 --> 00:34:17.008
with this?
If you have the handout,

00:34:17.008 --> 00:34:22.500
you can look ahead.
We know from before that delta

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:29.000
G equals delta G nought plus RT
natural log of Q.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.736
We also know that delta G
nought equals minus RT natural

00:34:33.736 --> 00:34:37.955
log of K, because at
equilibrium, delta G is zero,

00:34:37.955 --> 00:34:42.261
so we drop that out,
and at equilibrium Q equals K.

00:34:42.261 --> 00:34:46.738
We have seen this expression
before, so we know that.

00:34:46.738 --> 00:34:51.302
We also know the relationship
between delta G and cell

00:34:51.302 --> 00:34:54.488
potential.
We know that delta G nought

00:34:54.488 --> 00:34:57.675
equals minus N,
the number of moles of

00:34:57.675 --> 00:35:02.359
electrons, --
-- Faraday's constant,

00:35:02.359 --> 00:35:05.899
times the standard cell
potential.

00:35:05.899 --> 00:35:12.442
Now we can rearrange these and
relate the equilibrium constant

00:35:12.442 --> 00:35:16.840
to cell potential.
Combining, we get this,

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:23.276
so we just set those two equal
to each other and we can solve

00:35:23.276 --> 00:35:31.000
for K, or at least natural log
of K in terms of cell potential.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.173
And so you can calculate the
equilibrium constant from cell

00:35:35.173 --> 00:35:37.044
potentials.
And, of course,

00:35:37.044 --> 00:35:40.426
this is important,
because if you want your cell

00:35:40.426 --> 00:35:44.240
to be producing some kind of
current, creating energy,

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.191
or if you want to apply
something to get a

00:35:47.191 --> 00:35:51.076
non-spontaneous reaction to go,
you care about what the

00:35:51.076 --> 00:35:55.466
composition of the reaction is,
you care about the equilibrium

00:35:55.466 --> 00:36:00.000
constant, and you care about
these relationships.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.233
If you know about K,
you can also think about if the

00:36:03.233 --> 00:36:07.036
reaction is really favorable in
one direction or in the other

00:36:07.036 --> 00:36:10.586
direction at equilibrium,
do you have a lot more products

00:36:10.586 --> 00:36:14.010
or a lot more reactants,
and some of the same questions

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:17.496
we have talked about before.
See how all these units are

00:36:17.496 --> 00:36:20.539
kind of fitting together,
and how I told you that

00:36:20.539 --> 00:36:23.582
everything that you learned you
have to remember,

00:36:23.582 --> 00:36:25.611
because it is going to come
back?

00:36:25.611 --> 00:36:28.464
It's back again.
We are back to thinking about

00:36:28.464 --> 00:36:32.878
equilibrium constants.
This half semester of the

00:36:32.878 --> 00:36:35.132
course is very,
very connected.

00:36:35.132 --> 00:36:38.437
You cannot get away from any of
the material,

00:36:38.437 --> 00:36:42.795
which is kind of good because
on the exam it is kind of all

00:36:42.795 --> 00:36:47.378
related, so doing the next unit
is reviewing the unit that you

00:36:47.378 --> 00:36:49.031
already did.
All right.

00:36:49.031 --> 00:36:53.689
Let's look at an example of an
oxidation-reduction reaction and

00:36:53.689 --> 00:36:57.971
talk about what the equilibrium
constant is, again at room

00:36:57.971 --> 00:37:01.772
temperature.
This is going to involve two

00:37:01.772 --> 00:37:04.683
half reactions.
We have a reaction with zinc in

00:37:04.683 --> 00:37:07.151
the forward direction,
I mean with lead,

00:37:07.151 --> 00:37:10.696
lead plus two going
to lead solid.

00:37:10.696 --> 00:37:13.417
Lead plus two electrons going
to lead solid.

00:37:13.417 --> 00:37:16.898
We also have zinc solid

00:37:16.898 --> 00:37:20.506
going to zinc plus
two and then two

00:37:20.506 --> 00:37:22.658
electrons.

00:37:22.658 --> 00:37:26.518
Those are the two half
reactions involved in this cell

00:37:26.518 --> 00:37:30.000
reaction.
Now, we are interested in K.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.635
We are interested in the
magnitude of K.

00:37:32.635 --> 00:37:34.932
We want to think about if K is
big.

00:37:34.932 --> 00:37:37.567
Is K greater than one for this
reaction?

00:37:37.567 --> 00:37:40.945
We can do the math and
calculate, knowing something

00:37:40.945 --> 00:37:44.459
about the cell potentials,
or we can just think about

00:37:44.459 --> 00:37:48.648
whether this reaction would be
favorable before doing the math.

00:37:48.648 --> 00:37:52.027
If you think about what is
happening in the forward

00:37:52.027 --> 00:37:56.013
reaction, what is happening?
Well, what is happening is that

00:37:56.013 --> 00:38:00.000
zinc is reducing lead 
plus two.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.361
Lead plus two is
being reduced to lead solid,

00:38:04.361 --> 00:38:06.759
and zinc is being
oxidized.

00:38:06.759 --> 00:38:09.085
It is acting as a reducing
agent.

00:38:09.085 --> 00:38:12.502
And in the backward reaction,
what is happening?

00:38:12.502 --> 00:38:16.863
Well, in the backward reaction,
we have lead solid 

00:38:16.863 --> 00:38:20.643
reducing zinc plus two
to zinc solid.

00:38:20.643 --> 00:38:22.387
If we think about,

00:38:22.387 --> 00:38:25.876
are there going to be more
products or reactants,

00:38:25.876 --> 00:38:30.092
we are really thinking about
which of these two things is a

00:38:30.092 --> 00:38:35.250
better reducing agent.
If zinc is a better reducing

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:38.544
agent than lead,
it will favor the forward

00:38:38.544 --> 00:38:42.401
direction, and we will have a K
greater than one.

00:38:42.401 --> 00:38:47.142
Is it a better reducing agent?
We talked last time about how

00:38:47.142 --> 00:38:51.000
to figure this out,
and we talked last time about

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.017
the fact that things with
positive numbers up here,

00:38:55.017 --> 00:39:00.000
the oxidized species of this is
strongly oxidizing.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.070
And at the bottom with these
negative numbers,

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.594
the reduced form is strongly
reducing.

00:39:05.594 --> 00:39:07.710
We can look at where things
are.

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:10.848
There are numbers,
there are standard reduction

00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:15.147
potentials, and figure out which
one is a better reducing agent.

00:39:15.147 --> 00:39:18.149
If we look those up,
we know the zinc couple.

00:39:18.149 --> 00:39:21.765
We just talked about that one,
actually, minus 0.7628.

00:39:21.765 --> 00:39:25.791
And we can look up the standard
reduction potential of lead,

00:39:25.791 --> 00:39:29.339
and it is also negative,
but it is a smaller negative

00:39:29.339 --> 00:39:34.662
number, minus 0.1263.
This is a big negative number.

00:39:34.662 --> 00:39:38.122
Is it going to be a good
reducing agent?

00:39:38.122 --> 00:39:43.180
What do we know about how
difficult it is to add electrons

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:46.552
to this?
Is it hard to add electrons to

00:39:46.552 --> 00:39:47.440
this?
Yeah.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.344
It is hard to reduce.
That makes it easier to

00:39:51.344 --> 00:39:54.184
oxidize.
Does that make it a good

00:39:54.184 --> 00:39:58.000
reducing agent?
Yeah, it does.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.444
Because a reducing agent gets
oxidized itself.

00:40:01.444 --> 00:40:05.501
It reduces other things.
This would be a good reducing

00:40:05.501 --> 00:40:07.644
agent.
Well, what about this?

00:40:07.644 --> 00:40:10.400
Is it as good?
No, it is not as good.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.920
It is probably not bad,
but it is not as good a

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.441
reducing agent.
It would be a little bit easier

00:40:17.441 --> 00:40:21.039
to reduce than zinc,
a little harder to oxidize,

00:40:21.039 --> 00:40:25.479
so it is not as good a reducing
agent, because it is a more

00:40:25.479 --> 00:40:30.872
positive number than this one.
This is the bigger negative

00:40:30.872 --> 00:40:33.923
number, so this is the better
reducing agent.

00:40:33.923 --> 00:40:37.876
If that is the better reducing
agent, then the equilibrium

00:40:37.876 --> 00:40:41.552
should lie to the right.
There should be more products

00:40:41.552 --> 00:40:45.158
than reactants at equilibrium,
because in the forward

00:40:45.158 --> 00:40:48.418
direction, zinc is acting as the
reducing agent.

00:40:48.418 --> 00:40:52.302
And it is a better reducing
agent, so it should drive the

00:40:52.302 --> 00:40:56.463
equilibrium such that there are
more products than reactants.

00:40:56.463 --> 00:41:00.000
And so K should be greater than
one.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.007
And we can actually do the math
and prove that this is true.

00:41:04.007 --> 00:41:08.150
This is very much like when we
talked in acids and bases about

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:11.615
equilibrium and K values,
and how if something was a

00:41:11.615 --> 00:41:15.486
stronger acid one way then a
stronger acid in the backward

00:41:15.486 --> 00:41:19.698
reaction you could predict what
K would be, or you could do the

00:41:19.698 --> 00:41:22.075
math.
It is the same principle here.

00:41:22.075 --> 00:41:25.675
If we go through the math,
we can plug in the standard

00:41:25.675 --> 00:41:29.411
reduction potential for the lead
couple and the standard

00:41:29.411 --> 00:41:33.758
reduction potential for the zinc
couple and get an answer for the

00:41:33.758 --> 00:41:37.545
cell potential.
What is N for this?

00:41:37.545 --> 00:41:40.149
This is also a fairly simple
one?

00:41:40.149 --> 00:41:41.857
Two.
We know N is two.

00:41:41.857 --> 00:41:44.949
And then we can plug into our
equation.

00:41:44.949 --> 00:41:49.098
That is all we really needed to
know to do this one.

00:41:49.098 --> 00:41:53.735
We needed to know the standard
potential for the reaction,

00:41:53.735 --> 00:41:56.908
which we calculated,
Faraday's constant,

00:41:56.908 --> 00:42:02.368
we need to know N and RT.
And so we can put those in.

00:42:02.368 --> 00:42:07.280
And I will also provide this
with the math worked out for

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:12.631
Faraday's constant and R and T.
And so we can plug that in and

00:42:12.631 --> 00:42:16.578
put in our two and put in the
number of volts,

00:42:16.578 --> 00:42:21.666
the standard cell potential
that we calculated just before,

00:42:21.666 --> 00:42:24.385
and go back and calculate for
K.

00:42:24.385 --> 00:42:28.508
And so K is 21.5.
That is definitely bigger than

00:42:28.508 --> 00:42:31.832
one.
That is a very big number.

00:42:31.832 --> 00:42:35.004
Sorry, log of K,
and K turns out to be a very,

00:42:35.004 --> 00:42:38.246
very big number.
And so the forward reaction is

00:42:38.246 --> 00:42:41.277
definitely favored,
which is what we assumed

00:42:41.277 --> 00:42:44.660
thinking about which was a
better reducing agent.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:48.255
It said that the forward
reaction should be favored,

00:42:48.255 --> 00:42:50.581
that K should be greater than
one.

00:42:50.581 --> 00:42:53.612
And when you do the math you
find that K is,

00:42:53.612 --> 00:42:56.925
in fact, greater than one.
It is favored in that

00:42:56.925 --> 00:42:59.814
direction.
More products than reactants at

00:42:59.814 --> 00:43:02.000
equilibrium.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.031
In the last couple of minutes,
then, I want to go back to

00:43:13.031 --> 00:43:18.511
biological systems and show you
that the same equations apply.

00:43:18.511 --> 00:43:23.453
All the same principles apply
that you just learned to a

00:43:23.453 --> 00:43:27.675
biological system.
Answering the question of how

00:43:27.675 --> 00:43:33.812
B12 is reduced in the body --
-- B12 is reduced in the body

00:43:33.812 --> 00:43:39.436
by a protein called flavodoxin,
and this contains another B

00:43:39.436 --> 00:43:45.157
vitamin, a flavin B vitamin.
If we look at the standard cell

00:43:45.157 --> 00:43:50.587
potentials, the reduction
potentials for these reactions,

00:43:50.587 --> 00:43:56.018
the reduction potential E
nought for vitamin B12 is minus

00:43:56.018 --> 00:44:00.187
0.526 volts.
That is a very low number for a

00:44:00.187 --> 00:44:05.734
biological system.
That is one of the lowest

00:44:05.734 --> 00:44:10.437
standard reduction potentials
that is known.

00:44:10.437 --> 00:44:17.218
Flavodoxin is minus 0.23 volts.
Let's think about this reaction

00:44:17.218 --> 00:44:20.937
and whether it is favorable or
not.

00:44:20.937 --> 00:44:26.734
B12, then, is a better reducing
agent than flavodoxin.

00:44:26.734 --> 00:44:32.771
It has a more negative number.
As we just saw in the last

00:44:32.771 --> 00:44:35.905
example, that makes it a better
reducing agent.

00:44:35.905 --> 00:44:38.835
It is hard to reduce B12,
easier to oxidize.

00:44:38.835 --> 00:44:41.356
Flavodoxin has a more positive
number.

00:44:41.356 --> 00:44:44.898
Just like we saw in the last
one, it is not as good a

00:44:44.898 --> 00:44:47.624
reducing agent.
If this reaction occurred

00:44:47.624 --> 00:44:50.076
spontaneously,
B12 should be reducing

00:44:50.076 --> 00:44:52.529
flavodoxin, not the other way
around.

00:44:52.529 --> 00:44:56.753
We just worked an example where
we saw there was one thing that

00:44:56.753 --> 00:45:02.000
was a really good reducing agent
and another wasn't as good.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.009
And we had an enormous K,
so it was very much favored in

00:45:06.009 --> 00:45:09.580
the other direction.
This should not be occurring.

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:13.006
It doesn't seem possible that
this is occurring,

00:45:13.006 --> 00:45:15.849
yet it is.
Is the reduction spontaneous?

00:45:15.849 --> 00:45:19.275
No, it wouldn't be.
Let's actually calculate the

00:45:19.275 --> 00:45:23.576
numbers and see how bad it is.
Again, you can use this exact

00:45:23.576 --> 00:45:26.419
same equation.
Instead of calling things

00:45:26.419 --> 00:45:29.845
cathodes and anodes,
you can just consider it in

00:45:29.845 --> 00:45:34.000
terms of the reduction and the
oxidation.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.750
And we can plug in the values.
What is being reduced is B12.

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:44.429
What is being oxidized is
flavodoxin in the body.

00:45:44.429 --> 00:45:48.718
We can put in the numbers,
minus 0.526 volts.

00:45:48.718 --> 00:45:54.371
And then it is minus a negative
number of minus 0.23 volts.

00:45:54.371 --> 00:46:01.000
And we get out that the cell
potential is minus 0.296 volts.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.627
That is not going to be
spontaneous.

00:46:03.627 --> 00:46:07.154
It is a negative number for
delta E of the cell,

00:46:07.154 --> 00:46:10.232
which is going to mean what
about delta G?

00:46:10.232 --> 00:46:14.060
It is going to be positive.
No, it is definitely not

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:17.213
spontaneous.
And then we can continue to go

00:46:17.213 --> 00:46:21.791
on and plug in these numbers and
calculate what delta G nought

00:46:21.791 --> 00:46:23.743
would be.
By this equation,

00:46:23.743 --> 00:46:27.871
that we have seen many times
today, it is a one electron

00:46:27.871 --> 00:46:32.000
reduction, so one electron is
involved.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.902
We plug in Faraday's constant
and we plug in the cell

00:46:36.902 --> 00:46:41.710
potential, and we get plus 28.6
kilojoules per mole.

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:47.367
That is a very positive number.
It is a pretty big number for

00:46:47.367 --> 00:46:50.855
delta G.
So how does this reaction go?

00:46:50.855 --> 00:46:56.228
Why don't we all have heart
disease, megaloblastic anemia,

00:46:56.228 --> 00:47:01.242
problems finding our way home?
What happens?

00:47:01.242 --> 00:47:06.878
Well, the answer is that the
body has to apply energy to get

00:47:06.878 --> 00:47:09.936
the reaction to go.
In this case,

00:47:09.936 --> 00:47:14.522
the energy comes in the form of
a molecule called

00:47:14.522 --> 00:47:18.343
s-adenosylmethionine.
And the cleavage of

00:47:18.343 --> 00:47:23.598
s-adenosylmethionine generates,
the delta G for that is,

00:47:23.598 --> 00:47:30.000
minus 37.6 kilojoules per mole,
so it is very favorable.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.652
And it is more favorable than
this reaction is unfavorable.

00:47:34.652 --> 00:47:38.101
When you put those things
together, it goes.

00:47:38.101 --> 00:47:42.192
What do you call it when you
have a cell in which an

00:47:42.192 --> 00:47:46.122
unfavorable reaction is driven
by applying energy?

00:47:46.122 --> 00:47:50.213
What was that called that we
talked about last time?

00:47:50.213 --> 00:47:54.304
Yeah, electrolytic cell.
The body just does the same

00:47:54.304 --> 00:48:00.000
thing that you would to drive
any non-spontaneous reaction.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.378
It comes up with an energy
source, couples the reaction,

00:48:04.378 --> 00:48:08.676
and then the reaction goes.
Again, same principles that

00:48:08.676 --> 00:48:09.676
apply.
