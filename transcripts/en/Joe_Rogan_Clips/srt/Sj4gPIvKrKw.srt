1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Losing their job. Maybe one of those
things could also cause this trigger.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,980
We know with all mental health,

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,090
all aspects of mental health
or mental health problems.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,220
There were three kinds of calls, right?
There's, I'm a bit lost connections,

5
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:17,760
which about depression, anxieties, a lot
about this. There are biological causes,

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,790
things like your jeans,
real brain changes,

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,510
things like the introduction of a drug.
There are psychological causes,

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,820
how you think about yourself
and your place in the world.

9
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:30,600
And then there's environmental causes like
you know, how we live with each other,

10
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:32,910
things like loneliness,
that sort of thing. Um,

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,650
and in all mental health phenomena to
some degree these three sets of courses

12
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:40,980
play out. So let's think about
even something very dementia.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,660
Dementia has a very, obviously has
a heavy biological driver, right?

14
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,290
Dementia is a physical degeneration of
the brain or a disease like Alzheimer's.

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,970
Um, but even with dementia, which has
this very heavy biological driver,

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,390
we know there are big social
and psychological effects
that can mitigate it.

17
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,720
So if you're part of a strong community
and have lots of social connections,

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,630
if you have a positive self image,
if you speak other languages,

19
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,600
you're dementia will develop significantly
more slowly than if you don't have

20
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:10,080
any of these factors. Right?
So with things like psychosis,

21
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,840
there's a brilliant person
called Tanya Lurman,

22
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:16,890
Professor Tanya Lurman at
Stanford University who's
done really interesting, uh,

23
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,860
research and is having listened
to in great detail, but I
interviewed her, um, who,

24
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:21,694
who,
who's shown.

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,840
So we know recovery from psychosis or
schizophrenia is much stronger in African

26
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:29,580
countries than it is in the United States.
Right?

27
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,060
And it's not a genetic thing because
Africans who come to the United States end

28
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:36,480
up having the American level of recovery,
not the African level of recovery.

29
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,590
And again,
it's a while since I spoke turnout,

30
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,090
I don't want to overstate my confidence
about this, but there are other people,

31
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:45,060
there are people I think
including her who argue in part.

32
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:49,290
What's going on is in many, not
all. Some places it's really brutal,

33
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,380
but in many parts of Africa,
you remain part of the community.

34
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:54,300
Even if you have these mental
health problems, right?

35
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,140
They have much stronger social connections
is a study that asks Americans,

36
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,590
how many close friends do you have,
who you could tend to in a crisis?

37
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,430
And when they started doing it years ago,
the most common answer was five. Today,

38
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:08,580
the most common answer is none,
right? It's not the average,

39
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:12,390
but it's most common answer.
Half of all Americans asked,

40
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:15,720
how many people know you?
Well say nobody, right?

41
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,720
So a huge amount of evidence,
loneliness is toxic for human beings.

42
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,960
Lonely people as guided a lot of
experiments on this here in la,

43
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,810
lonely people exposed to the flu virus
and the cold virus and the coulds,

44
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,920
um, are way more likely to actually get
them to non lonely people, right? Um,

45
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,160
it's just devastating for your physical
and mental health to be lonely.

46
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:39,390
There's other things going on.

47
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,330
So I think there's a whole range of
things that are going on with all mental

48
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:44,310
health problems. I don't know how this
relates to cannabis and psychosis.

49
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:47,860
I don't want to, I don't know. But we
know with psychosis, yeah, there's,

50
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:50,730
there's a big debate about
this. Immigrants are more
likely to have psychosis.

51
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:52,670
The nonimmigrant says there's a whole,
um,

52
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,570
lots of environmental factors playing out,

53
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,010
even in extreme mental health problems.

54
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:59,980
Like now I wanna stress they're not the
only thing. There are real aspects as

55
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,940
well,
uh,

56
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,840
which are clearly very significant and
things like schizophrenia and play some

57
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:08,410
role in things like depression for
a lot of people. But, but yeah.

58
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,060
Does that make sense? Was it, I mean,

59
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:17,500
sort of, yeah. I mean, obviously
there's varying biological factors,

60
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:18,970
but the cultural factors make sense.

61
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:21,400
The fact that these
people in Africa are not,

62
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,530
they're not expelled from the community,

63
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,790
so they have a sense of bond and
maybe it's more easy to recover.

64
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,500
And one of the things that you hear about,

65
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,950
part of the problem with mental illness
is that people with Melton mental

66
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:36,400
illness are pushed away. People don't
want to deal with their problem,

67
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,580
and it exacerbates whatever is
causing it in the first place.
