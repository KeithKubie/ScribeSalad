so why do we need more fighter jets I do

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030
so why do we need more fighter jets I do
 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.610
so why do we need more fighter jets I do
not know we already have the best

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620
not know we already have the best

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.420
fighter jets and the f-16 the F you know
you know 15 and the f-18 so why do we

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430
you know 15 and the f-18 so why do we
 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.409
you know 15 and the f-18 so why do we
need the f-35 and what's even more

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419
need the f-35 and what's even more
 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.080
need the f-35 and what's even more
amazing is that we have spent more on

trillion dollars on the f-35 that's more

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810
trillion dollars on the f-35 that's more
 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.839
trillion dollars on the f-35 that's more
than Russia's GDP if the f-35 were a
