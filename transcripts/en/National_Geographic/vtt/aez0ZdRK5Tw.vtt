00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:12.244
<i> How do I help support
 these young women?</i>

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:14.247
<i> This is exactly what
 I had always hoped</i>

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:18.017
<i> is that we'd find a way that
 we could normalize bikes</i>

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.754
<i> so that we could get girls
 bikes to get to schools.</i>

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:29.929

Hi, everyone. Thanks
so much for coming out.

00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:36.369 line:0%
I am truly, truly
honored to be here

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:38.071 line:0%
at<i> National Geographic</i>
headquarters.

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:40.406
<i> So, let's be clear.</i>

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:42.609
<i> I did not go
 to Afghanistan</i>

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.978
<i> intending to ride
 a mountain bike.</i>

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:47.947
<i> I don't think anyone goes to
 an active war zone and thinks,</i>

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:51.016
"if only I had brought my
lycra and my single-speed."

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:53.085
You know, what was I thinking.

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:57.556
No, I started in Afghanistan,
my first visit in 2008

00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:58.591
to work with women and girls.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.629
<i> Afghanistan is repeatedly
 ranked by numerous indexes</i>

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.998
<i> as the worst place in the
 world to be a woman.</i>

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:10.136
<i> And yet, as a country where I
 have focused my attention</i>

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:11.538
for the last seven
to eight years

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:14.140
because I believe that women
and girls are the future.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.709
Not just in Afghanistan,
but around the world.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:20.179
Afghanistan is a country
that begs to be explored.

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:22.348
<i> It's insanely beautiful.</i>

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:24.583
<i> And I'm sure there may
 be one of two of you</i>

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:27.386
<i> that have been able to see the
 country in the 60s and 70s</i>

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:29.621
<i> when it was part of
 the tourist trail.</i>

00:01:29.621 --> 00:01:30.956
It was literally part
of the hippie trail.

00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:33.826
It had great marijuana, and
people were traveling through

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:37.296
to experience this in
the 1960s and 1970s.

00:01:37.963 --> 00:01:40.066
<i> It has a history
 with the Silk Road.</i>

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.235
<i> There's a lot of sports
 in Afghanistan now</i>

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:45.137
<i> that are open to
 women and girls.</i>

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:47.740
Bikes are the anomaly.

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.142
Cycling is a sport that is

00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:52.512
inherently taboo for
women and girls.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:55.415
<i> This is a shot from 2008.</i>

00:01:56.782 --> 00:01:58.817
<i> And this while she
 is in a burkha</i>

00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:01.488
<i> you have women in
 headscarves as well</i>

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:05.424
<i> riding side saddle, riding
 horses side saddle.</i>

00:02:05.424 --> 00:02:07.593
Riding motorcycles side saddle.

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:10.363
Regardless of their dress
they are not allowed

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:14.066
to straddle a bike seat,
motorcycle seat, or a horse.

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:15.802
It is considered
culturally obscene.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.671
And no good girl would do this.

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:22.174
As a matter of...

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:25.177
I live in Colorado
and point of fact

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.212
I'm a mountain biker.

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:29.048
<i> It is the sport I
 have come to love.</i>

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:32.018
<i> It is the sport that keeps
 me sane and grounded.</i>

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:35.921
And I started to explore
when I was in Afghanistan

00:02:35.921 --> 00:02:39.759
this concept that was presented
to me on my very first visit

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:41.694
of being a hybrid gender.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:46.666
In Afghanistan, as a foreign
woman, I obviously do not blend.

00:02:47.266 --> 00:02:51.771
I stand out and what I found
was rather than a hindrance

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:54.673
that was actually one
of my greatest assets.

00:02:54.673 --> 00:02:57.410
Because I wanted to work
with women and girls

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.611
but in Afghanistan the men
are the gate keepers.

00:02:59.611 --> 00:03:04.416
<i>And what I found was that I was
 considered an honorary man.</i>

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:08.354
<i>They knew I was a woman, but yet
 they treated me like a man.</i>

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:10.389
<i> They conversed with
 me like a man.</i>

00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:13.159
<i> They invited me to
 dinner like a man.</i>

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.795
So, over the next
four-five years

00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:18.464
I started pushing on
those gender barriers

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:21.401
and enjoying the interactions
that I had with Afghan men.

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:23.836
<i> Laughing and joking with them.</i>

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:26.839
<i> Fishing with them in
 the Panjshir River.</i>

00:03:27.774 --> 00:03:29.542
<i> They've allowed me
 to ride horses.</i>

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.277
<i> This is a Buzkashi horse.</i>

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:33.646
<i> If a woman rides a horse,</i>

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:37.049
the idea is that that Buzkashi
horse will never compete again.

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.785
So, it was a huge honor to
be able to ride this horse

00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:41.887
that later competed in that
game and did well.

00:03:41.887 --> 00:03:43.823
<i> And it was only really
 a matter of time</i>

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:47.092
<i> before I would decide to bring
 my bike to Afghanistan.</i>

00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:50.163
<i> And on my third visit in 2009,</i>

00:03:50.696 --> 00:03:53.265
<i> I brought over my
 single-speed 29er.</i>

00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:55.634
And experimented in
the Panjshir Valley.

00:03:55.634 --> 00:03:59.171
I'd been working there,
asking people if they thought

00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:01.441
it would be okay
if I rode a bike

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:05.644
I mean, would that offend them,
and tried to source that out.

00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:08.581
Everyone was
supportive of the idea.

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:11.184
And I went in an
area where I knew

00:04:11.184 --> 00:04:12.518
that it was clear
of land mines,

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:16.122
that I knew was...
relatively safe and

00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:17.423
where the locals knew me.

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:20.660
And I started doing little rides

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.230
just to experiment what would
happen if a girl rode a bike.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.765
Afghanistan is one of the
only countries in the world

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:29.735
where girls and women are
not allowed to ride.

00:04:29.768 --> 00:04:32.972
It's not illegal like
it was in Saudi Arabia.

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:35.607
It's simply not allowed.

00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:39.111
<i> The men that I encounter
 are so flabbergasted</i>

00:04:39.111 --> 00:04:41.080
<i> and so overwhelmed
 with curiosity</i>

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.118
<i> that the normal barriers that
 we have are just blown away.</i>

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:50.590
<i> So, security guards,
 Afghan National Police,</i>

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.759
the Army, they've
all ridden my bike.

00:04:54.393 --> 00:04:56.462
I may have ridden
theirs if they had one.

00:04:56.462 --> 00:05:00.166
And what I realized was
that in that sharing,

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:02.802
that I could maybe
finagle a back door.

00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.772
And in one case in point
it was Darul Aman Palace.

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:08.474
<i> Darul Aman Palace was the
 king's palace in Kabul.</i>

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:11.677
<i> It was... it became ground
 zero during the Civil War</i>

00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:13.879
<i> before Taliban times for
 a lot of different base camps</i>

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:17.149
for Mujahedin fighters, there's
bullet holes all throughout

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:19.018
Islamic graffiti inside.

00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:22.555
I wanted to visit inside and

00:05:22.555 --> 00:05:25.591
see what the inside had
looked like, desperately.

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:27.960
And I kept going
back every visit.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.130
I've been there 19 times now,
and I, every single time

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:33.499
was like "I'm going to get in.

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:35.100
It's going to be a different
day, a different guard

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.637
charm him, he's going
to let me in."

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:38.638
And, no, never.

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:42.041
So, I had my bike one day

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:43.910
and went for a bike
ride with a friend

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.812
up to, and just did hot laps
around Darul Aman Palace.

00:05:46.812 --> 00:05:49.715
We were just riding around...
the roads.

00:05:49.715 --> 00:05:51.884
And this man comes up.

00:05:52.784 --> 00:05:55.021
<i> Turns out...
 through the access of</i>

00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:57.190
<i> I'm on a bike, you're on a
 bike, let's talk bikes.</i>

00:05:58.758 --> 00:05:59.825
<i> He's the gardener.</i>

00:05:59.825 --> 00:06:02.829
He's been the gardener since
he was nine years old.

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:05.331
He says that he's 88.

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:06.531
But in Afghanistan
very few people

00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:08.167
know what their
real age is.

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:09.769
But he says he's 88,

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:12.471
that he's been the gardener
since he was a young boy.

00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:14.107
So, he's seen everything.

00:06:14.107 --> 00:06:17.143
He's like
little nugget of history

00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:19.445
embodied in an amazing man

00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:22.147
who immediately said,
"well, why are you here?"

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.182
I said, "well, I just...

00:06:23.182 --> 00:06:25.551
I'm fascinated by the
history of this place.

00:06:26.118 --> 00:06:27.753
I've always wanted
to go inside."

00:06:27.753 --> 00:06:30.356
And he walks over, he's like,

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:31.858
"go give him your bike."

00:06:31.858 --> 00:06:34.159
And walk, and not give it
to him, give it to him.

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.361
Like, let's give it for a ride.

00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:37.963
So, I asked the security guards
if he wants to ride my bike.

00:06:38.897 --> 00:06:42.368
They come out, discover
the joys of disc brakes.

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:43.402
And he face plants.

00:06:43.402 --> 00:06:44.403
( audience laughter )

00:06:44.403 --> 00:06:45.738
And I think we've
ruined any chance

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:47.339
that I've ever had
to get in this place.

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:52.411
And he dusts himself off, and
shakes, kind of embarrassed.

00:06:52.411 --> 00:06:54.480
But he's blood-free,
thank goodness.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.150
And all of them take, there's
three security guards,

00:06:58.183 --> 00:07:00.853
they're Afghan National
Police, guarding this place.

00:07:00.853 --> 00:07:04.056
They open the gate of
barbed wire, let me in,

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:07.759
not just me, myself, but
me, myself, and my bike.

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:10.896
<i> And allow me and my
 bike to go inside</i>

00:07:10.896 --> 00:07:16.001
<i> and ride up and down the halls
 and experience what was once</i>

00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:17.569
<i> one the most
 incredibly beautiful</i>

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:18.738
<i> places in Afghanistan.</i>

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:19.772
<i> The King's Palace.</i>

00:07:19.872 --> 00:07:23.876
But it was one of those
experiences where you realize

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:28.314
that again, it's access,
it's a human connection.
