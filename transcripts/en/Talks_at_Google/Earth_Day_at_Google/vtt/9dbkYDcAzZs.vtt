00:00:01.559 --> 00:00:02.850
MALE SPEAKER: Hello, everybody.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.470
Welcome to this talk on
[INAUDIBLE] to green.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.000
So we have Mr. Gauranga Das from
the Govardhan Ecovillage, which

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.200
is a model community
that's based

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.239
on this principle of
sustainable living and putting

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:20.480
into practice what
we believe in.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.010
So basically, foundation
of this principle

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.350
is that, as Mahatma
Gandhi said, there

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.480
is enough for everybody's
need, but there's not

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.560
enough for everybody's greed.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.450
So if you have a
lifestyle that's

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.770
based on satisfying the
basic needs of human being

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.010
and be able to live a healthy,
happy life of a sustainable

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.100
nature, that's the
best gift we can

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.060
do for our future generations.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.840
So based on this principle,
the Govhardhan Ecovillage

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.370
started like 10 years back.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.530
And when we had, in
terms of technologies,

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.770
to implement a
sustainable living.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.820
So Gauranga Das is a
metallurgical engineer

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.180
from the prestigious Indian
Institute of Technology.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.940
And he's a director
of this project.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.490
We're really happy that he's
here at Google to give us

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.197
a talk on some of
the technologies,

00:01:14.197 --> 00:01:16.030
as well as any other
questions you may have.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.640
So we'll have the presentation
for about like 40 minutes

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.850
and then open up for
questions at the end.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.308
So with that, let's
give a big hand

00:01:22.308 --> 00:01:23.510
to welcome Mr. Gauranga Das.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.320
GAURANGA DAS: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.415
On behalf of
Govardhan Ecovillage,

00:01:32.415 --> 00:01:35.550
I'd like to make this
presentation-- Symbiotic

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.990
Recycling at
Govardhan Ecovillage.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.570
So we have a 75 acre property.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.330
And we're trying to
showcase solutions

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.870
to four issues-- food,
water, energy, and waste.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.220
So we have tried out
some interesting methods

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.850
to try to provide solutions.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.920
And I'm going to
share with you some

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.860
of the things
which we have done.

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.960
As you know, economy,
society, and environment--

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.410
can they go hand in hand?

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.820
So the current paradigm
is that we produce goods,

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.300
they're used to by the industry,
used by the population,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.990
and then thrown out.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.560
What do we do with the wastes?

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.470
So therefore, with the
increase in energy consumption,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.970
we find that people are using
more energy, creating more

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.180
waste, and as a
result, there's also

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.530
depletion of water resources.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.470
And we're depleting resources
and increasing wastes.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.700
Ecological resilience is
strained the utmost limits.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.910
And also, even if you
want to handle wastes,

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.930
then the cost is exorbitant.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.270
So we found that in
the last 100 years,

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.560
that has been a paradigm shift
from decreasing resources

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.170
to increasing wastes.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.680
And as a result, we
assume that nature

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.130
will subsidize the cost of
converting the wastes back

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.190
into resources.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.260
So it doesn't happen
like that because only

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.620
to a certain extent
nature will do that.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.220
Therefore, ecological
resilience strained to a limit

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.550
is a very interesting
feature, because government

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.750
is spending a tremendous
amount of money

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.680
to bring things under control.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.300
When we find that
food costs are rising,

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.880
air pollution is
increasing, and we

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.770
find that transportation
costs is increased,

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.050
it becomes extremely
difficult for solid waste

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.360
to be transported
and what to speak

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.310
of water, which
is such a demand.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.060
And we find that water
is being utilized

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.870
for more and more activities.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.830
And the next crisis is seriously
going to be that of water.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.710
So considering
that, we are trying

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.380
to figure out what is the root
cause analysis of the problem.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.640
So you find that the root
cause solution, the root cause

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.630
is the irreversible conversion
of resources into wastes.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.410
The concept we thought of, if we
could devise a system by which

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.910
the wastes could be converted
back into resources then

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.970
the problem of increasing
waste and decreasing resources

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.840
could be solved, because
we'll have a sustainable loop.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.410
Then, ecological
resilience strained

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.720
to a limit, if the waste
becomes a resource, then

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.820
you a reversible system which
is very close to nature,

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.820
because that's what
nature naturally does.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.910
And the increasing
cost of waste handling

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.530
would be irrelevant, because
your waste is actually

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.210
becoming a resource.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.980
So therefore, waste--
in definition--

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.800
is an object which neither in
partial or totality contributes

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.930
to the end goal of a system.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.570
So we have two kinds of waste--
immediate waste and delayed

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:59.810
waste.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.110
And therefore, we were
trying to figure out

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.900
a concept where the
waste could actually

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.460
become the resource
for the next system.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.000
Then that second
system produces a waste

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.470
that, if it becomes a
resource for the third system,

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.700
then through this
methodology, we'll

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.320
have something called a
symbiotic recycling, where

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.820
every waste is
becoming a resource.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.480
And in one sense, we
are trying to remodel

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.120
what naturally
happens in nature.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.840
In nature, we go
through the cycle.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.270
And the cyclical
chain takes one system

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.850
to the next system in a
smooth, seamless fashion.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.660
We also find it
in the water cycle

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.640
and in the nitrogen cycle, where
seamlessly, one system just

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.160
merges into the other system,
because the waste of one system

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.150
becomes a resource
for another system.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.280
So therefore, in a linear
model, what we find

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.690
is that the resource being
consumed converts into waste.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.560
So this is a linear
resource-to-trash model,

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.210
where at the end of
all the resources,

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.130
you're left with a
whole lot of wastes.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.330
And we do not have any
clue how to deal with them.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.690
Whereas, in a system
of symbiotic recycling,

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.070
instead of the resource
being converted

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.600
to waste as a consumer,
the resource actually

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.020
converts into a waste and
waste one becomes resource two.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.570
So it actually
becomes a contributor.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.190
So we are devising a system by
which the consumer is no longer

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.250
called a consumer, he will
be called a contributor.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.490
And therefore,
this is the system

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.030
which we're trying to
apply in our ecovillage.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.860
And I'll share with you
the details very soon.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.240
So basically,
sustainability is defined

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.550
as the interface between
bearability, viability,

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.470
and equitability when
social, environment,

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.520
and economic factors interface.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.510
So when we are discussing
the whole concept

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.130
of sustainability,
then human society,

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.530
if it has to remain for
long periods of time,

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.760
has to be in this
operating zone.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.530
Therefore, the top 10
problems of the world

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.850
is global warming, economic
collapse, peak oil and energy

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:24.110
consumption, urbanization,
water crisis, malnutrition,

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.810
nuclear proliferation,
war, terrorism,

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:29.630
and loss of biodiversity.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.330
And at the ecovillage, we try to
integrate all of these factors

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:34.760
together.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.430
And we try to address the issue
of global warming by making

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.240
green buildings and integrating
a green waste management

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.040
system, global economic
collapse with rural empowerment,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.490
peak oil and energy consumption/
energy crisis by using

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:54.670
alternative energy
and using animals,

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:58.210
urbanization and population
by rural empowerment,

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.900
global water crisis with our
water conservation and soil

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.390
biotechnology-- which is a
green technology for sewage

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.340
management, which I'll be
sharing with you right now--

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.980
malnutrition and food security
issues by using organic

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.210
agriculture, and loss of
biodiversity and species

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:19.020
extinction with also
organic agriculture.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.730
So basically, ours was a
community set up in 2003.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.090
You must have a lot of
place called Mumbai,

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:29.320
and 108 kilometers away
from Mumbai on the north

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.980
is the Govardhan Ecovillage.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.240
And the concept of GEV's based
on sustainable technologies,

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.630
which are very effective
in urban, semi-urban,

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.510
and rural areas.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:46.840
As far as waste is concerned,
four types of waste

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.430
are created in our property.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:52.350
We have animal waste
and food waste.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.730
Second is we have dry,
biodegradable waste

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.210
like foliage.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.770
And then you have
non-biodegradable--

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.910
that is plastics and
construction aggregate.

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:05.890
And human waste, the black
and grey water, et cetera,

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.970
which constitute the sewage.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.470
So therefore, how do
we fit in the puzzle

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.990
with all of these wastes
being put together?

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:18.580
So let's spend a few moments
on this picture, where

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.000
the entire concept of
symbiotic recycling

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.310
is explained at one glance.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.530
So you look at to figure
where there is this cow.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:33.690
So the cow eats on the
grass and it gives cow dung.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.670
OK, so the input for
the cow is the grass.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:39.720
The grass is the
fodder for the cow.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.060
The output from the
cow is the cow dung.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.970
So interestingly enough for
many of you-- who may or may not

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:50.100
know-- one of the
best forms of manure

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:54.070
which we have experimented
with is made with cow dung.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:59.730
So cow dung is one of the
top-notch fertilizers which

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.180
actually creates such
a fertile ground.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:08.220
So if you leave the cow
and the earth alone,

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.260
both will sustain each other.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.680
The earth will give grass.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.030
The cow will eat the
good, give cow dung.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.690
That cow dung will give more
grass when it hits the ground.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:23.000
And in this way, both take care
of each other perfectly well.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.250
It's a sustainable system.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.660
But then, you bring
in human being.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.040
So the human, he wants to live.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.450
OK, so naturally, he
cannot live under the sky.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.230
So he needs a house to live.

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.860
OK, so what do we do?

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.760
The human being needs three
things-- a house to live,

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.180
a food to eat,
energy to sustain.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.710
So if you look at this
figure, you find a hut.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:56.690
That house is made
with mud blocks.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:01.520
So we created 250,000
blocks made out of mud,

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.030
adding 8% cement, and
they're called compassed,

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.040
stabilized earth blocks.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.520
It's called green building.

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:11.460
It's called green earth blocks.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:16.530
So when you have buildings which
are made out of earth blocks,

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.560
then it's a breathing
wall and you have very low

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.950
embodied energy.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:25.000
OK, so you have created
a dwelling place

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.650
which is as green as possible.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.710
But then, he also
needs food to eat.

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.280
So how does the food come?

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.180
So from the cow dung,
you have other kinds

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.220
of crops which can be grown.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.440
So on that card what
you see is rice.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.760
So one of the greatest
challenges in India

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.080
is also to preserve the
indigenous varieties of rice.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:51.730
So on our property, we grow 54
varieties of indigenous rice.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.160
And you'll be amazed to know
that some of those varieties

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.290
are highly medicinal
in property.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:59.130
And simply by consuming
those varieties of rice,

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:02.690
many of the medical
problems can be solved.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:06.060
So therefore, indigenous
varieties of rice--

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.890
but without using harmful
chemical pesticides

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:13.940
and fertilizers-- and with
that, the organic farming

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.790
you grow this food.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.840
So the input for
that is the cow dung.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.510
The output is the food.

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:23.270
Then, the food is eaten
by the human being.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:28.540
And then, what comes out-- now
you need the food to be cooked.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.570
So how do you use that?

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.990
So the cow dung,
again, is used in what

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.940
is known as a bio-gas plant.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.660
So in a bio-gas plant,
cow dung becomes an input.

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.290
And what comes out is fuel.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:47.530
And that fuel is
used for cooking.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.200
And that cooking
ultimately cooks

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.980
the food which the
humans can eat.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.760
And then, after the humans
eat that, what comes out

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.370
is the sewage.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:03.090
So you see on the right side
is this rectangular structure.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:06.050
That is the sewage
treatment plant,

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:09.750
which is known as the
soil biotechnology plant.

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:12.220
And we'll discuss
about that also.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.410
But that input for
that is the sewage.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.480
The sewage comes
out, and it goes

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.680
through that sewage
technology plant.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.570
And what comes out
is fish fit water.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:27.840
Fish fit water means water
in which fishes can dwell.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.140
But it's a completely
green sewage technology

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:35.940
with hardly any downtime and
practically no sound at all.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.210
And it is composed of rocks in
different layers, geofigures,

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.880
earthworms, and various
kinds of bio-reactors

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:49.640
which generate over 10 million
liters of sewage-- sewage water

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:54.090
can water 10 million liters
of fresh water every year.

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:56.880
And that output, which
is irrigatable water,

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.570
goes into irrigation.

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.190
That output becomes the
input for the fields.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:06.000
And then again, the
same chain continues.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.760
So we have in this
way created a system

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.620
by which every output
is becoming an input.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:20.380
And thus, we are regenerating
sources of energy

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.110
which we would not
have thought of before.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.170
So this is, in brief, what
we are trying to describe.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.640
So therefore, food, shelter,
and energy is required.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.910
And what human being
generates is waste, sewage,

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:38.090
construction waste,
and domestic waste.

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:41.270
OK, so fulfilling the
human need, food is there,

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.670
the grain is there, the
milk products is there.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:45.850
And this is the actual
pictures of what

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.940
we are grown there on our plant.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.830
We have 100 varieties
of mango, also.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.060
Mango is a fruit which
grows very famously

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.040
in [INAUDIBLE] in that area.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:00.640
So we have sugar cane,
rice, [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.670
and various kinds
of organic fruits.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.280
And if you see
here, what you see

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.110
in that [INAUDIBLE]
bed is earthen bricks.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.730
That is a construction
waste which

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:14.820
is utilized for creating
permanent and raised bed

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.000
system.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.620
So the permanent
raised bed system

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:19.290
is a technique by
which you increase

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.090
the productivity
of organic farming.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:24.420
And we can use all
kinds of wastes

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:28.860
which are generated from
construction for creating that.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.270
So we also have an
animal farm, where

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:34.020
we protect all these
different kinds of animals.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.670
And there's a whole free
range available for them to go

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.050
and graze.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:42.360
And we have created very
huge, nice facilities for them

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.240
to feel completely
protected and at ease.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.950
On a regular basis, every week,
all of the community members

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.580
go and brush these
animals-- these cows

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.070
and other animals--
with brushes.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.220
And we have created such
a beautiful relationship

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:02.650
with them that they
feel totally at ease

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:06.000
and very, very friendly with
anyone who approaches them.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.990
And they also give
very nice milk.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:13.360
So then we have--
as far as food is

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.160
concerned-- that is taken care.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.300
Then as far as that
accommodation--

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.850
compressed and
stabilized earth blocks.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.700
So these are some of
the guest rooms which

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.880
we have created with
the CSEB-- Compressed

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.160
to Stabilized Earth Blocks.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:34.530
So basically, it is
one portion of cement

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:35.610
to six portion of sand.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:40.410
And the rest is all--
one cement, one mud,

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.780
and four stone dust.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.580
The difference
between the energy

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:48.510
consumed you can see--
72.3 megajoules per kg

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:52.490
versus 0.275 megajoules per kg.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.400
A compressed to
stabilized earth block

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.760
has such low embodied energy.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.710
So you are saving such a major
amount of carbon footprint,

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:05.829
just by deciding not to
utilize paint and plaster

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:09.819
method for making walls.

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:13.099
And thus, we find
that the energy we use

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.500
is solar and
bio-gas for cooking.

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.119
These are some of
the solar panels.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.680
And what you see on the
right-hand bottom side

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.560
is what is known
as a bio-gas plant.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.250
You see the [INAUDIBLE] moving.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:30.500
So that is known as ADPM--
Animal Driven Prime Mover.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.590
So it is connected
to a gear system.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:35.060
And then it helps
pump the water out.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:39.870
And that water is utilized for
irrigating the fields nearby.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:44.320
And then, we have handling
of human waste, construction

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:49.220
waste, and other construction
material inercity.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:53.550
And basically, recycling
the non-biodegradable wastes

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:57.240
is done in various ways.

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.490
We use it for waterproofing
of roof in construction.

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.050
Because for
waterproofing, you need

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:05.320
many of these bricks which are
broken and not in good shape.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.280
They are utilized for
waterproofing of the roof.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.460
The dust which is generated
during construction

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:15.480
is used for making agarbatti--
or incense sticks-- made out

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.360
of cow dung.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.880
So it's a cow product-based
small scale industry.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:22.290
Then, as I showed in
the picture before,

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:24.450
the bricks which are
broken down can also

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:27.570
be used for making permanent
raised-bed technology.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.370
Then, many of these
leaves and grasses

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:35.460
which are part of biodegradable
waste are used for mulching.

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.910
Mulching is a technique by which
you cover the plants around

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:40.810
so that they get some
kind of fertilizer.

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:44.310
And at the same time, the
moisture which is there

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.980
is retained.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.130
And the plastics
and others are also

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.832
used as-- suppose cement
bags are generated.

00:18:52.832 --> 00:18:54.290
So if the cement
bags are there, we

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.510
use them for composting
and plant bags.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.040
We are re-utilizing
them that way.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:02.900
And some of the
other wastes we use

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.920
in the walls for
which we make cob.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.400
So cob house is
actually mud house,

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.110
but the walls can
actually be filled

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.350
with various kinds
of wastes which

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:16.400
are around-- say bottles or
tires or anything can be put

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.440
inside, and then covered
over and plastered with mud.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.130
So a lot of wastes
are also re-utilized

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.670
in the walls of the cob house.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.320
So in this way, we
are trying to use

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.930
the non-biodegradable
wastes in this fashion.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:38.220
Then we have the domestic waste
and the food and cattle waste.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:42.750
And other biodegradable waste,
all that is used in composting.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.720
Because it can be
composted, and it

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:49.080
can be used as manure
for agriculture.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.450
So, the whole community,
it is very sensitive

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.310
to separate all of these wastes.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:57.790
Because as you know,
the number one principle

00:19:57.790 --> 00:20:01.010
of waste management is
separation at source.

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.740
And if we do not
separate at source,

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.040
we cannot have a successful
waste management plan.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.980
So therefore, this
composting unit

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.590
is utilized in organic farming.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.000
So it is used in
bio-gas plant, and it

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.190
comes from cow barn, organic
farming, and community kitchen.

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:21.150
These are the three sources of
giving us animal waste and food

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.940
waste inputs.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.830
So all of these three go
into the bio-gas plant

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.070
and give energy.

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:29.160
The input is from these wastes.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:33.610
The output is energy which
is utilized for cooking.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:35.310
So this is a picture of that.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:41.890
And then, we have
the last, which

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:44.380
is the sewage-- or human waste.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:48.220
And that is recycled in what is
known as the soil biotechnology

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.400
plant.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.970
And the soil biotechnology
plant is actually

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:56.230
an IET Mumbai patented plant.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:59.970
It is created by a Doctor
Biplab Patnaik, who

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.680
was one of my classmates
from IET Mumbai.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.320
And I knew when he was doing
his PhD in '90, '93, '94,

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.770
in that period.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.960
So Professor Shankar
and Dr. Biplab Patnaik

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.970
created this technology.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:16.270
And the principle is very
simple-- water, by nature,

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:16.770
regenerates.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.460
Even you don't drink
water for a few hours,

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.270
you feel energy going down.

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:29.880
So as soon as you start drinking
water, you generate energy.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.400
As soon as the plants get
water, they start generating.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.640
So water is a
regenerating medium.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:41.220
Whereas, the earth is best
for these degeneration,

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.050
because the number of
bacteria which are in earth

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:46.700
is several hundred times
more than the bacteria

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.010
which is there in water.

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:52.760
So therefore, the
degradation and degeneration

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.260
happens more effectively,
more efficiently,

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:59.050
naturally, in earth
than in water.

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:02.250
So previously, all
of the wastes would

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:04.680
be actually dumped
in the outside.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.980
And people would
in the out and then

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.340
they would respond to
the call of nature.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.390
Then we had this
flush-driven toilet system.

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:14.880
So because of the
flush-driven toilet system,

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.700
we had water as the
medium for transporting

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.080
all of the gray and black water.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.450
So as a result, what do you
do with all of that waste?

00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:28.490
So the statistics reveal that
very few municipalities all

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.910
over the world-- city
councils all over the world--

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:35.220
take the trouble of actually
processing that waste

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.280
before they dump
it into the ocean.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.100
So the majority of
the times, it just

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:43.630
goes, because the cost of
handling that is enormous.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:48.280
So the thought
behind SBD was that,

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.980
since you cannot now tell
people to go out-- you know,

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.640
they have to use the toilet,
so as far as water-based,

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.920
gravity-driven sewage
system is concerned,

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.964
that cannot be replaced.

00:22:59.964 --> 00:23:02.380
But what if that water which
is brought through the sewage

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:06.440
system can finally be
processed through a soil-based,

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.320
earth-based,
purification system?

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:13.330
So it is combining
the ancient wisdom

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:18.100
of using earth as a purifying
medium with the modern usage

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.400
of the flush toilet system.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.810
So then we have what is
known as SBD bio-reactor.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:27.520
It goes into the SBD
system-- the human waste.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.950
And output which comes
out is fish-fit water

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:33.320
which is used for
nursery and landscaping.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:40.380
OK, so basically, the SBD
is very powerful system.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:40.880
Why?

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.550
Because septic tank-based
system is-- many times,

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:47.340
it creates foul
odor and it clogs,

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:49.300
and then it spills
over and creates

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:53.270
lot of difficulties in
rural areas especially.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:56.520
So here, when we have
an SBD-based system--

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.060
so we have at least 10
million liter of water

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.960
to be used for irrigation.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.110
Number two, the
solid waste-- it also

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:07.590
creates photosynthetic biomass
for internal use, which

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:09.590
is like manure.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:14.040
So basically, this is how
a schematic looks like.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:17.400
This is the stage one
of the SBD system,

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:21.800
where from the last manhole,
then the pipe comes in,

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.470
then you see those two
perforated screens-- that

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:26.990
separates the solid
waste from the liquid--

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:30.270
and then the liquid comes
in, goes on a settling tank,

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.570
and the overflow goes
into the next tank, which

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.580
is called the collection tank.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:38.440
From the collection tank
through a transfer pump,

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.800
it is fed in through
the feed lines

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.310
into the SBD bio-reactive unit.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:47.800
So you see those rocks,
they appear as hard rocks.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.790
But they're not hard rocks.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:54.010
When you have a lot of
mud which is hardened

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:56.650
over a period of
time, naturally, then

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:00.640
has as a fantastic
phenomenon of being hard,

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.660
but at the same
time it is porous.

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.800
It is porous because it allows
the water to flow through.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.950
At the same time, even
if water flows through,

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:11.860
it will not disintegrate
like regular mud.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.910
It will not flow with the mud.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:16.250
So that is one of the
secrets of this plant.

00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:19.410
And along with that, you
add geophagus earthworms

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:25.329
who have a natural tendency
off purifying and converting.

00:25:25.329 --> 00:25:27.370
So then, along with that,
you have specific kinds

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:30.450
of plants which
you grow in that.

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:34.230
And when you do that, what comes
out is this fish-fit water.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:36.400
And this is how the
SBD unit looks like.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.900
If you look at it
from outside, this

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.120
is a sewage treatment plant.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.330
It looks like a garden.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:45.140
These are the papayas
which are grown there.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.380
And you know, there is a
whole discussion going on

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.620
that these papayas look
bigger than the normal.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.500
They're well fed--
powerful looking.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.140
And you'll see in
the bottle, it's

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.790
the purified water which
is completely clear.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:00.180
So impact assessment,
if you see,

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:05.480
that as far as treatment is
concerned-- sludge handling is

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.450
concerned, aeration
is concerned--

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:10.090
is SBD-- the soil
biotechnologies-- scores

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:13.030
over the conventional
unit hands down.

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:13.770
Why?

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:17.930
Because practically no chemical
is required for treatment.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:19.820
Sludge handling
hardly is required,

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:23.540
because we have around two
and a half kilometers--

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.790
yeah, two kilometers
of line which come in.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.410
And by the time it
comes in, the water

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:32.570
has already kind of taken care
of all of the solid wasted.

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:35.010
So comes out is like
a liquid slurry.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:37.470
So sludge handling
is hardly there.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.680
And thirdly, as far as
aeration is concerned,

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.730
there is no requirement
for aeration,

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:44.810
because it's a simple,
gravity-driven,

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.880
you know, earth-based,
rock-based system.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.370
So there's no need for aeration.

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.140
So there's no need for
high mechanization.

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.080
There's no downtime required.

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.930
There is no sound
created, so it can

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:59.640
be installed very close
to human dwellings.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:05.540
Because conventional septic
tanks and conventional units

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:07.520
for STPs-- sewage
treatment plants--

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.550
cannot be installed very
near where people stay

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:13.810
because of the sound it
creates for the aeration unit.

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:17.910
And so we can see such a low
energy expended for one liter

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:22.401
sewage is less than
0.01 kilowatt hour.

00:27:22.401 --> 00:27:23.900
So these are some
of the advantages.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:27.510
It's sustainable, ease
of installation, recovery

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:32.480
efficiency-- we practically
recover 95% of the water--

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.910
and we are, as I said, 10
million liters of freshwater

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:36.830
we are generating.

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.540
And it's power saving.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:43.610
And also, we have this biomass
flowers, bio-fertilizers,

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.750
and we have a whole garden
which is created around that.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:50.990
So flowers and fruits are
generated also along with that.

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:57.880
The BOD, the COD, the
units-- if you compare,

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.530
it's very, very low,
you can see that.

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:04.960
The standard specification
is maximum 250.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.620
So in December, 2012 and Jan.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:11.170
2013 when we began, we
have some of these figures.

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:15.510
So you can see the treated
water is 42 and 38.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:16.010
Right?

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:20.390
Chemically oxidized,
and then BOD.

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:25.010
So biological also--
it's 18 and16,

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:28.440
which is much less than
the standard specification.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.600
Suspended solids are very
less, and total dissolved

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.240
solids which also came
out to be extremely low.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:40.630
Standard specification is
2,100, here we had 402.

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:44.970
So overall, we have found
that this symbiotic recycling

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:46.690
has turned out to be great.

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:50.010
As far as cost is concerned,
we are recovering the cost,

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.230
and we are saving
a lot on energy.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.420
We are saving on the
monthly cost a net savings.

00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:59.040
And in this way, we can see
that the value created by SBD

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.700
is also tremendous,
because it saves us

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.970
around 35,000 rupees per annum
on the water being generated

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.200
and 2 million tons of biomass.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.400
And what to speak of
the co-products which

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.927
are produced as a result of
the waste created from the cow

00:29:11.927 --> 00:29:13.460
dung?

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:17.510
And this is a 10
million liter pond.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.470
You see the mountains behind
are called the Sahyadri Mountain

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:21.360
Ranges.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:25.560
It's one of the top biodiversity
hotspots in the world.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.970
The monsoons hit against that,
now it's lashing like anything.

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:32.970
July to September, you'll get
3,000 millimeters of rain.

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:35.700
London gets around 500 to 600.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.330
So in this three to four
months, the amount of rain

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:41.000
which falls-- so we
need to conserve that.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Because as you know, India's
population is 1.2 billion,

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.520
out of which 820 million
live in villages.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.070
And villages very
much live upon water.

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.750
So therefore, if we
create a model by which we

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:56.890
show an ideal example
of water conservation,

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.340
it can transform the
landscape of the country.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.600
So the step one in doing
this water consideration

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.170
is what is known as
hydrogeological survey.

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.630
So there is a firm
called ACWADAM in Pune,

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:08.970
and we employed them.

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:11.420
And they did a complete
hydrogeological survey,

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:16.210
which means they showed the
movement of the ground water

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:17.840
under your property.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.460
And they showed the potential
moment of the rainwater

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:24.640
once the rain hits, depending
on the topography of the land.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.760
So it costs a little
bit to do this survey,

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:32.220
but once you do that, you have a
very accurate estimate of where

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.280
you must try to
conserve the rainwater,

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.780
and where you should
dig the wells.

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:39.270
And this water conservation
is closely connected

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:40.940
to organic farming.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:41.770
Why?

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:44.880
Because one of the major
culprits for groundwater

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.920
contamination is fertilizers
and insecticides.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.470
And when the rains
fall, then the rains

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:53.350
percolate down into
the groundwater

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:55.420
and pollute the aquifers.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:58.010
And when the overflow
comes through,

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:01.090
it pollutes all the
rivers and the ponds.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:04.330
All of this rainwater
carries the insecticides

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:06.500
and the pesticides with them.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.720
So if we think that we can
separate water conservation

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.050
from farming, it
is not possible.

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:14.880
Because what we
use as fertilizers,

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.910
pesticides, and insecticides
in our organic farming

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:20.520
will ultimately come
back in the form

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.330
of contaminated groundwater.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:27.960
So therefore, we partnered with
the government of Maharashtra.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.480
And we had a geo-membrane
laid in this particular patch

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.610
of land.

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:34.850
And according to the
hydrogeological survey,

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:38.320
this place was shown to be the
best for conserving the water.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:40.480
So the water hits against
the mountains, flows down

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:44.480
the mountains, and this
10 million liters water

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.850
is filled up in three
day of rainfall.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:50.314
In three days of rainfall,
it is full and overflowing.

00:31:50.314 --> 00:31:51.730
And then we have
created a channel

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:54.020
through which it goes farther.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:58.570
And then, we have
created-- this is actually

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:02.040
what you call as a
rainwater harvesting unit.

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.700
Then you have
another unit-- which

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.130
is called percolation
tank-- by which

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:09.010
we allow the rainwater
to go through the earth,

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:12.460
down, and regenerate
the aquifers.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:16.970
So all of the extra water from
here goes into the other pond.

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:20.370
And then, that pond
actually percolates down.

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:22.650
And overall, in the
last four years,

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:25.950
we have seen that our
groundwater levels have come up

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:31.240
by three feet because of
continuous percolation.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.030
So in this way, we can see
that the linear systems prove

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:36.430
to be injurious,
costlier and inadequate.

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:38.890
Symbiotic systems
are more efficient.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:42.790
And these systems which
are implemented in GEV

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:44.710
can be scaled up.

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:46.429
And we already in
dialogue with FICI--

00:32:46.429 --> 00:32:48.470
which is Federation of
Indian Chamber of Commerce

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:53.270
and Industry-- and CII--
Chamber of Indian Industries--

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:55.800
and also the government
of Maharashtra.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:59.040
And we are trying ways and means
by which this can be scaled up,

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.540
and the example can be utilized
in various other places.

00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:04.940
We have tried it
to great success,

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:08.390
and it is up to the government
and the corporate agencies

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:11.300
to utilize the
resources to scale it up

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:12.750
for the help of society.

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:16.110
An SBD is definitely a quite
green and more effective

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:17.694
than any other system.

00:33:17.694 --> 00:33:19.610
So these are some of the
thoughts on Govardhan

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:21.400
Ecovillage Symbiotic Recycling.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:21.900
Thank you.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:22.896
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:29.272 --> 00:33:31.730
AUDIENCE: Do you have a sense
of how large a community this

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:33.480
could be scaled up to,
or is that entirely

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.770
dependent on the geography?

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:40.290
GAURANGA DAS: Basically,
there is a certain thumb rule,

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:42.680
as far as community
is concerned.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:47.250
Say for 75 acres,
we don't want to go

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:50.900
beyond 200 people
living in a community.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:54.310
Because there's a very
short amount of food,

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:57.440
and the milk, and the grazing
land, and things like that.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:01.450
Ideally, for the cows, you
require very high degrees

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:02.120
of grazing land.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.850
But we are next to a forest
area in an open range

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:09.199
and next to the mountains,
so we can afford that.

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:11.540
But then, we have
to be very sure

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:15.409
that we can't go on
unlimitedly scaling up.

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:19.370
So the number of people and the
number of hard construction you

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:21.889
do on a particular
piece of land should

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:24.040
be very sensitively designed.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:28.030
And that will depend very
much on the local topography.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:30.929
So we are living in a
very high rainfall area.

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:33.820
And we are in zone three.

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:40.010
And also, we have what
is known as black soil.

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:43.270
So the black soil is
something which is very clay.

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:45.840
And so, the foundations
which we require to build

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.819
are quite deep.

00:34:47.819 --> 00:34:49.610
So therefore, the
intervention in the earth

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:51.280
is much more than regular.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:54.550
So we have to be very sensitive
how much we can actually build.

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:57.020
So at this stage, we
are kind of reached

00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:00.910
our limits of development as
far as our land is concerned.

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:04.250
AUDIENCE: Have you
worked with the SBD

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:07.620
separately from
the whole solution?

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:10.450
It sounds like something
that could be implemented

00:35:10.450 --> 00:35:13.690
as just one component
in other communities.

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:16.590
And if so, again,
how large would you

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.890
be able to scale that?

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:21.480
GAURANGA DAS: So
if you Google SBD,

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.200
then you'll find all the
works of Professor Shankar

00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:28.070
and some of the places
they're installed.

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:31.210
So this company, which
Biplab runs-- my friend,

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:34.110
Biplab Patnaik runs-- it's
called Lifelink Solutions.

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:36.130
And proposition
Professoer Shankar-- he

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:40.230
installed first in Mumbai
Municipal Corporation.

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:45.110
So, very much the city of Mumbai
also installed part of that.

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:47.060
One of the issues
in the initial days

00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.970
was processing of
chemical wastes.

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:52.350
So they ran into
issues with that.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:56.760
But now, after several years
of scaling up and tweaking

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.880
that system,
currently they claim

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.270
that they have dealt with it.

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:05.660
And they're kind of confident of
dealing with any kind of waste.

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:07.530
So in one sense,
in our community

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:11.170
it's kind of easier, because
we have certain protocols

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:16.260
on not using chemical-based
soaps and other kinds of stuff.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:20.680
So if you have a
lifestyle paradigm which

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:23.380
is connected to this,
it becomes much easier.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:27.140
But still, I met some of
the new vendors of the SBD,

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:33.030
and they claim that they're
ready for even direct chemical

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.480
plants.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.670
But I personally
have no experience,

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.710
but it looks like they've
taken care of that.

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:41.310
But probably, you'll find
more information on the net.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:48.505
But as far as we're
concerned, definitely we

00:36:48.505 --> 00:36:50.200
installed in 2011.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:54.590
Now, in three years,
practically zero maintenance.

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:57.430
Just we have one guy who
just takes care of it.

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:00.712
His job is to switch on the
pump, switch off the pump,

00:37:00.712 --> 00:37:02.920
you know, do a little bit
of cleaning here and there.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.650
He grows his own farm there.

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:09.430
He eats better food
than many of us.

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:12.140
So it's pretty impressive.

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.390
AUDIENCE: I guess my question
is, what are the culture

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:15.900
requirements for this to work?

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.941
Because I'm trying to
think how would you-- like,

00:37:17.941 --> 00:37:20.750
could you transpose this into
the rural Midwest or something

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:21.580
like that?

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:22.650
I'm skeptical.

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:25.010
So what aspects of
the human culture

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:27.860
do you think are required?

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:32.700
GAURANGA DAS: I think a deep
sense of compassion and care

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.260
for mother earth.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:39.090
If you have a deep feeling
that we need to be sensitive.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.730
Because when you
care for someone

00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:42.780
you're sensitive towards them.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:45.850
So if I feel that I
care for mother earth,

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:48.950
I want to be sensitive
towards mother earth.

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:51.930
And therefore, naturally, when
you begin from that point,

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:55.740
then all your priorities,
all your plannings,

00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:00.080
all your implementation
will then flow from there.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:05.360
So I think the concept
basically is care.

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.400
So taking this as the
foundational principle,

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:12.310
I think the implementation
of this can be global.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:16.010
Probably the details
may vary-- as far

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:20.220
as some of the types of
construction you may make,

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.089
or the kinds of
food you may grow,

00:38:22.089 --> 00:38:23.547
or the kinds of
animal you may take

00:38:23.547 --> 00:38:26.217
care-- the details may differ.

00:38:26.217 --> 00:38:28.300
But in principle, we are
dealing with four things,

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:33.380
as I said-- food, water,
energy, and waste.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:38.250
And we have showing how we
can integrate all of this.

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:41.520
Because as soon as human
beings come, they create waste.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.380
But how we combine all
of these in such a way

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:47.760
that the waste
becomes a resource.

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.370
So therefore, the
details may differ

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:55.250
based on the geography, based
on the particular situation--

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:59.270
the biodiversity of that place--
the climactic zone in which it

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:02.830
is, the earthquake zone in
which it is, so probably some

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:06.260
of the construction materials we
used there may not apply here.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:10.670
But still, the whole idea
is green construction.

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:11.170
Right?

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:13.810
The idea is low
energy construction.

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:16.510
And methodologies
can be worked out,

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:17.890
based on the particular place.

00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:20.650
But the two concepts
which I want to emphasize

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:25.120
is care, and based on
the principle of care,

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.375
then we actually implement
something sustainable.

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:33.496
So why not?

00:39:33.496 --> 00:39:35.495
So we have the website
called ecovillage.org.in.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.180
So you can visit the website.

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.340
ecovillage.org.in.

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:46.359
If you just type ecovillage,
it will come on the front--

00:39:46.359 --> 00:39:48.400
AUDIENCE: So how receptive
have local governments

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.839
been to the system?

00:39:49.839 --> 00:39:51.630
What are the major
difficulties that you've

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:53.290
encountered in dealing
with governments

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:55.170
and trying to get
them to subscribe

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:57.880
to this type of system
and implement it?

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:03.310
GAURANGA DAS: Yeah, one of the
biggest problems is-- just,

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:05.620
you begin from food only.

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.120
OK?

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.490
As soon as you come
to food, and as soon

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:13.790
as you say organic, then
you how all these giants who

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:20.020
are selling tons and tons
of pesticides, fertilizers,

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.640
importing them into India.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.730
And then it's a whole lobby.

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:27.435
You know?

00:40:27.435 --> 00:40:31.030
So, as soon as you say
organic, then there

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:38.180
is an existing lobby which
is based on a huge turnover.

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:42.247
And it's not so easy to
push the organic part.

00:40:42.247 --> 00:40:44.330
Although the government,
within their initiatives,

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:47.410
they have schemes for
promoting organic farming.

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:50.790
But then, within the bureaucracy
and within the ministers,

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:56.090
then there is such a kind of
integrated working with all

00:40:56.090 --> 00:41:00.120
these foreign firms and other
kinds of firms within India

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:02.360
who have vested
interest in selling

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.010
those insecticides,
pesticides, and fertilizers.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.030
They may say
something, but to what

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:12.870
extend the implementation
is really genuine

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:14.140
becomes questionable.

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:18.820
Number two, it is not that
organic farming is so simple,

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:20.580
also.

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:21.540
Right?

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:23.740
Just I'll give you an example.

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:29.240
One of the kind of fertilizers
we use is using cow dung.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:32.980
Now, what the cow does is goes
and eats at various places.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.960
So there are some kinds
of insects the cow eats,

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.830
which is locally found there.

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:39.610
And the insect does
a peculiar behavior

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:42.780
that, once it goes into the
cow's stomach, it doesn't die,

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:46.020
but it just kind of survives.

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:48.400
It goes into kind
of hibernation.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.230
And then, when it comes
out with the cow dung,

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:53.130
it is still there.

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:56.494
So then you use the
cow dung as manure,

00:41:56.494 --> 00:41:57.910
but then, when it
comes in contact

00:41:57.910 --> 00:42:02.120
with the grasses and the
plants, then that insect again,

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.280
it starts becoming active.

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.600
And that insect starts
eating the plant.

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.350
So we have using the
cow dung a manure,

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:14.090
but the cow dung has
sometimes these insects

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:18.260
which act against the interest
of what we are trying.

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.100
So these are just some
examples I'm telling you

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:24.150
that it is not always
so simple, even

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:26.780
for suppose a lawn--
a simple lawn.

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.390
You just put Urea,
the lawn will look

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:31.890
like green and fresh
and everything.

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:34.610
You try to use the
organic method,

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:36.510
you have to have patience.

00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:39.200
You have to spend a lot of time.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:43.230
So therefore, with patience,
with some kind of understanding

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:45.790
that, yes, there may
be someone difficulties

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:47.930
but we'll stick to it.

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:51.540
If you don't have that kind
of principle-based approach,

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:54.310
then one may become
impatient after some time.

00:42:54.310 --> 00:42:56.020
And then say, oh, forget it.

00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:58.480
Let's put something
in and get it going.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:02.016
So that's one of the elements
which we have experienced.

00:43:02.016 --> 00:43:03.390
So therefore, when
you're talking

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:06.360
of a statewide or
nationwide implementation

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:09.280
by the government agencies,
you can understand

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.220
that it's not so
easy to be patient

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.550
and just wait and watch.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:17.820
And we are talking of
reversing a trend which

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:20.900
has been so deeply rooted
for several decades.

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:22.480
So it's not going
to be also so easy.

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:26.590
Therefore, I call it creating
islands of excellence

00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:29.610
in an ocean of chaos.

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:31.700
So when you create
islands of excellence,

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:34.910
so probably to standout
and be noticed, and then

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:37.100
probably others
will be inspired.

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:40.560
And in a small way,
we can try our effort

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.760
to create a better place.

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.060
OK?

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:46.030
Thank you so much.

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:49.360
So I would now share that video.

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.210
Thank you.

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:54.620
So this video was made by
Julie from New York City.

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:57.480
She was so inspired when
she saw the ecovillage.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:02.040
And Robin Simon from Hollywood,
she came along with a group.

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:06.670
And one of the [INAUDIBLE]
teachers, Sharon Gannon,

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:10.130
was there at that time
they actually videoed.

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:12.810
They took one and one half
hours of film, actually,

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:17.478
but seven minutes--
just a promo-- is here.

00:44:17.478 --> 00:44:20.219
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:44:20.219 --> 00:44:21.760
REDHANATH SWAMI:
Govardhan Ecovillage

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.720
is about 2 and 1/2
hours northeast

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:30.140
of Mumbai in a very
beautiful rural village

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:33.500
area or Maharashtra.

00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.790
There's a very
holy place in India

00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:39.770
which is considered most
sacred to devotees of Krishna,

00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:41.300
it's called brindavan.

00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:46.140
And in that brindavan is a
mountain named Govardhan, which

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:52.910
represents environmental,
ecological harmony

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:55.850
with spiritual principles.

00:44:55.850 --> 00:44:57.850
PADMA SHARON GANNON: This
place is very special.

00:44:57.850 --> 00:45:01.030
Certainly, it's unique in
India, and perhaps unique

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.990
in the whole world.

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:03.890
It's like a retreat center.

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:05.540
It's like a spa.

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:06.820
It's like an ashram.

00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:09.890
It's a place that's
designed as an experiment

00:45:09.890 --> 00:45:12.960
to merge
environmentalism, animal

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.480
rights, and bhakti--
spirituality-- together.

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.320
And it's working.

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:24.280
JULES FEBRE: The amenities
here are a whole other caliber.

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.690
People, when they think of
the words India and ashram,

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:31.190
they think of harsh
and rough living.

00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:34.780
From the Ayurvedic Clinic,
which not only gives treatments,

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.220
but also has a
Ayurvedic doctor who

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.900
helps prescribe something
that is specific for your

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:42.490
[INAUDIBLE].

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:46.720
The atmosphere that is created
by the founder, Redhanath Swami

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:51.010
Maharaj, and the atmosphere that
is created by the devotees who

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:52.540
work here is palpable.

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:55.600
You can feel it in the air.

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:57.830
REDHANATH SWAMI: Originally,
I was from Chicago.

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:01.740
When I was 19
years old, in 1970,

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:07.130
I wanted to try to broaden
my outlook of life.

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:08.700
So I went on a journey.

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:10.900
Ultimately, I
hitchhiked from London

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:12.790
to the Himalayas and India.

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:19.270
And as I was traveling,
I came to realize

00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:24.950
that the real social and
environmental problems

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:29.090
of the world are due
to a spiritual crisis--

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:32.930
a crisis in what we consider
it's actually meaningful

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:35.000
and fulfilling in our life.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.500
PADMA SHARON GANNON: Redhanath
Swami is a passionate person.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:41.630
The best passion is
compassion, and he

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:44.140
has a ample amount of that.

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:47.245
And that type of
passion is contagious.

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.270
DAVID VINAS: To be
coming here and helping

00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:55.750
do the seva-- or the service--
helping with the cows,

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:59.700
helping to weave mats,
helping them make pottery,

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:01.570
it's actually fun.

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:02.815
It's very simple lifestyle.

00:47:02.815 --> 00:47:06.210
And I think a lot of us crave
that on different levels.

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:08.730
MICHELLE BAKER: It's sort of
programmed into our culture

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:12.330
that you look for
recognition, you need it.

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:16.860
For me, being here, I see it's
far more powerful to be humble.

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:18.360
NICK VELCOV: It was
easy to complain

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:21.660
about the tiny inconveniences
that come with a New York City

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:22.160
apartment.

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.220
Oh, it's not big enough.

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:25.352
Oh, the water pressure
isn't great enough.

00:47:25.352 --> 00:47:26.810
When you live in
the house that you

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:31.440
see built from the ground
up, every step along the way,

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:33.620
it's very special.

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:46.215
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:47:46.215 --> 00:47:47.840
REDHANATH SWAMI: When
people come here,

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:52.282
we're trying to inspire an
educational, experiential

00:47:52.282 --> 00:47:55.150
alternative of a fulfilling,
meaningful, sustainable,

00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:56.087
healthy life.

00:47:56.087 --> 00:47:57.670
MALE SPEAKER: Apart
from these jasmine

00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:00.420
flowers which you see, he grows
a lot of his lady fingers,

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:02.160
okra.

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.490
So we work with
all these farmers

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:06.800
so that we purchase them in
our kitchen and use them.

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.021
FEMALE SPEAKER: Can we
get these to the kitchen?

00:48:10.021 --> 00:48:11.520
REDHANATH SWAMI:
And the inspiration

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:15.917
of this project-- [INAUDIBLE]
he called this transformation

00:48:15.917 --> 00:48:17.250
simple living and high thinking.

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:23.330
GAURANGA DAS: We get 3,000
millimeters of rain, annually.

00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:26.120
So the rainwater hits against
those mountains-- the Sahyadri

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:30.016
Mountain Ranges-- and flows
down and collects here.

00:48:30.016 --> 00:48:31.390
And it is sufficient
order for us

00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:35.700
to irrigate our fields for up to
six to seven months every year.

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:38.520
The majority of
India's population--

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:42.120
which is 1.2 billion--
lives in the villages.

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:44.115
So one of the very
important requirements

00:48:44.115 --> 00:48:48.094
to develop a village is
how can water be conserved?

00:48:48.094 --> 00:48:49.760
BIPLAB PATNAIK: The
process begins here.

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:52.780
As you can see, the
[INAUDIBLE] is falling.

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.540
And there are some screens.

00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:57.540
The first chamber is
called screen chamber

00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.510
where we're trying to
separate floating solids.

00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:05.080
This is the groundwater
where it began.

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:09.184
And this the treated water.

00:49:09.184 --> 00:49:10.660
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:49:13.617 --> 00:49:16.200
GAURANGA DAS: The uniqueness of
this place comes from the fact

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:19.090
that every waste is becoming
a precious resource.

00:49:19.090 --> 00:49:21.890
That cow dunk becomes
a fertilizer for earth.

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:25.532
He needs fire or energy
for cooking his food.

00:49:25.532 --> 00:49:26.990
And therefore, all
of the cow dung,

00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:29.090
we utilize for bio-gas plant.

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:32.470
We need to make houses,
so we use the same earth.

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:35.040
And we have created
250,000 bricks.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:39.060
We call this a symbiotic
recycling model.

00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:42.650
Flushing your toilet,
you are contributing

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:44.030
to the growth of a papaya.

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:46.380
You are contributing to
the growth of flowers.

greatest management gurus

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:03.550
says that the
greatest management

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:08.404
challenge of the 21st century
is managing one's self.

00:50:08.404 --> 00:50:09.945
REDHANATH SWAMI:
Many corporate heads

00:50:09.945 --> 00:50:12.510
are having seminars
and retreats here.

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:15.240
And they also see
alternative ways

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:20.990
by which they could focus
their own corporations

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:26.240
and feel a real sense of
responsibility to humanity.

The thing I'm most

00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:35.740
compelled to do when I get home
is really seva-- it's service.

being so self-absorbed.

and my goal is

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:50.120
