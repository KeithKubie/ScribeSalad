00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:14.790
awarded for took a year of work to get
 

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.480
awarded for took a year of work to get
done but there is something so exciting

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:17.490
done but there is something so exciting
 

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:21.170
done but there is something so exciting
about Datuk being shown on a screen or a

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:21.180
about Datuk being shown on a screen or a
 

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.060
about Datuk being shown on a screen or a
laser that you've been trying to

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:23.070
laser that you've been trying to
 

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.160
laser that you've been trying to
struggle to make work finally works and

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:25.170
struggle to make work finally works and
 

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.920
struggle to make work finally works and
you see it and laser physics is one that

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:27.930
you see it and laser physics is one that
 

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.380
you see it and laser physics is one that
you actually see happening there's all

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:30.390
you actually see happening there's all
 

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:31.850
you actually see happening there's all
kinds of things when you see one color

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:31.860
kinds of things when you see one color
 

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.110
kinds of things when you see one color
of light change to another color of

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:33.120
of light change to another color of
 

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.000
of light change to another color of
light or what have you that's exciting

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.010
light or what have you that's exciting
 

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:37.430
light or what have you that's exciting
to see and brand new data that you know

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440
to see and brand new data that you know
 

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.440
to see and brand new data that you know
you have and other people don't have

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:39.450
you have and other people don't have
 

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.110
you have and other people don't have
this is such an exciting feeling so

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120
this is such an exciting feeling so
 

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.760
this is such an exciting feeling so
that's why I just I just think it's fun

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:43.770
that's why I just I just think it's fun
 

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:47.930
that's why I just I just think it's fun
and I like building Minaya was one of my

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:47.940
and I like building Minaya was one of my
 

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.000
and I like building Minaya was one of my
favorite toys growing up and so building

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.010
favorite toys growing up and so building
 

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:51.920
favorite toys growing up and so building
lasers falls under that category of

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:51.930
lasers falls under that category of
 

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:53.150
lasers falls under that category of
feeling like a toy and that you're just

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160
feeling like a toy and that you're just
 

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.330
feeling like a toy and that you're just
simply playing with a new thing

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:55.340
simply playing with a new thing

well there was only one commercial

00:16:03.699 --> 00:16:03.709
well there was only one commercial
 

00:16:03.709 --> 00:16:05.800
well there was only one commercial
application of this laser yet and that

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:05.810
application of this laser yet and that
 

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:10.540
application of this laser yet and that
is cutting or machining of transparent

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:10.550
is cutting or machining of transparent
 

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.430
is cutting or machining of transparent
material so it can be glass used on a

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:12.440
material so it can be glass used on a
 

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.139

cell phone it can be the cornea of your
eye that's the one application I was

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:16.670
eye that's the one application I was
 

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:18.129
eye that's the one application I was
actually quite surprised that that

00:16:18.129 --> 00:16:18.139
actually quite surprised that that
 

00:16:18.139 --> 00:16:20.050
actually quite surprised that that
started just ten years after the laser

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:20.060
started just ten years after the laser
 

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.610
started just ten years after the laser
was built usually takes quite a bit

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:21.620
was built usually takes quite a bit
 

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.009
was built usually takes quite a bit
longer from a research to a little lab

00:16:24.009 --> 00:16:24.019
longer from a research to a little lab
 

00:16:24.019 --> 00:16:27.490
longer from a research to a little lab
to become an actual product so I'm

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:27.500
to become an actual product so I'm
 

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:31.389
to become an actual product so I'm
surprised by that but I think going

00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:31.399
surprised by that but I think going
 

00:16:31.399 --> 00:16:34.269
surprised by that but I think going
forward the exciting one will be if we

00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:34.279
forward the exciting one will be if we
 

00:16:34.279 --> 00:16:36.189
forward the exciting one will be if we
can actually get laser acceleration to

00:16:36.189 --> 00:16:36.199
can actually get laser acceleration to
 

00:16:36.199 --> 00:16:37.569
can actually get laser acceleration to
work there's a number of people working

00:16:37.569 --> 00:16:37.579
work there's a number of people working
 

00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:40.120
work there's a number of people working
on laser acceleration I myself am NOT at

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:40.130
on laser acceleration I myself am NOT at
 

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.939
on laser acceleration I myself am NOT at
this point but I think if we can start

00:16:42.939 --> 00:16:42.949
this point but I think if we can start
 

00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:45.730
this point but I think if we can start
to either compete with the hospital

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:45.740
to either compete with the hospital
 

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.350
to either compete with the hospital
accelerators so that can be used for

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360
accelerators so that can be used for
 

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.870
accelerators so that can be used for
medicine or even the large CERN that

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:49.880
medicine or even the large CERN that
 

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:57.680
medicine or even the large CERN that
would be the exciting one I think

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:57.690
 
 

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:01.260
 
no I don't feel that the work you do

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:01.270
no I don't feel that the work you do
 

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.450
no I don't feel that the work you do
should be directly applicable to society

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:03.460
should be directly applicable to society
 

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.490
should be directly applicable to society
again it falls under my idea that we

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:05.500
again it falls under my idea that we
 

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.320
again it falls under my idea that we
should all do what we're good at and I

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:07.330
should all do what we're good at and I
 

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:09.150
should all do what we're good at and I
don't think every one of us is good at

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.160
don't think every one of us is good at
 

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.370
don't think every one of us is good at
taking an idea out to there or knowing

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:11.380
taking an idea out to there or knowing
 

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.250
taking an idea out to there or knowing
what society should do but again it goes

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:14.260
what society should do but again it goes
 

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.840
what society should do but again it goes
back to the fact that scientists have to

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:15.850
back to the fact that scientists have to
 

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:17.760
back to the fact that scientists have to
constantly have dialogues and so it's a

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:17.770
constantly have dialogues and so it's a
 

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.830
constantly have dialogues and so it's a
whole train of people and it doesn't

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:19.840
whole train of people and it doesn't
 

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.120
whole train of people and it doesn't
matter if it's something to be used for

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:21.130
matter if it's something to be used for
 

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.760
matter if it's something to be used for
Society or just an application for

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:23.770
Society or just an application for
 

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:26.160
Society or just an application for

whatever it's a non-stop continuum of
 

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:28.320
whatever it's a non-stop continuum of
people working together so hopefully

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:28.330
people working together so hopefully
 

00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:30.210
people working together so hopefully
there's other people that are looking at

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:30.220
there's other people that are looking at
 

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.130
there's other people that are looking at
this who want to help Society and work

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:32.140
this who want to help Society and work
 

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:33.750
this who want to help Society and work

was done over 30 years ago so it's not

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:52.490

one's expecting in my position to win a
 

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.650
one's expecting in my position to win a
Nobel Prize so you get woken up at 5:00

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:05.660
Nobel Prize so you get woken up at 5:00
 

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.850
Nobel Prize so you get woken up at 5:00
in the morning the my husband is closer

in the morning the my husband is closer
 

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.820
in the morning the my husband is closer
to our landline phone that is in our

to our landline phone that is in our
 

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:15.070
to our landline phone that is in our
bedroom and so he answered the phone and

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.080
bedroom and so he answered the phone and
 

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.120

certainly in the middle of the night

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:16.130
certainly in the middle of the night
 

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:17.470
certainly in the middle of the night
when you get woken up it's usually a

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:17.480
when you get woken up it's usually a
 

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.710
when you get woken up it's usually a
fear thing that someone has been hurt

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:19.720
fear thing that someone has been hurt
 

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.450
fear thing that someone has been hurt
and so I'm saying what is it what is it

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:22.460
and so I'm saying what is it what is it
 

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.370
and so I'm saying what is it what is it
what is it and that goes they're asking

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:24.380
what is it and that goes they're asking
 

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.350
what is it and that goes they're asking
for professor Strickland so then you

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:26.360
for professor Strickland so then you
 

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.020
for professor Strickland so then you
kind of know that the no timer might

00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:29.030
kind of know that the no timer might
 

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.690
kind of know that the no timer might
called professor Strickland even usually

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:31.700
called professor Strickland even usually
 

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.630
called professor Strickland even usually
at the University so and then you get

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640
at the University so and then you get
 

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.430
at the University so and then you get
this it's an important call from Sweden

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:36.440
this it's an important call from Sweden
 

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.410
this it's an important call from Sweden
and then you put on hold although

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:38.420
and then you put on hold although
 

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.670
and then you put on hold although
actually they hung up on me but I

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:39.680
actually they hung up on me but I
 

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.040
actually they hung up on me but I
thought I was on hold and I'm hanging on

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:42.050

that's that's all it feels like this

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:53.810
that's that's all it feels like this

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:55.170

00:22:44.929 --> 00:22:47.509
rather than a problem but then I also
like to work on projects that not very

00:22:47.509 --> 00:22:47.519
like to work on projects that not very
 

00:22:47.519 --> 00:22:49.690
like to work on projects that not very
many people are working on rather than

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:49.700
many people are working on rather than
 

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.909
many people are working on rather than
being part of the race so this is why I

00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919
being part of the race so this is why I
 

00:22:52.919 --> 00:22:54.230
being part of the race so this is why I
have not worked on short-pulse an

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240
have not worked on short-pulse an
 

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.869
have not worked on short-pulse an
application as much I have two systems

00:22:56.869 --> 00:22:56.879
application as much I have two systems
 

00:22:56.879 --> 00:22:59.629
application as much I have two systems
in my lab but I look for projects that I

00:22:59.629 --> 00:22:59.639
in my lab but I look for projects that I
 

00:22:59.639 --> 00:23:02.509
in my lab but I look for projects that I
find really fun to do but the whole rest

00:23:02.509 --> 00:23:02.519
find really fun to do but the whole rest
 

00:23:02.519 --> 00:23:03.590
find really fun to do but the whole rest
of the world aren't necessarily doing

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600
of the world aren't necessarily doing
 

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.330
of the world aren't necessarily doing
them so I don't ever feel like I'm in a

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.340
them so I don't ever feel like I'm in a
 

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.460
them so I don't ever feel like I'm in a
time race

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:06.470
time race
 

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:11.639
time race

in 30 seconds might be very hard this is

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:15.950
in 30 seconds might be very hard this is
 

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:18.759
in 30 seconds might be very hard this is
a way to make sure that you can have

00:23:18.759 --> 00:23:18.769
a way to make sure that you can have
 

00:23:18.769 --> 00:23:21.460
a way to make sure that you can have
very intense pulses and the idea is like

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:21.470
very intense pulses and the idea is like
 

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:24.369
very intense pulses and the idea is like
I call it a laser hammer in that if you

00:23:24.369 --> 00:23:24.379
I call it a laser hammer in that if you
 

00:23:24.379 --> 00:23:26.560
I call it a laser hammer in that if you
can push on a nail with all your might

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:26.570
can push on a nail with all your might
 

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:28.600
can push on a nail with all your might
it won't go into a piece of wood but if

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:28.610
it won't go into a piece of wood but if
 

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:30.310
it won't go into a piece of wood but if
you hit it with a hammer quickly it goes

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320
you hit it with a hammer quickly it goes
 

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.369
you hit it with a hammer quickly it goes
in and this is the idea is that we can

00:23:33.369 --> 00:23:33.379
in and this is the idea is that we can
 

00:23:33.379 --> 00:23:35.979
in and this is the idea is that we can
make our laser pulses both energetic and

00:23:35.979 --> 00:23:35.989
make our laser pulses both energetic and
 

00:23:35.989 --> 00:23:38.649
make our laser pulses both energetic and
short but we didn't have the hammer

00:23:38.649 --> 00:23:38.659
short but we didn't have the hammer
 

00:23:38.659 --> 00:23:40.659
short but we didn't have the hammer
inside the laser destroying the laser

00:23:40.659 --> 00:23:40.669
inside the laser destroying the laser
 

00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:42.460
inside the laser destroying the laser
which is why that it never worked before

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:42.470
which is why that it never worked before
 

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:45.369
which is why that it never worked before
but we could we could do it in a way

00:23:45.369 --> 00:23:45.379
but we could we could do it in a way
 

00:23:45.379 --> 00:23:47.769
but we could we could do it in a way
that the laser was fine and then make

00:23:47.769 --> 00:23:47.779
that the laser was fine and then make
 

00:23:47.779 --> 00:23:50.259
that the laser was fine and then make
the pulse short after amplification so

00:23:50.259 --> 00:23:50.269
the pulse short after amplification so
 

00:23:50.269 --> 00:23:54.240
the pulse short after amplification so
that it could be like a laser hammer

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:54.250
that it could be like a laser hammer
 

00:23:54.250 --> 00:24:03.690
that it could be like a laser hammer
