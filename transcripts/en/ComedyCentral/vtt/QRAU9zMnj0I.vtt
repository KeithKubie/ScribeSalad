00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:06.773
Hello.

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:09.075 line:0%
This is Patricia
Napier-Fitzpatrick.

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:11.110 line:0%
How are you, Patricia.
Nice to see you.

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:13.112 line:0%
Look at you.
What a honey-bunny, huh?

00:00:13.145 --> 00:00:14.614 line:0%
All right, what are we doing?

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:16.849 line:0%
We are going to cover
a few social graces,

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:19.318 line:0%
-if you don't mind.
-I mind all of this.

00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:21.721 line:0%
Handshakes are appropriate

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:24.791 line:0%
for most, uh,
senior government officials.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:27.660
It's always best
to let them take the initiative

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:29.662
in extending the hand
for a shake.

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:31.097
And then you touch-- look.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.699
First you touch here, and then
you go-- wait, wait, wait--

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:35.268
one... No, no, no.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:37.870
One... No. One... No.

00:00:37.903 --> 00:00:40.173
-You be Kim Jong-un.
-All right.

00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:42.775
Okay.

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:46.112
-Don't I go like this,
and then go pow! -Uh, no, no.

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:48.214
So, you're gonna face,
heart to heart,

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:50.517
-belly button to belly button...
-Okay.

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:05.565
Now you're Putin.

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.400
Hey, Vlad, how are you?

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:09.802
I love you.
I love you so much.

00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:11.804
-Mmm, mmm...
-Nah, I don't think so.

00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:14.107
-So, let's talk about your
appearance, all right? -Right.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.808
I just, your white shirts
are perfect,

00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:17.743
-your navy suits are perfect,
-White, perfect, crisp, white,

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:19.011
-your...
-pure white,

00:01:19.044 --> 00:01:20.947
-your red power color...
-the great race, the pure race,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.915
-So I would recommend
-the white race.

00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:24.884
you button your top button.

00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:28.121
Did... Well, that's not right.

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:30.990
-Perfect. It's perfect. -No,
the top button in the top hole.

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:33.226
I always put it
in the wrong hole.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.361
Now, let's look...
Look in the mirror.

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:37.397
Look how much nicer that looks.

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:40.099
Who's that weird guy?

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:42.468
What a great impression you make
when your jacket...

00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:44.303
-Look at that.
-Who's this guy?

00:01:44.336 --> 00:01:46.839
-And then when you sit down...
-Who is that guy!

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:48.308
Who is that!

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:51.744
-What's happening? Who is he?
-Sir, okay...

00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:53.045
-Who?
-Sir, that's you.

00:01:53.078 --> 00:01:54.547
It's you. It's gonna be okay.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.082
It's you in the mirror.

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:57.817
Oh. That's perfect. Look at me.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.886
All right, I just want
to make one recommendation.

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:02.221
The tie should come to
the middle of your belt buckle.

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:04.957
But how is everybody not
gonna know where the party is?

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.425
Well, I think they'll know,

00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:08.194
because you've told them
many times.

00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:10.163
Please. Give me a break.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.233
Who is that!

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:19.138
Just try and focus.

00:02:19.171 --> 00:02:20.606
You're the president.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:21.774
Excuse me.

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:23.743
Shall we dine?

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:28.714
Could you find South Africa
on this map?

00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:30.583
Everybody knows that.

00:02:30.616 --> 00:02:32.251
Oh, man!

00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:33.686
Uh...

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.788
The napkin--
you fold it in half.

00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:38.057
And the open part goes
toward the table.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.226
What am I? What am I?

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:43.262
I'm my dad at his meetings.

00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:44.931
-Mr. President?
-What?

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:47.033
Are you going to embarrass
the United States

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:49.302
by not knowing how
to handle these things?

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:51.404
No. I'm going to embarrass
the United States

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:54.373
by sidling up to neo-Nazis.

00:02:54.406 --> 00:02:56.642
All right. Good for you.

00:02:56.675 --> 00:02:58.611
So, find South Africa, please.

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:00.646
Okay. It was south.

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:02.014
Is it this?

00:03:02.047 --> 00:03:04.417
-No.
-What is that?

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.552
That's the logo on the globe.

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:07.820
Oh.

00:03:07.853 --> 00:03:09.255
Waiter?

00:03:09.288 --> 00:03:11.791
Get over here, you idiot.
Human garbage.

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:13.492
Mr. President,
we call the waitstaff

00:03:13.525 --> 00:03:15.461
with a little finger up.

00:03:17.162 --> 00:03:18.698
Mr. President.

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:20.566
How about this?

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.669
-Like this? -Just...
just a simple hand gesture.

00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:25.738
What about, do we want saluting?

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:26.839
-No.
-Okay.

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:29.208
-Please, not this.
-Can I go...?

00:03:29.241 --> 00:03:30.543
No.

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:31.978
That's all sides.

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:33.779
Black power. Hail Hitler.

00:03:33.812 --> 00:03:36.349
The same. All sides.

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:38.584
-Let's practice what
we learned, okay? -Okay.

00:03:38.617 --> 00:03:40.186
You see?

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.555
And then... You're ruining
the steak with ketchup?

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:44.590
(with mouth full):
Ruining?

00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:46.792
All right, this is, um...

00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:49.028
-Sir...
-That's good

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:50.396
Whoa!

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:52.365
Who's that!

00:03:57.736 --> 00:04:00.773
There's a ghost in the mirror,

00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:02.808
and he's filled with hate,

00:04:02.841 --> 00:04:06.012
and he speaks to me
through the mirror.

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:07.947
And he says...

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.815
"Find the way

00:04:09.848 --> 00:04:13.253
to destroy
as many people as possible."

00:04:15.587 --> 00:04:18.924
I hate the man in the mirror...

00:04:18.957 --> 00:04:21.294
'cause he knows my secrets.

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:25.498
-I have a recommendation.
-Right.

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:27.967
Get rid of the mirrors.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.270
(quietly):
Get rid of the mirrors.

00:04:31.303 --> 00:04:34.940
Get rid of the mirrors.
Get rid of the mirrors.

00:04:34.973 --> 00:04:36.776
No.

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:39.478
How did you get in here?

00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:41.147
Paul. Paul!

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.082
Yes, sir?

00:04:43.115 --> 00:04:46.118
No!

00:04:46.151 --> 00:04:49.989
No. Get out of my mind!

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:54.860
No!

00:04:54.893 --> 00:04:56.462
(muttering)

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.834
-You.
-(indistinct whispering)

00:05:01.867 --> 00:05:03.269
I understand.

00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:05.171
Yes, master.

00:05:05.204 --> 00:05:07.240
Whatever you want, master.
