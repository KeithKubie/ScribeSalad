00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:30.700
[Theme song]

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.700
Hellooo, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.000
And welcome to another edition of Old vs. New.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.000
It's the fairy tale that teaches kids all around the world

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.900
that it doesn't matter what you look 
like or where you come from,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.680
as long as you work hard and have a kind heart,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.940
you too, can get a makeover.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.900
Cinderella is a tale that's been told countless times,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.900
but the most definitive version belonged to 
Disney Animations in 1950.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.600
So it only figured when you have a money maker so iconic that it's cemented in everybody's memory,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.600
you remake it 65 years later!

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.800
To much surprise though, not only were there big names and astounding visuals,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.400
but it also got quite the critical backing, too, with people praising it for being such a stylized update!

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.400
But as always, which one is better?

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.800
Which one feels the most engaging, clever and all around magical?

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.800
Now, of course, being of the NOSTALGIC persuasion, I have a little bit of a leaning towards the old.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.800
*Whimsically* If only I could wish for someone
who had an opposite opinion of me...

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.800
*With slightly more force*  If only I could wish for someone who had an opposite opinion of me...

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.800
If only I could-- WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?!

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.600
Hyper Fangirl: Sorry! This thing's really hard to walk in.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.960
Critic: Christ, even when I WANT you in a video you can't get it right!

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.600
Hyper: Hey! Give me a chance, I have 
whimsical support on this one.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.760
Critic: Yeah? Who?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.600
[EXPLOSION HOLY MOTHER OF SOCKS]

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.400
"Answer": DEVIL BONER!!!!!!

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.900
Critic: Oh, great, what whimsical support can YOU offer?

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.000
Devil: Hey, I can get in touch 
with my feminine side!

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.920
Watch! Sparkles!!

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.020
Butterflies!!

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.120
EXPLOSIONS!!

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.960
Hyper: No.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.540
Devil: No? O-okay, no explosions. No 
explosions. But, um...ponies?

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.440
P-PONIES!

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.180
Critic: (sighs) How are you two still a thing?

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.240
Devil: What can I say? I love a woman
that writes fanfiction about me.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.300
Hyper: Oh, and we both held you hostage that one time. So we have that in common

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.060
Devil: You did it better.
Hyper: You did!

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.380
Devil: No, you did       Hyper: You did! (repeats)

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.320
Critic:*clears throat* Hyper, isn't Benny gonna feel weird that you have another outlet for mindless violence?

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.660
Hyper: Oh, come on! He's a professional assassin.
This kind of thing doesn't bother people like him

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.620
(sad piano music)

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.900
Benny: It's nothing, Benny.
Nothing. Just add her to the list.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.800
Critic: Okay, are you gonna debate me on these 
Cinderella movies or not?

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.180
Hyper: There is no debating. The new one is better,

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.520
if for no other reason that the lead actress had to
lose two ribs to fit into that dress.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.520
Critic: But it's so sexist and bland.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.520
Hyper: The ORIGINAL is sexist and bland!

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.520
Critic: You just like it 'cause there's more flashy sparkles

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.080
to play to your inner five-year-old. 
You're a flaky-flaley-flashy-holic!

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.780
Devil: What did you call her?

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.360
Hyper: Honey! Honey! I'm gonna do the crossover. Why don't you go start a war with a random country?

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.780
Devil: Ooh! I get to use my random war generator!

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.280
Jamaica it is!

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.440
Critic: So, Hyper, are you ready to be 
proven wrong once again?

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.440
Hyper: The day you start being right.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.220
Critic: Let's do Cinderella: Old vs. New.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.200
Critic: Sometimes a prince leaves no
impact on you, whatsoever.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.880
Hyper: Dude! Too soon...

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.680
Critic: I was talking about the royal position!

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.800
Hyper: And I'm not.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.460
Critic: *sigh* He's the arm-candy of
our main character's dreams

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.300
Let's take a look at best prince.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.060
Critic: While a lot of people give flack to some Disney princesses for not having enough character,

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.320
people forget the princes often weren't even
given TIME to have character.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.380
Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and- yes- Cinderella, all have princes with only a handful of lines.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.320
Hyper: And where the one from Sleeping Beauty fought a dragon

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.580
and the one from Snow White saves her from death,

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.160
this one yaaaawwnnns.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.020
Critic: Ok, Look, this was a different time. A time when...

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.240
Hyper: Yawning was an attractive trait?

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.100
Critic: I don't think you're taking into account how sexy that yawn was.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.800
Hyper: Heck, his father gets more screen time than this. So does his servant for that matter.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.800
Critic: Yes, yes but... through them we're 
discovering the prince's character

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.140
and they're also relaying the chemistry between our two romantic leads an-

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.740
Hyper: You got nothing.
Critic: I got nothing

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.340
Hyper: Now, with the remake, not only is the
prince given a lot more onscreen time

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.740
but there's also more time to develop their chemistry

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.320
Cinderella and him meet before the ball and they have time to talk like normal people

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.520
and build and appreciation of each other.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.640
Even during the ball, they talk and share experiences that help them build a stronger connection.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.760
She doesn't just see him and declare,
"This is love!" like in the original

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.220
Critic: *sarcasm* I wouldn't know anybody who did that.

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.720
Hyper: I've moved on Critic,
I found a more sensible love.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.740
Devil: Hey babe, it turns out it's
easy to start a war in this place.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.800
You just tell'em Cool Runnings is a 100% true story!

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.980
Devil: Will do. AAAAAHHH!!! (gun shots)

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.280
Critic: Okay, so maaybe this prince has more charm, more personality, more screen time

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.580
more chemistry and preeetty much more of a connection with everyone he comes in contact with

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.160
but there is one thing that prince does NOT have.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.260
Critic: A shit ton of eyeliner!

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:54.640
Hyper: Dude, again, too soon!

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.540
Critic: Just take the point.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.500
Hyper: After you give him an apology.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.340
*sigh*

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.500
He's waiting.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.420
Disney has always created the greatest villains.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.280
And what's scarier than a middle-aged woman
who's obsessed with housework?!

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.460
Hyper: Virtually anything!

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.380
Critic: This is best villain.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.140
Critic: This one is rough because it really is like  comparing apples to oranges.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.300
Hyper: Well, to Snow White that's an easy choice.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.040
Critic: The original is said by many to be one of the greatest Disney villains ever.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.140
With her style, grace and love of all the
villainous things she does.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.980
The only downside is that it's only explained in narration why she doesn't like Cinderella,

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.940
because of this, it's a little harder to
identify with her motivation.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.980
Hyper: In the new film, we see how her bitterness is born. She hears her husband confess that he preferred

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.480
the first wife more. Which makes her angry towards his offspring all the more understandable.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.020
We also see her slowly lure Cinderella
into the role of servant

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.620
showing how patient and manipulative she can be.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.920
Critic: The downside to that is, it may make
her too human by comparison.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.380
Which one is more frightening?

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.500
The one's that motivations are made totally clear?

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.180
Or the one shrouded in mystery, you're supposed to have no sorrow for.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.800
The original was so slimy and hateful; there was virtually no good in her at all,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.660
while the new one is so fragile and relatable
that you can see the tragedy

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.800
play out in every mean spirited move she makes.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.240
The original acts like someone in control

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.760
while the remake acts like someone
who wants to be in control.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.700
Hyper: I guess it's kindd like comparing Zuko with Frollo.

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.620
Boy, one of them needs a breakfast cereal.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.300
One is sympathetic while the other is pure evil,

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.120
both still coming off as complex and interesting.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.740
So how do we really judge which one is best?

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.580
Critic: Well, I guess whichever one scares up
the most is the most intimidating.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.780
Hyper: Well, I guess that speech that the new one made in the dark is creepy in it's own righ-

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:56.900
(BOOM)

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:02.720
WAH! Uh..! But the new one has the mind of a sociopath which is very psychologically terrifyin-

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.340
(BOOM)

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.860
AAHH! But the new one has a more developed past! Allowing her to-

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.480
(BOOM)

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.780
OKAY! She wins!

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.160
God, that look is scary.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.880
Critic: *chuckles* Some people can't just handle a good old fashion death glare.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:14.500
(BOOM)

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.780
DAH! You whore!

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.440
Hyper: Remember, I can point just as hard as you.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.200
Critic: Yeah, we seem to have unbelievable
power with this, don't we?

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:27.780
(BOOM's repeating)

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.900
*both scream*

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:29.780
Hyper: Never forget...

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.540
Critic: Hey Hyper, by any chance,
are you of Indian decent?

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.920
Hyper: No? Why?

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:49.100
(funky battle music)

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.940
(battle music

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:56.740
(gunshot)

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:57.580
(bullet ricochets)

00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.600
Devil: There's twenty metal plate in my head

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.340
The only downside is, I don't know what half
the words beginning with 's' means.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.720
Ask me the definition of seagull.

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.920
Hyper: What's the definition of seagull?

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.100
Devil: Stop making up words, honey!

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.740
Benny: You don't get it.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.180
When you hire an assassin, you use ONLY him.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.460
For life.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.860
Devil: No YOU don't understand.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.460
When you have a review already full of a ton of estrogen.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.040
Critic: HEY!

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.260
Devil: And the good looking half of
that estrogen is threatened

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.620
you awaken a demon that will not sleep into the nigh-

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.020
Oh, by the way honey, I got you a hat.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.880
Hyper: *gasp* Thank you so much, woobles!

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.980
Devil: No problem, babe.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.220
Into the niiiiggght.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.460
Benny: You might be good with a gun

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.240
but you're nothing compared to my stealth.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.700
Devil: HAH! I can see you coming a mile awa-

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.980
I was looking RIGHT AT him.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.300
How did he do that?

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.900
Hyper: Is something wrong, possum-bear?

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.100
Devil: Nothing, heart-eater.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.680
You and your lady-friend keep talking princesses

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.900
Critic: *disgruntled* Stop calling me that.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.840
Devil: I have to bury my bullets in bloody bastard that I bet!

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.280
Hyper: NO!

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.380
Devil: No?

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.400
Hyper: This one has more bullets!

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.380
Devil: I love you, skull-crusher!

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.700
Hyper: I love you, turtle-duck!

00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.100
*kisses and screams with gunshots*

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.520
Hyper: Back to the debate!

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.460
Critic: *whining* But.... that all sounded amazing!

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:07.420
Hyper: Critic...!

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.500
Critic: *angrily* Okay, fine! This is best side character!

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:10.920
(distant explosions and gunfire)

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:12.400
*whines*

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:27.580
Hyper: Although everyone remembers the talking mice in the original, they're very scaled down in the remake,

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.060
to the point where they don't even speak.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.920
Critic:  A different tone to say the least,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.480
but everybody looves the singing mice and their...

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:35.520
"Leave the sewing to the women!"

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.120
slightly sexist lines.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.960
HEY! Stallone knitted a sweater!

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.460
But c'mon, who could forget Lucifer, the cat?

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:44.260
Or the horse? Or the dog?

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.900
The king and servants? The stepsisters?

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.940
These are character we all remember.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.220
Hyper: Yes, you remember them because
there's a ton of time devoted to them.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.380
Too much time.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.760
In the remake, the supporting cast
stays exactly that: supportive.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.020
In the original, they hijack the
movie on several occasions.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.840
While they're cute and all, they take time away from the more important elements like the prince,

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.360
and the chemistry that's supposed to build 
between him and Cinderella.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.020
Critic: But hey! You were talking about how the king gets way too much time in the old one

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.760
he gets just as much time in the new one!

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.820
Hyper: Yes but it's with the prince.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.720
Every scene with him is helping develop the 
prince's character even more

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.680
establishing his responsibilities, his goals,
and his connection with his father.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.260
We never even see the prince and his father in the original, apart from the eye roll.

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.620
Critic: But again, it was a very passionate eye roll.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.600
Critic: I suppose that last big one to talk
about is the Fairy Godmother.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.320
In the new one she's played more for laughs because

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.920
well, she's Helena Bonham Carter and...
that's what you do with her now.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.520
Hyper: But you have to admit, some comedy is VERY welcomed after Cinderella's at her lowest moment.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.800
And also, she has to prove her worth by disguising herself as a homeless lady looking for water.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.580
And it's only after Cinderella gives it to her
that she grants all her wishes.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.120
Critic: But isn't that kind of pointless?

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.240
She has to know she's a kind
person if she's showing up there

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:58.900
I mean, watching her like a GOD MOTHER?!

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.120
Hyper: Maybe but have you figured this?

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:06.560
Cinderella is in shambles: she can't go to the ball, her dress is ruined, and her family hates her.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.220
Most people in that state would be too frustrated 
to be nice to the old woman

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:15.660
so by helping someone else, even in one of her worst moments, it cements what a good person she is.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:20.360
Critic: I guess but I don't know. The old one talks to her like a loving grandparent.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:25.260
Someone she's familiar with enough to know she would do that anyway she has a warmth in a comfort that

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.800
needs to be seen after such hardship.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.480
I wouldn't want to laugh after going through all this!

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:36.520
I would want to feel supported and after years of slaving for your family, suddenly being put to a test

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.120
to see if you're a nice person, does 
not seem very supportive!!!

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.900
Hyper: Okay, maybe the fairy godmother 
is a little better in the original

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.160
Critic: Did I mention she's a liar too?

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.040
"And you'll find they're really comfortable."

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.760
I got glass sneakers because of her!

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.740
THEY HURT!!!!

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.860
Hyper: But the fact remains that the supporting 
cast does more than support

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.760
They take over. They steal scenes that shouldn't have to be stolen by them.

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.460
While there's still focus on Cinderella
and the stepmother,

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.620
other important elements are being overlooked

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.380
and the new film keeps the focus where it should be.

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.920
The main characters stay main characters and supporting roles stay the supporting roles.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.080
Critic: *sigh* I guess I can't really fault you on that.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.360
New gets the point.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.720
Hyper: You forgot a heartless Prince joke

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.680
Critic: Shut up.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.240
But as simple as a story is there's
always room too muck it up

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.000
Trust me, Disney's done it before.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
This is which one mucked it up less.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:46.280
The funny thing about a simple story is that can be surprisingly tough to tell.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.620
You want to connect with the characters in a relatable set up but even in an hour and a half

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.600
you have to know what to expand
on and what to keep limitied

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.900
Hyper: Like said before, the first film expands
too much on the side characters

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.940
and not enough on some main ones.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:04.260
Critic: But in the new film's case the attention to add more detail can help some scenes

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.500
but seriously damaged others.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.000
For example: when Cinderella's not allowed to sit at the table with the others

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.920
it's when she realizes she's truly not a part of the family causing her to finally break down

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.820
This is a powerful scene and all but it then ruins the moment when her dress is destroyed.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.460
Or... slightly ripped?

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.500
Yeah... that's- that's a gut wrenching moment.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:31.360
But even if they did it like the original it wouldn't work because we got the breakdown earlier.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.700
Because of this, the arrival the fairy 
godmother is not as powerful.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:40.660
In the animated one, it's by far her lowest moment because they knew to save it.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:46.200
Thus, you feel more emotion for her and even more relief when the fairy godmother arrives.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.720
Hyper: But the story does allow for other emotional moments that weren't in the first.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:55.540
The king, for example, is given a lot of time with his son and when he passes away, it's a legitimate sad moment.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.040
The ways they allow Cinderella and Prince to meet before the ball are also very clever,

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.140
giving them more time to form a connection.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.900
Critic: The problem with THAT is every
single time she leaves the house.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:08.840
it makes her for a slightly less magical
night when she goes to the ball.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.540
Cinderella goes to the town and quite a few other places, several times int the new one.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:18.840
Which is fine but in the original everything she does is in that one location

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:23.460
It's a nice location so it's not visually dull but that's all you ever see.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:29.460
The story is very clever in keeping her there, as not only does it emphasized the feeling of being imprisoned

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.680
but also the freedom when she DOES leave and enters this heavenly, dream-like castle.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:40.040
Therefore, we're more sucked into the experience because, like her, it's our first time seeing it

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.540
Hyper: Yeah! But all the wasted
time with the side characters!

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.360
Critic: Yeah but all the time wasted
on the unneeded exposition.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.560
Hyper: But everything in the
original so obvious!

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.620
Critic: And this one isn't?

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.440
Gee, I wonder what the message was again!

00:15:50.709 --> 00:15:59.969
"Have courage and be kind" (repeating)

00:15:59.969 --> 00:16:02.249
"Be kind." "And have courage."

00:16:02.249 --> 00:16:05.040
Hyper: Fine. I guess there's both good 
things and bad thing about them.

00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:09.360
Critic: Yeah... I guess it just depends if you're looking for more mystery or more explaination.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.140
So... what we do in this case?

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:12.820
Hyper: Can there be at tie?

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:13.540
Critic: A TIE?

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.320
That's for pussies who don't believe some animals are more equal than others.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.640
Hyper: There's pros and cons to both, I don't think we're gonna find one that's better than the other.

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:25.570
Critic: *sigh* Okay, I guess we can have a tie. But I'm not gonna let this choice destroy my masculinity

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:27.550
nor anything else in the rest of this video!

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:31.950
(intense battle music)

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.320
(bullet shot and ricochet)

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.680
(bullet shot and ricochet)

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.760
(bullet shot and ricochet)

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.780
(bullet shot and ricochet)

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.740
Devil: AAAAAHHHHHH!! (bullet shot and ricochet)

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.400
(bullet shot and ricochet)

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.980
(swelling music)

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:53.860
(explosion)

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.280
Devil: DAAAAHHH!! (bullet shot and ricochet)

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.040
Alright buddy, you wanna play dirty?

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.520
Well time to play with Johnson Justice!

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.800
Benny: Holy mother of Go-

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.100
Critic: God knows we've talked about pretty
much everything you can talk about

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:21.500
but there is one last element to discuss, the most important element of the movie.. main character!

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:23.060
This is the best Cinderella!

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.120
Hyper: Now this one you KNOW you 
have to give to the remake.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:41.440
It's like everyone says, this Cinderella is stronger,
more independent, more intelligent

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.820
and more developed than that simple songbird who practically just did nothing in the first film.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.240
The audiences liked her! The critics liked her!

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.720
C'mon, this is hands down the winner.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.500
Critic: Well, I would agree with you if it
wasn't for one solitary fact.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:56.720
Hyper: What's that?

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.160
Critic: You're all full of shit.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.100
What makes Cinderella independent?

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:06.320
Hyper: Well, she leaves the house, goes into town and has smart conversations with the prince.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:12.120
Critic: Hmm.. so she could leave the house at any time, why does she stay there and take all that abuse?

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.440
Hyper: Well, like she says, it's her father's home.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:19.380
"Because I made my mother and father a promise- to cherish the place we were so happy in."

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.820
Critic: OH! Is that why she
end up leaving at the end anyway!

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:26.660
And even if it was her father's home why go
through all that hardship just for that?!

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:30.580
Hyper: Well... okay. It doesn't quite make sense but the one in the other film could leave too!

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.420
Critic: Not really.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.380
You see, in the original, the father
died when she was just a child.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:41.320
This gives the stepmother plenty of time to brainwash her and make her think she's supposed to

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.920
feel guilty and serve her family.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.400
And seeing how she was kept in the home all that time,

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:50.620
this indicates she doesn't know much 
about how the real world works.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:53.580
She talks to rats and BIRDS for crying out loud!

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:59.120
In the new one, the father dies when she's an adult, she leaves all the time, in fact her friends-

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.100
yeah, she has friends in this one!

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.200
say she should leave that place!

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.460
"Why do you stay there when they treat you so?

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.420
"They loved our house and now that they're gone, I love it for them."

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.960
So this makes absolutely no sense.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.240
By attempting to make her quote, SMARTER and independent,

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:19.620
they actually opened up a ton of plot holes
making her look dumber and weaker.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.540
Hyper: Okay,  so she's not the brightest one in Hogwarts

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:26.800
But! You have to admit she's stronger! She's not as passive as the animated one.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.160
Critic: Really.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:32.760
In the original, she felt stuck in her
position but she clearly didn't like it.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.960
She did angry. She DID have her breaking points.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:40.960
Even though she was taught over the years to be a certain way she was still human and relatable.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.740
This one, aside from her one big breakdown,
which they tried to do twice

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:49.060
She just kind of smiles and looks happy
like a zombie most of the time.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:53.320
In fact, in the animated one when it comes to being locked in the attic and held against her will,

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.200
she does try to get out!

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.120
She hits the door! She screams! She 
asks her animal friends for help.

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.680
She does everything she can to get out of there.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:07.420
In the new one, she fully accepts her doom and just spins around in circles, humming to herself.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.800
Yeah. This is the strong independent role
model the  critics were talking about.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:17.440
She actually escapes by MISTAKE when the animals open up the window and they hear her voice.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:23.140
That's not strong. That's the definition of
giving off while also being saved by luck!

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.800
Hyper: But! Uhh... she's so charming!

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:31.260
Critic: No. She's not allowed to be because they're focusing more on her being "smart and independent".

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:36.700
People miss what makes a strong character is
how they deal with their flaws, their fears,

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.260
their turmoil, their troubles that get in the way.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.520
That's what makes them relatable but this
Cinderella doesn't have any flaws.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.680
At least, none that they'll acknowledge!

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.020
You could argue that she's too passive 
but what does she do to solve that?

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:51.820
Let someone else save the day and not even try!

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:56.880
This Cinderella and we gave a shit because while having a character be strong is good,

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.020
it's more important to have them interesting first.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.460
This character is not interesting.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:09.020
I'm not going to act like the original is the best written character but you felt her pain, you understood her anger

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:14.890
&amp; you cheered for her when things went right because she allowed you to see her most fragile moments.

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:20.170
Hyper: But...! But... HER DRESS! It look so amazing!!

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:26.470
Critic: And that's why you're falling for it. It looks the part and sounds the part but it's not portraying the part.

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.240
It's like the two Charlies from the Willy Wonka movies

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:33.440
One is an emotional yet, dreamful
kid and the other is Jesus.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:39.440
We're obviously going to relate to the one that acts more like a real kid because we all were real kids!

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:40.810
We all can relate to that!

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:45.210
It's the same thing here. It doesn't matter 
what you claim she is or isn't

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:48.370
if you don't connect with her, there's no emotion.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:53.910
And this movie has made it impossible to connect with her because they try to make her flawless.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:59.460
Ironically creating, unintentional flaws with her that are never acknowledged or resolved.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.460
Hyper: But! HER DRESS!!!!

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.560
Critic: Point goes to the old!

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.520
Hyper: AAAWW, IT'S SO SPARKLEY!!!!

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.400
Critic: So! With everything wrapped up, let's see who the winner is.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.020
(sad trombone)

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.140
Another tie?!?!

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.100
What the hell, man! We can't end like this!

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:22.400
Hyper: Yeah!! We need to find the best Cinderella movie!

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.620
(explosion)

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.400
Devil: YEAH-HA!!

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.040
Didn't expect old Johnson Justice, did'ya?!

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.220
(Benny groans

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.420
Now, open you're mouth. I'm gonna give you the finishing blow!

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.040
Hyper: Honey-raisin, can you help us settle a dispute?

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.400
Devil: Oh, this still you're little book club going on?

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.040
Critic: *strained* I swear to God...

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:44.180
Hyper: We're trying to decide what's the better Cinderella film: the original or the remake.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.580
Devil: Really? You're asking me this, right now?

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.220
Critic: Answer the question! Cartoon or remake!

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.380
Hyper: YEAH! (clank) The cartoon or the remake?!

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.440
Devil: Ever After.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.640
Critic: The Drew Barrymore movie?

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.460
Devil: Yeah! I mean... There's nothing wrong with it!

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.140
It's cool, it's smart, it's got sword fighting,

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.220
Morticia Addams is the stepmother,

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.560
Hell, even Cinderella does a little fighting.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:11.940
Yeah, there's no magic but... I hate that shit!

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.440
I got Johnson Justice.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.160
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna finish what I star-

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.720
Dammit! How does he keep doing that?!

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.200
Critic: Benny! What's your favorite Cinderella movie?!

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.580
Benny: Oh. Uh...

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:23.700
Ever After.

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:24.680
Devil: Whaaaaat?

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.500
(clank)

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.480
Benny: The writing is clever, the characters are interesting, the villain is fun

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.780
And there's just enough changes to keep it fresh but stay true to the heart of the story.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.800
Critic: Actually, the more I think about it... 
it IS a really good Cinderella story.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.180
Hyper: Yeeah... like REALLY good.

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.420
Critic: Cinderella's strong but interesting

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.600
Hyper: The villain is evil but also intriguing.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.420
Critic: There's plenty of action and adventure...

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.400
Hyper: but good romance and dress porn!

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.800
Critic: We should just pick that one!

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.980
Hyper: Are we allowed?

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:52.900
Critic: Yeah! Why not?

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:58.100
I mean, I think everybody can agree the two
Cinderella movies have pros and cons

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.920
and everyone's just gonna kinda like the version they like.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.340
But... Ever After is clearly better!

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.440
Hyper: Yeah! Let's do it. Let's give it to Ever After!

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.440
Critic: You got it! The best Cinderella movie is Ever After

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.000
because it's my show and I can do
whatever the goddamn hell I want.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.940
Well, that certainly was an interesting
discussion and with a twist ending

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.740
Hyper: Yeah but what do we do now?

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:28.240
Benny: I don't know. It seems a little
weird to kill a fellow Ever After fan.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.800
Devil: There's only one incredibly
manly thing to do in this situation.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.360
(clank)

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.000
Benny: Siri, play Ever After.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:36.900
(classical music)

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:40.280
Critic: Once again, the magic of
Angelica Huston unites us all.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.680
Devil: Now, this is how REAL men spend their Friday nights.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.540
Hyper: Hey!

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.340
Devil: Oh. Don't worry, buzzsaw, you're an honorary dude tonight.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:46.900
Hyper: Thanks. &lt;3

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.940
Devil: Sooo, was she drunk during this movie too?

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:56.020
Benny: I'm not entirely sure. I'm just
glad she actually DOES something

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.020
Hyper: Her dress isn't as good but it's pretty badass.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.720
Devil: Isn't it usually the other way around?

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:03.760
Like, you start off sober and then you get drunk as you get older?

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.000
Hyper: I'm always drunk.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.160
Benny: It's never too girly.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:10.480
Devil: Where is Angelica Huston?

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.580
Like, I know she's right in front of me, don't get me wrong but I mean, just... the actress, where'd she go?

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:15.640
Hyper: Jamaica, I think.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.360
Devil: Oh. Uhh, she might not be there anymore

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:19.420
Benny: Ooh...

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.700
Devil: I was kind of wondering what, uh... old, white woman was doing there.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:22.400
Hyper: Babe....

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.500
Devil: I'm sooorry!
Hyper: It's okay.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.720
It's not like they were gonna do Adam Sandler 3.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.980
"Leave the sewing to the women!"

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:39.700
Next week we take a look and see
if there's still really white washing.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.820

Hey, Doug Walker here, doing the charity shout-out.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:01.020
Today, we are doing Big Cat Rescue.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:06.760
Big Cat Rescue's mission is to provide the
best home they can for cats in their care

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:11.440
As well as end the abusive big cats in cavity and prevent their extinction.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:17.040
They have many species of cats, many of whom are threatened, endangered or extinct now in the wild.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:22.440
These cats are here for a variety of reasons, including abandoned by owners who wrongfully thought

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:28.140
they would make good pets, abused by owners in order to force them to preform, saved from being sluahgtered

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:33.060
to make fur coats or even just rescued as
babies after hunters killed their mothers.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:37.540
With your help, you can see these animals live the proud lives that they deserve.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:43.640
