00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:12.916
&gt;&gt;It's three PM in
Chicago and schools

00:00:12.956 --> 00:00:15.216
around the city are
winding down for the day.

00:00:15.216 --> 00:00:19.406
But in a renovated downtown
warehouse, a program called

00:00:19.406 --> 00:00:21.626
After School Matters
is in full swing.

00:00:23.816 --> 00:00:24.916
[singing] Two, two, two, three.

00:00:25.156 --> 00:00:28.756
&gt;&gt;The program, which today
serves over 25,000 teens,

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:32.096
started as a summer arts
program in a vacant lot.

00:00:32.186 --> 00:00:33.946
&gt;&gt;This is lot thirty seven.

00:00:33.946 --> 00:00:36.696
It was an empty lot in
the middle of the city.

00:00:36.986 --> 00:00:38.526
Every kind of art that you can think

00:00:38.526 --> 00:00:41.286
of took place here on
this wonderful block.

00:00:41.676 --> 00:00:44.446
Therefore, we called the
program Gallery Thirty Seven.

00:00:45.606 --> 00:00:49.016
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Gallery Thirty Seven,
which offers programs in the visual,

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:51.396
performing, culinary
and theater arts,

00:00:51.736 --> 00:00:54.586
has branched out to
include Words Thirty Seven,

00:00:54.926 --> 00:00:58.446
promoting literacy skills like
journalism and creative writing.

00:00:58.446 --> 00:01:00.876
&gt;&gt;Where the city belongs
to the adolescent.

00:01:01.096 --> 00:01:03.616
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Tech Thirty
Seven, offering web design,

00:01:03.616 --> 00:01:05.546
video production and robotics.

00:01:07.716 --> 00:01:11.036
Sports Thirty Seven, for
health and fitness programs.

00:01:11.656 --> 00:01:14.266
And recently, Science Thirty Seven,

00:01:14.386 --> 00:01:16.976
all under the umbrella
of After School Matters.

00:01:17.256 --> 00:01:20.146
&gt;&gt;To keep our students interested
in school, to keep them motivated,

00:01:20.456 --> 00:01:23.696
we have to help every single
child find their unique skill,

00:01:23.696 --> 00:01:24.436
their unique interest.

00:01:24.436 --> 00:01:27.296
So may it's dance or
drama or computers,

00:01:27.436 --> 00:01:29.786
or working with other students
and teaching and coaching.

00:01:30.036 --> 00:01:32.346
And After School Matters has
provided that so that many,

00:01:32.346 --> 00:01:33.606
that portfolio of options.

00:01:33.606 --> 00:01:36.646
Every student's not gonna
want to go to school frankly

00:01:36.646 --> 00:01:38.676
because they love biology
or love trigonometry.

00:01:38.946 --> 00:01:41.076
But it might be for that
after school program.

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:43.816
&gt;&gt;So you just pat these dry,
but don't press too hard,

00:01:44.076 --> 00:01:45.626
because if you do, they'll break.

00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:50.246
&gt;&gt;If a young person's in our program,
they are less likely to be truant.

00:01:50.246 --> 00:01:52.046
They have fewer course failures.

00:01:52.216 --> 00:01:55.016
Perhaps if they're not having a great
success story in the school day,

00:01:55.016 --> 00:01:58.636
they get success in the after school
program that reinvigorates them,

00:01:58.906 --> 00:02:01.156
helps raise their self esteem
and helps them feel good

00:02:01.156 --> 00:02:03.286
about themselves, so they
show up that next day

00:02:03.616 --> 00:02:05.106
for school, ready to learn.

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:07.076
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The students
who participate

00:02:07.076 --> 00:02:10.596
in After School Matters receive
modest stipends for working

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:12.066
as apprentices with professionals.

00:02:12.246 --> 00:02:13.266
&gt;&gt;It's awesome.

00:02:13.426 --> 00:02:15.586
Like the teachers were
great and it's really fun.

00:02:15.586 --> 00:02:20.746
It's just like a class but we get
paid for it, so that's the part.

00:02:21.476 --> 00:02:26.486
&gt;&gt;Our model of an apprenticeship
program lends authenticity

00:02:26.486 --> 00:02:30.086
and real world expertise that
could help them to light a spark

00:02:30.146 --> 00:02:33.776
about what they may want to study, or
careers that they may wanna explore.

00:02:33.776 --> 00:02:34.866
&gt;&gt;Let's do the dance motion again.

00:02:34.866 --> 00:02:41.736
I wanna make sure that
everybody has that motion down.

00:02:41.736 --> 00:02:42.936
One, two, a five, six, seven.

00:02:42.936 --> 00:02:43.296
&gt;&gt;You got it.

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:43.976
Two, then three, four.

00:02:44.206 --> 00:02:45.356
&gt;&gt;These are not teachers.

00:02:46.056 --> 00:02:48.486
These are people who are
professionals in their field

00:02:48.826 --> 00:02:51.786
and what they bring is just
this passion that they have.

00:02:51.786 --> 00:02:54.606
"I love this work and I
wanna tell you about it

00:02:54.606 --> 00:02:55.856
and I wanna show you how I do it."

00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:58.976
&gt;&gt;All: [singing] "Let's
go to the hop."

00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:03.116
&gt;&gt;After School Matters partners
with community organizations

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:05.006
to leverage existing resources.

00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:08.366
They also raise private
funds so teens from all

00:03:08.366 --> 00:03:10.536
across the city can
access their programs.

00:03:11.076 --> 00:03:14.106
&gt;&gt;Some of these youngsters lived in
public housing and some of them lived

00:03:14.106 --> 00:03:16.396
in the Gold Coast and we
brought them together.

00:03:17.086 --> 00:03:19.746
And you know what, they
learned to like one another

00:03:19.746 --> 00:03:22.526
and to trust one another
and to realize

00:03:22.526 --> 00:03:26.366
that they had far more
similarities than dissimilarities.

00:03:26.626 --> 00:03:29.326
I think that's a gift
to give a young person.

00:03:29.686 --> 00:03:33.346
These young people have so
much to offer and all we need

00:03:33.346 --> 00:03:35.116
to do is give them that opportunity.

00:03:35.956 --> 00:03:38.626
It's really very simple.

00:03:38.626 --> 00:03:41.306
