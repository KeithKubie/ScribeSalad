00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.870
Even if you don’t work for yourself, even
if you have a job inside a company and you

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.580
love it, that’s what you want to keep doing,
I would actually encourage everyone to think

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.110
about how they can develop multiple income
streams in their own life and in their own

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.430
business.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.340
When I started my professional career I was
a journalist and I had been doing it for about

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.329
a year, and one day I got called into the
HR office and I got laid off without warning.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.890
And they gave me a week’s severance pay.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.860
Technically I had actually already worked
Monday so it was four days severance pay.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.170
And I somehow had to figure out what to do
with myself.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:54.490
And that, at age 22, was my first realization
that the things that we take for granted,

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.130
the things that we think are stable, are not
always.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.570
If you take the initiative to develop multiple
income streams in your business, if you even

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.800
just spend a couple of hours a week developing
some kind of a side project for yourself,

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.050
there are a host of benefits.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.080
First of all, heaven forbid something happens
with your day job, but if it does, you’ve

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.909
been cultivating something that, over time,
you’ve hopefully been able to create to

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.170
bring in additional revenue which creates
a cushion and gives you something else that

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.950
you might be able to pivot toward.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:30.950
That’s great.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.670
But let me make another case.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.950
Even if you feel 100 percent sure that things
are good with your employer and are going

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.770
to stay that way, when you do entrepreneurial
experimentation on your own time you are making

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.810
yourself more valuable to your company.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.320
In my book, 'Entrepreneurial You', I actually
tell the story of a guy named Lenny Achan.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.130
Now Lenny was somebody that I got to know
because I was consulting for his employer.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.600
At the time he used to work for Mount Sinai
Hospital in New York.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.730
And I kept hearing about him.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.689
People were sort of whispering about him because
he had risen so rapidly in the organization.

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:11.110
And so when I met him I was curious.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.450
I said, "Lenny, what’s your story?

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.450
Tell me."

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.760
And it turns out he had started his career
as a nurse at the hospital, and by the time

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.299
I met him he was running communications for
the hospital.

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.030
That is not a traditional career path.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.540
The vast majority of nurses are not doing
that.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.920
But the way he was able to dramatically transform
his career and his income was that he had

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.299
become interested, on the side, on his own
time, with apps.

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:44.209
And so he learned what he need to learn in
order to create a couple of apps on the side.

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.930
His boss found out about it, called him into
the office one day.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.129
Lenny was worried because he thought maybe
he had violated some policy he wasn’t aware

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.129
of.

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.190
But instead of firing him or punishing him
his boss said, Lenny, I hear you’ve made

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.629
some apps.

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.260
And Lenny said, well yes, it’s true.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.260
I did.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.889
And the boss said, we need someone to run
social media for the hospital.

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.110
I think it should be you.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.329
And so he got that promotion and he did so
well with it, ultimately they gave him the

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.040
entire communications portfolio.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.879
When you are learning and experimenting on
your own time, you are able to pursue your

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.950
interests, deepen your passions, gain more
skills and then bring all of that back to

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.879
work for your employer.

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.549
When they see that you’ve taken the initiative
to do that, it sets you apart.

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.209
The vast majority of people are not doing
that and it ultimately is likely to lead to

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.979
you being rewarded even more in your current
job and making you that much more secure.
