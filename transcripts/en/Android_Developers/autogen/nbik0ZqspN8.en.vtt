apps and they were basically all in

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209
apps and they were basically all in
 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.449
apps and they were basically all in
English so we had this big problem that

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459
English so we had this big problem that
 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.699
English so we had this big problem that
we were trying all the time to translate

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709

couple of years ago there were many
 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.880
couple of years ago there were many
alternatives in this specific field for

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890
alternatives in this specific field for
 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.800
alternatives in this specific field for
the early childhood a category so we we

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810
the early childhood a category so we we
 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.690
the early childhood a category so we we
were asked all the time and especially

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700
were asked all the time and especially
 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.600
were asked all the time and especially
in this past three years why why would

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610
in this past three years why why would
 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.259
in this past three years why why would
you go global

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269
you go global
 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.720
you go global
eh why wouldn't you focus for example in

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730
eh why wouldn't you focus for example in
 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.150
eh why wouldn't you focus for example in
the Spanish market that we we're from

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160
the Spanish market that we we're from
 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.970
the Spanish market that we we're from
Argentina so we we kind of know the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980
Argentina so we we kind of know the
 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.370
Argentina so we we kind of know the
language and we can make a difference on

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380
language and we can make a difference on
 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.800
language and we can make a difference on
that or why wouldn't you focus in the US

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810
that or why wouldn't you focus in the US
 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.810
that or why wouldn't you focus in the US
market that is more mature and you have

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820
market that is more mature and you have
 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.710
market that is more mature and you have
better chances of making more revenue so

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720
better chances of making more revenue so
 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.280
better chances of making more revenue so
a we we thought at that moment that this

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290
a we we thought at that moment that this
 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.250
a we we thought at that moment that this
particular issue was going to be a

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260
particular issue was going to be a
 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.680
particular issue was going to be a
global like many many people from all

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690
global like many many people from all
 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.270
global like many many people from all
over the world we're going to use the

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280
over the world we're going to use the
 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.400
over the world we're going to use the
apps in English only and we're going to

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410
apps in English only and we're going to
 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.900
apps in English only and we're going to
have this problem what while trying to

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910
have this problem what while trying to
 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.870
have this problem what while trying to
to help their kids learn useful stuff

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880
to help their kids learn useful stuff

we had we found this opportunity three
 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.380
we had we found this opportunity three
years ago that when we started the

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390
years ago that when we started the
 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.440
years ago that when we started the
company we we found amazing translators

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450
company we we found amazing translators
 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.509
company we we found amazing translators
and crowdsourcing services that probably

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519
and crowdsourcing services that probably
 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.240
and crowdsourcing services that probably
ten years ago if we had this this vision

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250
ten years ago if we had this this vision
 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.920
ten years ago if we had this this vision
would have been much more difficult but

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930
would have been much more difficult but
 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.860
would have been much more difficult but
at that specific moment we found it was

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870
at that specific moment we found it was
 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.370
at that specific moment we found it was
quite easy to get talented voiceovers in

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380
quite easy to get talented voiceovers in
 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.840
quite easy to get talented voiceovers in
several languages I'm going to tell you

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850
several languages I'm going to tell you
 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.780
several languages I'm going to tell you
we were localizing the apps in 15

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790
we were localizing the apps in 15
 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.830
we were localizing the apps in 15
languages and also it was very

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840
languages and also it was very
 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.569
languages and also it was very
unexpected and also very easy to

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579
unexpected and also very easy to
 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.659
unexpected and also very easy to
implement so I think once you start

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669
implement so I think once you start
 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.449
implement so I think once you start
seeing our metrics in in downloads and

seeing our metrics in in downloads and
 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.850
seeing our metrics in in downloads and
how after localizing is started to grow

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860
how after localizing is started to grow
 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.190
how after localizing is started to grow
probably more more than one of you will

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000
starting
 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.980
starting
in localizing in languages like Asia or

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990
in localizing in languages like Asia or
 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.650

Eastern Europe and our countries so this

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660
Eastern Europe and our countries so this
 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.780
Eastern Europe and our countries so this
this graph I I like it a lot because

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790
this graph I I like it a lot because
 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.060
this graph I I like it a lot because

an animal sounds are very simple but we
 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.740
an animal sounds are very simple but we
launched it already in three languages

then us about 9% so we launched the app

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240
then us about 9% so we launched the app
 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.330
then us about 9% so we launched the app
and immediately we had like 84 percent

they feedback we got and the reviews

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150
they feedback we got and the reviews
 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.640
they feedback we got and the reviews
were amazing because people were

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650
were amazing because people were
 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.250
were amazing because people were
actually surprised that we took care of

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260
actually surprised that we took care of
 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.130
actually surprised that we took care of
different languages in one single app

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140
different languages in one single app
 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.390
different languages in one single app
and then we have countries like

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400
and then we have countries like
 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.300
and then we have countries like
languages like Indonesia a German and

India that were like in the long time
 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.120
India that were like in the long time
but we were still like obsessed with

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130
but we were still like obsessed with
 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.080
but we were still like obsessed with
with this last statistics we were assess

with this last statistics we were assess
 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.740
with this last statistics we were assess
that 60% 16% of the traffic were using

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750
that 60% 16% of the traffic were using
 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.630
that 60% 16% of the traffic were using
the app in a foreign language and we we

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640
the app in a foreign language and we we
 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.850
the app in a foreign language and we we
said okay this is happening like the

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860
said okay this is happening like the
 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.280
said okay this is happening like the
same happened to us is happening in

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290
same happened to us is happening in
 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.409
same happened to us is happening in
countries like France in countries like

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419
countries like France in countries like
 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:50.600
countries like France in countries like
Italy so they are using an app and

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610
Italy so they are using an app and
 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.110
Italy so they are using an app and
translating the the app to your kid so

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120
translating the the app to your kid so
 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.260
translating the the app to your kid so
what we did right after we took like

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270
what we did right after we took like
 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.290
what we did right after we took like
localization that was something that has

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300
localization that was something that has
 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.050
localization that was something that has
been said a lot today like super serious

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060
been said a lot today like super serious
 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.980
been said a lot today like super serious
we decided to create a global team I'm

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990
we decided to create a global team I'm
 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.870
we decided to create a global team I'm
going to tell you how I'm going to share

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880
going to tell you how I'm going to share
 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.020
going to tell you how I'm going to share
our method to do it we have to decide at

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030
our method to do it we have to decide at
 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.570
our method to do it we have to decide at
what point which languages were going to

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580
what point which languages were going to
 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.690
what point which languages were going to
be to be included because there are too

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700
be to be included because there are too
 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.640
be to be included because there are too
many languages and we have to make at

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650
many languages and we have to make at
 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.510
many languages and we have to make at
least a one cut and we this the decision

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520
least a one cut and we this the decision
 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.969
least a one cut and we this the decision
for us was pretty easy we left some cut

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979
for us was pretty easy we left some cut
 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.000
for us was pretty easy we left some cut
some languages or countries that

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010
some languages or countries that
 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.990
some languages or countries that
potentially might be very good for

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000
potentially might be very good for
 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.770
potentially might be very good for
revenue but short in reach and we

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780
revenue but short in reach and we
 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.279
revenue but short in reach and we
decided to go for a megabit in the

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289
decided to go for a megabit in the
 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:38.750
decided to go for a megabit in the
emerging countries in the merging

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760
emerging countries in the merging
 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.760
emerging countries in the merging
markets so we

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770
markets so we
 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.189
markets so we
we cover languages like Indonesia Arabic

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199
we cover languages like Indonesia Arabic
 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.559
we cover languages like Indonesia Arabic
in the Malaysia Philippines all with

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:45.569
in the Malaysia Philippines all with
 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:48.379
in the Malaysia Philippines all with
voiceovers in those countries voiceovers

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:48.389
voiceovers in those countries voiceovers
 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:50.719
voiceovers in those countries voiceovers
and well that that is like the hardest

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:50.729
and well that that is like the hardest
 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:52.999
and well that that is like the hardest
part like to get quality voice overs but

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:53.009
part like to get quality voice overs but
 

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:55.309
part like to get quality voice overs but
everything is localized even the lowest

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319
everything is localized even the lowest
 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:58.309
everything is localized even the lowest
localizing Indian we were crazy trying

00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319
localizing Indian we were crazy trying
 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:00.700
localizing Indian we were crazy trying
to understand if we made the correct a

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:00.710
to understand if we made the correct a
 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.680
to understand if we made the correct a
understanding but in turnout rate and

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:03.690
understanding but in turnout rate and
 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.990
understanding but in turnout rate and
I'm going to tell you a little bit about

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000
I'm going to tell you a little bit about
 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.110
I'm going to tell you a little bit about
it and then we we knew that we were

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120
it and then we we knew that we were
 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.879
it and then we we knew that we were
going to fail in on so many levels

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:10.889
going to fail in on so many levels
 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:13.460
going to fail in on so many levels
especially because we we were facing on

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:13.470
especially because we we were facing on
 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.370
especially because we we were facing on
other cultures and well people have

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380
other cultures and well people have
 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.740
other cultures and well people have
different visions like for example in

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:18.750
different visions like for example in
 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.870
different visions like for example in
some countries that something that you

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880
some countries that something that you
 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.570
some countries that something that you
think that is good culture for you might

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580
think that is good culture for you might
 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.999
think that is good culture for you might
be completely a the opposite in our

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:26.009
be completely a the opposite in our
 

00:07:26.009 --> 00:07:29.029
be completely a the opposite in our
culture so we had to we study to check

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039
culture so we had to we study to check
 

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:31.460
culture so we had to we study to check
the reviews all day and study to respond

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:31.470
the reviews all day and study to respond
 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.499
the reviews all day and study to respond
and understand which were our weaknesses

00:07:33.499 --> 00:07:33.509
and understand which were our weaknesses
 

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:37.370
and understand which were our weaknesses
in win our apps we got a lot but we we

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380
in win our apps we got a lot but we we
 

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:39.830
in win our apps we got a lot but we we
set it to after conversation we started

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840
set it to after conversation we started
 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.010
set it to after conversation we started
to improve that a lot so this is our

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.020
to improve that a lot so this is our
 

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.309
to improve that a lot so this is our
graphic now two years later of the same

00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319
graphic now two years later of the same
 

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:48.890
graphic now two years later of the same
that I've shown before after localizing

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:48.900
that I've shown before after localizing
 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.800
that I've shown before after localizing
so basically you can see here all the

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:51.810
so basically you can see here all the
 

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.899
so basically you can see here all the
only blue countries were the original

00:07:53.899 --> 00:07:53.909
only blue countries were the original
 

00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:56.089
only blue countries were the original
languages that we array cover Brazil is

00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:56.099
languages that we array cover Brazil is
 

00:07:56.099 --> 00:07:58.730
languages that we array cover Brazil is
still in the position number two is

00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:58.740
still in the position number two is
 

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.249
still in the position number two is
still like in the top three but then we

00:08:01.249 --> 00:08:01.259
still like in the top three but then we
 

00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:03.680
still like in the top three but then we
have a lot of new countries that are in

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:03.690
have a lot of new countries that are in
 

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:06.469
have a lot of new countries that are in

is something I think it's a good example
 

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:58.759
is something I think it's a good example
of how by understanding and reading

00:12:58.759 --> 00:12:58.769
of how by understanding and reading
 

00:12:58.769 --> 00:13:01.910

sometimes you think that you have

00:14:26.329 --> 00:14:26.339
sometimes you think that you have
 

00:14:26.339 --> 00:14:27.740

something wrong in your app and it's
 

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.619
something wrong in your app and it's
something cultural and we we ask for

something cultural and we we ask for

like in the third or fourth session so
 

00:14:36.449 --> 00:14:38.509
like in the third or fourth session so
it might be like a good idea to start

00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519
it might be like a good idea to start
 

00:14:38.519 --> 00:14:40.490
it might be like a good idea to start
thinking for example Indonesia don't ask

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:40.500
thinking for example Indonesia don't ask
 

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.790
thinking for example Indonesia don't ask
right away because the users have this

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800
right away because the users have this
 

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.090
right away because the users have this
commitment to to put a review and then

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:46.100
commitment to to put a review and then
 

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.400
commitment to to put a review and then
evaluate the app so these are the kind

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:49.410
evaluate the app so these are the kind
 

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:51.110
evaluate the app so these are the kind
of things that we are learning by using

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120

the reviews and well resolved is the

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:53.730
the reviews and well resolved is the
 

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.730
the reviews and well resolved is the
some percentage of the people that says

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:55.740
some percentage of the people that says
 

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.319
some percentage of the people that says
that the app is the in-app purchases are

00:14:57.319 --> 00:14:57.329
that the app is the in-app purchases are
 

00:14:57.329 --> 00:14:59.540
that the app is the in-app purchases are
expensive but that is a main issue the

00:14:59.540 --> 00:14:59.550
expensive but that is a main issue the
 

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:04.100
expensive but that is a main issue the
de Guadalupe oh well at last this is

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:04.110
de Guadalupe oh well at last this is
 

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.319
de Guadalupe oh well at last this is
what we are more focused now because we

00:15:06.319 --> 00:15:06.329
what we are more focused now because we
 

00:15:06.329 --> 00:15:09.139
what we are more focused now because we
have the app available in where we have

00:15:09.139 --> 00:15:09.149
have the app available in where we have
 

00:15:09.149 --> 00:15:11.540

languages so we obviously know that it

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120
languages so we obviously know that it
 

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.449
languages so we obviously know that it
is it is simpler to have the same price

00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:17.459
is it is simpler to have the same price
 

00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:19.970
is it is simpler to have the same price
for example in Germany it than Indonesia

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:19.980
for example in Germany it than Indonesia
 

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:21.799
for example in Germany it than Indonesia
or it just doesn't work like the

00:15:21.799 --> 00:15:21.809
or it just doesn't work like the
 

00:15:21.809 --> 00:15:23.660
or it just doesn't work like the
percentage of paying users it's

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:23.670
percentage of paying users it's
 

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:24.379
percentage of paying users it's
ridiculous

00:15:24.379 --> 00:15:24.389
ridiculous
 

00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:27.549
ridiculous
if you have the same pricing in all so

00:15:27.549 --> 00:15:27.559
if you have the same pricing in all so
 

00:15:27.559 --> 00:15:30.620
if you have the same pricing in all so
when we we knew that the new feature of

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:30.630
when we we knew that the new feature of
 

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.230
when we we knew that the new feature of
the pricing tiers and and and the

the pricing tiers and and and the
 

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.240
the pricing tiers and and and the
templates came came out with

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:35.250
templates came came out with
 

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.430
templates came came out with
testing a lot and I have three things

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440
testing a lot and I have three things

that I would like to to share like the
 

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.750
that I would like to to share like the
experiments that might be some

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:41.760
experiments that might be some
 

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:46.550
experiments that might be some
highlights so after what we did I will

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560
highlights so after what we did I will
 

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.070
highlights so after what we did I will
explain very simple we did a division of

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:49.080
explain very simple we did a division of
 

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:49.850
explain very simple we did a division of
three tiers

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:49.860
three tiers
 

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:53.120
three tiers
we created a tier that was the top 15

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:53.130
we created a tier that was the top 15
 

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.470
we created a tier that was the top 15
countries in the world that spent more

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480
countries in the world that spent more
 

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.510
countries in the world that spent more
in gaming and we put it them in the

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:56.520
in gaming and we put it them in the
 

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.370
in gaming and we put it them in the
first column then the second like

00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:58.380
first column then the second like
 

00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.960
first column then the second like
countries like Brazil Argentina that

00:15:59.960 --> 00:15:59.970
countries like Brazil Argentina that
 

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:03.530
countries like Brazil Argentina that
spend more less than let's say Japan and

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:03.540
spend more less than let's say Japan and
 

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.510
spend more less than let's say Japan and
we put in the second row and then they

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:05.520
we put in the second row and then they
 

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:07.790
we put in the second row and then they
have we have the other countries that is

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800
have we have the other countries that is
 

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.850
have we have the other countries that is
spin less that are more oriented to ads

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:10.860
spin less that are more oriented to ads
 

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.160
spin less that are more oriented to ads
and we put in the third column so

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:13.170
and we put in the third column so
 

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:16.220
and we put in the third column so
basically the first column had a hundred

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:16.230
basically the first column had a hundred
 

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.470
basically the first column had a hundred
percent of the price the second 70% of

00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480
percent of the price the second 70% of
 

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.330
percent of the price the second 70% of
the price and the other 50% of the price

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:20.340
the price and the other 50% of the price
 

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.480
the price and the other 50% of the price
that was experiment we weren't trying to

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:22.490
that was experiment we weren't trying to
 

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.510
that was experiment we weren't trying to
to understand if that made a difference

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:25.520
to understand if that made a difference
 

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.070
to understand if that made a difference
so for example in countries like Russia

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:28.080
so for example in countries like Russia
 

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.370
so for example in countries like Russia
when we did this 30 percent discount we

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:31.380
when we did this 30 percent discount we
 

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.730
when we did this 30 percent discount we
saw a 70% increase in sales and this

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:34.740
saw a 70% increase in sales and this
 

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.220
saw a 70% increase in sales and this
this is like if you start doing this on

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:37.230
this is like if you start doing this on
 

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.070
this is like if you start doing this on
every country and start focusing you

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:40.080
every country and start focusing you
 

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.329
every country and start focusing you
will see that there are difference but

00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:41.339
will see that there are difference but
 

00:16:41.339 --> 00:16:43.340
will see that there are difference but
it is very impressive the growth we

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:43.350
it is very impressive the growth we
 

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.860
it is very impressive the growth we
having in Russia Russia is one of our

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:45.870
having in Russia Russia is one of our
 

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.980
having in Russia Russia is one of our
top 15 countries in downloads then we

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:48.990
top 15 countries in downloads then we
 

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:52.250
top 15 countries in downloads then we
put a reduced price in Latin America and

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:52.260
put a reduced price in Latin America and
 

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.480
put a reduced price in Latin America and
we saw that it didn't make any

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:53.490
we saw that it didn't make any
 

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.030
we saw that it didn't make any
difference for us at least like people

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040
difference for us at least like people
 

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.760
difference for us at least like people
it is just a percentage that my pay or

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:58.770
it is just a percentage that my pay or
 

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:01.820
it is just a percentage that my pay or
not but if in that specific case when we

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:01.830
not but if in that specific case when we
 

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:04.100
not but if in that specific case when we
reduce the price we had the same amount

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:04.110
reduce the price we had the same amount
 

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:06.740
reduce the price we had the same amount
of people but just less revenue but it's

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:06.750
of people but just less revenue but it's
 

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.500
of people but just less revenue but it's
interesting to see and try because maybe

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:09.510
interesting to see and try because maybe
 

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:11.270
interesting to see and try because maybe
maybe the price is still not very

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280
maybe the price is still not very
 

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.819
maybe the price is still not very
attractive to users that are willing to

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:13.829
attractive to users that are willing to
 

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:18.439
attractive to users that are willing to
to spend $1 $2 and then at last this is

00:17:18.439 --> 00:17:18.449
to spend $1 $2 and then at last this is
 

00:17:18.449 --> 00:17:21.740
to spend $1 $2 and then at last this is
just very simple Ana and we were like

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:21.750
just very simple Ana and we were like
 

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.949
just very simple Ana and we were like
very angry we didn't do it before we saw

00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959
very angry we didn't do it before we saw
 

00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:27.110
very angry we didn't do it before we saw
a significant increase by just running

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120
a significant increase by just running
 

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:30.590
a significant increase by just running
up the Europe price because the Google

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600
up the Europe price because the Google
 

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:32.690

Play console like if you do the auto

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.700
Play console like if you do the auto
 

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.810
Play console like if you do the auto
conversion it rounds for example from

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:34.820
conversion it rounds for example from
 

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:39.590
conversion it rounds for example from
$0.99 it was 0 89 by I think now it is

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600
$0.99 it was 0 89 by I think now it is
 

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.960
$0.99 it was 0 89 by I think now it is
auto converted but when we understood

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:41.970
auto converted but when we understood
 

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.750
auto converted but when we understood
that we said ok we have to run up every

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:44.760
that we said ok we have to run up every
 

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.000

price because probably was confusing

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:47.010
price because probably was confusing
 

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:48.890
price because probably was confusing
people who say why is it zero

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:48.900
people who say why is it zero
 

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.470
people who say why is it zero
89 and we sell like in countries like

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.480
89 and we sell like in countries like
 

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.350
89 and we sell like in countries like
Italy he had like 45 50 percent of

Italy he had like 45 50 percent of
 

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.630
Italy he had like 45 50 percent of
increase in sales so that is something

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640
increase in sales so that is something
 

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.810
increase in sales so that is something
very easy to do one if you have ABS

00:17:58.810 --> 00:17:58.820
very easy to do one if you have ABS
 

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:03.380
very easy to do one if you have ABS
distributor I suggest you do it so I

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:03.390
distributor I suggest you do it so I
 

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:05.480
distributor I suggest you do it so I
have been showing some results but I

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:05.490
have been showing some results but I
 

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.700
have been showing some results but I
wanted to show you like more the big

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:07.710
wanted to show you like more the big
 

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.890
wanted to show you like more the big
picture of how once we started

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:09.900
picture of how once we started
 

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:14.810
picture of how once we started
localizing how it turn out so we took

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:14.820
localizing how it turn out so we took
 

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.240
localizing how it turn out so we took
here to countries Italy and France as

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:17.250
here to countries Italy and France as
 

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:20.060
here to countries Italy and France as
examples let's say that Italian friends

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:20.070
examples let's say that Italian friends
 

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.340
examples let's say that Italian friends
were having without the localized

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:22.350
were having without the localized
 

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:24.110
were having without the localized
version so we when we having we're

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120
version so we when we having we're
 

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.170
version so we when we having we're
having the three languages let's say 100

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:27.180
having the three languages let's say 100
 

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.320
having the three languages let's say 100
downloads every day so after localizing

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:30.330
downloads every day so after localizing
 

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.230
downloads every day so after localizing
just the first month we had three times

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240
just the first month we had three times
 

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.800
just the first month we had three times
that that amount after six months we had

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:36.810
that that amount after six months we had
 

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:39.200
that that amount after six months we had
four times after a year we had five

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:39.210
four times after a year we had five
 

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:42.020
four times after a year we had five
times so I think it good it shows quite

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:42.030
times so I think it good it shows quite
 

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:45.110
times so I think it good it shows quite
good and the the huge potential of

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120
good and the the huge potential of
 

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.780
good and the the huge potential of
localizing because if you do it on on a

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:47.790
localizing because if you do it on on a
 

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.900
localizing because if you do it on on a
regular basis and with with 15 languages

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:50.910
regular basis and with with 15 languages
 

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:53.240
regular basis and with with 15 languages
like we did we had like three times the

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:53.250
like we did we had like three times the
 

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.430
like we did we had like three times the
downloads in general and there are some

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:55.440
downloads in general and there are some
 

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.620

countries like Indonesia that the the

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:57.630
countries like Indonesia that the the
 

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:01.010
countries like Indonesia that the the
growth was 10 times so i really suggest

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:01.020
growth was 10 times so i really suggest
 

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:06.710
growth was 10 times so i really suggest
you do it and well before localizing

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720
you do it and well before localizing
 

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.320
you do it and well before localizing
asia and europe was only 18 percent of

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:09.330
asia and europe was only 18 percent of
 

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.380
asia and europe was only 18 percent of
the traffic and after organizing is 51

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:12.390
the traffic and after organizing is 51
 

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:15.530
the traffic and after organizing is 51
and the other the other localized

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:15.540
and the other the other localized
 

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.440
and the other the other localized
languages are still growing not not like

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:18.450
languages are still growing not not like
 

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.350
languages are still growing not not like
the the ones that we localized now but

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360
the the ones that we localized now but
 

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.740
the the ones that we localized now but
this gave a huge percentage of new users

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:24.750
this gave a huge percentage of new users
 

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:29.750
this gave a huge percentage of new users
and especially in revenue so these are

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760
and especially in revenue so these are
 

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.960
and especially in revenue so these are
the I think the last two charts a this

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:32.970
the I think the last two charts a this
 

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.430
the I think the last two charts a this
is how it looked like our revenue top

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:36.440
is how it looked like our revenue top
 

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.860
is how it looked like our revenue top
grossing countries in Google Play before

grossing countries in Google Play before
 

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.930
grossing countries in Google Play before
organizing so basically you had us

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:41.940
organizing so basically you had us
 

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.870

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.140
Raziel Mexico Argentina and Chile after
organizing we have the big increase or

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:48.150
organizing we have the big increase or
 

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.840
organizing we have the big increase or
