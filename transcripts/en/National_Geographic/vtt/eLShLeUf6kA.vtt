00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.033
Cameras aren't working.

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:07.300
It's getting super frustrating.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.400
This is what it's like
on "Life Below Zero."

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.500
Cameras already down.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.734
Tough conditions all
around to film in.

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:14.533
No heat.

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:15.734
No power.

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:18.033
No anything.

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:19.133
Won't even turn on.

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:23.033
I've fallen too many times.

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:24.333
We have bad winds.

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:28.000
It's just a typical
day on the Arctic.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.367
Making best with what we got.

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:43.367
Takes a lot of food to feed a
bunch of people for a few weeks

00:00:43.367 --> 00:00:46.300
out in the wilderness to make
the show while we're out there.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.100
We're getting ready
for a winter move off.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.867
And the place we want
to go is to the Kiwalik.

00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:51.967
We go down there, sometimes
for several months at a time,

00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:53.233
and we hunt, fish, and gather.

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:54.033
It's worth the challenge.

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:55.033
It's worth the dangers.

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:56.300
It's worth the time.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.900
And the unknown doesn't bother
me because nobody knows.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.533
Today we're loading up
our entire show in order

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:08.133
to follow the hailstones to
Kiwalik for some adventures

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.000
out there.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.133
And part of what
we have to do is

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:15.300
load everything that we need for
a couple of weeks in the field.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.800
One sled with most
of the camera gear.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.300
Personal camping gear here.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.033
Another sled that's mostly food.

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:22.100
A bunch of propane.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.266
A generator.

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:25.367
We use a tremendous
number of camera batteries

00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:27.934
on a daily basis, so we
have to run a generator

00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:29.767
when we're out in remote areas.

00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:31.767
I always carry this
safety bag that's

00:01:31.767 --> 00:01:33.300
got our communication devices.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.367
It let's us keep in touch
with our office in Anchorage

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:40.000
and L.A. And then also it's
got emergency provisions,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.100
medical kit, and
emergency shelter,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.133
warm clothes, and
food, and fire,

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:47.867
and everything you would need
if you are stuck somewhere.

00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:48.867
Pretty excited to go.

00:01:48.867 --> 00:01:50.166
Hailstones are almost
ready to leave.

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:53.133
So we're going to
start up the machines

00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:54.767
and haul them out to Kiwalik.

00:01:54.767 --> 00:01:58.100
[music playing]

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.900
So we're carrying this
big load out to Kiwalik.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.633
We were going over these
really hard-packed wind drifts,

00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:20.600
and it's pushed up the gate.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.000
It's bent the gate
the wrong direction

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.967
on two of these hitches now.

00:02:26.967 --> 00:02:31.400
So we're kind of in a bit
of a sticky place here.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.200
See, this thing's at an angle.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.000
Yeah.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.533
There it is.

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:37.367
OK now, see if you can get
this-- yeah, there you go.

00:02:37.367 --> 00:02:38.266
- There it is.
- Yeah.

00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:41.200
Hallelujah.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.700
One, two, three.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.066
[engine reving]

00:02:56.133 --> 00:02:59.000
Just another day
on "Life Below Zero."

00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:05.433
So we're here in Kiwalik.

00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:07.367
We finally made it.

00:03:07.367 --> 00:03:10.500
This is a bit of a
victory celebration

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.066
going on at 3:00 AM.

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:15.333
110 miles over some
really rough terrain,

00:03:15.333 --> 00:03:21.700
across tundra and frozen
Bering Sea, and got here.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.834
Pretty much just had to
make hard luck shelter

00:03:24.834 --> 00:03:27.533
and get some food into the crew.

00:03:27.533 --> 00:03:30.900
We've got everything that we
need for the next month with us

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.367
in these four sleds.

00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:34.967
Roll out our sleeping
bags and get some rest.

00:03:34.967 --> 00:03:36.800
And then wake up in
the morning and build

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.300
our little tent city here.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.200
Everyone's pretty
excited to be here.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.800
This is what it takes
to follow the Hailstones

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.000
into the middle of nowhere.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.700
Woo hoo.
