00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.950
Microplastics could have made their way into this really common food additive, and honestly,

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.580
I'm feeling pretty salty about it.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.329
We’ve heard the term “microplastics”
ad nauseum and they’re pretty much what

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:15.549
they sound like; plastic debris that has been
weathered down into tiny fragments, usually

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:17.620
5 millimeters long or less.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.750
When we talk about it, we mostly focus on
how this trash affects our ocean life.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.200
We regularly find plastic inside the the bellies
of birds and whales.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.750
And for our shellfish fans, a study has shown
that European consumers can ingest up to eleven

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.080
thousand plastic particles a year from eating
shellfish.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.680
So, the answer is let’s just avoid all seafood
forever right?

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.079
Weeell, it’s not going to be that easy.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.230
In fact, microplastics are closer to your
kitchen table than you think.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.810
Ever heard of a little thing called I dunno,
SALT.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:45.810
YES.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:46.810
SALT.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.810
Sea salt to be exact.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.600
Those 0.3 millimeter salt grains have microscopic
plastic particles in them.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.140
A recent study from Nature found microplastics
inside the grains of 16 different salt brands

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.399
taken from 8 different countries, which held
plastic fibers and beads as small as 160 microns.

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.760
The earth is literally taking our trash with
a grain of salt.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.460
(btw the study conveniently didn’t list
brands, don’t even look for it I already

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.460
tried.)

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.250
The types of plastics inside these salty crystals
are important too.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.400
The polymer particles found were mostly polypropylene
and polyethylene which are two types of durable

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.670
plastics that are used in things like grocery
bags, plastic bottle caps, prescription bottles,

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.970
lunch boxes and more.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.500
And this isn’t the first time we’ve tested
for microplastics in our salt.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.210
Even earlier in 2017, researchers tested twenty-one
different types of Spanish table salts and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.960
ALL twenty one of them were found to have
polymer particles of polyethylene-terephthalate,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.380
which is used to make plastic bottles.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.110
So, the answer is let’s just avoid all shellfish
AAND salt forever right? Well avoiding them

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.049
might not be the best strategy since microplastics
are just everywhere.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.030
We’re finding it in our oceans, fertilizer,
food chains, and even the air we breathe.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.290
But we really shouldn’t be surprised.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.411
This polymer, polyethylene-terephthalate,
you know that one that’s used for plastic

00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:02.770
bottles, yeah it takes up to 400 years to
naturally decompose.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.310
Plastic hasn’t even been around that long
yet.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.490
It was invented in 1907, but since the 1950’s,
plastic production has ramped up and now we

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.070
make over 300 million metric tons globally.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.770
And up to 12.7 million tons of plastic waste
enters our oceans every year.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.230
It’s barely been over a century and we already
have plastic in our salt guys.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.620
But that’s the thing isn’t it?

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.160
Microplastics haven’t been around long enough
for us to really understand their long-term

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.150
harmful effects in human body.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.120
What we DO know from past research is that
the accumulation of microplastics can cause

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.310
particle, chemical, and microbial hazards.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.361
Particle toxicity may occur if a critical
mass of pieces are localized and cause an

00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:44.370
immune response from your body (which your
body can’t do much about anyway).

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.530
Chemical toxicity could occur since the particles
may excrete deadly pollutants they’ve picked

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.570
up from the environment.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.240
Plus, what plastic is made out of isn’t
too good for you.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.390
But when it comes to the salt, we ultimately
haven’t found a dosage of microplastics

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.980
that is harmful to us...yet.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.480
The production of plastic is still on the
rise and it’s expected to triple by 2050.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.690
So our exposure to it will likely increase,
and we’ll probably have to change the way

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.410
we think about our plastic production and
consumption.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.720
If we’ve already done this much damage,
how much are we going to see in another 30

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.720
years?

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.569
I know I don’t want a dash of plastic to
go with my dash of salt.

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.140
If you want some simple ways to reduce your
plastic consumption, you can invest in reusable

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.920
utensils, don’t wrap your compostable food
in plastic bags, give up on gum, reuse containers,

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.590
buy reusable water bottles, or any of the
hundreds of other ways you could prevent plastic

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.569
pollution.
It’s not too late to change our ways, and

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.730
if you still have doubts about all this then,
go ahead and reach for that salt shaker.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.870
I’m sure you’ll be fine :)
If you think you’re swimming in microplastics

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.170
now, you’ve got nothing on Ben Lecomte,
the swimmer attempting to cross the Pacific

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.170
Ocean, RIGHT.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.170
NOW.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.739
He’s out there as we speak, along with a
team of researchers that will be the first

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.159
to collect data by hand from one end of the
ocean to the other and Seeker has all the

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.810
latest updates and info, to learn about more
about his journey check out this video here.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.319
I’m Maren, Thanks for watching.
