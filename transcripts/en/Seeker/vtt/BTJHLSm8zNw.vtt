00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:16.500
Have you ever felt terrible, really terrible
for forgetting something?

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.860
A birthday, a passport, an appointment?

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.560
Maybe forgetting has had negative consequences
for you and your relationships.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.750
People that tend to remember facts and details
and recall them on short notice can appear

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.280
more intelligent, and these traits are often
praised and highly valued.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.930
As we grow-up we are taught through experiences
(both positive and negative) that being forgetful

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.660
is a bad thing, but scientists at the University
of California Santa Cruz are asking us to

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.380
take a deeper and more scientific look into
the adaptive *benefits* of forgetting.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.860
The authors of a paper published in Psychological
Science recently proposed that forgetting

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.610
allows us to re-allocate cognitive resources
away from maintaining old potentially irrelevant

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.110
information and focus instead on remembering
new information.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.760
This may free our brains up to be more responsive
to our environment in real time.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.470
So how do we make room for new information
without the negative consequences of forgetting

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.810
our mother’s birthday?

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.160
Or the names of the new boss’s kids? (holds
up iPhone) with technology of course!

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.160
The title of the recent paper says it all:
"Saving-Enhanced Memory: The Benefits of Saving

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.280
on the Learning and Remembering of New Information"
Our external hard drives, be they digital

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.390
records, handwritten lists, or long suffering
moms and girlfriends who remember details

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.479
for us and keep us on track, function to expand
our minds and allow us to hold on to information

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.820
without impairing our ability to access the
full store of our working memory.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.510
This may seem like a no-brainer, after all
if you’re like me your Google calendar has

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.860
been running your life for the past few years,
but now scientists are taking a deeper look

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.170
at this seemingly intuitive phenomenon.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.400
And asking specific questions about how technology
and our confidence in the “saving” process

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.439
facilitates our ability to create new memories.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.500
The nuts and bolts of the study go like this:

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.960
Researchers asked 20 college students to use
a computer to open and study pairs of PDF

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.540
files (cleverly named File A and File B).

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.282
Each file contained a list of 10 common nouns
and students were told that they would be

00:01:58.282 --> 00:02:01.240
tested on their ability to remember those
lists.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.869
After 20 seconds of studying File A they were
asked to close the file.

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.491
They then studied File B for 20 seconds and
were immediately tested on how many File B

00:02:09.491 --> 00:02:11.140
nouns they could remember.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.980
The key to this study is that half the students
were told they could save File A to a particular

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.849
folder before opening File B. The other half
of the students were simply told to close

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:23.849
the file.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.990
Unsurprisingly, students remembered more words
from File B when they had saved File A instead

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.170
of just closing it.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.150
This implies that knowing that the information
in File A was saved somewhere, allowed them

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.840
to forget that information and free up more
working memory for the list of nouns in File

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.840
B.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.209
Additional trials revealed that the perceived
reliability of the saving process of File

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.460
A affected the subject’s ability to remember
content from File B. When students were told

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.970
that saving File A might not work, there were
no saving-related memory benefits.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.320
So we have to have confidence in where we
are saving our information in order to release

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.080
that space in our short term memory for new
stuff.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.970
The researchers conclude that “off-loading
memory onto the environment in order to reduce

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.200
the extent to which currently unneeded to-be-remembered
information interferes with the learning and

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.250
remembering of other information.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.260
But only if we trust the place we are storing
our information.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.840
So I guess, in a way, those smartphones and
other assistants that seem like an extension

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.250
of ourselves … really are.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.510
And a trusting partnership (with technology)
is allowing us to expand our individual abilities

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.520
and hopefully be smarter.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.379
After all, as Einstein said:
“The value of a college education is not

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.209
the learning of many facts but the training
of the mind to think”

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.460
Where do your save your “off-loaded” memory?
