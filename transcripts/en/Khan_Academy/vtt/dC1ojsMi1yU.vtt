00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.379
- [Instructor] Do some example,

00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:04.589
raising exponents or products of exponents

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:05.866
to various powers,

00:00:05.866 --> 00:00:08.808
especially when we're dealing
with integer exponents.

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.938
So let's say we have three
to the negative eight

00:00:11.938 --> 00:00:14.499
times seven to the third,

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.611
and we wanna raise that
to the negative two power,

00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:19.266
and I want you to pause this video

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:22.762
and see if you could
simplify this on your own.

00:00:22.762 --> 00:00:24.230
So the key realization here,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.174
there's couple of ways
that you can tackle it,

00:00:26.174 --> 00:00:27.770
but the key thing to realize

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.728
is if you have the product of two things,

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:33.788
and then you're raising that
to some type of a exponent,

00:00:33.788 --> 00:00:35.925
that is going to be the same thing

00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:39.350
as raising each of these
things to that exponent,

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.946
and then taking the product.

00:00:40.946 --> 00:00:42.659
So this is going to be the same thing

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:45.242
as three to the negative eight,

00:00:46.182 --> 00:00:49.659
and then that to the negative two

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:54.167
times seven to the third
to the negative two,

00:00:54.167 --> 00:00:57.830
so I'll do seven to the
third right over here.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.409
And if I wanna simplify this,

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.553
three to the negative
eight to the negative two,

00:01:02.553 --> 00:01:04.621
we have the other exponent property

00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:05.928
that if you're raising to an exponent

00:01:05.928 --> 00:01:08.157
and then raising that whole
thing to another exponent,

00:01:08.157 --> 00:01:10.087
then you can just multiply the exponents.

00:01:10.087 --> 00:01:13.338
So this is going to be
three to the negative eight

00:01:13.338 --> 00:01:16.119
times negative two power.

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.860
Well, negative eight times negative two

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.110
is positive 16,

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.555
so this is gonna be
three to the 16th power

00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:24.994
right over there,

00:01:24.994 --> 00:01:26.438
and then this part right over here,

00:01:26.438 --> 00:01:28.657
seven to the third to the negative two.

00:01:28.657 --> 00:01:31.523
that's gonna be seven to the three

00:01:31.523 --> 00:01:33.226
times negative two,

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:36.570
which is seven to the
negative sixth power.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.324
So that is seven to the negative six,

00:01:39.324 --> 00:01:43.512
and this would be about as
much as you could simplify.

00:01:43.512 --> 00:01:45.365
You could rewrite it different ways.

00:01:45.365 --> 00:01:47.377
Seven to the negative
six is the same thing

00:01:47.377 --> 00:01:49.688
as one over seven to the sixth,

00:01:49.688 --> 00:01:53.410
so you could write it
like three to the 16th.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.916
We'll use that same shade of blue,

00:01:55.916 --> 00:01:57.333
three to the 16th

00:01:58.738 --> 00:02:00.738
over seven to the sixth,

00:02:02.738 --> 00:02:05.027
but these two are equivalent,

00:02:05.027 --> 00:02:07.547
and there's other ways that
you could have tackled this.

00:02:07.547 --> 00:02:08.380
You could have said

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.160
that this original thing right over here,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.458
this is the same thing as,

00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:13.579
three to the negative eight

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.215
is the same thing as one
over three to the eighth,

00:02:15.215 --> 00:02:16.596
so you could have said
this is the same thing

00:02:16.596 --> 00:02:18.232
as seven to the third

00:02:18.232 --> 00:02:20.429
over three to the eighth,

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.457
and then you're raising
that to the negative two,

00:02:23.457 --> 00:02:25.578
in which case you'd raise this
numerator to the negative two

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:27.267
and the denominator to negative two,

00:02:27.267 --> 00:02:30.553
but you would have gotten
to the exact same place.

00:02:30.553 --> 00:02:33.053
Let's do another one of these.

00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:35.854
So let's say

00:02:40.147 --> 00:02:41.480
that we have got

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.467
A to the negative two times
eight to the seventh power,

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:54.967
and we wanna raise all of
that to the second power.

00:02:54.967 --> 00:02:57.430
Well, like before, I can
raise each of these things

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.266
to the second power,

00:02:58.266 --> 00:03:01.697
so this is the same thing
as A to the negative two

00:03:01.697 --> 00:03:03.280
to the second power

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.363
times this thing to the second power.

00:03:08.482 --> 00:03:11.919
Eight to the seventh to the second power,

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.262
and then here, negative two
times two is negative four,

00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:18.512
so that's A to the negative four times,

00:03:19.663 --> 00:03:22.513
eight to the seven times two is 14,

00:03:22.513 --> 00:03:24.513
eight to the 14th power.

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.279
In other videos, we go into more depth

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:29.989
about why this should
hopefully make intuitive sense.

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.327
Here you have eight to the seventh

00:03:31.327 --> 00:03:32.482
times eight to the seventh.

00:03:32.482 --> 00:03:34.351
Well, you would then
add the two exponents,

00:03:34.351 --> 00:03:35.889
and you would get to eight to the 14th,

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.113
so however many times you
have eight to the seventh,

00:03:38.113 --> 00:03:40.528
you would just keep adding the exponents,

00:03:40.528 --> 00:03:44.295
or you would multiply by
seven that many times.

00:03:44.295 --> 00:03:46.141
Hopefully that didn't sound too confusing,

00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:48.341
but the general idea is if you
raise something to exponent

00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:49.495
and then another exponent,

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:52.341
you can multiply those exponents.

00:03:52.341 --> 00:03:54.041
Let's do one more example

00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:56.863
where we are dealing with quotients,

00:03:56.863 --> 00:03:57.792
which that first example

00:03:57.792 --> 00:03:59.664
could have even been perceived as.

00:03:59.664 --> 00:04:01.331
So let's say we have

00:04:04.273 --> 00:04:06.106
two to the negative 10

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:09.866
divided by four squared,

00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:13.140
and we're gonna raise all of
that to the seventh power.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.616
Well, this is equivalent
to two to the negative 10

00:04:17.616 --> 00:04:19.467
raised to the seventh power

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:24.053
over four squared raised
to the seventh power,

00:04:24.053 --> 00:04:25.499
so if you have the
difference of two things

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.322
and you're raising it to some power,

00:04:27.322 --> 00:04:28.789
that's the same thing as a numerator

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:29.678
raised to that power

00:04:29.678 --> 00:04:32.621
divided by the denominator
raised to that power.

00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:35.228
Well, what's our numerator going to be?

00:04:35.228 --> 00:04:37.385
Well, we've done this drill before.

00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:40.836
It'd be two to the negative
10 times seventh power,

00:04:40.836 --> 00:04:44.742
so this would be equal to two
to the negative 70th power,

00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:47.294
and then in the denominator,

00:04:47.294 --> 00:04:48.344
four to the second power,

00:04:48.344 --> 00:04:50.032
then that raised to the seventh power.

00:04:50.032 --> 00:04:52.312
Well, two times seven is 14,

00:04:52.312 --> 00:04:54.560
so that's going to be four

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.060
to the 17th power.

00:04:59.902 --> 00:05:01.884
Now, we actually could think

00:05:01.884 --> 00:05:04.681
about simplifying this even more.

00:05:04.681 --> 00:05:07.056
There's multiple ways that
you could rewrite this,

00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:08.821
but one thing you could
do is say, "Hey, look,

00:05:08.821 --> 00:05:11.236
"four is a power of two."

00:05:11.236 --> 00:05:13.192
So you could rewrite this as

00:05:13.192 --> 00:05:17.359
this is equal to two to the
negative 70th power over,

00:05:19.224 --> 00:05:22.724
instead of writing four to the 17th power,

00:05:24.436 --> 00:05:25.677
why did I write the 17th power?

00:05:25.677 --> 00:05:28.140
It should be four to the 14th power.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:29.533
Let me correct that.

00:05:29.533 --> 00:05:33.515
Instead of writing four to the 14th power,

00:05:33.515 --> 00:05:35.156
I instead could write,

00:05:35.156 --> 00:05:38.850
so this is two, get the colors right.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.017
This is two to the negative 70th over,

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.718
instead of writing four,

00:05:46.718 --> 00:05:50.160
I could write two squared
to the 14th power.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.464
Four is the same thing as two squared,

00:05:52.464 --> 00:05:54.926
and so now I can rewrite this whole thing

00:05:54.926 --> 00:05:58.176
as two to the negative 70th power over,

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:01.184
well, two to the second,

00:06:01.184 --> 00:06:02.609
and then that to the 14th,

00:06:02.609 --> 00:06:04.746
well, that's two to the 28th power,

00:06:04.746 --> 00:06:06.579
two to the 28th power.

00:06:09.282 --> 00:06:11.827
And so can I simplify this even more?

00:06:11.827 --> 00:06:13.032
Well, this is going to be equal

00:06:13.032 --> 00:06:14.199
to two to the,

00:06:16.735 --> 00:06:19.386
if I'm taking a quotient
with the same base,

00:06:19.386 --> 00:06:20.573
I can subtract the exponent.

00:06:20.573 --> 00:06:23.399
So it's gonna be negative 70.

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:25.732
It's going to be negative 70

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.150
minus 28th power, minus 28,

00:06:31.207 --> 00:06:33.417
and so this is going to simply

00:06:33.417 --> 00:06:36.000
two to the negative 98th power,

00:06:38.724 --> 00:06:42.891
and that's another way of
viewing the same expression.
