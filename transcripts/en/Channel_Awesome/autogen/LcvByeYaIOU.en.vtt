so that part we have to do and the other
thing obviously how the proton packs so

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050
thing obviously how the proton packs so
 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.369
thing obviously how the proton packs so
I got these images online so that's cool

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:32.379

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.309
the design so it looks pretty close but
I only have a few days to do it not a

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319
I only have a few days to do it not a
 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.559
I only have a few days to do it not a
ton of money and I have to build four of

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569
ton of money and I have to build four of
 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:52.170
ton of money and I have to build four of
them so I have a pile of junk of pieces

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180
them so I have a pile of junk of pieces
 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.520
them so I have a pile of junk of pieces
and stuff like that I'm gonna go through

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530
and stuff like that I'm gonna go through
 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.040
and stuff like that I'm gonna go through
and I'm gonna try and cobble something

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050
and I'm gonna try and cobble something
 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.899
and I'm gonna try and cobble something
together that looks pretty close to the

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909
together that looks pretty close to the
 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.300
together that looks pretty close to the
design and then once I have that I just

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310
design and then once I have that I just
 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.900
design and then once I have that I just
have to repeat it three more times so

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910
have to repeat it three more times so
 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.180
have to repeat it three more times so
yeah let's get cracking got a lot of

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190
yeah let's get cracking got a lot of
 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:15.410
yeah let's get cracking got a lot of
stuff to do

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420
 
 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.770
 
manney a lot of coffee let's go alright

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780
manney a lot of coffee let's go alright
 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.089
manney a lot of coffee let's go alright
so here's my pile of bits and pieces of

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099
so here's my pile of bits and pieces of
 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.429
so here's my pile of bits and pieces of
junk I've got a lot of pieces of PVC in

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:26.439
junk I've got a lot of pieces of PVC in
 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:31.170

and I try and cobble this together I

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389
and I try and cobble this together I
 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:50.550
and I try and cobble this together I
bought four backpacks and yeah let's try

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560
bought four backpacks and yeah let's try
 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:06:02.450
bought four backpacks and yeah let's try
and make something

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460
 
 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:08.390
 
all right so this is the basic gist this

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400
all right so this is the basic gist this
 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.640
all right so this is the basic gist this
is kind of based on the parts that I

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650
is kind of based on the parts that I
 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.879
is kind of based on the parts that I
have I think this is the closest we're

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889
have I think this is the closest we're
 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.550
have I think this is the closest we're
gonna get and it didn't take me long to

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560
gonna get and it didn't take me long to
 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.890
gonna get and it didn't take me long to
kind of put this together but I don't

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900
kind of put this together but I don't
 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.150
kind of put this together but I don't
think I have enough of these pieces I

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160
think I have enough of these pieces I
 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.730
think I have enough of these pieces I
have to get more of these boxes as I

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740
have to get more of these boxes as I
 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.650
have to get more of these boxes as I
think I'll add a few other odds and ends

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660
think I'll add a few other odds and ends
 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.080
think I'll add a few other odds and ends
and some wires and stuff like that I'd

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090
and some wires and stuff like that I'd
 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.820
and some wires and stuff like that I'd
like to actually make this light up if I

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830
like to actually make this light up if I
 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.430
like to actually make this light up if I
can but if I have time hopefully that

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440
can but if I have time hopefully that
 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.060
can but if I have time hopefully that
would be cool

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070
would be cool
 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.980
would be cool
I think if I could get that light up get

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990
I think if I could get that light up get
 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.779
I think if I could get that light up get
some kind of a red LED battery-powered

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:38.789
some kind of a red LED battery-powered
 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.339
some kind of a red LED battery-powered
light or something that I could put in

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:40.349
light or something that I could put in
 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:44.920
light or something that I could put in
there cool that didn't take too long so

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930
there cool that didn't take too long so
 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.589

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:29.170
also these blue boxes initially was
 

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.110
also these blue boxes initially was
going to use a bunch of them for the

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120
going to use a bunch of them for the
 

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.980
going to use a bunch of them for the
build but I only had three or four total

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:34.990
build but I only had three or four total
 

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:38.700
build but I only had three or four total
and I just wanted to get building as

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:38.710
and I just wanted to get building as
 

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:39.870
and I just wanted to get building as
quickly as possible and they weren't

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:39.880
quickly as possible and they weren't
 

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.190
quickly as possible and they weren't
quite the size that I wanted they're a

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:41.200
quite the size that I wanted they're a
 

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.110
quite the size that I wanted they're a
little bit big for the design and

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120
little bit big for the design and
 

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.150
little bit big for the design and
everything so I remembered I had a bunch

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:45.160
everything so I remembered I had a bunch
 

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.430
everything so I remembered I had a bunch
of these foam blocks from a dollar store

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440
of these foam blocks from a dollar store
 

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.990
of these foam blocks from a dollar store
buy a pack of like a pack of four or

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:49.000
buy a pack of like a pack of four or
 

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.010
buy a pack of like a pack of four or
something like that for a buck obviously

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:52.020
something like that for a buck obviously
 

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.500
something like that for a buck obviously
but yeah so I had a bunch of these

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:54.510
but yeah so I had a bunch of these
 

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.030
but yeah so I had a bunch of these
obviously super lightweight and I just

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040
obviously super lightweight and I just
 

00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:00.290
obviously super lightweight and I just
covered him with a metallic tape and

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.300
covered him with a metallic tape and
 

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.900
covered him with a metallic tape and
spray-painted them to give them a bit of

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:03.910
spray-painted them to give them a bit of
 

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.180
spray-painted them to give them a bit of
a burnished or kind of like worn look I

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:06.190
a burnished or kind of like worn look I
 

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:08.940
a burnished or kind of like worn look I
just gave them a light dusting of gray

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:08.950
just gave them a light dusting of gray
 

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:12.450
just gave them a light dusting of gray
or black rather kind of a flat black and

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:12.460
or black rather kind of a flat black and
 

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:15.120
or black rather kind of a flat black and
that kind of it still has a reflecting

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:15.130
that kind of it still has a reflecting
 

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:17.430
that kind of it still has a reflecting
like metallic quality but it looks

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440
like metallic quality but it looks
 

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.980
like metallic quality but it looks
dirtied up and stuff so obviously things

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:19.990
dirtied up and stuff so obviously things
 

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.500
dirtied up and stuff so obviously things
like the PVC to replace the copper

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:22.510
like the PVC to replace the copper
 

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.590
like the PVC to replace the copper
tubing and everything and yeah this is a

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.600
tubing and everything and yeah this is a
 

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.930
tubing and everything and yeah this is a
piece of tubing with some duct tape and

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:27.940
piece of tubing with some duct tape and
 

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:31.950
piece of tubing with some duct tape and
electrical tape to make the kind of

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:31.960
electrical tape to make the kind of
 

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.250
electrical tape to make the kind of
emergency sort of sticker on there

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:35.260
emergency sort of sticker on there
 

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.930
emergency sort of sticker on there
things like the circuit board I just

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:36.940
things like the circuit board I just
 

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.040
things like the circuit board I just
have a bunch of circuit boards lying

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:38.050
have a bunch of circuit boards lying
 

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.600
have a bunch of circuit boards lying
around you know

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:40.610
around you know
 

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.030
around you know
things just glue it on there gave it

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040
things just glue it on there gave it
 

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.470
things just glue it on there gave it
some texture and stuff

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:44.480
some texture and stuff
 

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.509
some texture and stuff
initially I wanted to add all kinds of

00:15:46.509 --> 00:15:46.519
initially I wanted to add all kinds of
 

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:48.309
initially I wanted to add all kinds of
little piping and tubing and stuff on to

00:15:48.309 --> 00:15:48.319
little piping and tubing and stuff on to
 

00:15:48.319 --> 00:15:49.929
little piping and tubing and stuff on to
them but I just really didn't have the

00:15:49.929 --> 00:15:49.939
them but I just really didn't have the
 

00:15:49.939 --> 00:15:52.299
them but I just really didn't have the
time so just adding the circuit board

00:15:52.299 --> 00:15:52.309
time so just adding the circuit board
 

00:15:52.309 --> 00:15:55.119
time so just adding the circuit board
gave it some texture and you have things

00:15:55.119 --> 00:15:55.129
gave it some texture and you have things
 

00:15:55.129 --> 00:15:56.650
gave it some texture and you have things
like I think you'd see the yogurt

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:56.660
like I think you'd see the yogurt
 

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.319
like I think you'd see the yogurt
container so that just glued on there

00:15:59.319 --> 00:15:59.329
container so that just glued on there
 

00:15:59.329 --> 00:16:02.650
container so that just glued on there
and spray painted the whole thing is zip

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:02.660
and spray painted the whole thing is zip
 

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.340
and spray painted the whole thing is zip
tied to a backpack so that if I wanted

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:06.350
tied to a backpack so that if I wanted
 

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.410
tied to a backpack so that if I wanted
to I could reuse the backpack again and

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:08.420
to I could reuse the backpack again and
 

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:12.039
to I could reuse the backpack again and
stuff and yeah it's just a zip ties that

00:16:12.039 --> 00:16:12.049
stuff and yeah it's just a zip ties that
 

00:16:12.049 --> 00:16:14.259
stuff and yeah it's just a zip ties that
go through here I had a belt and kind of

00:16:14.259 --> 00:16:14.269
go through here I had a belt and kind of
 

00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:16.229
go through here I had a belt and kind of
strapped around their waist that's

00:16:16.229 --> 00:16:16.239
strapped around their waist that's
 

00:16:16.239 --> 00:16:18.910
strapped around their waist that's
basically it for the pack itself and

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:18.920
basically it for the pack itself and
 

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.489
basically it for the pack itself and
then the wand were pretty simple to him

00:16:21.489 --> 00:16:21.499
then the wand were pretty simple to him
 

00:16:21.499 --> 00:16:23.530
then the wand were pretty simple to him
it says PVC tubing and various sizes and

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:23.540
it says PVC tubing and various sizes and
 

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.929
it says PVC tubing and various sizes and
I drilled some holes to give it that

00:16:25.929 --> 00:16:25.939
I drilled some holes to give it that
 

00:16:25.939 --> 00:16:28.299
I drilled some holes to give it that
look initially I was going to have a

00:16:28.299 --> 00:16:28.309
look initially I was going to have a
 

00:16:28.309 --> 00:16:30.579
look initially I was going to have a
grip here so I didn't continue the holes

00:16:30.579 --> 00:16:30.589
grip here so I didn't continue the holes
 

00:16:30.589 --> 00:16:32.229
grip here so I didn't continue the holes
he's like the grip - I didn't I never

00:16:32.229 --> 00:16:32.239
he's like the grip - I didn't I never
 

00:16:32.239 --> 00:16:34.269
he's like the grip - I didn't I never
had an official grip I was gonna get

00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:34.279
had an official grip I was gonna get
 

00:16:34.279 --> 00:16:37.210
had an official grip I was gonna get
some grips to put on it just didn't do

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:37.220
some grips to put on it just didn't do
 

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.900
some grips to put on it just didn't do
it but this is just an electrical box

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:39.910
it but this is just an electrical box
 

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:43.840
it but this is just an electrical box
electrical connector box with PVC pipe

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:43.850
electrical connector box with PVC pipe
 

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:46.359

I think it's a half inch telescopic

00:16:48.449 --> 00:16:48.459
I think it's a half inch telescopic
 

00:16:48.459 --> 00:16:55.079
I think it's a half inch telescopic
coupler for PVC and then things like the

00:16:55.079 --> 00:16:55.089
coupler for PVC and then things like the
 

00:16:55.089 --> 00:17:03.039
coupler for PVC and then things like the
box there is this is a container cutting

00:17:03.039 --> 00:17:03.049
box there is this is a container cutting
 

00:17:03.049 --> 00:17:05.679
box there is this is a container cutting
it up but it's basically just a

00:17:05.679 --> 00:17:05.689
it up but it's basically just a
 

00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:08.889
it up but it's basically just a
container for like this one's for

00:17:08.889 --> 00:17:08.899
container for like this one's for
 

00:17:08.899 --> 00:17:11.350

whatever you get at the store I have

00:17:14.439 --> 00:17:14.449
whatever you get at the store I have
 

00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:16.629
whatever you get at the store I have
bins full of these that I'm saving for

00:17:16.629 --> 00:17:16.639
bins full of these that I'm saving for
 

00:17:16.639 --> 00:17:17.409
bins full of these that I'm saving for
another project

another project
 

00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:20.500
another project
so again kept the weight down it has a

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:20.510
so again kept the weight down it has a
 

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:23.620
so again kept the weight down it has a
neat texture and once it's painted and

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:23.630
neat texture and once it's painted and
 

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:25.389
neat texture and once it's painted and
stuff like that you kind of blends right

00:17:25.389 --> 00:17:25.399
stuff like that you kind of blends right
 

00:17:25.399 --> 00:17:27.990
stuff like that you kind of blends right
in whatever so things like mounting the

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000
in whatever so things like mounting the
 

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.879
in whatever so things like mounting the
the wands - the packs initially Doug

00:17:30.879 --> 00:17:30.889
the wands - the packs initially Doug
 

00:17:30.889 --> 00:17:32.529
the wands - the packs initially Doug
said he's like I don't think they're

00:17:32.529 --> 00:17:32.539
said he's like I don't think they're
 

00:17:32.539 --> 00:17:35.110
said he's like I don't think they're
gonna need to have them slung I don't

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.120
gonna need to have them slung I don't
 

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.129
gonna need to have them slung I don't
think they're gonna be any scenes where

00:17:36.129 --> 00:17:36.139
think they're gonna be any scenes where
 

00:17:36.139 --> 00:17:38.350
think they're gonna be any scenes where
I'm pulling him out if we do we can

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:38.360
I'm pulling him out if we do we can
 

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:39.970
I'm pulling him out if we do we can
always just cut to it like they'd

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:39.980
always just cut to it like they'd
 

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.230
always just cut to it like they'd
already have him there and they pull him

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:41.240
already have him there and they pull him
 

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.909
already have him there and they pull him
out and there was a few scenes but they

00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:42.919
out and there was a few scenes but they
 

00:17:42.919 --> 00:17:44.680
out and there was a few scenes but they
have to have them slung and so using

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:44.690
have to have them slung and so using
 

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:47.049
have to have them slung and so using
both hands and stuff like that so what I

00:17:47.049 --> 00:17:47.059
both hands and stuff like that so what I
 

00:17:47.059 --> 00:17:48.950
both hands and stuff like that so what I
want to doing

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960
want to doing
 

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.420
want to doing
on set you can kind of see it in the

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:51.430
on set you can kind of see it in the
 

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.970
on set you can kind of see it in the
behind-the-scenes as I just added an

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:53.980
behind-the-scenes as I just added an
 

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:57.540
behind-the-scenes as I just added an
elbow with a couple pieces of PVC yeah I

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:57.550
elbow with a couple pieces of PVC yeah I
 

00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:01.920
elbow with a couple pieces of PVC yeah I
just attached like that and then there's

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:01.930
just attached like that and then there's
 

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:09.020
just attached like that and then there's
a hole here for the other piece of just

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:09.030
a hole here for the other piece of just
 

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:11.370
a hole here for the other piece of just
slips on there like that and that kind

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:11.380
slips on there like that and that kind
 

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:14.040
slips on there like that and that kind
of held it in place so and it worked out

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:14.050
of held it in place so and it worked out
 

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:17.970
of held it in place so and it worked out
fine so cool yeah things like the the

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:17.980
fine so cool yeah things like the the
 

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.740
fine so cool yeah things like the the
jumpsuits I know I didn't go into a lot

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:19.750
jumpsuits I know I didn't go into a lot
 

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:22.050
jumpsuits I know I didn't go into a lot
of detail about that either Rob actually

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:22.060
of detail about that either Rob actually
 

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.640
