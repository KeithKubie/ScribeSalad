SARAH PRICE: Hi, Glass
developers.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.650
Welcome to 2013.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.390
I'm Sarah Price, your
community advocate.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.040
I've been reading all of your
comments and questions online,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.870
and I've noticed maybe one or
two questions about what it's

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.570
going to be like to
develop for Glass.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.650
You want to know what
the API is like.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.725
You want to know what languages
you can use.

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:26.060
You know what I mean.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.500
So to help answer those
questions, I want to introduce

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.130
you today to some members of our
developer relations team,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.790
Jenny and Timothy.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.420
JENNY MURPHY: Hi, I'm Jenny,
and I'm a Glass Developer

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.710
Programs Engineer.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.840
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And I'm
Timothy Jordan.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.100
I'm a Glass Developer
Advocate.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.950
SARAH PRICE: So Jenny, can you
tell us a little bit about

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.030
what it's going to be like
to develop for Glass?

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.210
JENNY MURPHY: Absolutely.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.410
Development on Glass is done
with something called the

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.950
Mirror API, and it's basically
a collection

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.250
of RESTful web services.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.650
One of the great parts about
this is if you've done any

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.220
development with other web
services at Google, you'll

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.110
feel right at home developing
on Glass.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.100
SARAH PRICE: So I'm actually not
very familiar with RESTful

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.160
web services.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.430
What kinds of languages could
I use to develop using them?

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.090
JENNY MURPHY: That's one of the
great parts about RESTful

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.290
web services.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.490
They're inherently
language-independent, so you

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.130
can develop with whatever tools
or languages are your

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.330
favorite, whether that be PHP
or Python or even Java.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.290
SARAH PRICE: Well, the next
question I've seen a lot is,

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.100
when are people going
to get access?

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.850
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well, that's
something that we're excited

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.420
to announce today.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.720
For developers in the Glass
Explorer program, we're

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.760
putting together what we
call the Glass Foundry.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.520
You can think of it as kind
of a vacation with Glass.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.100
For two full days, in San
Francisco or New York, you'll

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.610
get early access to Glass
and the Mirror API.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.190
It's going to be a lot of fun,
and we'll send an invite out

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.840
to your email shortly.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.840
Space is limited, so please
sign up right away.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.420
SARAH PRICE: Well, thanks
so much, guys.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.910
I've seen so many great
suggestions from developers

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.370
for what you want to
do with Glass.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.310
I can't wait to see what
they put together.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.120
So thanks, and see you
at the Glass Foundry.
