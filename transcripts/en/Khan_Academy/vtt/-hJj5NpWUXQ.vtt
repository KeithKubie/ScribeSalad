00:00:00.915 --> 00:00:02.800
- [Voiceover] Where I had
left off in the last video,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.200
we had talked about the scenario

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.900
where my buddies and I
we came up with this idea

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.100
to sell socks online.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.400
We went to a rich investor

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.800
we call an Angel investor
who's usually kind of

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.800
a rich uncle type of
figure who gets excited

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.000
by young guys innovating in the world.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.700
We say "Hey, we need $5 million."

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.300
He says sure enough, I
think the idea you have

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.300
by itself or maybe some kind of prototype

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.600
you might have made or something.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.500
That's worth $5 million.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.200
I'll give you another $5 million of cash

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.100
to get started, rent some
space, hire some people

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.800
and for that since what
you had was $5 million,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.200
that's what you're bringing to the table.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.500
I'm bringing $5 million cash to the table,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.200
I essentially get half the company

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.800
and the way that works is it's not like

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.500
we each gave him half of our shares

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.200
instead since we are the
board of the company,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.500
we issue another million shares.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.900
We doubled the share count
and we give it to him.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.200
This pre-money valuation's
really, really important

00:00:57.953 --> 00:01:01.300
because if we had agreed,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.892
if we said this wasn't five million,

00:01:02.892 --> 00:01:04.900
if we said that this is, I don't know.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.500
Let's say if he is a hard negotiator,

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.523
he says "No, that's only
worth a $1 million,"

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:14.100
and I'm going to give $5 million.

00:01:14.946 --> 00:01:16.200
Let me ask you,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.600
how many shares would we have to issue?

00:01:19.507 --> 00:01:20.400
Think about it.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.569
If he was a hard negotiator,

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:23.600
let me draw it down here

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.200
so I don't want to mess up the issue.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.200
Because our idea I mean really is

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.930
a hard thing to estimate
what an idea is worth.

00:01:30.914 --> 00:01:33.800
He negotiates hard, at the end
of the day we're desperate,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.900
financial markets have collapsed

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.500
so we'll take money from whoever's willing

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.338
to give it to us

00:01:38.338 --> 00:01:39.738
and we really want to quit our jobs.

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.700
He says that what we have right now,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.000
our idea is only worth a $1 million.

00:01:48.984 --> 00:01:51.100
He's going to give us $5 million.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.800
How many shares do we have to give him?

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.100
This right here, this is a million shares.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.300
That's what we started off with

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.400
so when he says that
what we have right now

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.700
is worth a $1 million,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.400
he's essentially saying that's it's worth

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.100
a dollar per share, a dollar per share

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.930
so my 200,000 shares are worth $200,000

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.400
according to his valuation.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.900
Up here we said that what we had before

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.500
is worth $5 million in the previous video.

00:02:16.423 --> 00:02:18.700
If what we had before is worth $5 million

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.600
and there were a million shares initially.

00:02:21.246 --> 00:02:23.100
This was the million shares

00:02:24.115 --> 00:02:25.800
then the pre-money valuation

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.300
or actually it's the valuation

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.500
either pre or post money
would be $5 per share.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.400
In the $5 per share world,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.100
what we did was we issued
another million shares

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.800
and sold them for $5 million

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.284
or we sell them for $5 per share

00:02:43.315 --> 00:02:45.400
to get the $5 million

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.700
and so we ended up with a
50, 50 split of the company.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.407
This is the Angel investor

00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:53.800
and this is all of us down here.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.600
All of this is equity.

00:02:56.553 --> 00:02:59.400
No debt, no liabilities just yet.

00:03:00.553 --> 00:03:04.300
Now in this reality if he's
valuing what we have right now

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.900
at essentially $1 per share.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.907
His is worth a $1 million,
you have a million shares.

00:03:07.907 --> 00:03:09.900
It's $1 per share.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.600
In order for him to give $5 million,

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.000
he's essentially going to buy $5 million

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.600
worth of stock at $1 per share.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.400
He's essentially going to
need five million shares,

00:03:24.523 --> 00:03:27.800
five million shares.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.100
Notice in this situation up here

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.500
before when I have

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.600
200,000 shares,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.200
well when I had 1/5 of $5 million,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.400
that was five million.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.400
When I had 1/5 of $5 million,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.100
the value of my shares was $1 million.

00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:50.600
Then when I have 1/10
of two million shares,

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.000
I still have 1/10 of $10
million of total asset

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.700
because now he threw in his $5 million.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.700
My share is still worth $1 million of it.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.400
I have a tenth of 10 million

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.099
as oppose to a fifth of five million.

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.700
In this situation, I used to have

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.700
a fifth of one million
which would be $200,000.

00:04:15.646 --> 00:04:18.000
Now I have 200,000 over,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.601
how many total shares are there now?

00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:21.700
There are now six million shares.

00:04:22.869 --> 00:04:27.423
Now I have 1/60, is that right?

00:04:27.423 --> 00:04:30.500
I have 200,000 and I have 200,000

00:04:31.592 --> 00:04:35.500
over six million,

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.400
that's 6,000,000 so that cancels out.

00:04:39.984 --> 00:04:42.700
I now own 1/30 of the company,

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.200
before I had 1/5 and were
valuing it at six million

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.899
because I have a million
here and five million here

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:50.300
times six million.

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:53.800
What's 1/30 of six million?

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.900
1/6 over 30

00:04:57.223 --> 00:05:02.207
is equal to 1/5 of a million,

00:05:02.207 --> 00:05:04.722
so this is still $200,000.

00:05:04.722 --> 00:05:05.800
No matter what I do,

00:05:07.184 --> 00:05:10.400
between the pre-money and
the post-money valuation,

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.300
my per share value doesn't change any

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.300
and I want to show you that

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.400
but this matters a lot

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.400
because based on what this
pre-money valuation is,

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.000
it tells us how many shares

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.400
or what percentage of the company

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.700
our Angel investor gets for
investing his $5 million.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.500
In this case he gets 5/6 of the company.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.900
What is that?

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.701
Five times, that's like
80% of the company.

00:05:35.654 --> 00:05:37.938
I think roughly and we
are left with the other

00:05:37.938 --> 00:05:40.400
no 1/6 is, right.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.561
1/6 no, it's more than 80.

00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:43.000
It's like 84%

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.700
and we're left with
like 16% of the company.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.400
It's a very different scenario

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.200
depending on what our
pre-money valuation is

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.700
and of course the pre-money valuation

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.700
is just you just take
the pre-money valuation

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.200
plus the amount of cash they're given

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.753
and that's the post-money valuation.

00:05:57.753 --> 00:05:59.400
The amount of money you get,

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.200
pre-money and then post-money,
you have the money in

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.300
and that's you get the
$6 million valuation.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.300
Fair enough, I think I've
beaten this horse dead now.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.315
I think you have a good sense of it

00:06:10.315 --> 00:06:12.700
and let's say that we end up lucky.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.106
The guy wasn't a hard negotiator

00:06:14.106 --> 00:06:16.900
and we ended up with that first situation.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.400
Let me redraw it.

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:22.400
Now, if I were to draw the assets

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.800
of this corporation,

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.700
the assets of this corporation
at least at the time

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.400
of that guy's investment

00:06:31.292 --> 00:06:33.600
where it's a very intangible asset.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.700
We call it the idea, it
now has a value $5 million

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.100
and we have some cash,

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.299
we have five million in cash

00:06:43.852 --> 00:06:46.300
and then if we do the shares,

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.100
so we do that in another box.

00:06:52.237 --> 00:06:53.900
There you go, there are the shares

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:54.930
and of that share

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.700
we'll have two million shares outstanding,

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.700
two million shares.

00:06:59.407 --> 00:07:02.237
I have one million to the Angel investor,

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.700
he has 50% of the shares

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.100
and just because I like
to keep track of my slice.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.700
There's 200,000 shares that go to Sal.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.300
Fair enough.

00:07:14.869 --> 00:07:16.646
Now I mean obviously
the whole point of this

00:07:16.646 --> 00:07:18.600
wasn't just a negotiate and raise money

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.800
and quit our jobs.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.700
The whole point of this
was to start a business.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.000
Let's say we take this $5 million,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.300
we start hiring people
and really our first step

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.138
is to build out our website

00:07:28.138 --> 00:07:30.700
and just have a working site going.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.500
Let's say we burn through
$4 million of that

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.800
and we build a site.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.700
Let's say,

00:07:37.914 --> 00:07:39.300
we only have a $1 million left.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.300
This is maybe six months in the future

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.800
we all quit our jobs, we
got some fancy loft like

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.800
office space.

00:07:46.323 --> 00:07:50.000
We got a foosball table and
we also built a website,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.900
we hired some graphic
designers and things.

00:07:53.392 --> 00:07:55.400
We've burned through most of our cash

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.700
and were starting to
get a little bit worried

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.100
because we haven't made a profit yet

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.200
but we have a neat website,

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.384
we have a neat website.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.200
When we went to the Angel investors,

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.823
we just had an idea, a business plan

00:08:08.823 --> 00:08:12.200
and we just have, hopefully
we had our charisma

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.100
and we were able to sell
the guy on the idea,

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.753
he thought we're going to be the next

00:08:16.692 --> 00:08:19.000
dominant sock player in the world

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.700
but now we actually built something.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.200
We took his money and as promised,

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.500
we built a nice website
and now we need to raise

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.200
more money one, because
we've hired 50 people

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.700
and this $1 million isn't
going to last us too long

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.000
and that would be a
shame to run out of cash

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.700
just when we're getting off the ground.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.200
We now actually have a
real website and offices

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.900
and all of that and we
want to raise some money

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.900
because we want to put
up some AdWords on Google

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:45.200
so people know about our site.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.200
We want to spend a couple million dollars

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.923
for Super Bowl ads so people know

00:08:48.923 --> 00:08:50.500
that they can get socks online now.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.200
We have to raise more money

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.500
and now at this stage, we would go back

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.000
to the venture capital community

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.300
but we wouldn't go to the Angels.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.200
The Angels are the guys
who like the big picture

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.100
who want just to throw some
money into an early idea.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.500
It's usually a relatively small amount,

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.500
actually $5 million
would be a large amount

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:08.400
for an Angel.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.500
We want to go to real professional VCs now

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.300
and what we would do is
we would go to a seed VC.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.400
Seed VCs are kind of the first round

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.500
and each round is every
time you have to go back

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.900
to the till to raise money,

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.400
that's kind of a round of financing

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.700
but Seed Investors, so
there's a lot of words for it

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.300
but seed investors are
usually VC investors

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.600
who are actual professionals
at what they do.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.600
They're actually managing
other people's money

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.400
and we'll do another
video on how they raise

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.000
that money and it's very related

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.500
to how private equity confirms

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.600
and hedge funds also raise their money.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.000
They are usually managing
other people's money

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.600
while an Angel investor is usually,

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.192
he's just sitting on top
of a big pile of money

00:09:51.192 --> 00:09:52.353
and likes to play with it.

00:09:52.353 --> 00:09:54.100
They're managing other people's money

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:56.400
and they intend to have some fancy NBAs

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.000
that they just hired who'll make models

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.200
and do projections and
negotiate a little bit harder

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.300
with you when you're actually trying to

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.700
get a value on your business

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.700
but we have to go to these guys.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.500
They have some value, I
mean they all connect us

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.500
with other dudes

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:12.300
and they have experience
starting businesses.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.100
They can introduce us to other people

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:15.500
who've done similar things

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.900
and all the rest help us network

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.400
and help us manage the business.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.100
We go to a venture capitalist

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.000
and we get the door closed a lot of times

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.200
but that's what one venture capitalist,

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.200
one seed venture capitalist
finally comes to us.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.502
The terminology can be
a little ambiguous here

00:10:29.502 --> 00:10:32.000
but we'll call it our Series A financing,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.200
Series A.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.100
Sometimes it will be
called your seed financing

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.200
but we'll call it Series A

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.800
because we want to formalize it.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.946
Just so you know, the A is

00:10:39.946 --> 00:10:43.400
because it's our first real
formal round of financing.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.000
In our second round which I'll do

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.823
probably in the next
video, it would be Series B

00:10:46.823 --> 00:10:49.200
and then Series C and then Series D.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.600
Every time we run out of cash,

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.800
we want to go back to the till.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.100
We've already done the Series A,

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.600
now we want to do a Series B

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.500
and a Series C and so forth and so on

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.900
and eventually we'll hopefully get to

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.100
some type of an IPO which I'll talk about

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:01.800
in the next video because I just realized

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.100
I'm out of time again.
