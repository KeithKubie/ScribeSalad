00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.270
If we look at a piece of a nerve fibre,

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:11.270
we see that the cell produces large negatively
charged ions called A-

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.510
meaning large anions which are trapped inside
the cell and can't get out.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.240
It also actively excludes sodium ions, the
Na+.

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.780
And that leads the inside of the cell to be
strongly negative.

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:32.130
To some extent this is compensated by passive
migration of chloride ions.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.540
Negative. Out. Cl.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.920
And potassium ions. K+. Inwards.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.120
Which are then not in equal concentrations
inside and out.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.719
When part of the cell fibre becomes active
however,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.640
what happens is that there is a leakage of
sodium.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.640
Sodium is allowed to leak into the cell.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.040
Thus carrying positive charge inside and making
the inside go positive.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.400
As soon as that happens, about a 1000th of
a second later

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.000
the cell becomes leaky to potassium and potassium
moves out

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.840
taking the positive charge outside the cell
again and restoring the status quo.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.160
If we have an active region in the middle,
which becomes positive,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.480
then electric currents are sent out from the
active region to the surrounding regions.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.080
The currents go from positive to negative.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.060
And they cause the resting region to become
leaky to sodium.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.290
So that region in turn becomes active

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.240
and the action potential moves down the membrane.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.540
And it can move at quite a high speed.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.240
At the end of the fibre there is a slightly
swollen terminal

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.530
which contains a number of little capsules
called vesicles.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.560
And inside those are chemicals that are made
by the cell.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.020
The action potential comes along to the end
there

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.340
and it causes a few of those vesicles

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.670
to come to the outside of the cell, burst
and release their contents

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.280
and they diffuse across to the next cell

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.780
which is just a short distance away across
the gap.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.440
In some nerve terminals those chemicals cause
a leakage of sodium

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.180
so that they tend to excite activity in the
following cell.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.140
In other terminals different chemicals cause
the leakage of potassium

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.540
which makes the next cell become less active.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.420
Now in the brain that next cell may have ten
thousand terminals coming onto it.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.680
Some exciting it, some inhibiting it.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.480
And where its own action is determined on
the sum total of all that happens,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.320
all these ten thousand inputs.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.960
So it's rather like a computer that is receiving
a whole lot of information

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.300
through different channels and having its
own activity coordinated.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.400
When it fires its own action potential that
may go out through branches of the fibre

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.620
to as many as several thousand other cells.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.880
And this is a real piece of tissue.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.270
It shows a motor fibre branching to terminate
on muscle fibres.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.990
And each receives a terminal from the motor
fibre

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.900
and that whole collection forms a motor unit.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.700
When we make a muscle contract an action potential
goes down

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.270
and each one makes a number of muscle fibres
contract

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.740
and the whole muscle is controlled in that
sort of a way.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.240
What I'd like to show you now - an actual
action potential.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.740
We're going to show it in earthworms.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.180
Earthworms have, in common with other invertebrate
animals,

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.920
their nervous systems just inside the skin
on the ventral or underneath side.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.220
Here's some worms living in a wormarium.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.660
There's one on top here.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.580
You know that if you poke a worm it will contract
quickly along its length.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:16.980
See if this one will do it now.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.060
I pulled on its tail quickly.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.660
This is part of an escape reaction.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.840
If a worm is unwise enough to put its head
out of its burrow on the lawn

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.059
during the day and a bird comes along and
pecks at it

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:39.590
it'll pull back into its burrow very, very
quickly.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.100
It's important to do it quickly.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.760
But a worm can't afford to run its nervous
system at high speed.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.120
Because the speed at which an action potential
goes

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.780
depends for electrical reasons on the size
of the fibre.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.720
Big fibres conduct faster than small ones.

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.710
So for its escape reaction the earthworm has
a couple of giant fibres

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.740
that run along the body and tell it to contract

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.500
to get back into its burrow as quickly as
possible.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.580
We have a demonstration here. I'm going to
be helped by David,

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.700
a graduate student from Queen Mary College.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.500
Hi David.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.260
What we've done here is to hang an earthworm
over some wire electrodes

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.700
from which we can record the action potential
of its giant fibre system.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.379
And stimulate action potentials by passing
a small shock

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.340
through the body of the worm at the other
pair of electrodes.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.780
It would of course be terrible for this experiment
if the earthworm were to wriggle

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:47.740
so this one has been sedated by being dropped
for a few minutes into 10% alcohol.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.500
Roughly equivalent to the strength of table
wine.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.439
This doesn't seem to do them any harm at all.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.420
They recover afterwards and they don't even
seem to get a hangover.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.460
So I will now give it a switch on the stimulator.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:13.920
And what we see here on the screen is a spike
representing the initial shock

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.379
that goes down the length of the worm at the
speed of light.

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:24.430
If I go to the next scale I can turn it up
a lot more and I get a slower potential there

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.380
from a second smaller and therefore slower
fibre system.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.440
Let's just measure the time interval. Can
we record that please, David, on the screen?

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.460
The speed of this now then is about nine milliseconds.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.080
And the distance traveled is near enough nine
centimetres.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:50.740
So the speed then of the action potential
in that faster giant fibre

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.940
is just about ten metres per second.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.320
Well I said that this giant fibre is used
for escape reactions.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:07.260
One of the most spectacular of giant fibre
systems is that contained in marine fan worms.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.760
It's a different group of worms that live
on the bottom of the sea

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:17.990
on a muddy environment and construct for themselves
tubes of mud in which they live.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.500
And you see some here in the tank.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:26.759
They push their front ends out of the tube
as a big fan that collects food

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.300
by filtering the seawater and collecting microorganisms.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.280
But of course that's a very tempting morsel
for any fish that's going by.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.800
And they're very vulnerable.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.820
The only escape they can make is to whip back
into their tubes at high speed.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.540
Now I'm not going too close to the tank because
as I walk up

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.800
they often react just to my footfalls on the
floor.

00:07:49.809 --> 00:07:51.460
I creep up on them now.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.369
You see these very beautiful crowns of tentacles
here.

00:07:55.369 --> 00:07:58.770
If I tap the tank [tap] they'll shoot in.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.700
They nearly all shoot in.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.980
And that is brought about by a single giant
fibre that runs down the body of the worm

00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:12.099
and is truly enormous. Fan worms have some
of the largest fibres known.

00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:14.289
A section through a fan worm.

00:08:14.289 --> 00:08:18.889
At the bottom there, just above the skin is
the nervous system

00:08:18.889 --> 00:08:22.249
containing lots of small nerve cells.

00:08:22.249 --> 00:08:26.949
And above that, the pale area arrowed there,
is the single giant fibre.

00:08:26.949 --> 00:08:32.029
Which is much bigger than the whole of the
nerve cord of the rest of the nerve cord.

00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:36.550
It's up to 1.8mm in diameter. Which is huge.

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.370
It was so big that for a long time people
thought

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:43.190
that this was a strengthening, skeletal element

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.020
and didn't recognise it as a single nerve
fibre.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:53.800
Nevertheless, that fibre can only conduct
at 15-20 metres per second.
