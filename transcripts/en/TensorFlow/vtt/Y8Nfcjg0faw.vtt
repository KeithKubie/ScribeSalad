00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.090
HUIJE LIN: Hello, everyone.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.040
Nice to see you again.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.540
I'm Huije Lin from NetEase.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.800
Today I want to talk about
some things, applications,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.960
and hardwares we have built
and created with Devlight.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.950
And I have mentioned
yesterday, NetEase Youdao

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.010
is the leading company
in online education.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:44.160
We have created a lot of popular
applications and hardwares

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.860
in China.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.460
We are the leading
online education brand,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.990
with the most users in China.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.650
We have about over 800
million users in total,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.520
and we also have 22
million daily active users.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.460
And we also provide the Youdao
online course applications,

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:23.350
which has over 20 million
course attendances in a year.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.090
And in the past
years, we have created

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.960
a lot of popular
applications in China.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.610
We have the first leading
dictionary application

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.460
in China, which is
the Youdao dictionary.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.160
We also have the most popular
translation application, which

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.490
is Dear Translate in China.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.860
And we also have the most
popular dictionary and language

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.010
learning application in
India, which is U-Dictionary.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.030
And we also have many
other applications

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.270
that are very popular in China.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.140
For example, we have the
Youdao cost application,

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.919
and the reading
applications, and also

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:16.140
the applications for
practice our English.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.250
And beyond that we
also have provided

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.800
many services and their
own device abilities

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.790
to our partners.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.390
We have served over 40,000
developers in our Youdao AI

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.570
platform.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.360
We provide many
useful abilities based

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.930
on our own developed
neuromachine translation,

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:58.770
the OCR, the ARU, and ASR, TTS,
so many fundamental abilities

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:05.860
are surrounded by always
the language scenarios.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.100
And it will also
provide many solutions

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.760
related to the language
learning and education.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.520
We have served many
partners in China.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.690
And we are working
with our partners

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:35.200
to optimize our abilities
to provide better

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.690
services to the end users.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.320
And as I have
mentioned yesterday,

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.700
we also have built
several applications

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.660
and useful functions
ways the Devlight.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.420
For example, we have
built the word scanning

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.440
and look-up functions
with Devlight

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.720
in the dictionaries application.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.360
And we also have created
some photo translation and AR

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.090
solutions with Devlight.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.690
And here there is a
video that I can show you

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.930
how we do the AR translation.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.760
You can scan the word, the text,
around you with your camera.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:25.020
And it will translate the word
in real time with your camera

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.200
and by the OCR and
the translation.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.160
So this is the first AR
translation in China.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.090
And beyond applications, we also
have created some hardwares.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.610
For example, we have created
the Youdao Translator King,

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.560
which is a translator machine.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.110
It is [INAUDIBLE] Chinese to
English, Korean and Japanese,

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.210
offline speech translation,
and in reverse, of course.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.070
And it will also provide
over 40 languages

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.630
online speed translation.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.250
And it also supports online
and offline photo translation.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.830
And we have done the
offline translation

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.760
to be a translation, and the
photo translation was Devlight.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.980
And also, here is a video.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.560
Then I can show
you how this works.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.535
This is a man that is speaking
Chinese, and with device--

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.960
something about
booking a flight--

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.740
SPEAKER: Hello.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.735
I have booked flight--

00:05:31.735 --> 00:05:34.280
HUIJE LIN: --and it will
translate into English.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.950
SPEAKER: --to New
York on September 29.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.030
Now I want to change
to 1:00 PM on the 28th,

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.040
and I want to upgrade
the economy class-

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.310
HUIJE LIN: You can see the
translation is pretty good.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.000
And beyond the
applications, we have also

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.130
created many
applications for students

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.750
for education and learning.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.960
For example, we have created
a document-scan application

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.950
that you can scan your
document or your homework

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:15.560
with your camera, and it will
turn the text into the note

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.310
so you can store
your paper homework.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.690
And we also have created
an intelligent homework

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.680
autochecking application
which is Youdao homework.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.550
You can use your camera
to scan your homework

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:37.850
and it checks your
handwriting answers and checks

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.400
if it is right or wrong.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.790
So the green is true.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:49.275
It is right, and the red
color, it is the wrong answer.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.570
And we also have
provided some speech

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.340
interaction applications.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.230
So you can use this
app-- for example,

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:06.620
you can ask the app
what does tennis mean,

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.230
how to say tennis or
something like that.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:14.770
It will look up the English
dictionary for the tennis--

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.390
for other words
and translations.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.410
And we also have created
the handwritten character

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.580
recognition.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:28.880
And then students can
write the characters

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.210
in Chinese or in English.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.850
And we also have created
many other hardwares.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.810
For example, we have the
Youdao dictionary pen.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:44.400
You can use this pen to
scan the words on the paper,

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:49.560
and it will recognize words and
look up it in the dictionary.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.130
It is very convenient.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.370
And we also have
a Youdao note pen.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.180
You can write characters
with this pen,

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:05.030
and it will record your
track into the cloud note.

00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:06.890
And we also have homework pad.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.380
You can do your
homework on the pad,

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.040
and it will recognize the
handwritten characters

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.120
and it does the
homework checking.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:22.250
And we have talked about many
applications and hardware

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.500
we have built and created.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.980
And we all know that
in the education

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.830
scenario, many
students in school,

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.070
they are limited
to the internet.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:42.030
So we many offline on-device
inference for them.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.360
So there are many
challenges here--

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.220
for example, the limited
power and limited computation

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.300
resource.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:56.870
So we choose the TF Lite
to accelerate the Youdao's

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.320
on-device AI inference.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.420
It is very easy to use,
and it is very efficient.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:10.250
And as last, this is
our vision and mission,

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:15.970
which is to use technology and
AI to make people communicate,

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.310
study, and work much
more efficiently.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.590
That's all my sharing.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:21.160
Thank you.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:25.110
