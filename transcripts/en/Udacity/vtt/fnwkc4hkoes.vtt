00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.520
In this last work session,

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.910
you'll build a final version
of your mad libs generator.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.710
Which is the one that you saw Andy and
I play at the beginning of stage two.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.890
You'll see how your new knowledge of for
loops and

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.020
lists will allow you to build
a powerful Mad Libs generator.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.870
Which will be able to not only
replace the words noun and verb.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.090
But any other replacement word that you
want like place, adjective or name.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.830
You'll also learn about a new function,

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.910
which will let you use user
inputs as substitute words,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.360
rather than randomly generate ones.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.860
There will also be a tutorial for
mac and

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.170
pc users on how to run
this program locally.
