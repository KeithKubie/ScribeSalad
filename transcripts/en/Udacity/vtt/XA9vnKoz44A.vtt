Okay, Charles, so what do you, what do you think about this?

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.630
&gt;&gt; Wait, how old are my children?

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.950
&gt;&gt; Let's say what their adult height is going to be.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.610
&gt;&gt; I would expect them to be a little bit smaller than me.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.735
&gt;&gt; A little bit smaller than you?

00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:13.379
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.251
&gt;&gt; So, so their, the average height, their

00:00:15.251 --> 00:00:17.487
average height of your children, you would you say

00:00:17.487 --> 00:00:19.810
it would be like an average height person?

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.310
Or like your height or sort of in between?

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.170
&gt;&gt; In between.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.660
&gt;&gt; In between. All right. So it

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.720
turns out that if you actually do this, you measure people's

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.830
heights and you measure the heights of their children, that that

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.860
is in fact what you tend to see. That very, very

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.560
tall people, like you tend to have taller than average children.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.770
But the height is between. It actually regresses to the mean.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.760
And here we really do mean regresses in the sense of

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.420
going back to this kind of more primitive state that, if

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.440
you think about average height people, as being like your ancestors,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.347
then, you know, you as a, as a very tall

00:00:53.347 --> 00:00:55.950
person tend to have kids that that tend regress back

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.240
toward that average value that sort of, more older, more

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.030
ancient value. So does that that make some sense to you?

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.630
&gt;&gt; That makes some sense. But one comment and

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.970
one question. Comment, that is awesome because I've always actually

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.890
wondered what regresses to the mean actually means. The second,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.708
what prevents us from all being the same height then?

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:16.300
&gt;&gt; Yes, so what,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.940
what seems to be happening is that there's a kind of a noisy process and some

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.410
people turn out to be taller, but then

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.140
the, then the next generation there's a little

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.750
bit of a history effect in people stay

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.540
taller, but it tends to drift back towards

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.210
the mean. So it's, so it's, it's sort of like a random walk, to some extent.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.220
&gt;&gt; Oh, that actually kind of makes sense.
