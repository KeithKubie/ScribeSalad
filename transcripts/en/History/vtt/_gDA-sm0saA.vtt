00:00:01.751 --> 00:00:02.627
Oh, look there.

00:00:02.627 --> 00:00:05.505
That is a clean Ford.

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:07.716
- Looks pretty clean.
- Yeah, it is.

00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:09.134
Super clean.

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:11.469
I even like the patina
on it and everything.

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.013
It's either a '52 to a '54 Ford.

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:15.515
Hey, should we
go pull him over?

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.976
Sure.

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:19.811
Hey, can we--

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:23.857
do you have a few minutes to
pull over, talk about your car?

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:24.858
Yeah.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:25.859
Right on.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:26.568
Go ahead.

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:27.485
Ha, ha.

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:29.279
Got ya.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.239
Nice.

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.283
White walls look great on it.
- Yeah, it does.

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:34.576
White walls with the red rims.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:35.952
Yeah.
Nice.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.457
All right.

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:41.332
How you doing?

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:42.375
I'm good.
You.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:43.835
- All right.
- Good, good.

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:44.878
- My names' Ryan.
- Kevin.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:45.754
Kevin, nice to meet you.

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:46.963
Kevin, this Kelly.

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:47.672
Easy.
Yeah.

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:49.340
Wow.
A '50--

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.091
3.

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:51.634
- '53.
- '53.

00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:54.012
1953 was the
year of dynasties.

00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:56.431
Queen Elizabeth was crowned,
the New York Yankees

00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.391
won their fifth World
Series in a row,

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.268
and Ford Motor
Company celebrated

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:01.936
its 50th anniversary.

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:04.981
This '53 Ford Custom Line
showed just how far Ford

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:06.524
had come in half a century.

00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:09.402
It included a special 50th
anniversary horn button

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:10.737
on the steering
wheel to mark it's

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.782
impressive milestone in style.

00:01:13.782 --> 00:01:15.492
You clear coated
over the patina?

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:17.160
Yeah, I did a
little satin on there.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.830
I found it like this in a field
up in northern California.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.624
Somebody was going to paint it.

00:01:22.624 --> 00:01:25.251
So they literally started
doing some body work on it.

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.295
We did floor boards in it.
- Oh, you did?

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:28.379
Yeah.

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:30.006
Look at the patina on this.

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:31.549
Even the front bumper,
that's perfect.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:32.967
Right?

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:33.968
And the other thing in
here we 12 volted it.

00:01:33.968 --> 00:01:36.137
Oh, smart move on the 12 volt.

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:37.096
Right.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:39.432
Man, this car is awesome.

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:43.353
To save something out of a field
and turn it into this, I mean.

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:45.188
That's what building cars
is all about right there.

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:46.439
Yeah, oh, man.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.732
Find them, fix
them, and drive them.

00:01:47.732 --> 00:01:49.442
I was going over
to Viva right now

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:50.610
and going to throw
it up for sale.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.694
- Oh, yeah.
- Were you really?

00:01:51.694 --> 00:01:53.196
- Yeah.
- That's good timing.

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:54.906
We might be able to
save you some trouble.

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:56.783
What kind of number are
you looking for on this?

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:58.409
Well, we put 76 on it.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.494
76?

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.120
You know?

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.373
The price on this '53 Ford
was actually pretty good.

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:05.416
The body had a
beautiful patina on it.

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:07.836
But I know that means Danny
is just going to keep it.

00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:10.129
And there's no way in hell Kevin
is going to let that happen.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.506
So I've got to pass on this one.

00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:13.007
Kevin, I appreciate
you showing us your car.

00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:14.425
- No, I appreciate it too.
- Thank you very much.

00:02:14.425 --> 00:02:16.344
Brother, good job, man.
Man, I love it.

00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:17.345
Man, good find.
