00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.947
The last time I spent solving a
system of equations dealing with

00:00:04.947 --> 00:00:09.659
the chilling of this hardboiled
egg being put in an ice bath.

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:14.528
We called T1 the temperature of
the yoke and T2 the temperature

00:00:14.528 --> 00:00:17.434
of the white.
What I am going to do is

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:21.753
revisit that same system of
equations, but basically the

00:00:21.753 --> 00:00:26.465
topic for today is to learn to
solve that system of equations

00:00:26.465 --> 00:00:30.000
by a completely different
method.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.191
It is the method that is
normally used in practice.

00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:39.305
Elimination is used mostly by
people who have forgotten how to

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:43.161
do it any other way.
Now, in order to make it a

00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:46.934
little more general,
I am not going to use the

00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:52.047
dependent variables T1 and T2
because they suggest temperature

00:00:52.047 --> 00:00:56.155
a little too closely.
Let's change them to neutral

00:00:56.155 --> 00:01:00.198
variables.
I will use x equals T1,

00:01:00.198 --> 00:01:02.868
and for T2 I will just use
y.

00:01:02.868 --> 00:01:05.695
I am not going to re-derive
anything.

00:01:05.695 --> 00:01:08.364
I am not going to resolve
anything.

00:01:08.364 --> 00:01:12.369
I am not going to repeat
anything of what I did last

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.002
time, except to write down to
remind you what the system was

00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:21.635
in terms of these variables,
the system we derived using the

00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:25.404
particular conductivity
constants, two and three,

00:01:25.404 --> 00:01:28.309
respectively.
The system was this one,

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:34.952
minus 2x plus 2y.
And the y prime was 

00:01:34.952 --> 00:01:38.857
2x minus 5y.
And so we solved this by

00:01:38.857 --> 00:01:42.666
elimination.
We got a single second-order

00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:46.000
equation with constant
coefficients,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.047
which we solved in the usual
way.

00:01:49.047 --> 00:01:54.761
From that I derived what the x
was, from that we derived what

00:01:54.761 --> 00:02:00.000
the y was, and then I put them
all together.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.636
I will just remind you what the
final solution was when written

00:02:05.636 --> 00:02:08.818
out in terms of arbitrary
constants.

00:02:08.818 --> 00:02:13.454
It was c1 times e to the
negative t plus c2 e to the

00:02:13.454 --> 00:02:18.909
negative 6t, 
and y was c1 over 2 e

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:24.181
to the negative t minus 2c2 e to
the negative 6t.

00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:30.000
That was the solution we got.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.194
And then I went on to put in
initial conditions,

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:36.932
but we are not going to explore
that aspect of it today.

00:02:36.932 --> 00:02:40.533
We will in a week or so.
This was the general solution

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:44.000
because it had two arbitrary
constants in it.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.342
What I want to do now is
revisit this and do it by a

00:02:54.342 --> 00:02:58.638
different method,
which makes heavy use of

00:02:58.638 --> 00:03:02.328
matrices.
That is a prerequisite for this

00:03:02.328 --> 00:03:06.835
course, so I am assuming that
you reviewed a little bit about

00:03:06.835 --> 00:03:09.239
matrices.
And it is in your book.

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.694
Your book puts in a nice little
review section.

00:03:12.694 --> 00:03:17.051
Two-by-two and three-by-three
will be good enough for 18.03

00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:21.784
mostly because I don't want you
to calculate all night on bigger

00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:25.089
matrices, bigger systems.
So nothing serious,

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:28.619
matrix multiplication,
solving systems of linear

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:34.140
equations, end-by-end systems.
I will remind you at the

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.401
appropriate places today of what
it is you need to remember.

00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:43.146
The very first thing we are
going to do is,

00:03:43.146 --> 00:03:46.802
let's see.
I haven't figured out the color

00:03:46.802 --> 00:03:51.885
coding for this lecture yet,
but let's make this system in

00:03:51.885 --> 00:03:55.363
green and the solution can be in
purple.

00:03:55.363 --> 00:04:00.000
Invisible purple,
but I have a lot of it.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.508
Let's abbreviate,
first of all,

00:04:07.508 --> 00:04:11.940
the system using matrices.
I am going to make a column

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.613
vector out of (x,
y).

00:04:13.613 --> 00:04:18.714
Then you differentiate a column
vector by differentiating each

00:04:18.714 --> 00:04:22.059
component.
I can write the left-hand side

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:24.902
of the system as (x,
y) prime.

00:04:24.902 --> 00:04:29.000
How about the right-hand side?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.384
Well, I say I can just write
the matrix of coefficients to

00:04:33.384 --> 00:04:36.153
negative 2, 2,
2, negative 5 times x,y.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.538
And I say that this matrix
equation says exactly the same

00:04:42.538 --> 00:04:45.846
thing as that green equation
and, therefore,

00:04:45.846 --> 00:04:50.000
it is legitimate to put it up
in green, too.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
The top here is x prime.
What is the top here?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.619
After I multiply these two I
get a column vector.

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:18.854
And what is its top entry?
It is negative 2x plus 2y.

00:05:18.854 --> 00:05:22.266
There it is.

00:05:22.266 --> 00:05:33.040
And the bottom entry the same
way is 2x minus 5y,

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:42.198
just as it is down there.
Now, what I want to do is,

00:05:42.198 --> 00:05:49.919
well, maybe I should translate
the solution.

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:58.000
What does the solution look
like?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.150
We got that,
too.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.613
How am I going to write this as
a matrix equation?

00:05:58.613 --> 00:05:59.103
Actually, if I told you to use
matrices, use vectors,

00:05:59.103 --> 00:05:59.688
the point at which you might be
most hesitant is this one right

00:05:59.688 --> 00:06:00.216
here, the very next step.
Because how you should write it

00:06:00.216 --> 00:06:00.632
is extremely well-concealed in
this notation.

00:06:00.632 --> 00:06:01.066
But the point is,
this is a column vector and I

00:06:01.066 --> 00:06:01.415
am adding together two column
vectors.

00:06:01.415 --> 00:06:02.000
And what is in each one of the
column vectors?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.626
Think of these two things as a
column vector.

00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:09.500
Pull out all the scalars from
them that you can.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.032
Well, you see that c1 is a
common factor of both entries

00:06:14.032 --> 00:06:18.565
and so is e to the negative t,
that function.

00:06:18.565 --> 00:06:22.357
Now, if I pull both of those
out of the vector,

00:06:22.357 --> 00:06:26.972
what is left of the vector?
Well, you cannot even see it.

00:06:26.972 --> 00:06:32.000
What is left is a 1 up here and
a one-half there.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.175
So I am going to write that in
the following form.

00:06:35.175 --> 00:06:38.611
I will put out the c1,
it's the common factor in both,

00:06:38.611 --> 00:06:42.046
and put that out front.
Then I will put in the guts of

00:06:42.046 --> 00:06:44.703
the vector, even though you
cannot see it,

00:06:44.703 --> 00:06:46.907
the column vector 1,
one-half.

00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:49.240
And then I will put the other

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.805
scalar function in back.
The only reason for putting one

00:06:52.805 --> 00:06:56.435
of these in front and one in
back is visual so to make it

00:06:56.435 --> 00:07:00.000
easy to read.
There is no other reason.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.177
You could put the c1 here,
you could put it here,

00:07:03.177 --> 00:07:07.215
you could put the e negative t
in front if you want

00:07:07.215 --> 00:07:10.061
to, but people will fire you.
Don't do that.

00:07:10.061 --> 00:07:13.768
Write it the standard way
because that is the way that it

00:07:13.768 --> 00:07:16.614
is easiest to read.
The constants out front,

00:07:16.614 --> 00:07:19.593
the functions behind,
and the column vector of

00:07:19.593 --> 00:07:22.903
numbers in the middle.
And so the other one will be

00:07:22.903 --> 00:07:25.352
written how?
Well, here, that one is a

00:07:25.352 --> 00:07:30.838
little more transparent.
c2, 1, 2 and the other thing is

00:07:30.838 --> 00:07:33.767
e to the negative 6t.

00:07:33.767 --> 00:07:38.528
There is our solution.
That is going to need a lot of

00:07:38.528 --> 00:07:41.000
purple, but I have it.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.109
And now I want to talk about
how the new method of solving

00:07:50.109 --> 00:07:52.345
the equation.
It is based just on the same

00:07:52.345 --> 00:07:54.909
idea as the way we solve
second-order equations.

00:07:54.909 --> 00:07:56.000
Yes, question.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:04.953
Oh, here.
Sorry.

00:08:04.953 --> 00:08:07.814
This should be negative two.
Thanks very much.

00:08:07.814 --> 00:08:10.484
What I am going to use is a
trial solution.

00:08:10.484 --> 00:08:13.535
Remember when we had a
second-order equation with

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:17.413
constant coefficients the very
first thing I did was I said we

00:08:17.413 --> 00:08:21.354
are going to try a solution of
the form e to the rt.

00:08:21.354 --> 00:08:23.833
Why that?
Well, because Oiler thought of

00:08:23.833 --> 00:08:27.711
it and it has been known for 200
or 300 years that that is the

00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:32.202
thing you should do.
Well, this has not been known

00:08:32.202 --> 00:08:36.835
nearly as long because matrices
were only invented around 1880

00:08:36.835 --> 00:08:41.392
or so, and people did not really
use them to solve systems of

00:08:41.392 --> 00:08:45.873
differential equations until the
middle of the last century,

00:08:45.873 --> 00:08:48.987
1950-1960.
If you look at books written in

00:08:48.987 --> 00:08:53.164
1950, they won't even talk about
systems of differential

00:08:53.164 --> 00:08:57.873
equations, or talk very little
anyway and they won't solve them

00:08:57.873 --> 00:09:02.250
using matrices.
This is only 50 years old.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.144
I mean, my God,
in mathematics that is very up

00:09:06.144 --> 00:09:09.951
to date, particularly elementary
mathematics.

00:09:09.951 --> 00:09:14.711
Anyway, the method of solving
is going to use as a trial

00:09:14.711 --> 00:09:18.000
solution.
Now, if you were left to your

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.759
own devices you might say,
well, let's try x equals some

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:28.211
constant times e to the lambda1
t and y

00:09:28.211 --> 00:09:33.317
equals some other constant times
e to the lambda2 t.

00:09:33.317 --> 00:09:37.718
Now, if you try that,

00:09:37.718 --> 00:09:42.381
it is a sensible thing to try,
but it will turn out not to

00:09:42.381 --> 00:09:45.163
work.
And that is the reason I have

00:09:45.163 --> 00:09:49.663
written out this particular
solution, so we can see what

00:09:49.663 --> 00:09:53.754
solutions look like.
The essential point is here is

00:09:53.754 --> 00:09:56.863
the basic solution I am trying
to find.

00:09:56.863 --> 00:10:00.872
Here is another one.
Their form is a column vector

00:10:00.872 --> 00:10:06.054
of constants.
But they both use the same

00:10:06.054 --> 00:10:10.518
exponential factor,
which is the point.

00:10:10.518 --> 00:10:14.864
In other words,
I should not use here,

00:10:14.864 --> 00:10:19.915
in my trial solution,
two different lambdas,

00:10:19.915 --> 00:10:26.493
I should use the same lambda.
And so the way to write the

00:10:26.493 --> 00:10:32.484
trial solution is (x,
y) equals two unknown numbers,

00:10:32.484 --> 00:10:38.593
that or that or whatever,
times e to a single unknown

00:10:38.593 --> 00:10:43.799
exponent factor.
Let's call it lambda t.

00:10:43.799 --> 00:10:46.539
It is called lambda.
It is called r.

00:10:46.539 --> 00:10:49.826
It is called m.
I have never seen it called

00:10:49.826 --> 00:10:52.799
anything but one of those three
things.

00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:55.930
I am using lambda.
Your book uses lambda.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:00.000
It is a common choice.
Let's stick with it.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.843
Now what is the next step?
Well, we plug into the system.

00:11:03.843 --> 00:11:07.411
Substitute into the system.
What are we going to get?

00:11:07.411 --> 00:11:09.539
Well, let's do it.
First of all,

00:11:09.539 --> 00:11:13.176
I have to differentiate.
The left-hand side asks me to

00:11:13.176 --> 00:11:16.401
differentiate this.
How do I differentiate this?

00:11:16.401 --> 00:11:20.656
Column vector times a function.
Well, the column vector acts as

00:11:20.656 --> 00:11:23.127
a constant.
And I differentiate that.

00:11:23.127 --> 00:11:28.000
That is lambda e to the lambda
t.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.085
So the (x, y) prime is (a1,
a2) times e to the lambda t

00:11:32.085 --> 00:11:35.489
times lambda.

00:11:35.489 --> 00:11:38.137
Now, it is ugly to put the

00:11:38.137 --> 00:11:42.903
lambda afterwards because it is
a number so you should put it in

00:11:42.903 --> 00:11:46.156
front, again,
to make things easier to read.

00:11:46.156 --> 00:11:50.468
But this lambda comes from
differentiating e to the lambda

00:11:50.468 --> 00:11:53.721
t and using the chain rule.

00:11:53.721 --> 00:11:56.066
This much is the left-hand
side.

00:11:56.066 --> 00:12:00.000
That is the derivative (x,
y) prime.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.363
I differentiate the x and I
differentiated the y.

00:12:03.363 --> 00:12:07.426
How about the right-hand side.
Well, the right-hand side is

00:12:07.426 --> 00:12:09.808
negative 2, 2,
2, negative 5 times what?

00:12:09.808 --> 00:12:12.471
Well, times (x,

00:12:12.471 --> 00:12:15.624
y), which is (a1,
a2) e to the lambda t.

00:12:15.624 --> 00:12:18.636
Now, the same thing that

00:12:18.636 --> 00:12:22.420
happened a month or a month and
a half ago happens now.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.554
The whole point of making that
substitution is that the e to

00:12:26.554 --> 00:12:30.687
the lambda t,
the function part of it drops

00:12:30.687 --> 00:12:35.200
out completely.
And one is left with what?

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.855
An algebraic equation to be
solved for lambda a1 and a2.

00:12:39.855 --> 00:12:43.664
In other words,
by means of that substitution,

00:12:43.664 --> 00:12:48.319
and it basically uses the fact
that the coefficients are

00:12:48.319 --> 00:12:53.652
constant, what you have done is
reduced the problem of calculus,

00:12:53.652 --> 00:12:58.222
of solving differential
equations, to solving algebraic

00:12:58.222 --> 00:13:02.205
equations.
In some sense that is the only

00:13:02.205 --> 00:13:05.588
method there is,
unless you do numerical stuff.

00:13:05.588 --> 00:13:08.088
You reduce the calculus to
algebra.

00:13:08.088 --> 00:13:11.544
The Laplace transform is
exactly the same thing.

00:13:11.544 --> 00:13:14.852
All the work is algebra.
You turn the original

00:13:14.852 --> 00:13:19.117
differential equation into an
algebraic equation for Y of s,

00:13:19.117 --> 00:13:22.941
you solve it,
and then you use more algebra

00:13:22.941 --> 00:13:27.058
to find out what the original
little y of t was.

00:13:27.058 --> 00:13:32.185
It is not different here.
So let's solve this system of

00:13:32.185 --> 00:13:34.974
equations.
Now, the whole problem with

00:13:34.974 --> 00:13:37.462
solving this system,
first of all,

00:13:37.462 --> 00:13:41.155
what is the system?
Let's write it out explicitly.

00:13:41.155 --> 00:13:44.321
Well, it is really two
equations, isn't it?

00:13:44.321 --> 00:13:49.070
The first one says lambda a1 is
equal to negative 2 a1 

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:52.763
plus 2 a2.
That is the first one.

00:13:52.763 --> 00:13:56.909
The other one says lambda a2 is
equal to 2 a1 minus 5 a2.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.065
Now, purely,
if you want to classify that,

00:14:09.065 --> 00:14:13.327
that is two equations and three
variables, three unknowns.

00:14:13.327 --> 00:14:16.168
The a1, a2, and lambda are all
unknown.

00:14:16.168 --> 00:14:19.682
And, unfortunately,
if you want to classify them

00:14:19.682 --> 00:14:24.168
correctly, they are nonlinear
equations because they are made

00:14:24.168 --> 00:14:28.355
nonlinear by the fact that you
have multiplied two of the

00:14:28.355 --> 00:14:32.158
variables.
Well, if you sit down and try

00:14:32.158 --> 00:14:35.434
to hack away at solving those
without a plan,

00:14:35.434 --> 00:14:37.890
you are not going to get
anywhere.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:41.910
It is going to be a mess.
Also, two equations and three

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:46.004
unknowns is indeterminate.
You can solve three equations

00:14:46.004 --> 00:14:49.280
and three unknowns and get a
definite answer,

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.076
but two equations and three
unknowns usually have an

00:14:53.076 --> 00:14:56.873
infinity of solutions.
Well, at this point it is the

00:14:56.873 --> 00:15:02.507
only idea that is required.
Well, this was a little idea,

00:15:02.507 --> 00:15:05.619
but I assume one would think of
that.

00:15:05.619 --> 00:15:09.596
And the idea that is required
here is, I think,

00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:13.400
not so unnatural,
it is not to view these a1,

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.982
a2, and lambda as equal.
Not all variables are created

00:15:17.982 --> 00:15:20.576
equal.
Some are more equal than

00:15:20.576 --> 00:15:23.775
others.
a1 and a2 are definitely equal

00:15:23.775 --> 00:15:27.406
to each other,
and let's relegate lambda to

00:15:27.406 --> 00:15:31.153
the background.
In other words,

00:15:31.153 --> 00:15:34.923
I am going to think of lambda
as just a parameter.

00:15:34.923 --> 00:15:39.000
I am going to demote it from
the status of variable to

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.769
parameter.
If I demoted it further it

00:15:41.769 --> 00:15:44.307
would just be an unknown
constant.

00:15:44.307 --> 00:15:48.230
That is as bad as you can be.
I am going to focus my

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:52.076
attention on the a1,
a2 and sort of view the lambda

00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:55.153
as a nuisance.
Now, as soon as I do that,

00:15:55.153 --> 00:15:59.923
I see that these equations are
linear if I just look at them as

00:15:59.923 --> 00:16:04.017
equations in a1 and a2.
And moreover,

00:16:04.017 --> 00:16:07.539
they are not just linear,
they are homogenous.

00:16:07.539 --> 00:16:11.295
Because if I think of lambda
just as a parameter,

00:16:11.295 --> 00:16:14.347
I should rewrite the equations
this way.

00:16:14.347 --> 00:16:19.121
I am going to subtract this and
move the left-hand side to the

00:16:19.121 --> 00:16:23.973
right side, and it is going to
look like (minus 2 minus lambda)

00:16:23.973 --> 00:16:28.669
times a1 plus 2 a2 is equal to
zero.

00:16:28.669 --> 00:16:32.608
And the same way for the other

00:16:32.608 --> 00:16:35.304
one.
It is going to be 2a1 plus,

00:16:35.304 --> 00:16:39.565
what is the coefficient,
(minus 5 minus lambda) a2

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:43.130
equals zero.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:48.521
That is a pair of simultaneous
linear equations for determining

00:16:48.521 --> 00:16:53.826
a1 and a2, and the coefficients
involved are parameter lambda.

00:16:53.826 --> 00:16:58.000
Now, what is the point of doing
that?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.121
Well, now the point is whatever
you learned about linear

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:06.168
equations, you should have
learned the most fundamental

00:17:06.168 --> 00:17:10.365
theorem of linear equations.
The main theorem is that you

00:17:10.365 --> 00:17:13.737
have a square system of
homogeneous equations,

00:17:13.737 --> 00:17:16.960
this is a two-by-two system so
it is square,

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.332
it always has the trivial
solution, of course,

00:17:20.332 --> 00:17:24.079
a1, a2 equals zero.
Now, we don't want that trivial

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:28.426
solution because if a1 and a2
are zero, then so are x and y

00:17:28.426 --> 00:17:32.029
zero.
Now that is a solution.

00:17:32.029 --> 00:17:35.117
Unfortunately,
it is of no interest.

00:17:35.117 --> 00:17:39.705
If the solution were x,
y zero, it corresponds to the

00:17:39.705 --> 00:17:44.117
fact that this is an ice bath.
The yoke is at zero,

00:17:44.117 --> 00:17:48.882
the white is at zero and it
stays that way for all time

00:17:48.882 --> 00:17:52.941
until the ice melts.
So that is the solution we

00:17:52.941 --> 00:17:56.117
don't want.
We don't want the trivial

00:17:56.117 --> 00:17:59.117
solution.
Well, when does it have a

00:17:59.117 --> 00:18:03.176
nontrivial solution?
Nontrivial means non-zero,

00:18:03.176 --> 00:18:09.099
in other words.
If and only if this determinant

00:18:09.099 --> 00:18:10.000
is zero.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.319
In other words,
by using that theorem on linear

00:18:22.319 --> 00:18:28.234
equations, what we find is there
is a condition that lambda must

00:18:28.234 --> 00:18:33.868
satisfy, an equation in lambda
in order that we would be able

00:18:33.868 --> 00:18:38.000
to find non-zero values for a1
and a2.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.686
Let's write it out.
I will recopy it over here.

00:18:41.686 --> 00:18:44.571
What was it?
Negative 2 minus lambda,

00:18:44.571 --> 00:18:49.299
two, here it was 2 and minus 5
minus lambda.

00:18:49.299 --> 00:18:51.864
All right.
You have to expand the

00:18:51.864 --> 00:18:54.027
determinant.
In other words,

00:18:54.027 --> 00:18:58.675
we are trying to find out for
what values of lambda is this

00:18:58.675 --> 00:19:03.285
determinant zero.
Those will be the good values

00:19:03.285 --> 00:19:06.911
which lead to nontrivial
solutions for the a's.

00:19:06.911 --> 00:19:09.591
This is the equation lambda
plus 2.

00:19:09.591 --> 00:19:14.083
See, this is minus that and
minus that, the product of the

00:19:14.083 --> 00:19:18.418
two minus ones is plus one.
So it is lambda plus 2 times

00:19:18.418 --> 00:19:21.650
lambda plus 5,

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:25.512
which is the product of the two
diagonal elements,

00:19:25.512 --> 00:19:29.532
minus the product of the two
anti-diagonal elements,

00:19:29.532 --> 00:19:35.289
which is 4, is equal to zero.
And if I write that out,

00:19:35.289 --> 00:19:39.106
what is that,
that is the equation lambda

00:19:39.106 --> 00:19:43.399
squared plus 7 lambda,

00:19:43.399 --> 00:19:48.360
5 lambda plus 2 lambda,
and then the constant term is

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.844
10 minus 4 which is 6.
How many of you have long

00:19:52.844 --> 00:19:56.756
enough memories,
two-day memories that you

00:19:56.756 --> 00:20:02.857
remember that equation?
When I did the method of

00:20:02.857 --> 00:20:10.119
elimination, it led to exactly
the same equation except it had

00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:15.595
r's in it instead of lambda.
And this equation,

00:20:15.595 --> 00:20:21.666
therefore, is given the same
name and another color.

00:20:21.666 --> 00:20:25.000
Let's make it salmon.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.605
And it is called the
characteristic equation for this

00:20:34.605 --> 00:20:36.111
method.
All right.

00:20:36.111 --> 00:20:40.451
Now I am going to use now the
word from last time.

00:20:40.451 --> 00:20:44.437
You factor this.
From the factorization we get

00:20:44.437 --> 00:20:48.865
its root easily enough.
The roots are lambda equals

00:20:48.865 --> 00:20:54.357
negative 1 and
lambda equals negative 6

00:20:54.357 --> 00:20:57.191
by factoring the
equation.

00:20:57.191 --> 00:21:03.536
Now what I am supposed to do?
You have to keep the different

00:21:03.536 --> 00:21:08.102
parts of the method together.
Now I have found the only

00:21:08.102 --> 00:21:12.836
values of lambda for which I
will be able to find nonzero

00:21:12.836 --> 00:21:17.233
values for the a1 and a2.
For each of those values of

00:21:17.233 --> 00:21:21.798
lambda, I now have to find the
corresponding a1 and a2.

00:21:21.798 --> 00:21:26.702
Let's do them one at a time.
Let's take first lambda equals

00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:32.545
negative one.
My problem is now to find a1

00:21:32.545 --> 00:21:35.818
and a2.
Where am I going to find them

00:21:35.818 --> 00:21:38.545
from?
Well, from that system of

00:21:38.545 --> 00:21:42.909
equations over there.
I will recopy it over here.

00:21:42.909 --> 00:21:47.090
What is the system?
The hardest part of this is

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:52.181
dealing with multiple minus
signs, but you had experience

00:21:52.181 --> 00:21:58.000
with that in determinants so you
know all about that.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.746
In other words,
there is the system of

00:22:01.746 --> 00:22:06.202
equations over there.
Let's recopy them here.

00:22:06.202 --> 00:22:09.848
Minus 2, minus minus 1 makes
minus 1.

00:22:09.848 --> 00:22:15.113
What's the other coefficient?
It is just plain old 2.

00:22:15.113 --> 00:22:18.354
Good.
There is my first equation.

00:22:18.354 --> 00:22:24.126
And when I substitute lambda
equals negative one

00:22:24.126 --> 00:22:30.000
for the second equation,
what do you get?

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:37.156
2 a1 plus negative 5 minus
negative 1 makes negative 4.

00:22:37.156 --> 00:22:43.253
There is my system that will
find me a1 and a2.

00:22:43.253 --> 00:22:48.951
What is the first thing you
notice about it?

00:22:48.951 --> 00:22:56.771
You immediately notice that
this system is fake because this

00:22:56.771 --> 00:23:03.000
second equation is twice the
first one.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.956
Something is wrong.
No, something is right.

00:23:06.956 --> 00:23:12.043
If that did not happen,
if the second equation were not

00:23:12.043 --> 00:23:17.789
a constant multiple of the first
one then the only solution of

00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:23.536
the system would be a1 equals
zero, a2 equals zero because the

00:23:23.536 --> 00:23:29.000
determinant of the coefficients
would not be zero.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.641
The whole function of this
exercise was to find the value

00:23:33.641 --> 00:23:37.868
of lambda, negative 1,
for which the system would be

00:23:37.868 --> 00:23:40.935
redundant and,
therefore, would have a

00:23:40.935 --> 00:23:43.919
nontrivial solution.
Do you get that?

00:23:43.919 --> 00:23:47.235
In other words,
calculate the system out,

00:23:47.235 --> 00:23:51.794
just as I have done here,
you have an automatic check on

00:23:51.794 --> 00:23:54.695
the method.
If one equation is not a

00:23:54.695 --> 00:24:00.000
constant multiple of the other
you made a mistake.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.403
You don't have the right value
of lambda or you substituted

00:24:05.403 --> 00:24:10.248
into the system wrong,
which is frankly a more common

00:24:10.248 --> 00:24:13.229
error.
Go back, recheck first the

00:24:13.229 --> 00:24:17.236
substitution,
and if convinced that is right

00:24:17.236 --> 00:24:20.776
then recheck where you got
lambda from.

00:24:20.776 --> 00:24:26.366
But here everything is going
fine so we can now find out what

00:24:26.366 --> 00:24:32.117
the value of a1 and a2 are.
You don't have to go through a

00:24:32.117 --> 00:24:36.211
big song and dance for this
since most of the time you will

00:24:36.211 --> 00:24:40.235
have two-by-two equations and
now and then three-by-three.

00:24:40.235 --> 00:24:44.329
For two-by-two all you do is,
since we really have the same

00:24:44.329 --> 00:24:47.505
equation twice,
to get a solution I can assign

00:24:47.505 --> 00:24:51.670
one of the variables any value
and then simply solve for the

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:54.141
other.
The natural thing to do is to

00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:57.599
make a2 equal one,
then I won't need fractions and

00:24:57.599 --> 00:25:01.875
then a1 will be a2.
So the solution is (2,

00:25:01.875 --> 00:25:04.517
1).
I am only trying to find one

00:25:04.517 --> 00:25:07.755
solution.
Any constant multiple of this

00:25:07.755 --> 00:25:12.102
would also be a solution,
as long as it wasn't zero,

00:25:12.102 --> 00:25:15.937
zero which is the trivial one.
And, therefore,

00:25:15.937 --> 00:25:20.710
this is a solution to this
system of algebraic equations.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:25.909
And the solution to the whole
system of differential equations

00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:30.000
is, this is only the (a1,
a2) part.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.666
I have to add to it,
as a factor,

00:25:32.666 --> 00:25:36.500
lambda is negative,
therefore, e to the minus t.

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:40.000
There is our purple thing.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.950
See how I got it?
Starting with the trial

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:57.229
solution, I first found out
through this procedure what the

00:25:57.229 --> 00:26:00.703
lambda's have to be.
Then I took the lambda and

00:26:00.703 --> 00:26:04.567
found what the corresponding a1
and a2 that went with it and

00:26:04.567 --> 00:26:06.925
then made up my solution out of
that.

00:26:06.925 --> 00:26:11.052
Now, quickly I will do the same
thing for lambda 

00:26:11.052 --> 00:26:13.868
equals negative 6.
Each one of these must be

00:26:13.868 --> 00:26:17.078
treated separately.
They are separate problems and

00:26:17.078 --> 00:26:19.567
you are looking for separate
solutions.

00:26:19.567 --> 00:26:22.056
Lambda equals negative 6.
What do I do?

00:26:22.056 --> 00:26:25.921
How do my equations look now?
Well, the first one is minus 2

00:26:25.921 --> 00:26:32.419
minus negative 6 makes plus 4.
It is 4a1 plus 2a2 equals zero.

00:26:32.419 --> 00:26:37.775
Then I hold my breath while I

00:26:37.775 --> 00:26:44.955
calculate the second one to see
if it comes out to be a constant

00:26:44.955 --> 00:26:49.514
multiple.
I get 2a1 plus negative 5 minus

00:26:49.514 --> 00:26:54.415
negative 6, which makes plus 1.
And, indeed,

00:26:54.415 --> 00:27:00.000
one is a constant multiple of
the other.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.090
I really only have on equation
there.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:09.318
I will just write down
immediately now what the

00:27:09.318 --> 00:27:13.863
solution is to the system.
Well, the (a1,

00:27:13.863 --> 00:27:19.318
a2) will be what?
Now, it is more natural to make

00:27:19.318 --> 00:27:25.000
a1 equal 1 and then solve to get
an integer for a2.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
If a1 is 1, then a2 is negative
2.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.608
And I should multiply that by e
to the negative 6t

00:27:34.608 --> 00:27:38.007
because negative 6 is the
corresponding value.

00:27:38.007 --> 00:27:41.029
There is my other one.
And now there is a

00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:44.958
superposition principle,
which if I get a chance will

00:27:44.958 --> 00:27:47.677
prove for you at the end of the
hour.

00:27:47.677 --> 00:27:51.606
If not, you will have to do it
yourself for homework.

00:27:51.606 --> 00:27:54.779
Since this is a linear system
of equations,

00:27:54.779 --> 00:27:58.934
once you have two separate
solutions, neither a constant

00:27:58.934 --> 00:28:02.711
multiple of the other,
you can multiply each one of

00:28:02.711 --> 00:28:08.000
these by a constant and it will
still be a solution.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.534
You can add them together and
that will still be a solution,

00:28:11.534 --> 00:28:13.631
and that gives the general
solution.

00:28:13.631 --> 00:28:16.267
The general solution is the sum
of these two,

00:28:16.267 --> 00:28:19.322
an arbitrary constant.
I am going to change the name

00:28:19.322 --> 00:28:22.797
since I don't want to confuse it
with the c1 I used before,

00:28:22.797 --> 00:28:26.331
times the first solution which
is (2, 1) e to the negative t

00:28:26.331 --> 00:28:29.686
plus c2, another arbitrary
constant, times 1 negative 2 e

00:28:29.686 --> 00:28:32.202
to the minus 6t.

00:28:32.202 --> 00:28:37.250
Now you notice that is exactly

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:43.750
the same solution I got before.
The only difference is that I

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:47.650
have renamed the arbitrary
constants.

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:53.174
The relationship between them,
c1 over 2,

00:28:53.174 --> 00:29:00.000
I am now calling c1 tilda,
and c2 I am calling c2 tilda.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.504
If you have an arbitrary
constant, it doesn't matter

00:29:04.504 --> 00:29:09.804
whether you divide it by two.
It is still just an arbitrary a

00:29:09.804 --> 00:29:12.454
constant.
It covers all values,

00:29:12.454 --> 00:29:16.252
in other words.
Well, I think you will agree

00:29:16.252 --> 00:29:20.580
that is a different procedure,
yet it has only one

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:24.025
coincidence.
It is like elimination goes

00:29:24.025 --> 00:29:28.000
this way and comes to the
answer.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.530
And this method goes a
completely different route and

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:34.722
comes to the answer,
except it is not quite like

00:29:34.722 --> 00:29:36.962
that.
They walk like this and then

00:29:36.962 --> 00:29:40.697
they come within viewing
distance of each other to check

00:29:40.697 --> 00:29:44.228
that both are using the same
characteristic equation,

00:29:44.228 --> 00:29:48.098
and then they again go their
separate ways and end up with

00:29:48.098 --> 00:29:50.000
the same answer.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.493
There is something special of
these values.

00:30:00.493 --> 00:30:03.521
You cannot get away from those
two values of lambda.

00:30:03.521 --> 00:30:06.311
Somehow they are really
intrinsically connected.

00:30:06.311 --> 00:30:09.102
Occurs the exponential
coefficient, and they are

00:30:09.102 --> 00:30:12.545
intrinsically connected with the
problem of the egg that we

00:30:12.545 --> 00:30:15.098
started with.
Now what I would like to do is

00:30:15.098 --> 00:30:18.541
very quickly sketch how this
method looks when I remove all

00:30:18.541 --> 00:30:20.560
the numbers from it.
In some sense,

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.172
it becomes a little clearer
what is going on.

00:30:23.172 --> 00:30:26.615
And that will give me a chance
to introduce the terminology

00:30:26.615 --> 00:30:30.000
that you need when you talk
about it.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:03.360
Well, you have notes.
Let me try to write it down in

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.000
general.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.466
I will first write it out
two-by-two.

00:31:13.466 --> 00:31:18.377
I am just going to sketch.
The system looks like (x,

00:31:18.377 --> 00:31:23.000
y) equals, I will still put it
up in colors.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.115
Except now, instead of using
twos and fives,

00:31:33.115 --> 00:31:35.000
I will use (a,
b; c, d).

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.038
The trial solution will look
how?

00:31:44.038 --> 00:31:48.203
The trial is going to be (a1,
a2).

00:31:48.203 --> 00:31:53.126
That I don't have to change the
name of.

00:31:53.126 --> 00:31:59.436
I am going to substitute in,
and what the result of

00:31:59.436 --> 00:32:06.000
substitution is going to be
lambda (a1, a2).

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.686
I am going to skip a step and
pretend that the e to the lambda

00:32:11.686 --> 00:32:16.347
t's have already
been canceled out.

00:32:16.347 --> 00:32:19.516
Is equal to (a,
b; c, d) times (a1,

00:32:19.516 --> 00:32:22.593
a2).
What does that correspond to?

00:32:22.593 --> 00:32:28.000
That corresponds to the system
as I wrote it here.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.426
And then we wrote it out in
terms of two equations.

00:32:31.426 --> 00:32:35.126
And what was the resulting
thing that we ended up with?

00:32:35.126 --> 00:32:38.483
Well, you write it out,
you move the lambda to the

00:32:38.483 --> 00:32:41.361
other side.
And then the homogeneous system

00:32:41.361 --> 00:32:45.404
is we will look in general how?
Well, we could write it out.

00:32:45.404 --> 00:32:48.077
It is going to look like a
minus lambda,

00:32:48.077 --> 00:32:50.817
b, c, d minus lambda.

00:32:50.817 --> 00:32:53.901
That is just how it looks there

00:32:53.901 --> 00:32:56.573
and the general calculation is
the same.

00:32:56.573 --> 00:33:00.000
Times (a1, a2) is equal to
zero.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:13.653
This is solvable nontrivially.
In other words,

00:33:13.653 --> 00:33:25.192
it has a nontrivial solution if
an only if the determinant of

00:33:25.192 --> 00:33:30.000
coefficients is zero.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.464
Let's now write that out,
calculate out once and for all

00:33:39.464 --> 00:33:43.522
what that determinant is.
I will write it out here.

00:33:43.522 --> 00:33:46.850
It is a minus lambda times d
minus lambda,

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:50.584
the product of the diagonal
elements, minus the

00:33:50.584 --> 00:33:55.211
anti-diagonal minus bc is equal
to zero.

00:33:55.211 --> 00:34:00.000
And let's calculate that out.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:07.459
It is lambda squared minus a
lambda minus d lambda plus ad,

00:34:07.459 --> 00:34:14.019
the constant term from here,
negative bc from there,

00:34:14.019 --> 00:34:21.864
plus ad minus bc,

00:34:21.864 --> 00:34:29.324
where have I seen that before?
This equation is the general

00:34:29.324 --> 00:34:36.784
form using letters of what we
calculated using the specific

00:34:36.784 --> 00:34:45.000
numbers before.
Again, I will code it the same

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:54.333
way with that color salmon.
Now, most of the calculations

00:34:54.333 --> 00:35:00.850
will be for two-by-two systems.
I advise you,

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:03.990
in the strongest possible
terms, to remember this

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:06.214
equation.
You could write down this

00:35:06.214 --> 00:35:08.504
equation immediately for the
matrix.

00:35:08.504 --> 00:35:11.317
You don't have to go through
all this stuff.

00:35:11.317 --> 00:35:13.869
For God's sakes,
don't say let the trial

00:35:13.869 --> 00:35:15.700
solution be blah,
blah, blah.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:19.364
You don't want to do that.
I don't want you to repeat the

00:35:19.364 --> 00:35:23.028
derivation of this every time
you go through a particular

00:35:23.028 --> 00:35:25.252
problem.
It is just like in solving

00:35:25.252 --> 00:35:29.739
second order equations.
You have a second order

00:35:29.739 --> 00:35:32.690
equation.
You immediately write down its

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:35.943
characteristic equation,
then you factor it,

00:35:35.943 --> 00:35:39.650
you find its roots and you
construct the solution.

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:42.146
It takes a minute.
The same thing,

00:35:42.146 --> 00:35:43.962
this takes a minute,
too.

00:35:43.962 --> 00:35:47.744
What is the constant term?
Ad minus bc,

00:35:47.744 --> 00:35:49.711
what is that?
Matrix is (a,

00:35:49.711 --> 00:35:52.737
b; c, d).
Ad minus bc is its determinant.

00:35:52.737 --> 00:35:55.612
This is the determinant of that
matrix.

00:35:55.612 --> 00:36:00.000
I didn't give the matrix a
name, did I?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.307
I will now give the matrix a
name A.

00:36:03.307 --> 00:36:07.277
What is this?
Well, you are not supposed to

00:36:07.277 --> 00:36:10.679
know that until now.
I will tell you.

00:36:10.679 --> 00:36:16.161
This is called the trace of A.
Put that down in your little

00:36:16.161 --> 00:36:19.280
books.
The abbreviation is trace A,

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:25.234
and the word is trace.
The trace of a square matrix is

00:36:25.234 --> 00:36:31.000
the sum of the d elements down
its main diagonal.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.981
If it were a three-by-three
there would be three terms in

00:36:35.981 --> 00:36:40.696
whatever you are up to.
Here it is a plus b,

00:36:40.696 --> 00:36:43.542
the sum of the diagonal
elements.

00:36:43.542 --> 00:36:48.791
You can immediately write down
this characteristic equation.

00:36:48.791 --> 00:36:52.794
Let's give it a name.
This is a characteristic

00:36:52.794 --> 00:36:55.552
equation of what?
Of the matrix,

00:36:55.552 --> 00:36:57.509
now.
Not of the system,

00:36:57.509 --> 00:37:02.205
of the matrix.
You have a two-by-two matrix.

00:37:02.205 --> 00:37:06.008
You could immediately write
down its characteristic

00:37:06.008 --> 00:37:08.518
equation.
Watch out for this sign,

00:37:08.518 --> 00:37:11.256
minus.
That is a very common error to

00:37:11.256 --> 00:37:15.743
leave out the minus sign because
that is the way the formula

00:37:15.743 --> 00:37:17.264
comes out.
Its roots.

00:37:17.264 --> 00:37:20.915
If it is a quadratic equation
it will have roots;

00:37:20.915 --> 00:37:25.174
lambda1, lambda2 for the moment
let's assume are real and

00:37:25.174 --> 00:37:27.000
distinct.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.416
For the enrichment of your
vocabulary, those are called the

00:37:39.416 --> 00:37:40.000
eigenvalues.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.075
They are something which
belonged to the matrix A.

00:37:53.075 --> 00:37:56.464
They are two secret numbers.
You can calculate from the

00:37:56.464 --> 00:37:58.410
coefficients a,
b, and c, and d,

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:00.669
but they are not in the
coefficients.

00:38:00.669 --> 00:38:05.000
You cannot look at a matrix and
see what its eigenvalues are.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.150
You have to calculate
something.

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:10.826
But they are the most important
numbers in the matrix.

00:38:10.826 --> 00:38:13.878
They are hidden,
but they are the things that

00:38:13.878 --> 00:38:17.485
control how this system behaves.
Those are called the

00:38:17.485 --> 00:38:20.468
eigenvalues.
Now, there are various purists,

00:38:20.468 --> 00:38:24.560
there are a fair number of them
in the world who do not like

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:29.000
this word because it begins
German and ends English.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.337
Eigenvalues were first
introduced by a German

00:38:32.337 --> 00:38:35.296
mathematician,
you know, around the time

00:38:35.296 --> 00:38:38.179
matrices came into being in 1880
or so.

00:38:38.179 --> 00:38:41.820
A little while after
eigenvalues came into being,

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.400
too.
And since all this happened in

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.813
Germany they were named
eigenvalues in German,

00:38:47.813 --> 00:38:50.317
which begins eigen and ends
value.

00:38:50.317 --> 00:38:54.793
But people who do not like that
call them the characteristic

00:38:54.793 --> 00:38:56.386
values.
Unfortunately,

00:38:56.386 --> 00:39:02.000
it is two words and takes a lot
more space to write out.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.904
An older generation even calls
them something different,

00:39:06.904 --> 00:39:10.738
which you are not so likely to
see nowadays,

00:39:10.738 --> 00:39:13.949
but you will in slightly older
books.

00:39:13.949 --> 00:39:17.515
You can also call them the
proper values.

00:39:17.515 --> 00:39:21.439
Characteristic is not a
translation of eigen,

00:39:21.439 --> 00:39:25.006
but proper is,
but it means it in a funny

00:39:25.006 --> 00:39:30.000
sense which has almost
disappeared nowadays.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.288
It means proper in the sense of
belong to.

00:39:33.288 --> 00:39:37.458
The only example I can think of
is the word property.

00:39:37.458 --> 00:39:40.746
Property is something that
belongs to you.

00:39:40.746 --> 00:39:43.473
That is the use of the word
proper.

00:39:43.473 --> 00:39:46.842
It is something that belongs to
the matrix.

00:39:46.842 --> 00:39:49.408
The matrix has its proper
values.

00:39:49.408 --> 00:39:54.380
It does not mean proper in the
sense of fitting and proper or I

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:59.112
hope you will behave properly
when we go to Aunt Agatha's or

00:39:59.112 --> 00:40:03.149
something like that.
But, as I say,

00:40:03.149 --> 00:40:07.994
by far the most popular thing,
slowly the word eigenvalue is

00:40:07.994 --> 00:40:11.114
pretty much taking over the
literature.

00:40:11.114 --> 00:40:15.384
Just because it's just one
word, that is a tremendous

00:40:15.384 --> 00:40:16.615
advantage.
Okay.

00:40:16.615 --> 00:40:21.378
What now is still to be done?
Well, there are those vectors

00:40:21.378 --> 00:40:24.826
to be found.
So the very last step would be

00:40:24.826 --> 00:40:30.000
to solve the system to find the
vectors a1 and a2.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.348
For each (lambda)i,
find the associated vector.

00:40:40.348 --> 00:40:44.534
The vector, we will call it
(alpha)i.

00:40:44.534 --> 00:40:50.116
That is the a1 and a2.
Of course it's going to be

00:40:50.116 --> 00:40:53.720
indexed.
You have to put another

00:40:53.720 --> 00:41:00.000
subscript on it because there
are two of them.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.602
And a1 and a2 is stretched a
little too far.

00:41:04.602 --> 00:41:09.739
By solving the system,
and the system will be the

00:41:09.739 --> 00:41:15.197
system which I will write this
way, (a minus lambda,

00:41:15.197 --> 00:41:19.585
b, c, d minus lambda).

00:41:19.585 --> 00:41:24.401
It is just that system that was

00:41:24.401 --> 00:41:30.180
over there, but I will recopy
it, (a1, a2) equals zero,

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:34.776
zero.
And these are called the

00:41:34.776 --> 00:41:39.404
eigenvectors.
Each of these is called the

00:41:39.404 --> 00:41:44.380
eigenvector associated with or
belonging to,

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:48.082
again, in that sense of
property.

00:41:48.082 --> 00:41:52.132
Eigenvector,
let's say belonging to,

00:41:52.132 --> 00:41:58.495
I see that a little more
frequently, belonging to lambda

00:41:58.495 --> 00:42:01.698
i.
So we have the eigenvalues,

00:42:01.698 --> 00:42:04.905
the eigenvectors and,
of course, the people who call

00:42:04.905 --> 00:42:08.742
them characteristic values also
call these guys characteristic

00:42:08.742 --> 00:42:11.132
vectors.
I don't think I have ever seen

00:42:11.132 --> 00:42:13.836
proper vectors,
but that is because I am not

00:42:13.836 --> 00:42:16.415
old enough.
I think that is what they used

00:42:16.415 --> 00:42:20.000
to be called a long time ago,
but not anymore.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.619
And then, finally,
the general solution will be,

00:42:24.619 --> 00:42:30.319
by the superposition principle,
(x, y) equals the arbitrary

00:42:30.319 --> 00:42:35.823
constant times the first
eigenvector times the eigenvalue

00:42:35.823 --> 00:42:40.049
times the e to the corresponding
eigenvalue.

00:42:40.049 --> 00:42:44.668
And then the same thing for the
second one, (a1,

00:42:44.668 --> 00:42:50.368
a2), but now the second index
will be 2 to indicate that it

00:42:50.368 --> 00:42:56.363
goes with the eigenvalue e to
the lambda 2t.

00:42:56.363 --> 00:43:02.219
I have done that twice.
And now in the remaining five

00:43:02.219 --> 00:43:06.659
minutes I will do it a third
time because it is possible to

00:43:06.659 --> 00:43:09.797
write this in still a more
condensed form.

00:43:09.797 --> 00:43:13.548
And the advantage of the more
condensed form is A,

00:43:13.548 --> 00:43:16.992
it takes only that much space
to write, and B,

00:43:16.992 --> 00:43:20.437
it applies to systems,
not just the two-by-two

00:43:20.437 --> 00:43:23.039
systems, but to end-by-end
systems.

00:43:23.039 --> 00:43:27.708
The method is exactly the same.
Let's write it out as it would

00:43:27.708 --> 00:43:34.184
apply to end-by-end systems.
The vector I started with is

00:43:34.184 --> 00:43:39.301
(x, y) and so on,
but I will simply abbreviate

00:43:39.301 --> 00:43:45.329
this, as is done in 18.02,
by x with an arrow over it.

00:43:45.329 --> 00:43:51.925
The matrix A I will abbreviate
with A, as I did before with

00:43:51.925 --> 00:43:56.474
capital A.
And then the system looks like

00:43:56.474 --> 00:44:00.000
x prime is equal to --

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.733
x prime is what?
Ax.

00:44:06.733 --> 00:44:10.200
That is all there is to it.

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:15.218
There is our green system.
Now notice in this form I did

00:44:15.218 --> 00:44:20.237
not even tell you whether this a
two-by-two matrix or an

00:44:20.237 --> 00:44:23.886
end-by-end.
And in this condensed form it

00:44:23.886 --> 00:44:30.000
will look the same no matter how
many equations you have.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.864
Your book deals from the
beginning with end-by-end

00:44:33.864 --> 00:44:36.073
systems.
That is, in my view,

00:44:36.073 --> 00:44:40.963
one of its weaknesses because I
don't think most students start

00:44:40.963 --> 00:44:43.171
with two-by-two.
Fortunately,

00:44:43.171 --> 00:44:46.878
the book double-talks.
The theory is end-by-end,

00:44:46.878 --> 00:44:49.639
but all the examples are
two-by-two.

00:44:49.639 --> 00:44:53.504
So just read the examples.
Read the notes instead,

00:44:53.504 --> 00:44:58.000
which just do two-by-two to
start out with.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.623
The trial solution is x equals
what?

00:45:01.623 --> 00:45:07.629
An unknown vector alpha times e
to the lambda t.

00:45:07.629 --> 00:45:11.253
Alpha is what we called a1 and

00:45:11.253 --> 00:45:15.498
a2 before.
Plug this into there and cancel

00:45:15.498 --> 00:45:19.640
the e to the lambda t's.

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:24.506
What do you get?
Well, this is lambda alpha e to

00:45:24.506 --> 00:45:29.166
the lambda t equals A alpha e to
the lambda t.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.576
These two cancel.
And the system to be solved,

00:45:40.576 --> 00:45:46.067
A alpha equals lambda alpha.

00:45:46.067 --> 00:45:51.355
And now the question is how do
you solve that system?

00:45:51.355 --> 00:45:57.762
Well, you can tell if a book is
written by a scoundrel or not by

00:45:57.762 --> 00:46:02.980
how they go --
A book, which is in my opinion

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:07.849
completely scoundrel,
simply says you subtract one

00:46:07.849 --> 00:46:12.320
from the other,
and without further ado writes

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:16.493
A minus lambda,
and they tuck a little I in

00:46:16.493 --> 00:46:19.772
there and write alpha equals
zero.

00:46:19.772 --> 00:46:25.137
Why is the I put in there?
Well, this is what you would

00:46:25.137 --> 00:46:28.814
like to write.
What is wrong with this

00:46:28.814 --> 00:46:32.916
equation?
This is not a valid matrix

00:46:32.916 --> 00:46:36.675
equation because that is a
square end-by-end matrix,

00:46:36.675 --> 00:46:39.476
a square two-by-two matrix if
you like.

00:46:39.476 --> 00:46:42.941
This is a scalar.
You cannot subtract the scalar

00:46:42.941 --> 00:46:45.668
from a matrix.
It is not an operation.

00:46:45.668 --> 00:46:49.353
To subtract matrices they have
to be the same size,

00:46:49.353 --> 00:46:52.744
the same shape.
What is done is you make this a

00:46:52.744 --> 00:46:56.061
two-by-two matrix.
This is a two-by-two matrix

00:46:56.061 --> 00:47:01.000
with lambdas down the main
diagonal and I elsewhere.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.653
And the justification is that
lambda alpha is the same thing

00:47:05.653 --> 00:47:10.307
as the lambda I times alpha
because I is an identity matrix.

00:47:10.307 --> 00:47:13.541
Now, in fact,
jumping from here to here is

00:47:13.541 --> 00:47:16.776
not something that would occur
to anybody.

00:47:16.776 --> 00:47:21.193
The way it should occur to you
to do this is you do this,

00:47:21.193 --> 00:47:24.585
you write that,
you realize it doesn't work,

00:47:24.585 --> 00:47:29.081
and then you say to yourself I
don't understand what these

00:47:29.081 --> 00:47:33.924
matrices are all about.
I think I'd better write it all

00:47:33.924 --> 00:47:36.097
out.
And then you would write it all

00:47:36.097 --> 00:47:39.760
out and you would write that
equation on the left-hand board

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.871
there.
Oh, now I see what it should

00:47:41.871 --> 00:47:44.292
look like.
I should subtract lambda from

00:47:44.292 --> 00:47:47.148
the main diagonal.
That is the way it will come

00:47:47.148 --> 00:47:48.203
out.
And then say,

00:47:48.203 --> 00:47:51.866
hey, the way to save lambda
from the main diagonal is put it

00:47:51.866 --> 00:47:54.660
in an identity matrix.
That will do it for me.

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.392
In other words,
there is a little detour that

00:47:57.392 --> 00:48:01.840
goes from here to here.
And one of the ways I judge

00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.727
books is by how well they
explain the passage from this to

00:48:05.727 --> 00:48:08.181
that.
If they don't explain it at all

00:48:08.181 --> 00:48:11.454
and just write it down,
they have never talked to

00:48:11.454 --> 00:48:14.045
students.
They have just written books.

00:48:14.045 --> 00:48:17.931
Where did we get finally here?
The characteristic equation

00:48:17.931 --> 00:48:20.454
from that, I had forgotten what
color.

00:48:20.454 --> 00:48:23.590
That is in salmon.
The characteristic equation,

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:27.750
then, is going to be the thing
which says that the determinant

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:32.114
of that is zero.
That is the circumstances under

00:48:32.114 --> 00:48:35.662
which it is solvable.
In general, this is the way the

00:48:35.662 --> 00:48:38.664
characteristic equation looks.
And its roots,

00:48:38.664 --> 00:48:40.779
once again, are the
eigenvalues.

00:48:40.779 --> 00:48:44.736
And from then you calculate the
corresponding eigenvectors.

00:48:44.736 --> 00:48:46.510
Okay.
Go home and practice.

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:50.126
In recitation you will practice
on both two-by-two and

00:48:50.126 --> 00:48:53.332
three-by-three cases,
and we will talk more next

00:48:53.332 --> 00:48:54.332
time.
