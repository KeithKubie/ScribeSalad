anyway so I'm not even sure that we've

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:50.660
anyway so I'm not even sure that we've
 

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.590
anyway so I'm not even sure that we've
got the right to do that but it's

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:53.600
got the right to do that but it's
 

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:59.860
got the right to do that but it's
definitely worth thinking about

so there what what you can take the data
 

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.329
so there what what you can take the data
and put it into a number of systems so

00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:20.339
and put it into a number of systems so
 

00:16:20.339 --> 00:16:23.690
and put it into a number of systems so
yes it creates a model that you can play

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:23.700
yes it creates a model that you can play
 

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:28.240
yes it creates a model that you can play
with in other systems definitely
