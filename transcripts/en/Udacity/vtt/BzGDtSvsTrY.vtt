00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.170
A dictionary is a collection
of key value pairs.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.490
Dictionaries in Swift can be
initialized in a couple ways.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.830
As with arrays,
you can use initializer syntax or

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.670
you can use a dictionary literal,
a list of values separated by commas.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.660
Here between the brackets, we have the
key and value type separated by a colon,

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.740
and then a pair of parentheses
to signify the constructor.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.350
You'll notice in the dictionary literal
the relationship between key in value is

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.548
also indicated with the colon.

00:00:25.548 --> 00:00:29.370
And many key-value pairs
are separated by commas.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.920
Let's see another example.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.750
Here's my very short dictionary
of animal life spans,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.720
which I can initialize with initializer
syntax or with a dictionary literal.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.845
And here, you can see the type of
the lifespan value is a range of ints.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.610
By the way, these three dots here
represent the closed range operator.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.930
For example, this range represents
the range from 20 to 30,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:50.750
including 20 and 30.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.350
The average lifespan of a ball nosed
dolphin in the wild is 20 to 30 years.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.300
We'll see these range operators again
when we get to flow of control.
