00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.910
Getting every nation on Earth to agree on
an environmental issue is tough, but it has

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.150
been done before.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.550
The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete
the Ozone Layer — or just the Montreal Protocol

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.620
— is the most successful step we’ve taken
to protect our planet to date, but getting

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.309
there wasn’t easy.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.140
When you hear about the ozone layer you probably
think of aerosol cans, but the story actually

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.230
begins with air travel.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.050
In the early-1970s jet setting around the
world took off, and curious scientists started

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.940
gathering data on how airplanes were affecting
Earth’s atmosphere.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.840
Ozone is a vital molecule of three oxygen
atoms that exists mainly in the stratosphere,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.090
but it’s very rare: there are only about
three molecules of ozone for every 10 million

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.929
molecules of air, Still those .3 parts per
million of ozone play a critical role of absorbing

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:51.129
biologically damaging UV-B sunlight.

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.829
At the time, ozone had already been studied,
but Frank Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.380
threw ozone into the spotlight.They posited
that chlorine atoms from refrigerators and

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.640
AC units might have an adverse effect on our
atmosphere.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.650
And boy were they right.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.750
It turns out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) can
actually float all the way up to the ozone

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:12.750
layer.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.890
And when they get there, the CFCs run rampant!

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.399
Ultraviolet light breaks a chlorine atom off
the CFC.

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.469
That chlorine in turn breaks an oxygen molecule
off of ozone and binds with it, until another

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:27.270
free oxygen atom comes along and kicks the
chlorine off on its lonesome.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.880
The spurned atom then continues the cycle
of breaking down more ozone molecules into

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.370
oxygen molecules.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.380
Basically, CFCs are serious home wreckers,
and they were wrecking our home, planet Earth.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.350
The study called out man-made chemicals for
contributing to the problem, And as you might

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.070
expect, there was backlash from the people
who made those chemicals.Because some of these

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.810
were commonly used in refrigeration and air
conditioning, industry groups had a lot to

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.850
lose, and resisted regulation.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.409
Industry representatives said it was unnecessary
to take action against useful chemicals over

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.670
what many felt was flimsy evidence.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.909
Gee that sounds familiar.

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.710
But the scientific evidence kept mounting
and a report from the National Academy of

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.530
Sciences, published in 1976 solidified, the
link between CFCs and the depleted ozone layer.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.390
So, of course, everyone jumped to action right
away!

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.680
Just kidding, we waited until the problem
got really bad.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.659
In 1985, researchers found the ozone layer
over the South Pole had depleted by about

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.730
40 percent in just a decade.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.980
Even NASA hadn’t noticed, because the programs
they were using were set to ignore what they

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.810
assumed were impossible ozone measurements.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.450
NASA ignored a giant hole because they thought
it was impossible.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.290
Unable to ignore the problem any longer, 28
nations, including most of the largest CFC

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.970
producers, signed on to the Vienna Conventions,
establishing guidelines for negotiating international

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.370
regulations on substances harmful to ozone.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.770
But it wasn’t enough.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.209
About two years later The Montreal Protocol
was drafted.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.519
Designed to reduce the production and consumption
of substances harming atmospheric ozone, it

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.140
held signing nations responsible to gradually
scaling back the use of nearly 100 chemicals.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.950
The atmosphere-harming substances became controlled,
and the protocol laid out a binding agreement

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.420
to stemming their use.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.569
We were finally taking the environment seriously.

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.930
Can you imagine that happening now?

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.870
Can you?

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.760
The treaty has been adjusted and amended a
number of times since.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.240
It’s also been changed to account for unforeseen
side effects.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.200
Hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, were introduced
as a chemical to take the place of CFCs in

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:38.519
things like refrigerators and air conditioners,
and while they don’t hurt the ozone they

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.420
are greenhouse gases that trap heat far more
efficiently than carbon dioxide.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.709
Once that was known, a phase out plan for
HFCs was added into the Montreal Protocol.

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.840
On September 16, 2009, the Vienna Conventions
and the Montreal Protocol became the first

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.510
universally ratified treaties in UN history.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.640
Now, 30 years later, the results of the Montreal
Protocol are clear.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.629
The ozone hole over the South Pole is healing,
plus a new study has found an encouraging

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:09.079
side effect: a significant drop in greenhouse
gas emissions in the United States!

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.709
They found, prohibition on these chemicals
eliminated the equivalent of 170 million tonnes

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.720
of carbon dioxide emissions annually, a level
never anticipated in the original treaty.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.720
The team estimates that by 2025 the US will
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.920
of 500 million tonnes of CO2 every year compared
to 2005 levels.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:36.050
The Montreal Protocol worked, thanks to the
cooperation of all 197 signing nations.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.840
If history were to repeat itself, now would
be a great time.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.120
Global temperatures are still rising, but
The Paris Agreement, designed to keep global

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.389
temperature rise below the 2-degree tipping
point is facing some … shall we say… pushback

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:49.930
from one signatory specifically.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.669
But, if anything, the Montreal Protocol shows
that if we pull together we can make a global

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.360
change that benefits everyone.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.460
Some countries are doing better than others
in the fight against climate change.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.980
We did a video on whether China is taking
the right steps; check it out right here.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.259
Do you think it’s possible to undertake
another climate agreement like the Montreal

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.080
Protocol?
