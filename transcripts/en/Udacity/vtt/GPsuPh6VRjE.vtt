00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here are my answers.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The prior for fire is 0.001

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
times the probability that the neighbor now correctly said, yes, it burns, which is 0.9.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
He lies with a probability of 0.1, so the complement is 0.9.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This gives us 0.0009.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
For the complement, the prior of no fire, is 0.999,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but now the neighbor would have lied, which multiplies with 0.1,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
which gives us 0.0999.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now, these two values don't add up to 1.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The normalizer will be 1 over these two things, which is about 9.92.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Multiplying these with their normalizer gives us approximately 0.0089 and 0.991.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So the answer your neighbor gave you--yes, it burns--

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
raised your probability from 0.001 to 0.0089.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's still small, but it's significantly larger.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
In fact, it's approximately 0.9 times as large as the initial probability.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The reason why that is the case is it relates to the 0.9 probability of speaking the truth.

00:01:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
It's not exactly 0.9 because of normalization, but it's approximately 0.9.
