00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:09.424
[DEEP BREATH]

00:00:11.356 --> 00:00:12.730
INTERVIEWER: What
is your ritual?

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.620
JAMES ARMSTRONG: My ritual
is meditating and breathing.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.590
My breathing is as
long and as slow.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.130
At times, it can feel like
an out of body experience.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.810
It's given me a lot of ability,
I would say, to do things.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.310
Anything.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.560
Whether you're stressed,
or scared, or keeping calm

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.144
is a big deal.

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:31.559
INTERVIEWER: How long have you
been in the Hollywood stunt

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:32.350
business?

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.391
JAMES ARMSTRONG: I've been
a stuntman for as long

00:00:34.391 --> 00:00:35.765
as I can remember, to be honest.

00:00:35.765 --> 00:00:36.940
I'm second generation.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.960
My father and my uncle
were all stuntmen,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.400
and I grew up around it.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.210
But we're a weird breed.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.894
We enjoy hitting the ground
and smashing through things.

00:00:45.894 --> 00:00:48.060
So there's a million ways
to turn a stuntman around,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.627
and I've probably done them all.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.250
On a big, full body fire burn,
I might have as many as five,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.570
six layers on.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.090
And I like to alternate
between dry, wet, dry and wet,

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.440
just because it interacts
differently with the flame.

00:01:09.376 --> 00:01:10.835
So I've got all
these layers on me.

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:12.292
They've got fire
retardant on them.

00:01:12.292 --> 00:01:13.606
They've got fire gel on them.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:14.480
They're cold as well.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.055
That affects your breath
when you're breathing.

00:01:17.055 --> 00:01:20.775
[DEEP BREATH]

00:01:21.656 --> 00:01:24.030
INTERVIEWER: Do you still get
nervous before a big stunt?

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.560
JAMES ARMSTRONG: Oh, for sure.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.300
I get nervous about everything.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.270
The smallest things.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.040
People die doing stunts, and
you learn the older you get, OK.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.309
I'm scared, I'm nervous,
but this is a good thing.

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:35.850
It means I'm thinking
things through.

00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:42.945
When you're there and
they're all looking at you,

00:01:42.945 --> 00:01:44.194
it's incredible, the pressure.

00:01:44.194 --> 00:01:45.880
You have to kind of
get into the moment,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.160
switch on, and do it once.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.900
Get it done, you know?

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.250
And we have a saying.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.290
Fear knocks on the door,
but experience answers.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.910
INTERVIEWER: What happens
if you lose focus?

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.826
JAMES ARMSTRONG: If I'm
about to do something,

00:01:56.826 --> 00:01:59.150
and I feel my heart
thumping or my hand shaking,

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.844
then I'll close my
eyes, and I breathe.

00:02:02.844 --> 00:02:10.889
[DEEP BREATH]

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.430
The fear all goes
away at that point.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.429
There is no other
distraction, no other thought.

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:17.200
It's just this
absolute pin point

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.934
focus of the task at hand.

00:02:18.934 --> 00:02:23.407
When I open my eyes,
I'm ready to go.

00:02:23.407 --> 00:02:54.644
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:54.644 --> 00:02:56.810
INTERVIEWER: Click to watch
how one boy's ritual has

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.620
made him feel less different,
and ignited a passion.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.120
SUBJECT 1: Sports
is very important.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.110
It's where I go to
relax, and that's

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.080
what I do to get
everything off my mind.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.840
I've learned to be
confident in myself,

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.570
I've learned to be positive.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.480
I'm different.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.030
That's not a bad thing.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.110
