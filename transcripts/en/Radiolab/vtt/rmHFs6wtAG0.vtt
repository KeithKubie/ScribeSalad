00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.740
Radiolab is supported by dash digital cash,

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.570
the quick and easy way to send money to anyone in the world from anywhere in the

4
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:13.350
world.

5
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.350
Dash arrives within seconds and transactions are instant secure and optionally

6
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:24.270
private dash is digital cash. For more information,

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.910
<v 1>This is Radiolab. I'm Jad boom rod and I'm Robert Krulwich today on our program,</v>

9
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.720
stories about stumbling onto the past and finding surprises.

10
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.110
Strange things which brings us to DNA.

11
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.330
DNA is used to track crimes. This we know from police dramas like CSI,

12
00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:49.600
far less glamorously but no less. Interestingly,

13
00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.870
historians and geneticists use DNA to go way back in time and answer basic

14
00:00:56.151 --> 00:00:58.970
questions about who we are and where we came from.

15
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.400
And that is an unlikely development if you think.

16
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.910
<v 0>Yeah. Cause usually when you know, if someone has sex with someone else,</v>

17
00:01:04.911 --> 00:01:09.050
the DNA gets mixed. So the DNA is always changing from one generation to,

18
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.000
<v 1>it's always getting jumbled up.</v>

19
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.210
One would think it would be hard to keep track of across time. Yeah,

20
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.940
but and here's what you need to know. For our next segment,

21
00:01:16.941 --> 00:01:20.190
there are patches of DNA which don't change.

22
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.650
The y chromosome is the one of these places.

23
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.250
This is the chromosome that men have that women don't have,

24
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.120
and when a father has a son, he gives his son an exact copy. Yeah,

25
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.540
of his y chromosome, sort of like a xerox.

26
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.630
Then when many years later, the boy has a boy of his own

27
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.870
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

28
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.010
<v 1>thing happens an exact copy of the why</v>

29
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.350
<v 2>on and on and on down the male line. Now,</v>

30
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.460
<v 1>here's where it gets interesting.</v>

31
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.580
Every so often the cellular xerox makes a mistake and tiny mistake.

32
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.801
Sort of like at work.

33
00:01:55.801 --> 00:02:00.210
When you put the paper on the copier and the copy it spits back out at you has a

34
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:04.200
little smudge on it, little speck, maybe some dusks got in there. Who knows?

35
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.800
It's not a big deal. I mean you can still read that text,

36
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:11.370
but this new smudgy copy is in it's way

37
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.253
<v 0>unique.</v>

38
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.960
<v 1>It's no longer just to copy because it's got that Spec on it.</v>

39
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.270
[inaudible] this is where the analogy breaks down a bit.

40
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.110
Granted because a paper with the SPEC is not a very interesting thing,

41
00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:28.111
but a y chromosome with a mutation is useful because geneticists can look at

42
00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:30.220
that little speck,

43
00:02:30.221 --> 00:02:35.221
that little mutation on the y and say that right there that came from one man

44
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.740
somewhere in time, it's a clue.

45
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.460
And since they know that little mutation will get copied in [inaudible],

46
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.730
they know that everyone else who shows up with it is descended from that man.

47
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:49.713
Now this principle,

48
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.030
<v 0>particularly mutation on the y chromosome comes from an individual back in time.</v>

49
00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.010
It brings us to a story that I want to tell you once upon a time a of scientists

50
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:04.780
led by this guy. Yeah, I am Spencer Wells. I am a population geneticists.

51
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:09.640
Got into a Land Rover and headed off to Asia on what they call a blood sampling

52
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:12.550
tour. We set off in April of 90

53
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.700
<v 3>the 98 on a six month odyssey and it was literally four guys and it wasn't just</v>

54
00:03:17.971 --> 00:03:22.860
four guys. So my name is [inaudible]. I'm an Italian researcher. Yeah,

55
00:03:22.861 --> 00:03:25.580
she uh, flew over for about three weeks.

56
00:03:25.581 --> 00:03:29.850
I joined them in Tuscola and she came with us to Kyrgyzstan [inaudible] taking

57
00:03:29.851 --> 00:03:34.560
samples and I'm on the caucuses time out. It's driving all over centrally.

58
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.940
He said 10 hours in Hong Kong from place to place, sleeping and lighten.

59
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.940
10 we sampled, it was a thousand people. It was really an adventure.

60
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.800
So here's what they do. Each village they'd come do,

61
00:03:46.801 --> 00:03:49.890
they'd find out who was in charge and then they'd sit down with him or her.

62
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.470
Describe the project in simple terms.

63
00:03:52.471 --> 00:03:54.770
Basically make sure that we had permission to do the same thing.

64
00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.330
It's kind of an intimate thing they're asking for here,

65
00:03:57.331 --> 00:04:01.770
so they'd have to do a little [inaudible]. Usually a beverage with served,

66
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.390
not alcohol, not coffee,

67
00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.130
they kind of milk that comes from horses.

68
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.350
But is it fermented milk?

69
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.650
They couldn't spit it out because they were offering it to me and they were all

70
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:17.620
smiling, so I really kind of swallowed it and went away before they,

71
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.950
so over this a milky concoction, they'd say to the chief, okay, we're here.

72
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.650
Tell a good story.

73
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.910
<v 0>The history of your people, your family.</v>

74
00:04:29.911 --> 00:04:34.050
Because by looking closely at the DNA in an ordinary blood sample,

75
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.250
we can discover where your ancestors came from, where they went to,

76
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.750
they conquered who conquered them,

77
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.020
or we can go back hundreds of generations and typically most people would

78
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.770
willingly give us blood samples.

79
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.960
What were they looking for exactly, or I guess what were they?

80
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.820
What do they expect to find? Well,

81
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.090
this same group had done this in Europe and when they did it in Europe,

82
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.080
when they took blood from people, they found lots and lots of very distinct,

83
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:05.740
separate families with very separate ancestors. That makes sense.

84
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.290
That's what they were expecting to find in Asia, but that's not what they found.

85
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.870
Any case, Spencer,

86
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.550
it gives Tatyana a batch of the DNA samples almost 2017 it goes back to her lab

87
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:21.670
in London and the goal again was was very kind of open ended.

88
00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:23.560
What are the genetic patterns in Central Asia

89
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.690
that China gets all her DNA,

90
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:32.210
lays it out and begins to investigate and right away something's a little odd.

91
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:33.273
Very, very odd.

92
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.840
I really thought we've made a mistake in sample after sample after sample.

93
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.630
He could see a specific mutation.

94
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.750
And when you got everybody that presented that mutation come from one

95
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.180
individual, sometimes in the past,

96
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.600
meaning all those modern Asian guys from was Becca,

97
00:05:53.601 --> 00:05:56.210
Stan and Kazakhstan and Mongolia and China,

98
00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.320
people who came from different ancient tribes and should have only the most

99
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.260
distant family connections. Weirdly,

100
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.730
they shared a fairly recent great, great, great, great, great, great,

101
00:06:07.731 --> 00:06:12.410
great grandparent. No one ever see anything like this before. No, never.

102
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.260
She asked for her boss to come here.

103
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.580
I'm Chris Tyler Smith and she showed him the data. As soon as we saw that,

104
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:23.270
we knew that that couldn't happen by chance. So low.

105
00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.480
So the first thing she wanted to know was when did this mysterious person,

106
00:06:29.481 --> 00:06:33.530
when did he live? So using some statistical program,

107
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:37.340
she plugged the data into a computer program and asked it to count backwards to

108
00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:41.900
the first moment when the mutation peered in the program saying roughly 1000

109
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:46.220
years, a thousand years ago, give or take 200 years, this person live now.

110
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.330
Now this is interesting.

111
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.460
If you are alive a thousand years ago and you had a son and that son had a son,

112
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.790
so forth, you would have right now about 800 living descendants.

113
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.080
This person,

114
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:02.060
whoever he was has right now like 16 millions of men.

115
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.790
16 million descendants. Yeah, it's a lot. Yes, absolutely.

116
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.113
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

117
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:16.080
<v 0>now here's where it gets interesting, Tatyana. I got herself a map. Yeah.</v>

118
00:07:16.081 --> 00:07:18.510
I had the map of the region and I spread on a map.

119
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.250
The frequency of these linens.

120
00:07:20.251 --> 00:07:24.820
She began putting pins where ever she saw heavy concentrations of the mutation

121
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.550
in Mongolia. Put a pin in Mongolian [inaudible], China's eye barrier. Siberia.

122
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.170
Kazakhstan has exten Pakistan and then she stood back and looked at this map.

123
00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.610
These pins spread all across Asia and she's like, now wait a second.

124
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:43.660
So then you had realized that the spread of this lineage was perfectly matching

125
00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.630
the spread of the Mongol Empire. As soon as she saw it,

126
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.990
they went to Chris and Tatiana said, I said to him, you know Chris,

127
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.280
I think I found gang discount.

128
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:03.700
<v 4>That's pretty interesting.</v>

129
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.633
[inaudible]

130
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:29.460
<v 3>I knew just what I, I studied when I was at high school,</v>

131
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.210
so I didn't really know much about it, but she knew the basics.

132
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:37.770
In the 13th century Gangas Kahn United the tribes of Mongolia into a massive

133
00:08:37.771 --> 00:08:39.810
army and they rode west,

134
00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:43.140
literally killing piles in thousands of men.

135
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:47.620
So that means removing competitors if you kill him and you're keeping

136
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:52.410
[inaudible] Molina and then with all those men and their y chromosomes out of

137
00:08:52.411 --> 00:08:56.140
the way, Gingiss forced himself. I mean this, he's the conqueror,

138
00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:56.973
<v 0>so this is what he gets.</v>

139
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.930
He women having no choice in the matter because that was his privilege in those

140
00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:01.710
days.

141
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:06.710
He was the one picking up the youngest women and keeping them for himself.

142
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.320
<v 6>Jingles undoubtedly had a number of quite a number of sexual partners.</v>

143
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:15.340
We wanted to just be a little careful here. So we called up an expert. Yeah.

144
00:09:15.341 --> 00:09:16.780
My name is Maurice for Sabi,

145
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:21.100
<v 0>a professor of Mongolian history from Columbia University and arranged for</v>

146
00:09:21.101 --> 00:09:23.500
breakfast. I've got a couple of scrambled eggs. Yes,

147
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.380
<v 6>I have read accounts and I don't know how really are where the mangoes would</v>

148
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:33.381
come in conquer territory and there was a save the pretty ones for the boss kind

149
00:09:33.841 --> 00:09:36.480
of rule. Is that true at all? Yes, that's true.

150
00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:41.810
One story is that he was murdered by one of these women who had sex with their

151
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:46.500
chief, placed a knife in her vagina and as they were having sex,

152
00:09:46.501 --> 00:09:49.710
he was stabbed and killed. Whether that's true or not,

153
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.440
it's an interesting story.

154
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:57.570
<v 0>Well, whatever, if gangas did have the power to command any woman,</v>

155
00:09:57.571 --> 00:10:01.230
he wanted an if the dates were right for history and the places were right

156
00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:02.064
geographically,

157
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.850
all the evidence points in the same direction that looks like a dock and it

158
00:10:05.851 --> 00:10:09.170
walks like a duck. You know, the inference was that it was a dock. This was,

159
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.920
this Kangaskhan is y chromosome lineage.

160
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.040
And so 23 scientists from all over the world together announced in the American

161
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:21.060
Journal of human genetics that Gangas Kahn was very probably the most successful

162
00:10:21.061 --> 00:10:25.920
biological father in human history and human history. Yes. Which in all of time,

163
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.100
in all of time. And the thing about this story is it really,

164
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:32.640
really caught people's attention because this is one of those things where you

165
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:37.170
can actually do something about it. You can take those DNA tests. Yes,

166
00:10:37.171 --> 00:10:40.380
I know the DNA test, the swab your mouth, cheeks. Put it in a vile.

167
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:41.640
Send them back to these companies.

168
00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:45.840
I may send you big tell you whether you have Gingiss cons, marker.

169
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.400
How much are these tests? How much about not my, I don't know.

170
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.970
It depends on 300 bucks. 300 hundred bucks. That's it. That's it. For 300 bucks.

171
00:10:53.971 --> 00:10:57.420
I can find out if I'm related to gangs cause yeah, I bet I am.

172
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.270
I bet you're not because his conquest routes ended sort of near Lebanon where

173
00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:05.670
my, where my folks are from. [inaudible] come on,

174
00:11:05.671 --> 00:11:10.520
look at suckers like you who were perfect marks for businesses like

175
00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:15.460
<v 6>yes, we found this restaurant in London. Hello. Welcome. How are you?</v>

176
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.480
The same called shish called go. What? Shish. Yeah.

177
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.610
Shish because for short, for just Kebab,

178
00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:27.690
they announced a major Gingiss con promotion 10 when is had DNA testing done and

179
00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.960
Oxford's find out if they were ancestors of Kangaskhan.

180
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:38.170
This was a very unique and the response was just people came,

181
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.490
there were lines around the block phone call, the phones were ringing all day.

182
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.160
I mean I never thought there would been that interest. I see.

183
00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.270
<v 0>You weren't the only one.</v>

184
00:11:46.271 --> 00:11:50.630
There were a lot of people working under strange illusions like you a lot.

185
00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.930
Let me ask you this though, if I, let's,

186
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.810
I had taken the test and came up positive. I am.

187
00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:00.190
So it seems related to gangs con, does that really mean anything definitively?

188
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.930
I mean, is that marker for sure. Gangs, cons, mark, or do we know that in fact,

189
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:05.860
no,

190
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.400
the only way you ever know for sure that it's anybody's mutation is you got to

191
00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:12.190
go to the body. [inaudible] pluck some DNA from the body,

192
00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:16.930
see if it matches the mutation. So you got to find Gingiss con's body.

193
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.610
Yeah, that would be the ultimate proof.

194
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:27.020
And by the way, there's a lot of people looking, oh my God. Oh,

195
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.070
found a human skull buried in the [inaudible] barrier.

196
00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:36.220
I have been doing this now for going on two eating the half years and we've dug

197
00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:38.950
up a some very nice fellas so far.

198
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:44.070
That guy is he cravats his voice you hear is a direct result of screaming for

199
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:47.790
years. He was a commodities trader in Chicago. Yeah,

200
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.670
I was a warrior of the trading pitch. He got just enough money actually.

201
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:56.380
He made quite a bit of money to sponsor annual summer trips looking for Gangas

202
00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:01.280
cons corpse. Why is he looking for Ganga Scott Valuables? Great wealth.

203
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.840
Cause he knows that for all the sacking and pillaging that the Mongols did back

204
00:13:04.841 --> 00:13:09.370
in the 12 hundreds cheers this day. Not one vigil dagger,

205
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:13.600
that one necklace, not one diamond studded Tiara,

206
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:18.660
which could be identified from the 13th century has ever sugarfish suggesting

207
00:13:19.271 --> 00:13:21.970
that it might be all under the surface of the ground somewhere. Does he?

208
00:13:21.971 --> 00:13:26.200
Just seeing that it all went south with the old man.

209
00:13:26.201 --> 00:13:28.480
So there might be two treasures here.

210
00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.410
Here's the physical treasure and the biological treasure.

211
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.450
Well that's what a scientist,

212
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:39.040
I am a different sort of Genghis Khan man,

213
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:44.220
but you're not going to be able to do a proper DNA search unless the guy like me

214
00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:46.750
find the tomb, Moises, if there is a treasure,

215
00:13:46.751 --> 00:13:49.450
he will happily hand it over to the Mongolian government.

216
00:13:49.451 --> 00:13:52.240
But damn well officials are a little leery excavation for.

217
00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:55.660
So he continues to plead his case and we excavate her camp.

218
00:13:55.661 --> 00:13:59.520
We at g you must say exactly. Must be a hate into the motherfuckers buffalo.

219
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.670
What do you mean no?

220
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:05.200
And he keeps digging up bodies always with the same result. Well

221
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:07.650
<v 4>it's not shingles con,</v>

222
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.910
it's not [inaudible].

223
00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.000
<v 0>The problem is nobody knows where Gangas Kahn is buried.</v>

224
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.640
They don't even know if he was buried.

225
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:21.750
They don't even know if there's any place for things.

226
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.980
<v 6>Define, uh, it appears unlikely.</v>

227
00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:29.880
Professor the savvy says no looking for gangs. This is a, I don't know,

228
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.100
he died in 12,

229
00:14:31.101 --> 00:14:35.210
27 and they had no tradition of tumor culture at that point.

230
00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:37.640
The body was just left word.

231
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.540
So does that mean we'll never know.

232
00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:47.200
There may be a way out of this Gingiss con he had a grandson who bla con,

233
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:51.110
<v 0>a famous emperor of China.</v>

234
00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.260
COUPLA has the same exact mutation that his grandpa had. That's the nature of

235
00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:00.480
<v 6>yes, and I think the more likely discovery will be of Coogler cons. Joe,</v>

236
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:05.060
why not look for coop? Where is [inaudible] comes buddy,

237
00:15:05.061 --> 00:15:05.894
would you get,

238
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.850
well we know the stated in the sources that is somewhere in Mongolia when it is

239
00:15:10.851 --> 00:15:14.480
discovered, uh, it will be a real bonanza. I you talked to Maria around,

240
00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:16.370
I mean it seems to me you can on the funds that you idiot,

241
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:20.180
you're looking for the wrong guy. Well wait,

242
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.530
<v 0>I'm going to cut you off. Morris or Sabby is going to say,</v>

243
00:15:24.531 --> 00:15:27.020
I'm looking for the wrong guy. You know it's true.

244
00:15:27.021 --> 00:15:30.160
He happens to Coupla con is the, his, his, his pitch speakers.

245
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.200
He wrote a book on Coupla Con. Okay. Okay.

246
00:15:33.201 --> 00:15:38.060
The point is both gangas and Coupla con have the same genetic markers.

247
00:15:38.061 --> 00:15:39.680
So if you find either one, either one,

248
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.370
we'll do pluck a hair from either guy's body, look up the DNA,

249
00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:47.270
and then you will know for sure if gangas and his family not only conquered the

250
00:15:47.271 --> 00:15:51.860
ancient world but fathered the modern world one day we will know

251
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:54.913
<v 7>[inaudible].</v>

252
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:58.550
<v 8>And I guess the neat thing about all of these tails is you know,</v>

253
00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:02.150
you think when you're going to tell a story from the past that the sensible

254
00:16:02.151 --> 00:16:06.090
place to go is you go to the library, you go to a fossil, you go to were ruined.

255
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.940
But the truth is you can go anywhere.

256
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:12.260
The blood coursing through your veins tells you, I have a story for you.

257
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.140
Same with a little bit of garbage that sits next to an ancient shoe.

258
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.110
You plucked a piece of paper and Jesus is talking to you. Literally.

259
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.540
There are clues about the past everywhere,

260
00:16:20.541 --> 00:16:23.750
and if it's a knock on your door and you decide to open the door and take a

261
00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:28.700
look, who knows what you will find it. Who knows where you will go. By the way,
