/ Hey, Google Developers
Live, I'm Zachary Cohn.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.560
I work with an organization
called Startup Weekend.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.300
And I'm here today
with Don Dodge.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.600
And we're here to give you pitch
advice for startups and

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.660
entrepreneurs.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.830
So Don is a developer
and startup

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.190
advocate here at Google.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.510
And he's a veteran of five
different startups, so he's

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.060
had some experience pitching.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.340
And he's going to be here to
help us with that today.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.945
So Don, are all pitches
the same, or are

00:00:29.945 --> 00:00:31.035
there different types?

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:33.690
DON DODGE: No, there are
different types of pitches.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.200
There's the elevator pitch,
which is the shortest one.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.500
And the elevator pitch is used
to get the next meeting with

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.930
an investor or with a partner.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.720
The next pitch is usually about
30 minutes long, and

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.200
that goes into more of what the
product is, how it works,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.830
what problem it solves.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.560
And then there's an hour-long
pitch, which is for investors

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.220
where you go deep
into the product

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.080
and all of the details.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.360
So I think today we want to talk
about the elevator pitch

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.810
and why that's important.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:07.300
ZACHARY COHN: Cool.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.020
Well, tell me about the
elevator pitch.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.781
What makes a good one?

00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:15.300
DON DODGE: An elevator pitch
should be five minutes or less

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.290
and it should cover
just a few topics.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.470
What you want to do is get
their head nodding yes.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.640
If you don't see their head
nodding yes, stop, because

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.610
you're probably not going
to get very far.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.540
And you need to redo
your pitch.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.980
So the very first thing that you
do in an elevator pitch is

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.080
explain what is the problem
you're solving.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.600
And the investor or the partner
or the customer, needs

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.650
to identify with that problem.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.470
If they're not interested in
the problem you're solving,

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.160
then they're not interested at
all in your solution to it.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.160
So one big mistake that a lot
of entrepreneurs make is, in

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.310
their elevator pitch, they
immediately jump into their

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.360
solution and why it's better.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.510
And if you haven't gotten the
person to nod their head and

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.090
understand what the problem
is, there's no way they're

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.800
going to be interested
in your solution.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.330
So that's the number
one thing.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.760
Start with what problem
you solve.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.305
Try to use a real-life example
of a real person that you

00:02:26.305 --> 00:02:28.810
know, or a real life
example of the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.660
problem that you're solving.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.030
The second thing you do
is talk about why is

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.340
this problem important.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.350
Why are you solving
this problem?

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.320
And again, if you have real-life
experience where

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.670
you've experienced this
problem, and you're

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.130
passionate about it.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.900
Then that's going to get the
credence that says, OK, this

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.020
guy knows what he's
talking about.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.490
I'm going to listen.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.170
So those are the first
two things.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.080
Start with the problem.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.860
Start with, why this problem
is important And what

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.750
experience you have
in solving it.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.620
If you don't have experience in
solving the problem, then

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.960
they're going to say, well,
yeah, interesting problem, but

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.580
you don't know anything
about it.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.835
So start with those things.

00:03:15.835 --> 00:03:16.980
ZACHARY COHN: Interesting.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.025
So what are some good ways
to practice pitching?

00:03:20.025 --> 00:03:22.680
DON DODGE: Well, you don't want
to practice on the people

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.710
who are going to
give you money.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.260
You want to have practice
with other people.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.710
So practice with your friends
first because they'll be kind.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.020
Then practice with people you've
worked with in the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.070
past, or people who are in
this industry and kind of

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:42.490
understand the problem, and see
if you can get them to nod

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.120
their heads.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.934
Then move on to investors
and that kind of thing.

00:03:46.934 --> 00:03:48.362
ZACHARY COHN: Cool.

00:03:48.362 --> 00:03:50.100
Well, how would you
structure a pitch.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.880
We talked a little bit about
that, but could we go into

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.920
more detail about the different
things that you

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.940
should have in, what you should
say first, what you

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.335
should say later on?

00:03:57.335 --> 00:03:59.430
DON DODGE: So there are
three main things

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.570
in an elevator pitch.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.720
The problem that you're solving,
your solution, and

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.190
the team that you have that
can solve that problem.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.620
Those three things.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.900
So again, start with the
problem you're solving.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.260
If they nod their head like,
yeah, I understand that

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.540
problem, I've seen that, then
move on to your solution.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.649
What is your solution?

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:24.710
Why is it better than what
exists out there today?

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.820
And then close with the team,
and why this team is capable

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.460
of putting together
this solution.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.980
If you cover those three things
in a minute to a minute

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.760
and a half, now you have
permission to go deeper.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.420
If you don't see them nodding
their head at those three

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.265
things, stop and move
on to the next one.

00:04:43.265 --> 00:04:44.515
ZACHARY COHN: Great.
