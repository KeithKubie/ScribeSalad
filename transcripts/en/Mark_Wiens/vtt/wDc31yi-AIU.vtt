00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.750
- Hey, everyone, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.710
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in the
beautiful Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.310
This is day two of our trip,

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.130
and today is gonna be another food tour.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.670
We're gonna eat at some
of the best places,

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.260
but then, tonight, for dinner,
is gonna be a highlight

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.140
where we have a Choyhana,
which is a social gathering.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.795
Guaranteed, it includes
some incredible food.

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:21.540
But it's then, just a time
of fellowship and food

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.210
and learning about culture, and so,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.230
it's gonna be an amazing
day, and I'm gonna share

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.140
everything with you in this video,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.570
and we have actually just
arrived for breakfast.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.733
This is the spot.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.814
I can smell breakfast!

00:00:35.814 --> 00:00:38.397
(upbeat music)

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.648
- The droplets of happiness.

00:00:42.648 --> 00:00:43.481
(laughs)

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:45.894
There's no sadness, you see,
you eat, you're so happy.

00:00:45.894 --> 00:00:49.280
So the tears of happiness
will shatter through our eyes.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.381
- Tears of joy. (laughs)

00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:53.453
Oh, gonna come back in this area.

00:00:54.334 --> 00:00:55.780
- Oh, and this--
- [Mark] Oh, I can smell it.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.133
- Yeah, you can smell it and they're

00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.490
about to start doing it.
- Oh wow.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.430
- So as you can see

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.930
one, two, three,
- Oh wow.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.270
- You can feel the heat
just radiating off of them,

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.390
and you can smell the aroma,
of just the threshold.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.641
There's a fresh, fresh batch right there.

00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:12.891
(clinking)

00:01:14.036 --> 00:01:16.317
Slapping it onto the side of the oven.

00:01:16.317 --> 00:01:18.427
As it starts to cook,
because of the lamb fat

00:01:18.427 --> 00:01:21.180
and the ingredients,
it starts to droop down

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.744
in the oven and that's where
it gets the teardrop shape.

00:01:24.744 --> 00:01:26.575
(chopping on board)

00:01:26.575 --> 00:01:27.408
- Hello, hello.

00:01:27.408 --> 00:01:28.241
(man speaking in foreign language)

00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:31.410
(people laughing)

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.593
(slaps)

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:35.300
(man speaking in foreign language)

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.850
- They actually have
their own butchery here.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.736
The freshness of the meat.

00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:42.344
(Man speaking in foreign language)

00:01:42.344 --> 00:01:44.927
(upbeat music)

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:53.435
(slapping on dough)

00:01:53.435 --> 00:01:57.060
(water splashing)

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.450
- They sprinkle it with water,

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.090
like shoving a bunch of water,
a thing that will sort of

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.510
help steam it first before they

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.150
crank up the heat, and
create the golden edge,

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.153
and that will like, melt
all that lamb together.

00:02:08.153 --> 00:02:09.194
(man speaking in foreign language)

00:02:09.194 --> 00:02:11.444
(scraping)

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.260
- I wanna ask you just one thing,

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.134
just call it samsa, okay?

00:02:16.134 --> 00:02:16.967
- Samsa.
- Not samosa

00:02:16.967 --> 00:02:18.725
- It's Uzbek's national samsa.

00:02:18.725 --> 00:02:19.558
- Samsa.

00:02:19.558 --> 00:02:20.391
- Okay?

00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:21.224
- Okay, sure!

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:22.057
- S-A-M-S-A

00:02:22.057 --> 00:02:23.290
- S-A-M--
- Okay?

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.580
- Sure, sure.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.880
- [Bekruz] Everything has turned up.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.504
- Okay, see you!

00:02:27.504 --> 00:02:28.337
And then, they have kind of a patio-garden

00:02:28.337 --> 00:02:30.160
section for seating.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.270
Bekruz had to just run
an errand real fast.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.790
But we're gonna, yeah, we
got a plate of them there.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.011
They're almost like
blooming, like a flower.

00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:39.738
So what you have to do, is shake it,

00:02:39.738 --> 00:02:41.077
(laughs) oh you can feel the
meat rattling around in there.

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:43.260
It's like the fat mixes with the meat,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.060
and kinda coats the bready wrapper.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.437
Oh wow, that you can feel
how crispy that is too.

00:02:48.437 --> 00:02:49.522
(laughs)

00:02:49.522 --> 00:02:51.772
(crunches)

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.050
- It's even better than
the yesterday, right?

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.650
- It's so good!

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.110
The bread is perfectly like crispy.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.320
It's like crispy all over.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.080
Actually I didn't even reach the meat,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.800
on that first bite, but
the bread is incredible!

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.800
A little bit of this chili powder on top,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.220
or in the center, fill it into the pocket,

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.950
kinda let it shake around, and also some

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.919
of this like tomato, it's like a tomato.

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:15.752
- Yeah

00:03:15.752 --> 00:03:18.400
- Like it's gonna be nice and spicy.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.065
It's like a tomatoey chili, maybe?

00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:21.580
See, is that good?
- Yeah.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.715
- Or you put a lot in?

00:03:22.715 --> 00:03:23.548
- No, it's good.

00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:25.076
- Okay, just to try it first.

00:03:25.076 --> 00:03:26.464
(upbeat music)

00:03:26.464 --> 00:03:28.177
(crunches)

00:03:28.177 --> 00:03:30.311
(child shouting in the background)

00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:32.894
(upbeat music)

00:03:33.786 --> 00:03:34.619
- Wow!

00:03:36.848 --> 00:03:38.620
It's so unbelievably good!

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.090
I really experienced the
mix of the fat and the meat.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.530
The ratio in that bite.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.800
The onions are but then
for spices, mostly,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.338
if you've said, it's just cumin
and black pepper in there.

00:03:49.338 --> 00:03:52.040
(crunches)

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.203
It's like the greatest meat
pie, maybe I've ever had.

00:03:56.554 --> 00:03:59.972
The bread, the dough, the
wrap is just perfectly crispy.

00:03:59.972 --> 00:04:02.555
(upbeat music)

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.673
All that feels so right!

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.870
I ate three, back-to-back, to-back.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.570
Without even like, without
even thinking about it,

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.160
without even knowing that I

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.570
actually ate three of them,

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.370
and I wanted to eat like
three more, back-to-back,

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.460
but I, I resisted, because there's

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.540
gonna be a lot more food today,

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.173
but those are unbelievably good.

00:04:24.173 --> 00:04:26.756
(upbeat music)

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.240
Right across the street
from the samsa place,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.220
is a mosque, made of white marble,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.360
it just shines in the sunshine,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.110
and then just the,

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.180
the articulate design.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.013
- [Bekruz] Okay.

00:04:43.013 --> 00:04:45.300
- It's really beautiful,
but just the, the contrast

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.763
of the white and the blue tilework.

00:04:49.046 --> 00:04:51.629
(upbeat music)

00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:56.670
- You gonna say I'm
gonna need one portion,

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.320
you say by kilograms, you
say, "We want two kgs of that,

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.386
and two kgs of this.".

00:05:01.386 --> 00:05:03.320
So, hopefully you're gonna enjoy it.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.260
- Now, we're on our way to lunch.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.294
We're gonna have some meat.

00:05:07.294 --> 00:05:10.230
(upbeat music)

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.990
And there's a car wash at the bottom,

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.420
I think around the world, if you,

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.750
if there's a restaurant
where there's a carwash

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.393
in the same parking lot,
you know it's gonna be

00:05:19.393 --> 00:05:22.390
a local, properly good
spot in the restaurant.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.052
I think it's in this complex
right here on the top floor.

00:05:26.052 --> 00:05:27.771
(man speaking in foreign language)

00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:28.604
(sizzling)

00:05:28.604 --> 00:05:32.687
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.862
- You can see from the outside.

00:05:35.862 --> 00:05:36.872
- [Bekruz] Okay, okay.

00:05:36.872 --> 00:05:39.420
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.154
- We're heading upstairs,
to have a meat feast.

00:05:42.154 --> 00:05:46.290
(man and woman speaking
in foreign language)

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.710
Okay, so we're sitting down,

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.410
they have multiple dining rooms.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.290
The first section, and then
we came to another section,

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.880
they have an outside section,
but we chose this section,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.130
because they have this
cool bucket seats sofas,

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.560
that we're gonna sit on,
and this is definitely

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.730
a meal where I think I'm
almost positive that,

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.240
after we eat, we're gonna
need to, to lean back.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.120
So I'm, I'm planning ahead here.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.410
- One day, I was passing by,
and I saw a lot of people

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.858
in there, I don't know, a lot of people

00:06:10.858 --> 00:06:13.040
that standing and eating,
you ask them if they're

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.580
standing and eating, if it's
worth standing any of that,

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.920
something must be good.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.753
- Yes.

00:06:17.753 --> 00:06:21.190
- And that's how I discovered,
I came here and I saw 'em,

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.603
a lot of the older meat,
I'm like, what is that?

00:06:24.614 --> 00:06:25.447
(Mark laughs)

00:06:25.447 --> 00:06:26.290
Like that kind of meat, okay?

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.850
- So, that's just like
custom, for every single

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.117
time you drink tea.
- Yeah.

00:06:30.117 --> 00:06:31.762
Have a little tea ceremony.

00:06:31.762 --> 00:06:34.147
(child mumbling)

00:06:34.147 --> 00:06:34.980
- This is just an appetitizer.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.810
This is just to get stomach juices flowing

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.500
before the main meat dish comes.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.993
Smells so good, you can smell
that sizzling fat, the onions.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.173
- The smell even better than taste.

00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:48.880
(Mark laughs)

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.400
- You can eat it right
off the middle skewer,

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.800
just look at these beauties.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.993
So soft and tender, and so,

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.249
so juicy, like, you actually
barely need to chew.

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:04.527
(child exclaims)

00:07:04.527 --> 00:07:07.150
(people exclaiming)

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.370
- Did we get one kilo?

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.380
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we
ordered one kilo lamb,

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.620
and one kilo fries next
to it, yeah meat fried

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.110
on it's own fat and they use
this fat for a long time.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.943
- Okay.

00:07:19.943 --> 00:07:20.776
- They keep it, they don't really,

00:07:20.776 --> 00:07:23.010
- So the flavor--
- Yeah, flavors keep on--

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.046
- brewing away in the fat.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:07:25.046 --> 00:07:26.271
- And then they fried the fries--

00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:27.300
- Exactly.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.237
- in that same fat.

00:07:29.237 --> 00:07:32.640
(upbeat music)

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.807
(chewing)

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.213
- Nice.

00:07:38.213 --> 00:07:39.046
- Oh wow.

00:07:40.346 --> 00:07:42.470
- It's so, it's so me,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.740
it's so perfectly salty.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.950
It's really tender but at the same time,

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.195
it's almost like, thick, and
almost like, bouncy in texture.

00:07:49.195 --> 00:07:50.028
- Yeah.

00:07:50.028 --> 00:07:52.611
(upbeat music)

00:07:54.798 --> 00:07:55.631
Just like,

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.840
just such succulent nuggets of meat.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.330
Sprinkle on some vinegar to the salad,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:02.353
to the onion salad,

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.121
oh, that's like a dill
and chili-infused vinegar.

00:08:07.121 --> 00:08:11.277
- Yeah. It looks like, it's
not Pepsi though (laughs).

00:08:11.277 --> 00:08:12.777
- Try some onions.

00:08:15.274 --> 00:08:18.210
Yeah, yeah the onions, they
provide that refreshing touch,

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.700
they kinda cut the oil, and
also give you that crunch.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.813
Fries, and again cooked in the lamb fat.

00:08:25.206 --> 00:08:27.611
(chewing)

00:08:27.611 --> 00:08:28.444
(laughs)

00:08:28.444 --> 00:08:30.510
- These are the perfect fries,

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.920
they are so mashy inside,
and crunchy outside.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.760
- Yeah, they're so flavorful,
they are as flavorful

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.290
as that lamb, because it taste like lamb.

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:38.559
You can immediately taste the difference.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:39.392
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:39.392 --> 00:08:42.690
Like, vegetable oil, would not do,

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:44.363
would not do for these fries.

00:08:44.363 --> 00:08:46.946
(upbeat music)

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:54.181
Wow, (laughs) the combination of the lamb,

00:08:54.181 --> 00:08:57.891
and the fries, that's just,
it's actually dangerously tasty.

00:08:57.891 --> 00:08:58.724
(laughs)

00:08:58.724 --> 00:09:02.977
Like, I mean, it looks big, and it is big,

00:09:02.977 --> 00:09:06.010
like one person could eat this all.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:08.670
- And don't feel like
sick, yeah, you won't sick.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.151
- And feel really good, at
least while you're eating it.

00:09:11.151 --> 00:09:13.734
(upbeat music)

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:18.030
Even just a little bit of salt,

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.233
or none, it refreshes,
with that heavy meat.

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.800
Now would be the time in the meal,

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.700
the point in the meal
where I utilize the sofa

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.040
to the maximum, and just sit back,

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:30.790
sipping on tea to wash it all down.

00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:35.560
The car wash pit stop,
(laughs) that's the name.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.890
So yeah, definitely, get your car washed,

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.680
or if you don't have a
car, just skip the car wash

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.110
and go straight to the restaurant.

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:44.500
But man, that's crazy good food,

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.350
and those mini satay
kebabs were, were insane.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.610
But that meat, oh man, if you love meat.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.140
We're on our way now to
a place that, thought of,

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.440
as we're, as we're eating.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.727
- Yeah, as we were eating, I was like,

00:09:55.727 --> 00:09:57.250
"Okay, we need to go there."

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:59.927
- Bekruz, Bekruz was like,
"This is the place we

00:09:59.927 --> 00:10:01.960
"have to go.", we almost forgot about it.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.970
We have to go right now,
so, we're on our way.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.060
It's a little on the outskirts
of town, but it's another,

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.583
it's another meat stop.

00:10:08.637 --> 00:10:11.220
(upbeat music)

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:14.573
Five finger.

00:10:14.573 --> 00:10:15.982
- Five finger barbeque.

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:17.937
- [Mark] Five finger barbeque.

00:10:17.937 --> 00:10:18.770
- Hello!

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:20.220
On a spur of the moment, change of plans,

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.554
while we, we were gonna head out of town,

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:23.760
to eat at a meat spot,
that Kruz knows about,

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.810
but then we decided to
actually stop by a place

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:28.600
to eat the five finger kebab first then.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:36.150
And it's fat meat, fat
meat, we're coming back

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.140
to the kitchen, it's about

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.127
thrilled out on your grill, say, "Ah!".

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.270
I've had quite a few
different kebabs in my life,

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:46.850
but I've never had, the five,
the Uzbek five finger kebabs.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.472
I'm very excited for this one.

00:10:48.472 --> 00:10:50.639
(sizzles)

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.500
It is an entire hand of a kebab.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.263
- I can do, like that, right?

00:11:03.263 --> 00:11:08.160
- Oh yeah, (speaks in foreign language).

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:08.993
- Yeah, sure.

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:12.640
So this is the Tashkent specialty.

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.403
- Yup, yup, Tashkent specialty.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:16.995
- Logan! (laughs)

00:11:16.995 --> 00:11:21.210
- (speaks in foreign
language) You never go hungry.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.447
- The hand.

00:11:22.447 --> 00:11:23.590
(men speaking in foreign language)

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:24.650
- X-men, X-men.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.690
- Wolverine (laughs), Logan (laughs).

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.940
- It's almost like a steak,
but then at the bottom

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.510
of all the skewers is a bone, that you,

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.910
like skewer through, so
they're all still attached.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.353
I got one chunk of fat, one chunk of meat.

00:11:39.264 --> 00:11:41.347
(laughs)

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:47.607
Oh, that fat, that fat
just melts (laughs).

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:56.390
- As locals, we pre-approve
it, it is what it is, yes.

00:11:56.556 --> 00:11:59.070
(speaks in foreign language), it's best.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.440
- What is it called in Uzbek?

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.520
- Bish-ban-ja

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.353
- All that fat, it's crazy.

00:12:03.353 --> 00:12:05.409
- Eat it with onions, yeah.

00:12:05.409 --> 00:12:08.076
(child playing)

00:12:09.302 --> 00:12:10.440
- Come on, lay down.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.096
- It's so good!

00:12:12.096 --> 00:12:14.653
That is, that's a lamb candy.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.370
It's down the road, to like
right next to where we've just

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:22.500
had the five finger kebabs,
there's a place that serves

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:27.380
these donuts, kinda like fried,
fried like dumplings donuts,

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:31.113
but filled with a mix of
organs, organ meat innards!

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:34.813
They also serve the tomato sauce.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:37.143
- Alright.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:39.130
- Oh yeah, they are hot.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.120
They are like over-sized egg shapes.

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.203
(laughs)

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:47.620
- Is it good?

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:49.580
I've never tried one (laughs).

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.413
- Really?

00:12:50.413 --> 00:12:51.246
- No, I'm joking.

00:12:51.246 --> 00:12:53.440
- It's like a donut,
but like a savory donut,

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.120
and then you do like have
the different texture

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.122
of all the organ meat in there.

00:12:57.122 --> 00:12:59.705
(upbeat music)

00:13:16.367 --> 00:13:19.080
Yeah, I was dozing off on the way here,

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.050
that was like a 15, or 20 minute ride,

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.060
but, we've had so much food today,

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.720
I was dozing off in the
car, but we made it.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.610
As soon as you step out of the
van, you can smell the meat.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:29.543
Oh yeah, this looks like a spot!

00:13:31.165 --> 00:13:32.536
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:13:32.536 --> 00:13:36.453
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:13:37.386 --> 00:13:38.931
(chewing)

00:13:38.931 --> 00:13:41.181
- (laughs)

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.310
Oh, It's so good.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.610
- So basically, it's a tandoori meat,

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.440
with a juniper tree.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.180
- Oh man, I taste that
spice, that herb on that.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.629
- It is a juniper tree.
- It's a juniper.

00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:54.920
- Yeah, yeah, we call it "ar-char",

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.613
so gives that, little odor.

00:13:58.767 --> 00:13:59.713
- And taste.

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:02.163
(Mark speaks in foreign language)

00:14:02.163 --> 00:14:04.280
- Actually, this is like an
entire little market here.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.110
Oh, there's like a, a
bunch of different food

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:07.360
that you can choose from.

00:14:09.527 --> 00:14:13.860
(people speaks in foreign language)

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:18.610
A bubbling vat of cow
feet, just bubbling away,

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.710
you can see that collagen,
just juicing, and just like,

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:24.740
it's thick and so he
just sliced a piece of,

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.666
it's very wobbly, this
is the cow, like gelatin.

00:14:28.666 --> 00:14:31.200
(chewing)

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.198
Oh yeah

00:14:32.198 --> 00:14:33.031
- (laughs)

00:14:33.031 --> 00:14:34.440
- It tastes like, like tendon!

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.820
That's cow foot jelly, wow!

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.727
(women speaking in foreign language)

00:14:39.727 --> 00:14:43.043
- I asked them to cut you a little slice.

00:14:43.043 --> 00:14:44.360
(women speaking in foreign language)

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.484
- What's the name of this sausage?

00:14:45.484 --> 00:14:46.317
- Haz-sef.

00:14:46.317 --> 00:14:49.260
- Haz-sef, like a blood
sausage, but there's organs

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.810
in it, there's rice and there's
chunks of fat, it's jiggly.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:52.643
- It's jiggly.

00:14:52.643 --> 00:14:53.499
- It's very jiggly.

00:14:53.499 --> 00:14:54.570
- Let's go for it.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:55.909
- Let's go for it.

00:14:55.909 --> 00:14:58.220
(chewing)

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.670
- Wow.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:00.750
- Wow.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.610
- Wow, that's pretty hardcore.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:04.940
That's like, it's really good though.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.118
- Two flavors, cannot
concentrate on one of them.

00:15:08.118 --> 00:15:08.951
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:15:08.951 --> 00:15:09.784
(woman speaks in foreign language)

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:10.930
- And then a fried potato.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.910
Oh, it's really good.

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:16.743
Deep fried.

00:15:16.743 --> 00:15:20.400
Snacking paradise, there's
just like pans full of chicken,

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.710
and lamb legs, and potatoes, and sausage.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:24.750
Man, this is beautiful.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.854
Oh, and the cow foot,
which we already sampled.

00:15:27.854 --> 00:15:29.094
(speaks in foreign language)

00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:30.800
(woman speaks in foreign language)

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.030
There's like an oily sauce, it's a dry,

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:37.292
like dry spice rubbed to
it, but at the same time--

00:15:37.292 --> 00:15:40.027
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:15:40.027 --> 00:15:41.204
- (speaks in foreign
language), Oh, another potato,

00:15:41.204 --> 00:15:42.037
(speaks in foreign language).

00:15:42.037 --> 00:15:44.870
This one is more like
a, feels a little more,

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:45.943
like juicy.

00:15:47.212 --> 00:15:50.170
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:51.770
- Uncle just handed me a pickle.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.883
Yeah, that's great!

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.058
(speaks in foreign language)

00:15:57.058 --> 00:16:01.308
(woman speaks in foreign language)

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.230
And by the way, this is a 24 hour market,

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:06.510
you can come here 24 hours a day,

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:09.003
it's on the side of the
high way, really good meat.

00:16:09.003 --> 00:16:13.440
They're so friendly,
that's a very cool spot.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.800
And it's just places
like that in Uzbekistan,

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:20.140
where the culture, where the generosity,

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.017
and kindness of people just shines.

00:16:23.017 --> 00:16:25.600
(upbeat music)

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.870
Can you quickly tell
us, what is a Choyhona?

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:38.130
- Yeah, yeah, Choyhona is quite a culture,

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.330
we can call it like a gentlemen's club--

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.163
- Okay.
- Usually,

00:16:41.163 --> 00:16:42.177
we engage it with a friend,

00:16:42.177 --> 00:16:44.070
and we can discuss some issues,

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:46.200
and they can bring their own ingredients,

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.140
and they are relaxing and chats,

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.470
and they cook the meal.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:50.310
But at the same time--

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.510
- So typically, there's
not, it's not a restaurant,

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:53.343
- It's not a restaurant, no, no, no.

00:16:53.343 --> 00:16:54.920
- But they do prepare food.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:55.825
- Yeah, it's like a restaurant,

00:16:55.825 --> 00:16:56.658
- And you can bring--
- Yeah,

00:16:56.658 --> 00:16:57.491
it's like a restaurant,
restaurant service.

00:16:57.491 --> 00:16:59.213
We're here for a very special dish.

00:16:59.213 --> 00:17:00.046
- Okay.

00:17:00.046 --> 00:17:02.622
- This restaurant is very
well known for oxtail.

00:17:02.622 --> 00:17:03.455
- (laughs)

00:17:03.455 --> 00:17:04.742
- Yeah. So it's very exotic--

00:17:04.742 --> 00:17:05.640
- Okay.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.479
- Even for Uzbek people.

00:17:06.479 --> 00:17:07.312
- Okay.

00:17:07.312 --> 00:17:08.145
- So, let's give it a try!

00:17:08.145 --> 00:17:10.323
- This is like a palace-looking place.

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:12.740
- Mark--
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:13.953
- Hello.
- [Mark] Hello

00:17:13.953 --> 00:17:14.786
- How are you?

00:17:14.786 --> 00:17:16.030
- [Mark] Good, how are you.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.333

00:17:17.333 --> 00:17:20.859
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:22.700
Oh there goes a plate a
food, but this is beautiful.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.363
You've got this inner courtyard,

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.523
a huge private, like cabana rooms.

00:17:28.477 --> 00:17:30.680
Already, the table is filled with food,

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.040
there's fruit, there's some meat dishes,

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.080
and some cheeses, and drinks, and then,

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.180
you can already tell it's
just gonna be a feast.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.520
The piles of fruit, there's
a platter of horse sausage,

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.910
there's some cheese,
there's like sculptures

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:47.980
of vegetables and herbs, a tree of herbs,

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.128
and then just the display,
like the community,

00:17:51.128 --> 00:17:54.680
the social aspect of it, it's beautiful,

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.230
and something like I've never seen before.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:00.140
My first time breaking the Uzbek bread.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.320
Is it, is there a method
you should do it though?

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.749
- [Man] No. Do what you feel like.

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:03.660
- Just break it?
- [Man] Yeah.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.493
- And then you have to--

00:18:04.493 --> 00:18:06.150
- [Man] To the chance
that it's comfortable

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:07.650
to have for one person.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:08.483
- [Man] Yeah!

00:18:08.483 --> 00:18:10.284
- Perfect, hand-held chunk and you can

00:18:10.284 --> 00:18:12.017
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:18:12.017 --> 00:18:13.597
- [Man] Yeah, you can put it--

00:18:13.597 --> 00:18:14.970
- Put it across the table?

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:15.911
- [Man] Yeah.

00:18:15.911 --> 00:18:17.580
(upbeat music)

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:18.413
- Thank you.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:27.263
- Hello.

00:18:27.263 --> 00:18:28.102
- Hello, nice to meet you.

00:18:28.102 --> 00:18:28.935
- Nice to meet you too
(speaks in foreign language).

00:18:30.193 --> 00:18:32.068
(men speaking in foreign language)

00:18:32.068 --> 00:18:34.651
(upbeat music)

00:18:37.913 --> 00:18:39.762
- [Man] (mumbles) soup (speaks
in foreign language) drink.

00:18:39.762 --> 00:18:40.595
- Traditional rice soup.

00:18:40.595 --> 00:18:41.428
- Mas-ta-va.

00:18:41.428 --> 00:18:42.613
- Mas-ta-va.

00:18:42.613 --> 00:18:44.221
- Yes, Mas-ta-va.

00:18:44.221 --> 00:18:46.971
(spoon clinking)

00:18:48.334 --> 00:18:50.960
- Oh, you can really taste
the carrots in there,

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.710
and also the dill, and
also there's bits of meat

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.280
mixed within the rice,
and you can add a little

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.980
of that cream to the soup as well.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.020
Oh yeah, that thickens it
up, that makes it a little,

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.410
that kind of soury,
yoghurty taste to that.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.803
Okay, next up, the samsa course.

00:19:10.001 --> 00:19:13.249
This is a giant platter,
and check out these,

00:19:13.249 --> 00:19:17.480
they are both, there's two
sides, they're like little twins.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.287
One is vegetarian side, one is meat,

00:19:19.287 --> 00:19:21.450
and I'm not totally sure,
which one is the, the meat,

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:23.200
which one is the
vegetable, but we will just

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.391
take a bit and find out.

00:19:24.391 --> 00:19:26.641
(crunches)

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.270
I got the meat first.

00:19:31.751 --> 00:19:35.850
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.160
- Okay, next up, for the delicacy,

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.030
which is a horse sausage,
it's called cas-zian.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.230
And you have to take off this skin,

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:44.447
and there's always, that's
the back right there,

00:19:44.447 --> 00:19:47.140
the little chunk of white horse fat.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:51.713
But then, it's like a salty,
preserved, horse sausage.

00:19:59.019 --> 00:19:59.919
Wow, it's so good,

00:20:01.611 --> 00:20:04.440
it's so, it's so rich and succulent.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.552
And yet, that fat, it's like meat butter.

00:20:07.552 --> 00:20:09.785
And it has like been salt adhered to it.

00:20:09.785 --> 00:20:11.072
- Wow! (laughs)

00:20:11.072 --> 00:20:12.469
- (laughs)

00:20:12.469 --> 00:20:15.920
- (laughs) Just messing.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.610
- We're gonna share a pear together,

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:20.760
he has organized this entire Choyhana,

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.550
the food, all of us gathering us together,

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.770
and so, I want to say a huge thank you!

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.270
It's a huge honor to
have this opportunity,

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:33.310
and to experience this
part of Uzbek culture

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.600
and hospitality, and it's an honor.

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.484
Thank you!

00:20:37.484 --> 00:20:38.317
- Thank you.

00:20:38.317 --> 00:20:40.900
(upbeat music)

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.440
- We're gonna go back to the kitchen now,

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.873
where they're gonna prepare
the main dish, the oxtail.

00:20:46.873 --> 00:20:47.706
(upbeat music)

00:20:47.706 --> 00:20:48.817
- [Mark] Yeah.

00:20:48.817 --> 00:20:51.400
(upbeat music)

00:21:02.567 --> 00:21:04.167
- The entire oxtail,
which has been cooked,

00:21:04.167 --> 00:21:06.980
and braised in its own
juices for over four hours,

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.640
that smells unbelievable,
that's like soupy!

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.200
From that fat and that
marrow that's cooked out.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.680
And, that was the kitchen,
now we're going back

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.404
to the table to eat the main course!

00:21:17.404 --> 00:21:19.718
(men speaking in foreign language)

00:21:19.718 --> 00:21:23.603
- It takes five hours
for, approx five hours.

00:21:23.603 --> 00:21:26.947
- Like a baby skin, you
know, we call it baby skin.

00:21:26.947 --> 00:21:27.985
- (laughs) Baby skin.

00:21:27.985 --> 00:21:29.140
- We call it baby skin.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.940
(men laughing)

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.417
(men speaking in foreign
language and laughing).

00:21:34.417 --> 00:21:35.350
- Oh wow.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:37.433
(laughs)

00:21:40.463 --> 00:21:42.910
- Oh wow. It's just falling apart,

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.910
and there's so much fat, and
they say you gotta eat it

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:50.300
really fast, because it
will freeze in the cold air.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.830
Look at the tenderness,
that's almost insane.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:54.670
You almost cannot even use a fork,

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.893
because it just barely even pokes!

00:21:58.557 --> 00:22:00.319
(upbeat music)

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:02.402
(laughs)

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:06.793
Woah!

00:22:08.179 --> 00:22:10.350
Unbelievable, unbelievable,
this is like one

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:13.710
of the most tender,
softest, like gummy things

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.470
I have ever tasted.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:18.180
Wow! I think I have a tear, I have a tear,

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.673
it's so soft, so tender.

00:22:21.543 --> 00:22:23.890
(upbeat music)

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.090
Literally, it's unbelievable,
that might be the one

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:29.207
of the richest things
I have ever eaten too.

00:22:31.395 --> 00:22:34.678
(men speaking in foreign language)

00:22:34.678 --> 00:22:35.511
(Mark laughs)

00:22:35.511 --> 00:22:38.520
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.309
Literally, melted fat.

00:22:40.309 --> 00:22:41.166
(man laughing)

00:22:41.166 --> 00:22:43.124
(speaks in foreign language)

00:22:43.124 --> 00:22:44.790
- [Man] Omar! (laughs)

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:45.981
- I didn't know you, my apologies.

00:22:45.981 --> 00:22:46.814
- Thank you.

00:22:46.814 --> 00:22:49.570
The entire mouthful of
melted fat, I need to wash

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.270
that down with some hot green tea.

00:22:52.761 --> 00:22:54.650
(men speaking in foreign language)

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.505
To balance, of course.

00:22:56.505 --> 00:23:00.102
(people speaking in foreign language)

00:23:00.102 --> 00:23:01.950
And so, the next course
is the pilaf course,

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:03.650
which is the rice course.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:06.570
He put it onto a plate,
and then he topped it

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:07.900
with some of the horse sausage,

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:12.900
some quail eggs, some domas,
some crispy lamb chunks.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:15.790
And, that's the next course.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:18.860
The guest, it's really an
honor to take the first bite,

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.186
but yeah, you can just see,
the, every grain is just oiled.

00:23:22.186 --> 00:23:24.436
(men laughing)

00:23:24.436 --> 00:23:26.450
- Okay, guest has been served.

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:27.283
- Wow.

00:23:28.242 --> 00:23:29.075
Wow!

00:23:31.473 --> 00:23:33.440
That's just like meat covered in rice,

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.590
and it's so good, it's
salty, you can taste

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:37.423
the onions and the carrots, it's the

00:23:37.423 --> 00:23:39.278
caramelized carrots in there.

00:23:39.278 --> 00:23:42.459
(upbeat music)

00:23:42.459 --> 00:23:45.346
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:23:45.346 --> 00:23:46.179
- [Mark] (speaks in foreign language) man,

00:23:46.179 --> 00:23:47.416

00:23:47.416 --> 00:23:49.240
- (speaks in foreign language)
- [Mark] It's so good!

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.073
- [Mark] It's very special.

00:23:50.073 --> 00:23:52.270
- Bye.
- Thank you very much!

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:53.103
- Nice to meet you, thank you very much.

00:23:53.103 --> 00:23:55.347
(men speaking)

00:23:55.347 --> 00:23:56.963
- Nice to meet you.

00:23:56.963 --> 00:23:59.546
(upbeat music)

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.520
- Allow me just quickly
tell you how I unfold it,

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.140
but we met Baha yesterday.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.260
- Hello, (speaks in foreign language)

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:07.760
- Mark, hello!

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:08.710
How are you?

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:09.543
- Very good!

00:24:09.543 --> 00:24:13.060
- He watches our videos, he,
through, some social media

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.410
he found out that we were in town,

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:17.460
and he took it upon himself, he took it,

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.860
it was his initiative to put
the entire event together.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:24.690
He, he supplied the food,
he got everyone together,

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:27.091
he organized the entire
thing, and so I wanna say

00:24:27.091 --> 00:24:30.880
a huge thank you, it
was incredibly special,

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.730
it was such an honor to have
a chance to experience that,

00:24:34.829 --> 00:24:36.950
to experience the ultimate

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.530
generosity and kindness

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:42.070
of Uzbek culture, and of Baha,

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:44.080
and the whole, the whole crew.

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.490
And thank you to Bekruz,

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:48.030
for all of his organizing for,

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:50.640
for doing so much for us as well.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.460
And again, it's been a very long day,

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.590
I'm very sleepy, so I'm gonna head to bed,

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:57.630
but then tomorrow, we are
on our way to Samarkand,

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:01.900
which is a historical
center, along the silk road,

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.500
of Uzbekistan, but I'll explain

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.900
much more about that
tomorrow, in the next video.
