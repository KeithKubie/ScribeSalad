00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.890
- [Narrator] Right over
here, we've defined y

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:03.990
as a function of x,

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.600
where y is equal to the
natural log of x minus three.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.170
What I encourage you to do
right now is to pause this video

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.780
and think about for what x values

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.380
is this function actually defined?

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.250
Or another way of thinking about it,

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.910
what is the domain of this function,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.210
and then try to plot this
function on your own,

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.400
on maybe some scratch paper

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.870
that you might have in front of you,

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.030
and then we'll talk about,
and also think about,

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.313
does this have any vertical
asymptotes, and if so, where?

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.850
So, I'm assuming you've given a go at it,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.010
so first, let's think about
where is this function defined?

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.810
So, the important realization
is this is only defined

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.980
if you're taking the natural
log of a positive value.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.820
So, this thing right over here must be,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.120
this thing right over
here, must be positive,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.780
or, another way we could think about it,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.620
it's only going to be
defined for any x, such that,

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.680
x minus three is strictly positive.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.760
Not greater than or equal
to zero, greater than zero.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.140
We haven't defined what
the natural log of zero is,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.030
so x minus three has
to be greater than zero

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.660
in order to give a positive,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.170
in order to take the natural
log of a positive something,

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.950
or if we add three to both sides,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.750
we get x is greater than three.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.750
So, it defined, defined
four, x greater than three.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.490
You could do this as the domain,

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.120
the set of all real numbers
that are greater than three.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.390
Now, that out of the way,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.313
let's actually try to plot
natural log of x minus three.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.600
So, let me put some of this
graph paper right over here,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.180
and the first thing I
wanna think about is,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.760
well, let's just try to plot
some interesting points here,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.860
and the most obvious one is
what makes this natural log,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.620
what makes this entire
function equal to zero?

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.830
When are we going to intersect the x-axis?

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.089
So, let's just think about
that for a little bit.

00:01:59.089 --> 00:02:04.089
So, when is the natural
log of x minus three

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.100
going to be equal to zero?

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.380
Well, one way to think about this

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.000
is to view these both as exponents

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.860
and raise e to both of these powers.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.910
So, you could say that e to the
natural log of x minus three

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.030
is the same thing as e to the zero,

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.600
and, of course, if you raise e

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.380
to whatever exponent you need
to get you to x minus three,

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.680
that's just going to get
you to x minus three,

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.120
and if you raise e to the zero,

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.729
well, anything to the zeroth power,

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:32.560
except possibly zero, that
one's under contention,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.100
or maybe not defined, e to
the zero is equal to one.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.667
This is just another way of saying,

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:40.727
"Hey, look, if I wanna know what exponent

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:43.270
"do I need to raise e to to get to zero,"

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.800
we know e to the zeroth
power is equal to one,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.560
so x minus three is equal to one.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.960
So, if I'm taking the natural
log of one, it'll be zero.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.980
So, x minus three is equal to one,

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.660
add three to both sides,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.120
you get x equals four.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.390
So, we know that the .4,
zero is on this graph,

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.980
so let me graph that.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.980
One, two, three, and four.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.150
So, that right over there is the point.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.480
X is four, and y is zero.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.980
Four minus one, four minus three is one,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.270
natural log of one is zero.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.947
We also know that this is only defined

00:03:21.947 --> 00:03:23.720
for x being greater than three,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.850
so let's just put a little dotted line

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.120
right over here at x equals three.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.567
And we know that our
function isn't even defined,

00:03:30.567 --> 00:03:35.370
for x equals three, and in
any value, to the left of it.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.470
Well, let's think about what happens

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.830
as we approach x equals three
from the right-hand side,

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.230
and to do that, I'll
make a little table here.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.800
So, let me make a little table here,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.730
and put some x values here,

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:49.810
and then let's just think about

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.170
what our corresponding y value is.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.630
So, we could put in,

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.040
so we already know that we get four, zero.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.723
Let's try out 3.1, 3.01,

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.760
and 3.001 and see what you get.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.900
And you can imagine, from each of these,

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.330
you're gonna subtract
three, so then the input

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.570
into the natural log function
is gonna be .1, .01, .001,

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.900
and so you're gonna have more
and more negative exponents,

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.600
or powers, that you have to raise e to

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.780
to get to those values,

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.280
but to just verify that,

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.770
let's actually get our calculator out.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.050
Let's get our calculator out,

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.880
and let me go to the main screen.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.010
And so, let's take the natural log

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.751
of three, of 3.1 minus three.

00:04:38.751 --> 00:04:42.380
3.1 minus three.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.380
We get negative 2.3, and
I'll just round to the tenth.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.643
So, this right over here is negative 2.3.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.130
If we raise, if we take the natural log,

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.903
natural log of 3.01,

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.250
3.01 minus three, we get to

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.640
negative 4.6, once again,
just rounding, negative 4.6,

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.033
and if we take the natural log,

00:05:15.973 --> 00:05:19.480
the natural log of 3.001,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.480
zero, one, minus three,
we get to negative 6.9.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.190
Negative 6.9, and just for fun,

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.380
let's do one that's way more dramatic.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.490
So, let's take the natural log of 3.,

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.180
let's do one, two,
three, four, five, zeros,

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.480
followed by one, minus three,

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.480
and we get a fairly more
negative value right over here.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.100
So, as you see, as we're getting
closer and closer to three,

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.580
we're getting more, and more,
and more negative values.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.590
Let me just plot this right over here,

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.370
so this is negative one,
this is negative two,

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.960
this is negative three,
this is negative four.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.700
So, when x is equal to 3.1,

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.200
which is right about there,
we're at negative 2.3,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.990
which is right around there.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.500
When x is 3.01, which is really
hard to see right over here,

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.320
we get to negative 4.6,
so it's way down here.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.750
So, our graph is gonna
look something like,

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.570
our graph is gonna look something like,

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.270
and my best attempt is
to draw it freehand,

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.000
is gonna look something,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.530
something like, something like that.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.480
So, do we have a vertical asymptote?

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.690
Absolutely.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.640
As we approach three from
values larger than three,

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.640
from the right-hand side, our
function is plummeting down.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.930
It's unbounded.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:42.850
It's going down.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:43.820
Our value of our function

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.790
is quickly approaching negative infinity.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.780
So, we clearly have a vertical asymptote.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.023
We have a vertical asymptote at,

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:58.683
asymptote, at x equals three.
