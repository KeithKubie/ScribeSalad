00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington, D.C.,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.350
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon and welcome

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.670
to the African American
[inaudible] Division.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.330
I am Mary Jane Deeb, Chief of
the Division, and I'm delighted

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.020
to see you all here to attend
this special presentation

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.490
with Harry Boonin, who will
talk to us about his new book,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.520
Never Tell a Boy Not to Fight.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.930
As I always do, I make a little
presentation about our division,

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.600
and our division is made up of
three sections, the African,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.850
the Near East, and
the Hebraic Sections.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.250
We are responsible for materials
from 78 countries in the Near East,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.200
Central Asia, the Caucuses, and
well as from the entire continent

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.650
of Africa, north and
south sub-Sahara,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.630
and for the Hebraic
section we collect materials

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.660
from all over the world.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.650
We are also very active
in acquiring materials,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.320
and restore our materials,
we develop our collections,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.480
we brief our visitors, and
we serve the collections

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.290
in this reading room.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.690
We also invite scholars, and
experts, who have done research

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.990
and used our collections to share
their insights and their findings

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.310
with our patrons, with
our audiences here

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.540
in the United States,
and across the world.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.550
And we like to have especially
authors who have written new books

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.590
and done research, to share, not
only the content of their research,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.160 position:56%
but how they've done their research.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.460
So we are particularly happy
to welcome Harry Boonin today,

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.780
because he is making a presentation
on a topic that we rarely,

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.680
if ever, discuss at the Library.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.570
Namely, boxing.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.790
But Harry Boonin is a local
historian from Philadelphia,

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.380 position:56%
whose work is, in many ways, unique,
as it focuses on boxers who came

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.100
from the Jewish Quarter
of Philadelphia.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.550
As I looked Harry up on Google,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.760
I found a little announcement
about this project.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.710
That was before the
book had been written,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.160 position:56%
where he introduces himself, and
then adds, "I'm looking for stories,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.820
letters, diaries, photographs of
the lesser known Jewish fighters,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.060
managers, such as Phil Glassman,
Boo Boo Hoff, love the name,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.920
trainers such as Kudel
Seinfeld, and sports writers,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.530
such as Lou Jaffe, of Philadelphia.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.990
Any personal stories
or personal content

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.040
to families would be
greatly appreciated.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.510
The moment you read this,
you really are excited.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.050
You want to know-did
people give the letters?

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.130
Did they share their photographs?

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.710
You know, who are the
people, the stories?

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.320
I mean it's a hook that immediately
makes you want to read the book,

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.410
and to know how that
book got written.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.350
So I am sure he is going to share
with us a history and the story

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.440
of the boxer that he
is writing about.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.860 position:56%
But now, our very own Sharon
Horowitz, Senior Reference Librarian

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.200
in The Hebraic Section will
introduce Harry Boonin,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.540
and the program.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.510
So thank you.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.180
[ Applause ]

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.850
&gt;&gt; Thank you Mary-Jane.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.380
On behalf of the Hebraic
section, let me thank you all

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.680
for coming to today's program.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.980
My name is Sharon Horowitz,

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.980
I'm the reference librarian
in the Hebraic Section.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.290
The Hebraic Section marks its
beginning in 1912, with the receipt

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.600
of 10,000 Hebrew books
and pamphlets,

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.130
whose purchase was
made possible by a gift

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.260
from a New York Philanthropist,
Jacob Schiff,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.780
from those humble beginnings,

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.810
our collections have grown
to around 250,000 items.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.350
In Hebrew, Yiddish,
Ladino, Judeo-Persian,

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.300
and other Hebraic script languages.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.090
The Hebraic section also includes
an important collection of books

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.360
in the languages of Gez,
Amharic, and Tigrinya,

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.070
languages of Ethiopia,
past and present.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.040
Our section's holdings
are particularly strong

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.160
in the subject areas of Bible and
Rabbinic liturgy, Hebrew language,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.250
and literature response
and Jewish history.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.660 position:56%
Two of our missions in this division
are to publicize our collections,

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.500
and to bring people
into the library,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.710
and one way we accomplish this
second goal is by holding lectures,

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.780 position:56%
and having programs, such as the one
we are hosting here today, and now,

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.310
a word about our speaker, Mr.
Harry Boonin, who received his B.A.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.000 position:56%
from Pennsylvania State University
and his J.D. from Temple University.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.580 position:56%
Before retiring, he worked for many
years as a lawyer for the U.S. Navy.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.130
Mr. Boonin devotes much of
his time to Jewish genealogy

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.920
and to Philadelphia Jewish history.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.360
He was the founding President
of the Jewish Genealogy Society

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.550
of greater Philadelphia, editor of
their newsletter, and was honored

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.360
by the Society for
Lifetime Dedication.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.100
Harry has published many articles

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.230
in the Jewish Genealogy
Journal of [inaudible].

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.720
The book we will hear
about today is his fourth.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.050
Never Tell a Boy Not to Fight
describes the lost world

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.730
of Philadelphia Jewish boxing, and
the story of immigrant Jewish boys

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.350
who literally fought
their way up from poverty.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.630
One item of business, before
we hear from Mr. Boonin,

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.140
this event is being videotaped
for subsequent broadcasting.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.220
There will be a formal question and
answer period after the lecture,

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.940
at which time the audience
is encouraged

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.840 position:56%
to ask questions and offer comments.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.700
Please be advised that your
voice and image may be recorded

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.900
and later broadcast
as part of this event.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.210 position:56%
By participating in the question and
answer period, you are consenting

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.760
to the library's possible
reproduction

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.850
and transmission of your remarks.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.570
And now, please join me in
welcoming Mr. Harry Boonin.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:33.610
Oh, one more thing-there are
questionnaires asking for feedback

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.930
that are going to be distributed.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.170
If not on your chair, they will be.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.860
So if you could fill them out and
hand them in before you leave,

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.200
that would be appreciated, and
also the book, Never Tell a Boy Not

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.030
to Fight is for sale in the back,
and Mr. Boonin will be very happy

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.650
to sign them if anybody wants.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.510
Thank you.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:59.170
[ Applause ]

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:06.090
&gt;&gt; Thank you for the very nice
introductions, and welcome,

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.770
you all, on such a beautiful day.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.790
A question about letters
has been brought up,

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.410
whether I ever got any letters.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:19.180
Well, that shows you how little I
knew when I started about boxers.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.260
Boxers wear eight ounce gloves, and
I guess they can't write letters

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.600
with their gloves on [laughs],
but boxers do not write letters,

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.450
which is a big disappointment, if
any of you want to be a biographer,

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.060
make sure that the
person you're writing

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.900
about writes letters,
or writes something.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.400
It's difficult without
them, without the diary.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.770
How did I get into this?

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:47.600 position:56%
Twenty-four years ago, I was working
for the Navy, and I found myself

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:53.010
in London one day, London,
England, and I had a few hours off.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:59.660
And I decided to take a walking
tour of the old east end of London.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.000
It was a wonderful tour.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.820
I thought I would do the same thing
when I came back to Philadelphia.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.120
Nobody was doing it.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.760
I started them, and I
did it for 15 years.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.490
And what came out of it was a
book called The Jewish Quarter

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.840
of Philadelphia.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.510
And when I finished the
book, I was frustrated

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:21.520
because I felt I really
hadn't told the full story

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.520
of the Jewish Quarter, and the
Russian Jews who settled there.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.650
So I wrote a second book,
about a Synagogue of the area,

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:38.710 position:56%
and the synagogue, I was surprised
to find, had parents, three parents,

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.280
that had sons who were
professional boxers.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:47.450
And I though that was odd, whether
it was or not, I'm not sure.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:52.090
Then I found out that one of
the premiere boxing managers

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.490
in Philadelphia was also
a member of the synagogue.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.190
So I finished the synagogue
book, and I thought I was done,

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:02.580
but the boxers fascinated me.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.490
I was intrigued.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.820
And I thought I would do
a little bit of research,

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:11.700
and see if there was a possibility
that a book could be written.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:17.440
I found out that Philadelphia,
a century ago,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.900
had many dozen professional boxers.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:29.040
In 1928, there were more
Jewish boxers for an ethnicity

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.380
than any other ethnicity
in the United States.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.360
It only lasted a short time, and
I guess that put me over the top.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:41.490
And I said, well, I guess
three books make a trilogy,

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.230
and I started on my boxing book.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.970
It took eight years.

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:49.110
And this is basically the story.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.420
Let me get started.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.970
This photograph comes from
the Library of Congress,

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:04.020
and it is from the Association
of Newsboys, from Cincinnati.

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.220
It's a very interesting
picture, for many reasons.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:16.710
A lot of the Jewish newsboys in
Philadelphia were not lucky enough

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:20.070
to have any kind of training
like this, but this seems

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.240
to be, to be a training room.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.710
The boys, some of the boys
you'll see, are in bare feet.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:27.770
Other boys have shoes on.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.860
You'll notice, there's
no adults in the room.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.010
And the boys are learning
from each other.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.940
The remarkable part
about this picture is,

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.800
if there are both African
American and white boys together,

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:47.730
and they seem, from the picture,
to have been getting along,

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:53.140
and learning, and concentrating,
despite all of the prejudice

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:56.580
that existed around
them at that time.

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:02.260 position:56%
In fact, if you'll look on the
right-hand side of your screen, I...

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:10.560
[ Inaudible ]

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:17.360
&gt;&gt; There is a-one of the larger
boys, is standing next to,

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.440
on his right, a white boy,
and he has his hand gently

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.160
on the boy's shoulder,
and you can see

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.690
from this little fact,
how close the boys were.

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:31.530
They were intently, and
you can see in their eyes,

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.260
how intently they are in learning.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.070
This next picture comes
from Philadelphia,

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.800
and again involves the boys.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.560
Newsboys, a lot of Jews
were newsboys at that time.

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.910
I was unable to find any kind of
study in Philadelphia, Cincinnati,

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.540
or New York, but I did find a
study of newsboys in Denver,

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.410
Colorado, a few years later.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:02.160
And of the 250 newsboys
that were studied,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.260
125 or half of them were Jewish,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.190
which I found really
surprising in Denver, Colorado.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:14.480
This particular picture
shows, on the left-hand side,

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.030
you'll see there's a girl
on a swing, and if you look

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:19.500
in the middle, in the back,
there's a single girl,

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.690
who is reading a book, but in
the front, there are two boys,

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:27.760
who are practicing the art of
boxing, the manly art of boxing,

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.270
and the teacher doesn't seem
to be interfering with them.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:32.570
She's letting it go.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:36.100
So this was something today,
you would see a baseball game,

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.330
maybe the kids are playing
ball against the wall,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.010
but what is what the
kids practiced then.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:51.390 position:56%
To get into boxing, in Philadelphia,
which is probably like all the towns

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:54.000
in the eastern part
of the United States,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.860
one of the most unusual
venues was called a cyclorama.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.550
And the picture of it is here.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:04.170
This picture is stated
it was taken in 1887,

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:07.940
and this is where the first
Jewish fighter fought.

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:13.350
A cyclorama is a painting
that is mounted on the inside

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:16.710
of a round building, the
battle of Gettysburg is one

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:21.650 position:56%
of the most popular cycloramas after
the Civil War, and you can see it

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:25.820
if you go-has anybody here
gone to the Gettysburg Museum?

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.560
The new museum opened up.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.730
They have a cyclorama up there.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:35.560
And it has 20,000-20,000
life-sized figures.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:41.930
The building on the right
is the same building,

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:46.590
it's painted white here, it's
called the Winter Circus.

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.260
This was converted
from the cyclorama

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:53.310
to the Winter Circus
for boxing in 1893.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.380
First, there were Vaudeville
shows here,

00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:06.020
and after the Vaudeville shows,
the interest wanted in the city,

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:14.150
and the manager thought he
would try to bring in boxing.

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:21.190
One of the boxers he
brought in was Jewish.

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.430
This is a famous painting.

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.300
You may recognize the
painting by Thomas Eakins.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:32.350
Eakins painted it in 1898,

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:36.100
and it was in the interior
of the same building.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.840
You can see in this painting
on the left-hand side,

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.360
you'll see there's a press
box, right above the policeman

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:49.900
who is standing there, in the
press box were three journalists,

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.180
I guess you'd call
them sports writers,

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:56.380
although they didn't really call
them sports writers at that time,

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:01.180
because it wasn't a profession,
and a fellow that named the round,

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.270
and then they also had
a telegraph operator.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.990 position:56%
So if you were a boxing manager, and
you wanted to get your story out,

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:08.910
you didn't have to go
to a telegraph office,

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:11.730
you could do it right
from the boxing arena.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:17.550
The fellow in the foreground is
the timekeeper, and you can see

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:21.400
that the ropes in the
ring are already a foot

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:27.790
or more inside the raised
platform that they fought on.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:31.600 position:56%
So if the fellow was knocked through
the ropes, he didn't fall right away

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:36.590 position:56%
onto the floor, which is quite a
fall, but he would fall on the edge,

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:39.740
and hopefully stay
within the platform.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:44.280
This is a fellow, that is Henry
Pinkus [assumed spelling],

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.150
who was the first promoter
at the Winter Circus.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:55.720
He was also an inventor, filed six
patents at the Library of Congress,

00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:02.170
and remained in the fight game
until he ended up being arrested.

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:09.090 position:56%
In 1898, the fight game was still
considered semi-legal in some towns,

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:13.390
and completely illegal in others.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:19.880
He finally had enough, and he
left Philadelphia for New York.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.020
This is a picture of the
first Jewish fighter.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.640
He had 60 professional
Jewish fights.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:32.500
He fought from 1893 to 1905.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.990
His name was Izzy Strauss.

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:39.360
But they called him
the Hebrew Cyclone.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:47.100
Both of those words would have been
a surprise to the boxing public

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.940
and to the general public.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.900
First of all, most Jews
were not known as Hebrews,

00:16:52.900 --> 00:17:00.580
and that was to give him sort of an
aura of maybe a Biblical warrior,

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.180
rather than a street Jew.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.370
They called him the Hebrew.

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:11.510
The Cyclone-some boxers, many
black boxers were named Cyclone

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.150
because he kept his arms
moving all the time.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.560
So this was the Hebrew Cyclone.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.050
He had 60 fights.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:21.620
Of the 60 fights, there
were 10 disqualifications.

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:26.640
At that time, the press did not
write about anti-Semitism in boxing

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:31.050
or in baseball, so you have to
sort of use your imagination,

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.630
which is not a good way to
write a book or to tell a story,

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:40.350
but the ten disqualifications,
none of them were explained.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:46.010 position:56%
Strauss bit his opponent, kicked his
opponent, and wrestled his opponent

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:50.800
to the ground, but not one
of the reporters who looked

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.550
into these disqualifications
stated why they happened,

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:59.960
and so we just have our
imagination to go on.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:06.000
And this is where radio biography,
letters, could be so important

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.320
or a diary, where the person
would admit what happened.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.330 position:56%
But the newspapers were not going
to admit anti-Semitism at this time,

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:15.770
at least in Philadelphia.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:17.170
In other towns they did.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:24.750
Philadelphia was very proper, and
everything went on on the Q-T.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:36.420 position:56%
The next story I'm going to tell you
will be partially my imagination,

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:41.540
probably 100% of what
happened in a fight

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:47.470
on June the 15th, 1906,
in Philadelphia.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:51.090
This is a picture of the
National Boxing Club,

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.310
where the story takes place.

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:59.160
To tell you the story, I'd like to
take you back, both chronologically

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.870
and geographically to Russia.

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:06.650
Almost all the fighters who
fought at this time either came

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:11.860
from Russia, or were born to
parents who came from Russia.

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.210
And I'll take you back to a little
schechtel [phonetic spelling]

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:21.960
in the southern part of
Russia, in the fall of 1905.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.300
That fall, in the south of Russia,

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:28.440
there were 657 Pogrums
[phonetic spelling].

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:33.830
Pogrums were organized attaché
by the government and the police

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:38.860
and the army against the Jewish
citizens of different towns.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:44.570
In our imagined story, the
fellow comes out of the house,

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:51.110
his spouse is inside, his children
are hiding in terror under the bed.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.470
The Pogrum crowd has just
destroyed the town and left,

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:57.900
and he goes outside
to look at the street.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.940
The street is muddy.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:04.530
In the street are all the broken
furniture, from the Pogrum,

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:09.360
and on top of the broken
furniture, the Pogrum chicks,

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.860
the Russians who liked to
make Pogrums against Jews,

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:18.080
had cut open all the feather
pillows that they could find,

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.920
and spread them all over, and
these were one of the-this is one

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:25.070
of the marks that they left

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.690
when the Pogrum was over.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:31.680
And he thought to himself,
"What am I doing here?

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:35.530
I'm going to tell my
spouse, and tell my kids,

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:38.330
we're getting out of here."

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:42.250
That fall, he sold his
belongings, had enough money

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:46.080
to get a train ticket, and he
left what my uncle called dark

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:51.330
and miserable Russia for
a new land, a golden land.

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:53.230
They traveled by train to Hamburg.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:55.240
When you got to Hamburg
in those days, remember,

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.640
this is the winter of 1906.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.970
You were two miles from the ship.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:02.810
You had to walk, with your
family, and you had little babies,

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:04.400
so everybody had to carry a baby

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.800
in their luggage, two
miles to the ship.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.990
The ship went across the North Sea
in winter, a very rough crossing,

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:15.180
to Grimsbere Hull, in the east
coast of Britain, and from there,

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.480
they crossed by rail to Liverpool,

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.930
and Liverpool took
them to Philadelphia.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:23.370
In Philadelphia, this would
be in January or February

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:27.830
in this hypothetical story,
they settled where all

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:31.810
of the immigrants settled
at that time.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.610
This would be January
or February of 1906.

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:42.880
That was the one year where the
Jews had 125,000 immigrants.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.620 position:56%
Immigrant Jews who came from Russia,
the largest immigration of any year

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:51.090
in our history or in
Russian history.

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:53.890
He got a job in one
of the sweat shops.

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.300
The sweat shops at
that time operated

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.040
with 39 different functions.

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.250
You were taught one function-sew
the buttons on the collar.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:03.700
Sew the buttons on the shirt.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:05.670
And that is what you did all day.

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:08.660
It could be taught, you
didn't have to know English.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.610
Everyone in the sweat
shop spoke Yiddish,

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:13.590
and that is what he learned.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:18.170
He noticed, after a few months
there, now we're into May and June

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:23.630
of 1906, that the other men in the
shop, who were speaking Yiddish,

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:25.490
were talking about a prize fight,

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:28.980
and he didn't know
what a prize fight was.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:34.320
And they told him, the two men get
in a ring, and in a certain number

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.720
of rounds, they try
to win the fight.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:45.230
Well, there was a-he felt, well,
maybe the best thing for me

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:48.070
to do is go to a fight and
see what goes on there.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:52.070
All the fellows in the shop
seemed to-you could buy a ticket

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.370
for a quarter.

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:56.440
He said, "I just won't tell my wife
about spending a quarter on this,

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.440 position:56%
and I'll go over there Friday night.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.690
Maybe she'll think I
went to synagogue."

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:08.960
He woke up the morning of 15 June
1906, and reading the headlines,

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:12.240
the fellows in the shop
who could read English,

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:18.100
discovered there was a
Pogrum, in Bialystok, Poland.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:23.230
And normally, in Philadelphia,
when there was a large Pogrum,

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:27.190
they had protest meetings
in all of the synagogues

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:31.340
in the southern part
of Philadelphia.

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:36.270
So he then had a choice between
going to synagogue that night,

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:40.560
and attending the protest
meetings or going to the fight.

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.000
And he said, "If I'm going
to be a real American,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.990
and understand what
this country is about,

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.290
I'm going to go to the prize fight.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:53.040
So he went to the National
Boxing Club, which we see here.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.460
And he went inside.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.600
When he got inside, he looked
around, and he wondered,

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.050
"I wonder who all these people are?

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:02.830
Are they Jews?

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:04.650
Are they Jews like me?

00:24:04.650 --> 00:24:06.900
Or are they other people?"

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:13.920
And he couldn't quite determine who
they were, because unlike Russia,

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.710
where the peasants and the Jews
wore much different clothing,

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:24.720
in the United States it was hard to
discern by clothing who anyone was.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:29.960
And then the fighters came out.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:37.820
The first fighter to come out is
one of the most popular fighters

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.130
who ever fought in
the United States.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.250
His name was Joe Gans.

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:44.450
I don't know if anybody
ever heard his name.

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:48.220
Today, he is not well-known,
but in 1906,

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.270
there was no heavyweight champion.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:56.480
Jim Jeffries had just retired, and
Gans was the lightweight champion,

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.080
and the lightweight division

00:24:58.080 --> 00:25:04.310
in those days was considered the
second most interesting behind

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.540
the heavyweights.

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:11.640
Gans was to die of tuberculosis
four years after this,

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.310
but I think he was the
most popular fighter,

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:16.450
black or white, at that time.

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:19.790
And he has always been considered
one of the best fighters,

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:25.300
pound for pound, who ever
fought in the United States.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.420
I want to go back.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.980
He fought against a Jew by
the name of Harry Lewis.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:52.060
And Lewis' real name was Besterman.

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:56.590
Lewis had had 77 fights before
this, but never met anyone

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:58.950
of the caliber of Joe Gans.

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:00.960 position:56%
Joe Gans was a lightweight champion,

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:04.020
and this was not a
championship fight.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:08.910
But the national AC,
that night, June 15,

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:11.690
1906, was completely filled.

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:19.520
There were 5,000 people
in the-at the club.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:25.440
Just to compare that, the Chicago
Cubs of 1906, who finally went

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.960
through World Series, but
didn't win it that year,

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.700
but won it the next year, and
with the double-play combination

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:35.330
of tinkers averaged a chance,
they could only draw 4,000 people

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:37.830
to the ballpark to
play the Phillies,

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:41.370
where this boxing match drew 5,000.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:48.310
The first thing that our imagined
attendee thought was, in Russia,

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:52.260
a Jew couldn't be an
official street sweeper,

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:57.100
an official street
sweeper-and here he is looking

00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:01.090 position:56%
up that this is fellow, Harry Lewis,

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:05.770
is eligible to fight the
lightweight champion.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:11.490
He happens to be an African
American, but what stuck

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:17.260
in our imagined fellow's
mind is, that as a Jew,

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.020
he has a right to fight him.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:24.830
And so he recognized right
away not in a courtroom,

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:30.530
not in a naturalization ceremony,
but the equality that exists

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:35.710
at the lowest level of American
society, and he liked it.

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:37.920
The fight went six rounds.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.370
At that time, they were
six-round fights in Philadelphia.

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:45.610
When Gans and Lewis went in
the ring, they shook hands,

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:47.400
and he took note of that.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:52.900
But when the fight was over,
and it was more or less a draw,

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:57.700
the fighters shook hands again
and smiled at one another,

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:03.080
and that meant a lot to him, that
there were two diverse ethnicities,

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:07.300
if you call it that, who could
get along with each other,

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:11.020
even after they pummeled
each other for six rounds.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.840
Neither one was particularly hurt,

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:17.160
and Harry Lewis' name
then skyrocketed,

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.610
because everyone felt it.

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:23.350
Although he did not win the fight
he had put up a wonderful battle

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:27.490
and that he would go
far in the boxing game.

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:31.300
Harry Lewis is one of the
stories that's in the book.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:39.450 position:56%
For you who read old newspapers, you
may be familiar with illustrations.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:40.770
They had photographs.

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:44.630
This is the illustration
of that fight.

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:51.690
And they illustrated-the cartoonist
illustrated people the way they saw

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:56.220
them, or the way their editor
wanted them to be portrayed.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:03.830
If you wanted them to show a
minority in an unfavorable light,

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:09.140
you could take an African
American and paint his lips thick.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.970
You could take a Jew and
give him a Jewish nose.

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:16.550
Either one of those things would
accomplish what the editor wanted,

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:19.590
and that's what the paper wanted,
I won't name the paper [laughs].

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:26.220
This is another cartoonist,
by the name of Tad Dorgan.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:29.830
I don't know if the name Tad
Dorgan means anything to anybody,

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:31.380
but he is very famous today.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.280
He is a coiner of phrases.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.800
He coined them back when
he was a boxing writer,

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.010
and he was a very fair man.

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:41.100
Here's an illustration
of the same two fighters,

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:47.100
but there is no derogatory
pen marks in his drawing.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:52.300
Gans on the right is shown as
hitting Lewis in the stomach,

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:56.480
while avoiding or slipping
Lewis' right hand,

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.080
which goes harmlessly
over his shoulder.

00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:02.160
But both men are pictured
like they are.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:08.040
Lewis, a little bit on the heavy
side, Gans slightly angular.

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:12.800
And it is a better picture of
what they really look like.

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:20.510
This is one of the few really
interesting and subtle,

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:23.850
or not too subtle, depending
on how you look at it,

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:25.970
ideas of the Tale of the Tape.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.270
A Tale of the Tape is
usually a measurement

00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:36.700
of the fighter's different parts of
his anatomy, such as biceps, legs,

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.000
ankles, and things like that.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.580
And you read down, and the only
line that is of some interest,

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.460 position:56%
of great interest, is the last line.

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.130
Now, this is the Tale of the Tape,
and they always stop at ankle.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:53.370
They didn't stop at ankle, it went
to nationality, and the fellow

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:59.110
on the left, Howard Baker, was
identified as an Irish American.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:00.410
Well, you would think the fellow

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:04.020
on the right would be
identified as a Jewish American.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:08.780
I won't ask you the question why
they identified him as a Jew.

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.320
But they did identify
in the narrative

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:16.760
that Howard Baker had baby
skin and a blonde pompadour,

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.130
so those were two very
relevant factors

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:21.430
to the boxing match [laughs].

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:27.960
I'm going to skip that.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:36.930
Harry Lewis later went over to
France, and fought in France,

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:40.930
and this is a battle he had
with Georges Carpentier,

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:43.130
who was a famous French fighter,

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:47.930
and a famous French flier
in the first world war.

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:53.030
This picture, I love
this picture from 1913.

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:57.420
This is a drugstore in London, and
it has two pictures on the left.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:59.310
One of the pictures
is all in Yiddish.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:04.450
One of the pictures in Yiddish
says "Rabbi attacked by Shiksa,"

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:10.590
and the two papers on the right
are papers about American fights.

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:14.570
So out of the seven papers that are
shown in front of this drug store,

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:19.340
some of them have to do with
Yiddish or they are in Yiddish,

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:21.300
and the other two had
to do with boxing,

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:27.090
to show you how popular
boxing was in London in 1913.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:32.000
The fellow on the left
is one of the Jews

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.870
in Philadelphia they
did not write about,

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:38.310
but he won the lightweight title,
and the junior lightweight title,

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:41.950
and the featherweight
title in the 1920s.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:43.590
This is Lew Tendler.

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:48.140
Lew Tendler was a most
famous-I don't know

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.860
if his name means anything here

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.220
in Washington-in Philadelphia
almost everybody knows him

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:55.560
like people know Jack
Dempsey in New York.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:59.550
Lew Tendler, after he
retired, opened a restaurant.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:02.640
In fact, he's the one
who gave Dempsey the idea

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.380
of opening a restaurant,
and they both were

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.810
in the restaurant business
for 25 years.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:14.330
When there were big fights in
Philadelphia, like all the fights

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:21.320
of Jersey Joe Walcott, and Marciano
in the early 50s, and Joe Lewis,

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:26.590
all the writers from New York would
come down to Tendler's restaurant.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:28.520
Everybody gathered there.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:33.200
It was a great meeting place
for writers, and a great place

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.910
for writers to get the
material for their stories.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:40.510
They may not have had letters,
but they knew where to go

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:46.140
to find Broadway characters, and
it wasn't on Broadway [laughs].

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:50.730
One of the favorites in
Tendler's was David Runyon.

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:53.480
David Runyon was always there.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.400
It's a story that he
was told by Hurst,

00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:02.330 position:56%
he worked for William Randolph
Hurst, covering the 1936 convention,

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:06.620
when Roosevelt was
nominated, and eventually won,

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.660
but he should get to Philadelphia.

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:14.020
Since Roosevelt was such a shoe-in
at the Democratic Convention,

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:21.070
David Runyon spent the whole time,
the whole week of the convention

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:25.910 position:56%
at Tendler's restaurant, and it goes
on to say all the stories he wrote.

00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:28.000
He wrote a story called
Little Miss Marker,

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.890
and I don't know if
you've ever seen it.

00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:34.140
That was made into a movie
and starred Shirley Temple,

00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:40.210
and that was one of her roles
that really shot her to fame.

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:46.700
This is the street that Tendler
was born on in Philadelphia.

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:50.090
Years later, that's one
of his first fighters.

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:53.650
When Tendler fought another Jewish
fighter, they were both Jewish,

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:56.730
they got in the ring, and
they couldn't hit each other,

00:34:56.730 --> 00:35:01.290
they just couldn't do it, so there
were 4,000 people in the arena

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:04.370
and by the second round, there were
2,000 people, by the third round,

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:08.520
there was about a dozen people
left, because it was a fake.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.480
When the reporters
went into the room

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:15.210
to ask Tendler what was
this all about, he cried.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:19.800
So sometimes, we think of players
as being really tough guys,

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:24.110
but it doesn't mean a
tough guy can't cry.

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:26.700
This is another one of his fights.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:28.160
This is Tendler in training.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:33.060
He trained at a millionaire's
mansion.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:37.380
How he wrangled this, I couldn't
quite figure out, but the guy was

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:42.590
such a nice guy, he had a 21-- - 28
room mansion, and when Tendler came

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:48.380
to prepare for a fight, he put
every one of Tendler's people,

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.910
there were 28 of them, he
gave them each a Victrola,

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:54.510
so they could play music
before they went to bed.

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:59.640
This is another boxing venue in
Philadelphia, and that's a picture

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.880
of it empty, this is
a picture of it full.

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:06.220
And these are taken
in the early 1920s.

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.520
This you can't see too much of,

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.420
but Benny Leonard was
a lightweight champion,

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:14.790
probably the best Jewish
fighter there ever was.

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:17.140
And these are the people
celebrating.

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:20.330
In the picture you can see a
snare drum, a bass drum, clarinet,

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:25.660
and even a violin [laughs]
and letters at the top.

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:30.020
This is a picture at the
place where he was training,

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:34.990
Tendler always had a ukulele,
but this is not a ukulele,

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:36.770
it looks to me like
a banjo [laughs],

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:39.470
and I don't know-he's
playing it left handed.

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:41.430
Can you play a banjo left handed?

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:42.800
You don't have to answer that.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.760
These are some of the
guys-Tendler was never seen alone.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.760
He was a great guy-a great fellow.

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.880
And he takes up over half the book.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.720
The stories are wonderful.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.960
This is my favorite picture
of him in the newspaper,

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.780
my son the fighter, and you
can see who the mother is,

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.180
and who the fighter
is in this picture.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.480
The two men in the back were
his brothers, and the person

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.410
on the left is the sister.

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:10.960
All four of them have their
arms around the youngest member.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.820
This was something
that Tendler handed

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:14.950
out at his restaurant, of advice.

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:17.700
It has all the advice, and
I know you can't read it,

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:28.190
but the last line says...the last
line, the last-the greatest thing

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:32.110 position:56%
in all the world, bar none, is love.

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:33.450
That was the way he felt.

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:35.610
He gave out 300,000 of these free.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:37.530
There are postcards
on the other side.

00:37:37.530 --> 00:37:41.470
And this is the last picture.

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:46.490
This picture was taken about a
month after the book came out,

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:50.440
and it's sort of like
an archaeological dig,

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.170
because everybody in Philly
saw this, that they knocked

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:57.720
down a parking garage, next to
where Tendler's restaurant was,

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:01.630
and lo and behold, there was a sign
that said Tendler's restaurant.

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:05.400
Nobody had heard of it or thought
of it in the last 20 or 30 years.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.000
They closed in 1970.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.470
That's 46 years ago.

00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:12.210
So it made quite a hit.

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:14.990
So that's the story
of the book on boxing.

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:16.910
Sorry I didn't have more
time to talk to you,

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:19.760
but I'd love to take any
questions that you have.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.510
Thank you.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:32.070
[ Applause ]

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:33.370
&gt;&gt; Who were the trainers?

00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:37.050
All boxers, who trained
them for the boxing matches?

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:42.870
Who trained these young
men to become boxers?

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:49.220
&gt;&gt; The question is who
prepared-in other words,

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.520
was there an organization?

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.820
Was this organized?

00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:53.790
&gt;&gt; Was this organized
with the trainers or?

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:56.740
&gt;&gt; Okay, boxing was
very unorganized.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.480
That's a very good question.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:08.030
In 1905, in 1906, there were 16
boxers who were killed in the ring.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:11.220
And I knew there were
problems in football,

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.980
and a lot of the articles said
that boxing is not as rough,

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:16.500
or more rough than football,

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:21.030
and I wondered just how
rough football was in 1906.

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:23.040
Looking it up, ironically,

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:28.500
what I found was there were 16
football players in 1905 and 1906.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:30.940
I continued, and I
looked up horse racing,

00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:35.760
and I found out there were 16
jockeys who were killed in 1906,

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:40.480
eight of them on a horse, the other
8 were killed in other incidents.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:47.940
So there was a lot of-there
was danger in all the sports,

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.610
but football was organized,
to answer your question,

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:54.340
and football addressed the
flying wedge in different forms

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:57.220
of football, to lessen the danger.

00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:01.080
The way the deaths in
boxing were handled was

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:04.240
that they would handle
it as a criminal matter.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.440
And Lewis, Harry Lewis, and I spent
a lot of time in the book on this,

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.980
Harry Lewis actually
killed a man in the ring,

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.810
and they charged him with murder.

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:17.970
So that's-that's what boxing got,
because they weren't organized.

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:21.140
You asked the question about
who arranged the matches.

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:25.060
The matches were arranged by
whoever was the best negotiator.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:30.430
Each boxer had someone looking out
for them, somebody in the family,

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:33.600
or he had no one looking out for
him, and looked out for himself.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.970
Most of those guys got
taken advantage of.

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:40.610
But there was an awful lot
of skullduggery in boxing,

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:42.700
probably was in football
and baseball too [laughs],

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:46.180
I didn't write about them.

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.830
But I don't know if that
quite answers your question,

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:53.960
but I would say it was basically an
unorganized sport, and no one tried

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:58.120
to organize it before 1915.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:07.230
By 1930s, when prohibition was
being phased out, and the mafia

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:12.440
and different gangs felt there
was money to be made in boxing,

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:17.880
then the criminal element
entered boxing in a big way,

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:21.370
at the management and
promotional level.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.880
Yes sir?

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:28.130
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:29.430
&gt;&gt; Could you speak a little louder?

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:31.180
&gt;&gt; At one point in this
century did Jewish involvement

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:34.530
in boxing start to taper off?

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:35.830
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:40.310
The question is at what point in
this century did Jewish boxing tend

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:43.570
to taper off, and the
answer to that is,

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:48.620
when Congress passed the quota
act in 1924, up until 1924,

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:55.860
there was another quota act in
1921, but in 24, they cut off all,

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:59.160
for practical purposes,
immigration from Russia.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.480
Almost all of the fighters
did it for money.

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:06.440
Almost all of the fighters
were poor.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:10.390
And all of the fighters knew
that if their father had died,

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:13.770
like Tendler's father, somebody had
to make the money for the family,

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:16.360
and they could make a
lot more money fighting

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.770
than they could being newsboys.

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:21.160
He was a newsboy, and a
fighter, both at the same time.

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:26.510
And so beginning in 1924,
there was no more immigration.

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:30.730
So then the boys that were being
brought up, the Jewish boys,

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:33.910
felt that gee, this boxing
thing is kind of rough,

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:37.920
maybe I'm better off going to
college, or something like that,

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.640
and becoming a lawyer,
becoming a doctor.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:45.310
If this is really an open country,
and we know there were restrictions

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:47.770
at Harvard and different
ivy league schools,

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:52.390
that it might still be a better
risk than getting in the ring

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:54.990
and getting my brains knocked out.

00:42:54.990 --> 00:43:00.610
So it started to drop off
as far as new young boxers,

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:05.020
I would say, in the early 1930s.

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:09.730
But during the 1930s, they still
had full-grown Jewish boxers,

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:11.650
in the 1920s.

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:15.520
But if you went to a
training ring at that time,

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:19.470 position:56%
there would be no young boys, six or
seven, looking up at their heroes.

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:22.180
There would be none of those,
because there were no immigrants.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:28.400
In 1906, I think I mentioned,
there were 125,000 Jews from Russia

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.140
who came to the United States.

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:33.320
In 1933, there were 2,000.

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:37.400
That is how effective the
quota act of 1924 was.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:43.370
And then, everybody knows the
story, when Hitler came to power.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:46.010
Any other questions?

00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:48.670

very much for inviting me,

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:50.510
