00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.895
Now that we've learned that being clear
about value is really important for

00:00:03.895 --> 00:00:05.120
in-app purchases,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.330
what else can a game developer do
to improve their in-app purchases?

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.820
&gt;&gt; You also want to be clear about
how to use purchases in your game.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.520
Lots of games use tutorials to
show you how to use new items.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.120
&gt;&gt; When you show a player how
to use an in-app purchase,

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.820
they're much more likely
to use them in the future.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.930
&gt;&gt; Also, make sure to have
variety in your purchases

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.700
to keep people interested.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.698
And think about introducing new
items as people play the game.

00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:33.610
&gt;&gt; So you could introduce a group of
items the first day someone plays

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.735
a game and then a different
group of items a week later.

00:00:36.735 --> 00:00:40.370
&gt;&gt; Yep, variety is a great way to
keep players interested in your item.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.620
And one place, though, you should
avoid variety is your price points.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.800
Most successful games offer between
one and five price points for

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.600
all their in-app purchases.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.250
&gt;&gt; This goes back to clarity, because
the value for items at each price point

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.960
has to be very clear, and
too many options can get confusing.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.560
&gt;&gt; So to improve your in-app purchases,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.360
teach players how to use them,
offer variety, and be clear about value.
