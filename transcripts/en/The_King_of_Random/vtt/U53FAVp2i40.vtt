Hey, what's up guys? This is a video just for you fans that've been watching for a long time and sending me emails about wanting to buy some of the things from my previous videos.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.120
Now I've never ever had the time or resources in the past to make products because I'm focusing on making videos for you

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.120
But I do have a team of guys now who actually have connections to manufacturing and turning some of these things into products.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.240
So what we need to know from you is what do you want me to make!

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.040
If we were to turn some of my projects into products which ones would you want to see? Which ones would you want to buy?

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.380
Kind of what we're thinking is imagine if a little pocket slingshot came in a kit.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.460
You know it had three or four different pieces that you just assemble  father son gets together

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.240
spends an evening together and make a little backyard pocket slingshot.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.340
You can put ammunition in there, screw the cap on tight and carry it around in your pocket

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.460
That's very very cool or what about a laser assisted blowgun?

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.040
It comes in maybe three or four pieces; snap it all together; pop a laser on top and now you're in business

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.500
Shooting marshmallows around the backyard. That would be cool!

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.489
But something like the bottle blaster you get the base

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.400
And you just use water bottles to screw on and make sonic exploding targets

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.480
[It would be] very cool if you put a little chalk dust in there to make a very colorful explosion as well

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.860
And we could do them a bunch of different ways we could make kits

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.660
We could send monthly packages of things for you to put together or we could send the products themselves

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.540
Built and intact and of course the Lego silicone mold, you can use chocolate you can use.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.100
Actually you could even cast your own crayons, melt down crayons and make little Lego crayons, that'd be pretty sweet and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.300
You know so rather than getting a two-part mix and having to mix it yourself,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.400
It would just come pre-made or maybe you do want to mix it yourself. Maybe we put together some kind of kit for you, and

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.940
Make kits available. So right now this is kind of a choose-your-own-adventure

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.540
I need to know from you what you want, and they do not have to be these products guys

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.880
I just chose these because these are some of the suggestions you've reached out to me for.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.380
Do we take King of Random to the next level and start making products? The choice is yours!

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.460
I just wanted to chat with you for a second and see if this is something you really wanted.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.720
If there's enough interest maybe we will start making products and wouldn't it be cool if we started putting together a King of Random camps.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.320
Where we can get together and make projects together in the camping setting?

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.420
I don't know got kind of a lot of ideas right now, but only if you're interested

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.380
This is really for you guys!

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.960
So check the link for the description to the survey give us as much honest feedback as you can because

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.260
we're going to be building programs based on what you want.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.840
Really trying to reach out and meet the needs that you have. You can also click right here to take the survey

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.740
I'll put a little box that should take you straight to it

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.999
If you're on a mobile phone just look for the card to pop up click that and it'll take you over the survey as well

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.880
So tell me what you want. Let's see where the king of random goes from here
