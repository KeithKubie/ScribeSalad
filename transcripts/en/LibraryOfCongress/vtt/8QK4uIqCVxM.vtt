&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: We
want to welcome all of you

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.100
who are joining us via
livestream as well.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.090
We're very happy to be
livestreaming the program.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.870
I only have a couple of
housekeeping items for you.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.470
Just if you could please turn
off or silence your cell phones

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.050
for the duration
of this program,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.510
we would greatly appreciate it.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.160
And we also wanted to
let you guys know that we

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.680
as a Hispanic division have a
mailing list right in front.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.110
If any of you are
interested in finding out more

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.320
about our program and our
projects, please sign in,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.240
sign our sign-in
sheet [inaudible].

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:47.690
We are very excited for this
anniversary, and it's my honor

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.030
to introduce the
principal deputy Librarian

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.510
of Congress, Mark Sweeney.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.830
[ Applause ]

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.810
&gt;&gt; Mark Sweeney: Thank you
and everyone, welcome here

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.110
to the Library of Congress.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.370
I'm delighted to welcome
you on behalf of Dr. Hayden,

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.110
Librarian of Congress, to this
year's America's award ceremony.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.610
For 25 years, the consortium of
Latin American Studies programs,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.350
Tulane University's Stone Center
for Latin American Studies,

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.550
and Vanderbilt University's
Center

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.770
for Latin American
Studies have collaborated

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.730
with the Hispanic division
here at the Library of Congress

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.320
to celebrate children's
and young adult books

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.540
that portray Latin
America, the Caribbean,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.330
and Latinos in the
United States.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.790
I'm aware that there are many
here that have been involved

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.180
in coordinating this event,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.770
and I want to welcome
Denise Woltering-Vargas

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.570
and her colleagues here
today to the Library.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.750
But I would also like
to take this opportunity

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.030
to extend a very special
thanks to Georgette Dorn.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:03.590
Having worked at the Library
of Congress for 55 years

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.790
and having served as the
chief of the Hispanic division

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.360
with great distinction
since 1994,

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.140
Georgette is retiring
next month.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.910
She began her career at the
Library of Congress in 1962,

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.230
moving to the Hispanic
division in 1969.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.960
In her later role as chief,
she initiated the digitization

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.130
of the Handbook of
Latin American Studies

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.630
and the creation of the online
website and the digitization

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.730
of the Archive Hispanic
Literature on tape.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.310
As well as making the
collections fairly available

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.230
online, Georgette also
influenced those using

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.290
or interested in
using these resources.

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.180
Additionally, through
her administration

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.120
of the Huntington
Society Gift Fund,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.720
Georgette has awarded
internships to hundreds

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.220
of undergraduate and
graduate students to work

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.760
in the Hispanic division.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.810
Many of those interns
are now members

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.170
of the current generation

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.300
of Latin American bibliographers
in the United States.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.330
Georgette's vision and her
passion for literature,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.900
scholarship, and programming
have left an indelible mark

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.680
on our institution and have
strengthened the myriad roles

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.750
that the role the Luca
[phonetic] Hispanic culture

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.160
plays in the Library's
collections,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.140
outreach efforts
and programming.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.060
Indeed, the tradition of hosting
this particular event here

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.990
at the Library materialized
in many ways,

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.900
thanks to Georgette's belief in
the value of the Americas award.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.400
We wish her a wonderful
retirement, and we thank her

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.570
for her countless contributions
throughout her career.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.370
Georgette.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.540
[ Applause ]

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.840
Thank you.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.830
I would like to close by
just congratulating all

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.850
of those involved in the
America's Award, the organizers,

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.180
the winners, past and
present, and congratulate you

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.430
on your 25th anniversary.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.710
We hope all of you
here and those

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.290
of you watching online enjoy
this afternoon's program,

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.320
and I will pass it to the
esteemed Georgette Dorn.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.120
Thank you.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:26.400
[ Applause ]

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.700
&gt;&gt; Georgette Dorn: I'm very glad

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.230
that my last official
function is giving the,

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.440
is hosting the Americas award.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.100
We began 35 years ago with
the University of Wisconsin

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.770
in Madison, I'm sorry,
in Milwaukee,

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.340
and of course now we're doing
it with Tulane and Vanderbilt.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.080
So welcome this year's
awardees, and I'm very pleased

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.380
to welcome everybody here.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.510
Thank you.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:05:01.260
[ Applause ]

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.560
&gt;&gt; Denise Woltering-Vargas:
Good afternoon.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.160
My name is Denis
Woltering-Vargas.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.930
I'd like to say thanks,
thank you, to Catalina Gomez,

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.600
Mark Sweeney, Georgette
of course.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.410
Good afternoon and welcome
to the 2018 Americas Award.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.630
On behalf of the consortium of
Latin American Studies programs,

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.740
Vanderbilt University and Tulane
University, we welcome you

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.820
to the 25th ceremony
of these awards.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.120
We are very excited to be here,
sharing the ceremony with you

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.990
across the country, streaming
with fans across the country,

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.830
with our class members.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.070
It's a great addition this year
to be streaming and celebrating

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.650
and engaging with the award with
communities across the country.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.850
Our co-sponsors of this year's
award are working with teachers

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.770
to develop curriculum that
correspond with books,

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.010
forming book clubs, creating
book trailers, and much more.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.140
The awards are administered
by the consortium

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.440
of Latin American Studies
programs and coordinated

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.650
by both Tulane and Vanderbilt.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.320
Generous support
is also provided

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.710
by Florida International
University, Stanford University,

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.040
the Ohio State University,
UNC Duke consortium

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.770
in Latin American and Caribbean
studies, the University

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.590
of Florida, the University
of New Mexico, the University

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.260
of Texas at Austin, University
of Utah, and the University

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.830
of Wisconsin Milwaukee.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.400
A lot of really great
support from our centers

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.330
from across the country.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.400
Our awards are given up to two
books each year and are selected

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.510
for their distinctive
literary quality,

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:37.320
cultural contextualization,
exceptional integration of text,

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.510
illustration and design and
potential for classroom use.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.180
The goal of this award
is to link the Americas,

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.010
to reach beyond geographic
borders, focusing instead

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.430
on cultural heritages
within the hemisphere.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.630
I'd like to take a moment to
say thank you to our committee.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:58.080
Many of our committee members
are here with us today.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.640
This year's Americas Award
review committee was comprised

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.770
of teachers, librarians,
faculty, and community activists

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:11.350
from Tennessee, Texas, Illinois,
North Carolina and Wisconsin.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.760
This year Paula Mason was
our chair of the committee.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.340
She is a librarian for the
Waukesha Public Library

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.640
in Wisconsin.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.660
Just to give you an
idea of the process

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.960
that our committee goes through.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.030
In the fall, books arrive,
throughout the year.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.670
By January we have our list.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:34.430
We set up Skype calls in the
spring and chat for hours

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.150
over weekends about
amazing books,

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.360
and they are spirited
conversations

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.640
about the diverse cultures of
Latin America and the Caribbean.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.970
Coleen and I are extremely
grateful for the hard work

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.640
of the committee, and
the care that they put

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.090
into this year's award
winners, the honorable mentions,

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:54.170
and the commended titles.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:59.310
I'd like to share some
messages about our founder

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:00.840
of the Americas Award, Julie.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.390
The Americas Award began
as an idea 25 years ago

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.220
by my colleague, Julie.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.900
She is the associate director
at the Center for Latin American

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.630
and Caribbean studies
at the University

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.800
of Wisconsin Milwaukee,
a member of class.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.280
She started the award when no
other award recognizing Latin

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.040
America and Latino
culture in children's

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.130
and young adult literature
yet existed.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.470
Her idea became one of the most
important projects of class.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.620
It has enabled scholars of
Latin America to come together

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.800
and engage with children's
literature in many diverse ways.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.220
It has become our passion and
our responsibility to educators

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.110
to read and share authentic
and engaging literature

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:41.650
for the K12 classroom.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.300
I want to thank Julie
by presenting

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.660
to her a symbol she
once created years ago,

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.850
a weaving from Guatemala
that represents the weaving

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.230
of stories and voices
of the Americas.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.210
I'd like to invite my
daughter, Valeca [phonetic],

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:58.970
to share our token of thanks.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:05.050
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:13.180
[ Applause ]

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.220
I got to see the whole thing.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.520
Thanks.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.820
&gt;&gt; I want to thank
you by presenting this

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.730
and say muchas gracias, Julie.

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:23.530
Come on up.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:31.900
[ Applause ]

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.690
&gt;&gt; Julie Kline: Good afternoon.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.260
Wow, 25 years [inaudible].

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:44.650
In his 1998 acceptance speech
for the circuit at the Library

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.210
of Congress for the
Americas Award.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:50.960
Author Francisco
Jimenez said for most

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.430
of my school days I didn't find

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.450
in the literature
the experiences

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.490
that I had gone through,
so I decided

00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:59.970
that it was very
important to promote

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:04.620
in any way possible ethnic
American literature and also

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.490
to contribute to that
body of literature.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.080
And I thought that it
was important to do

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.270
that because the curriculum,
what we study in school,

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.010
reflects who we are as a people.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:20.350
So if we do not see
ourselves as students,

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:23.360
if we do not see ourselves
reflected in the curriculum,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.280
in the literature, in the
music, in the art that we study,

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.550
then we do not arrive
at a good understanding

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.740
of who we are personally
and who we are as a nation.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.670
From the start, our goals for
the Americas Award were simple.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.120
To highlight books that allow
children and young adults

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.690
to see themselves
in the literature,

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.230
to encourage U.S.
publication of such books,

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:51.530
to showcase the diversity of
Latin America, the Caribbean,

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.960
U.S. Latin Next, and other
diasporic Americas communities

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.530
in the hemisphere, and
to encourage young people

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.330
to read engaging
stories about lives

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:05.520
and cultures perhaps
different to them.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.230
The Americas Award was inspired

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.020
by the Children's
Africana Book Award, CABA,

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.760
created by Africa Access
with the Outreach Council

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.360
of the African Studies
Association.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.400
The book award concept seemed
a perfect project to propose

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.590
to the class teaching
and outreach committee.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.820
I had some background that
made me really interested

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.480
in internationalism
in children's books,

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.010
and the committee at the
time was extremely receptive

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.670
to the idea.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.390
And we did an event
through my center

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.500
in 1991 called Reading
Latin America,

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.290
both at Columbia Teachers
College and in Milwaukee,

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.000
which was, I sort of count
that as a starting point

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.710
because it gave us a sense of
what was out there at the time

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:53.470
in terms of this kind of
content in children's books.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:57.270
The class committee helped
shape the award criteria,

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:59.130
and in doing so,
we decided to focus

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:02.080
on the multi-cultural
international dynamic,

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.540
including the Latin Next
experience in the U.S.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.210
and including all the Americas,

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:10.490
not just Spanish-speaking
countries and communities.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.220
We also determined the award
should be more than recognition

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.280
of winners but rather should
include an annotated annual

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:21.000
bibliography of commended titles
to be a guide for classroom use

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.610
and for Library collection
development.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:28.860
As we refine the aware rationale
and criteria and discuss what

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.220
to include and where
to draw lines, if any,

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.560
I remember the comment
by Linda Hahn Miller,

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.140
who was a former
outreach coordinator

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.260
at the University of Florida.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:43.120
Said Linda, the world is made
up of lumpers and splitters.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.930
That is, people who think about
commonalities and connections

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.430
and those who think about
difference in separation.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.820
I think for all of us shaping
the early Americas Award,

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.700
we aim to be lumpers
through and through.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:01.750
So the award was further refined
over the years by the expertise,

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.430
thoughtfulness, and commitment

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.700
of the National Review
Committee members, all of you

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.420
and all of your predecessors.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:12.250
And as it's matured, other
children's book awards,

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:16.020
such as the Pura Belpre and the
Tomas Rivera were established.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.130
Each award makes a contribution,
and we've dovetailed with each,

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:22.140
I think, in a way that
broadly benefits the field

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.710
of children's literature.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:28.000
In the case of the Americas,
both the Award's recognition

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.170
of the diversity of
Americas and the inclusion

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.040
of a criterion focused
specifically on potentials

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:39.150
of classroom use helps make
it's contributions unique.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:45.470
So, I remember writing a letter
after the first competition

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:46.820
when Becky Guenther, masqueraded

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.120
by Lula de la Croix
[phonetic] run,

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:53.210
I think we had a whole six
books on the commended list,

00:13:53.210 --> 00:13:54.740
and wrote a letter
to the committee,

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.060
I believe there was onion
skin paper involved.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:02.620
It was back then, and it said
something about we'll look back

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.950
on this 20 years from now
and look at what we started.

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.390
Well, it's been 25 years.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:12.960
And there's been over 400 titles
recognized since 1993 as winner,

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.880
honor, and commended books.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.830
And the ongoing relationship
with the Library

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:22.650
of Congress has given
us a remarkable way

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:27.270
to truly celebrate the books,
authors, and illustrators.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:32.860
Creatively coordinated since
2011 by Vanderbilt and Tulane,

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.350
the Americas Award is stronger
and more vibrant than ever,

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:39.720
and it's enhanced by the
innovative outreach programming,

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.010
by colleagues at Latin
American study centers

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:45.570
across the U.S. Diversity

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.630
in children's literature
has a long way to go,

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.370
but we can all appreciate the
Americas Award and in children's

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.470
and young adult literature
has made a 25-year

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.570
and counting contribution
to diversity.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:00.410
In recognition of books of
distinctive literary quality,

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:04.290
cultural contextualization,
noteworthy integration of text,

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:08.150
illustration, and design, and
potential for classroom use.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.510
[foreign language
spoken] Thank you.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:16.040
[ Applause ]

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.590
I do want to go back
very briefly to,

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.850
back to Georgette Dorn.

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:27.800
The relationship of the Library

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:32.910
of Congress has been really
valuable for the Americas Award,

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:36.460
and it was you and I at
a meeting in New Orleans,

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.390
getting in a car after
a committee meeting,

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:44.090
going to lunch, and Georgette
said, we should have this

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:45.390
at the Library of Congress.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:48.500
And I said, uh-huh,
that'd be really swell.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.270
It was because of Georgette
and the commitment of Georgette

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:56.640
in the Hispanic division over
the years that we've been able

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.650
to give this kind of
weight, this kind of value

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:03.870
to the Americas Award, and
it's very much Georgette

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.170
and the Hispanic division.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:06.970
So, thank you, Georgette,
very much.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:10.430
[ Applause ]

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:13.680
I believe the Americas Award
has a present finally for you

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.980
after all these years.

&gt;&gt; Denise Woltering-Vargas:
Can you [inaudible].

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.990
&gt;&gt; Julie Kline: If anybody
has helped with the weaving

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.980
of stories, it's Georgette Dorn.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.280
Thank you, Georgette.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:36.350

[laughter] Thank you all.

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:49.670

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.450
commended titles.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.810
Several English-Spanish
bilingual picture books made our

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:15.160
commended list.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.750

written by Dr. Juan Guerra,

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.120
and illustrated by
Victoria Castillo.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:27.520
In this story, a young boy
dreams of becoming a doctor.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.190
This delightful book is based

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.570
on the writer's childhood
experience,

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:35.640

In Marti's Song for
Freedom by Emma Otheguy,

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.980
illustrated by Beatriz
Vidal, we learn of Jose Marti

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.970
and his tireless
efforts in speaking

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:07.910
out for Cuba's independence
from Spain as well

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:10.950
as the love he shared
for his two countries.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.310
Another biographical
piece is Ruben Dario,

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:19.280
written by Georgina Laazaro
and illustrated by Lonnie Ruiz.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.860
In this poetic piece,

journalist, novelist,

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.520
and diplomat, Ruben Dario.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.830
to Midnight charmingly
captures the celebratory spirit

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.980
of día de los Muertos.

and former Americas
Award winning author,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.450
Margarita Engle captivates
us with her poetry in Bravo,

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:57.950
poems about amazing Hispanics.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.590
The vibrant illustrations

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:03.210
of Rafael Lopez complement
each diverse character

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:05.930
and the role they
played in history.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.370
Margarita is recognized today
for having a second title

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:13.020
on our commended
list, Forest World.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.070
In this timely novel written
in verse, she introduces us

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.760
to the story of two siblings,
one in the United States,

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.310
and one in Cuba, who
were unaware of the other

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:28.350
until they are reunited to
spend a summer together in Cuba.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.740
Family stands as a
strong theme of several

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.240
of our commended titles.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.060
In The Epic Fail of Arturo
Zamora, eighth grader,

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.470
Arturo's summer gets off

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:42.070
to a pretty typical start
until things go awry.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:44.760
Author Pablo Cartaya
tells an intriguing story

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.250
that will have you rooting
for Arturo in his efforts

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:49.580
to save not only
the family business

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.060
but his community's
identity as well.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:56.250
Keeping with the theme of
family, The Inexplicable Logic

00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:01.600
of My Life, written by Benjamin
Alire Saenz, tells the story

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:06.060
of a white 17-year-old boy
raised by a gay Mexican father.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:09.720
It is a story of resiliency,
what makes a family,

00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.530
and the connections
that bind us.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:16.110
In The First Rule of Punk,
author Celia Perez introduces us

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:19.920
to Maria Luisa, better
known as Malu.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.770
After moving to Chicago from
California, Malu must deal

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.620
with the familiar changes
of being a new kid in town

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.910
and embracing her punk identity.

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:33.850
We see a young girl become the
hero of her own story in Lucia,

Cynthia Leonor Garza,

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.760

This delightful book
offers a cultural view

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:47.190
of Mexican superheroes
and celebrates the courage

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:51.390
and determination of
girls all over the world.

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:54.790

winning author, Monica Brown,

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:58.450
brought us The Biography
of Frida Kahlo in her book,

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:03.660

illustrated by John Parra.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.820
This captivating
story is presented

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:10.720
from the unique perspective
of her beloved pet.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.100
In the thriller Disappeared,
written by Francisco Stork,

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.650
two Mexican teenagers
are inadvertently drawn

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.570
into the world of drug
trafficking, kidnapping,

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.110
corruption, and violence.

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:25.580
Our last commended
title this year is Sing,

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:28.770
Don't Cry, by Angela Dominguez.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:33.090
This story is inspired by the
Mexican ballad, Cielito Lindo,

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.620
which is a loving tribute
to her grandfather,

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:40.810
successful mariachi musician
Apolinar Navarrette Diaz.

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:42.230
Please give a round of applause

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:46.510
for the 2018 Americas
Award commended titles.

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:56.060
[ Applause ]

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.360
And now I have the pleasure

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.840
of chairing the 2018 Americas
Award honorable mention titles.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.600
Our first book, All
the Way to Havana,

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.230
written by Margarita Engle,
and illustrated by Mike Curato,

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.410
is the delightful story
of a young boy travelling

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:14.470
to the big city of Havana, Cuba,

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:17.960
in his family's old
blue car, Cara Cara.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.300
Along the way they experience
the sights and sounds

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.180
of the streets, the
beautiful cars putt-putting

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:25.920
and bumpety-bumping
along the way.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.970
This engaging story
celebrates the spirit

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:30.490
of the young boy's
family as well as that

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:33.480
of the Cuban people they
greet along the way.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:37.230
Margarita Engle's masterful
use of onomatopoeia coupled

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:38.530
with the brilliant illustrations

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:41.270
of Mike Curato make this
an engaging read aloud

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.570
for the young reader.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:46.520
Our second book,
Lucky Broken Girl,

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:50.590
is based on the inspirational
story of author, Ruth Behar.

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:54.260
Having recently emigrated
to New York in the 1960's,

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.460
fifth grader, Ruthie Mizrahi
[phonetic], a Cuban Jewish girl,

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.360
feels that she is finally
starting to fit in.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.770
School is going well,
and she has become known

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:05.600
as the neighborhood
hot-scotch queen.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.910
Tragically, Ruthie is involved
in a horrific car accident

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:11.080
that nearly cost her her life.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:14.470
She is so badly injured that
she is forced to lie in bed

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:18.540
in a body cast immobilized
for nearly a year.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.420
This inspirational story allows
us to witness the struggles

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.780
and successes that ultimately
form the diverse friendships

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:29.720
that bring hope, healing, and
happiness back into her life.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.350
Please join me in congratulating
the 2018 honorable mention

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:35.700
titles, their authors,
and illustrators.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:37.500
Thank you.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:58.300
[ Applause ]

00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:59.980
&gt;&gt; Emily Chavez: Good afternoon.

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:04.860
I'm Emily Chavez, and I'm the
associate director in the Center

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.120
for Multicultural Affairs
at Duke University,

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:11.390
and I'm here also on behalf
of the UNC Duke Consortium

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:13.500
in Latin America and
Caribbean Studies.

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:18.680
It is my great pleasure to
present this 2018 Americas Award

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.970
to Duncan Tonatiuh for
his children's book Danza!

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:27.630
Amalia Hernández and El
Ballet Folklórico de México.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.710
You may know that Mr.
Tonatiuh is a prolific author

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.520
and illustrator whose
work has been recognized

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.450
by the Americas Award
several times.

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:39.120
In addition to this
award we present today,

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:43.310
Mr. Tonatiuh was a 2015
Americas Award winner

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:45.200
for his book Separate
is Never Equal,

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.940
and he won honorable
mentions in 2014 and 2016,

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.630
in addition to having
multiple books

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:53.710
on our commended titles list.

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:55.590
Thus, I would like
to thank Mr. Tonatiuh

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:57.040
for his many contributions

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.510
to Latin American
children's literature.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:03.500
Danza documents an important
part of Latin American

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.640
and performing arts history.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:09.300
It is the story of Amalia
Hernandez' life work

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.020
to create a dance company that
brought to life the history

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:16.000
and the many indigenous
identities and cultures

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.050
of Mexico through
contemporary movement.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:24.210
Hernandez' dance choreography in
many ways was about recognizing

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:26.940
and honoring Mexico's
history and in turn,

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:30.200
Mr. Tonatiuh does the
same in telling the story

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:34.120
of Amalia Hernandez' life
long devotion to her craft

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.850
and the impact it made
on Mexico and the world.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:41.290
In his typical [inaudible]
inspired style

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.920
with creative textures
and rich colors,

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.320
Mr. Tonatiuh draws
readers into the pages.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:50.490
This book is the first of
it's kind to tell the story

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.910
of Amalia Hernandez to
a children's audience,

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:57.160
and in this way makes more
accessible a Latin American

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.890
pioneer in the arts.

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:00.890
I imagine young Latina dancers

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:04.620
and any young dancer reading
this story with pleasure.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.370
Empowered with the knowledge

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:09.420
of who came before
them, who paved the way.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.980
I would like to now
present Duncan Tonatiuh

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.250
with the 2018 Americas
Award for children's

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.510
and young adult literature.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:39.270
[ Applause ]

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:41.900
&gt;&gt; Duncan Tonatiuh: Thank
you and I'm very happy,

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.730
very grateful to be here.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:48.640
I want to congratulate my fellow
authors/illustrators whose work

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.580
is also being celebrated,
recognized today.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.870
I'm very thankful to
CLAS to the committee

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.900
for celebrating my work,
for choosing my work,

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.600
and all these other
wonderful books

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.300
that you're presenting today.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:08.280
I think, you know, the Americas
Award does a wonderful job

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:12.630
in doing that and highlighting
and creating this list of books,

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:15.380
this body of work that
celebrates Latin America

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:22.050
and Latinos in the U.S.
I also really appreciate

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:25.590
and feel very grateful to CLAS
for their continual support,

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:29.590
that they've recognized
some of my work in the past,

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:32.960
and in the job they
do, creating resources

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.180
to use the books
in the classroom.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.430
I think that's something
very special and wonderful

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:40.430
that the Americas Award does
creating different guides

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.410
in different ways of not
only recognizing the books

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:46.980
but to then making
them useful to teachers

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.390
and to people in the classroom.

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:52.220
I take the opportunity to
thank the people at Abrams,

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:53.760
who made this book possible,

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.100
and I feel very grateful
to the people there.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:01.490
And, you know, it takes a
whole team to create a book,

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:05.030
and I've been making books with
Abrams now for almost ten years,

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:09.130
and it's been a wonderful
relationship, and I'm very happy

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:14.410
that they've supported my work
and helped it be successful,

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:17.360
and I especially want to thank
my editor, Howard Reeves,

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.120
who has always been
very thoughtful

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:25.330
and has made my work
better by his thoughtful

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:29.280
and careful editing but also
for being a friend and just kind

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:33.210
of looking after me and
supporting my vision

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:34.510
in the books that
I want to create.

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:40.040
I want to thank my family, you
know, my wife, for her love

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.700
and for her partnership,

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.740
for being a partner
in this adventure.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:49.290
To my kids, who are just my, I
have a three-year-old daughter,

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.540
[inaudible], and a
one-year-old son, Maximo,

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:56.860
who just bring a lot
of joy and happiness,

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.930
and I thank them for that.

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:02.050
And I just want to tell
really briefly a little bit

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:06.390
of how this book came about,
give you a little bit of sort

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:09.770
of the story behind the book.

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.450
My wife, Patty, she's a dancer.

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:15.660
She's classically trained,
and she does modern

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.680
and contemporary dance.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.600
And the last year she's been
aerial dance with the hoop

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.900
and the straps and the trapeze.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.480
And I've done a few
illustrations inspired

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.210
by her dancing, and I
like dancing myself and I

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:33.610
like watching dance, so I've
made some images about that.

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:38.340
And so it's something that I'm
interested in, that I like.

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.550
My wife's mother was a dancer,

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:43.820
and her grandmother was
actually a dancer too,

00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:46.330
and my wife's mother,
my mother-in-law,

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:50.790
she danced with Ballet
[foreign language] in the '70's

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.480
for a few years, and so that's--

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.870
and it just kind of came up
in conversation at some point,

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:58.820
and that gave me the
idea of making a book

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:00.120
about Amalia Hernandez.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:04.270
So that's sort of on one hand.

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:07.580
On the other hand, another
reason for doing the book,

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:10.980
like I remember, I grew up
in Mexico, and I remember

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:13.250
when I was like seven
or eight years old,

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:14.880
dressing up like a charro

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.530
and dancing the [foreign
language spoken],

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:19.830
and it's a very common
experience,

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:22.220
a very popular experience,
you know, for a kid,

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:25.150
especially I think, you know,
to celebrate a special occasion

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:29.570
like Mother's Day or the end
of the school year, to dance,

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:33.100
to do, to perform
a folkloric dance.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.050
And later on when
I was a teenager,

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:37.860
I came to the United States,

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:41.690
and I saw in the United States
folkloric dance was also very

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:45.380
popular and important,
especially for occasions

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:48.120
when different kinds of people
celebrate their culture,

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.880
celebrate their heritage.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:52.660
In the case of Mexican
American people, you know,

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:55.760
on days like Cinco de Mayo

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.530
or [foreign language
spoken] it's a way to show

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:03.200
that you're proud of your
roots, to display your culture,

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:10.680
and so I wanted to
do a book about dance

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.820
and especially folkloric
dance, because I know that it's

00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:17.800
such an important experience,
not only in the country

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.870
where it comes from,
in this case in Mexico,

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:23.070
but also in the U.S., you know.

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:25.330
And when I heard my
mother-in-law talking

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:28.210
about the folkloric ballet, it
just made sense to me to do it

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.850
about Amalia Hernandez, a woman
that really dedicated her life

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:36.250
to learning about the
traditional dances of Mexico

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:40.220
and to then being able to
adapt them to the theater

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:45.530
and being able to share
then in the world stage.

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:50.740
So, again, I just want to say
thank you, I'm very grateful.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.040
I'm very happy.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:56.960
I feel very fortunate for
all the support and for all

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.300
that the Americas Award does.

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.510
So thank you very much.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:20.040
[ Applause ]

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.880

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:24.180
[laughter] Good afternoon.

My name is Paula Mason, and
I'm a reference librarian

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.440
It's a great honor to
be here with you today.

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.910
I have the privilege

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:37.580
of introducing a truly
phenomenal author, Ibi Zoboi,

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:41.130
whose debut fiction title
American Streets moved our

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:44.040
hearts and spirit
immensely this year.

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.990
Through Ibi's confident
and powerful prose,

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:48.940
we have the chance
to meet Fabiola,

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:50.830
a young Haitian teenager

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:53.710
who finds herself painfully
separated from her mother

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:57.040
as they seek une belle
vie, a beautiful future,

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:01.220
in the United States with her
aunt and cousins in Detroit.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:05.210
This story is so many things as
once, but to name just a few,

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:10.060
it's a tale of great bravery,
resilience of spirit and faith,

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:13.440
and a culture and a family which
helped carry us through times

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.780
of unimaginable loss and
rebuilding our future

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:19.160
when everything falls apart.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.730
It also pierces through
our hearts and minds

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:25.140
with the timeliest of
themes, such as immigration,

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.660
family separation, and
the senseless tragedy

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.220
of the young lives lost.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.640
However, at the crossroads
of American Street,

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.070
Ibi never leaves the
reader behind without hope.

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:39.780
Rather, she brings
us alongside Fabiola

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.340
and her ever-evolving
journey towards achieving her

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:43.670
own dreams.

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:46.690
Thank you so much for this
gift, Ibi, and it is an honor

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:49.220
to present you, to have
you here and present you

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:52.510
with an Americas Award.

00:33:52.510 --> 00:34:09.210
[ Applause ]

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:11.250
&gt;&gt; Ibi Zoboi: Good
afternoon everyone.

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:13.190
Thank you so much.

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:16.380
This is such a huge
honor for me.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:22.330
Thank you to the consortium for
Latin American Studies programs

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:26.640
and everyone involved in this
award and award ceremony.

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.520
I'd like to thank my publisher,

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:32.230
Harper Collins [inaudible]
imprint, and I'd also

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:34.860
like to thank my editors,
Alisandra Balzer [phonetic]

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:37.750
and Haley Lagwich [phonetic] of
Alloy [phonetic] Entertainment.

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:40.780
I'd like to thank my
family and all the programs,

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:44.380
the writing programs and the
workshops that got me here.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:48.560
I've been writing for 15 years
and trying to get published.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:53.000
American Street is my debut
novel, and I'm so happy

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.400
and thrilled and honored to
see how it's been honored

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:01.060
over the last two years,
the feedback from teachers,

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:05.530
librarians, and students, and
I'm just overjoyed at the fact

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:09.180
that readers, young readers, are
still discovering this story.

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:13.260
I will share a little bit about
why, how American Street came

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.520
to be, why this sort of story
is very important to me,

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:22.100
and most importantly, I'm really
grateful that I am honored

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:28.350
by an award that upholds
Latin American culture.

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:31.420
I am a Haitian immigrant,
and as you know,

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.990
Haiti is not a Spanish-speaking
country.

00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:39.350
It is a Francophone Caribbean
nation, and based on that fact,

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:41.970
it kind of stands
out on it's own.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:45.290
However, it is also a
Latin American country

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:49.610
which I just discovered I never
considered Haiti being part

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:54.710
of this larger conversation
of Spanish-speaking countries

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:58.190
or ever associating
it to anything Latin.

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:00.750
Our history was that
of revolution,

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:05.570
of French colonization and
African cultural retentions.

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:09.460
So only recently did I begin
to think about what it means

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:13.730
to be a Latin American
nation and what it means

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:17.270
to be an Afro-Latinx nation.

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:21.430
My recently published book is
called Pride, it's the Pride

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:24.230
and Prejudice remix, or
just a light retelling

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:25.530
of the literary classic,

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.860
and it features a
Haitian-Dominican character.

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:31.450
And as you may or may not know,

00:36:31.450 --> 00:36:35.690
Haiti and Dominican
Republic have been at odds,

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:39.710
historical odds, cultural
odds, and you know,

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:42.820
there's a language
barrier as well.

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:46.770
And I was thrilled
that Elizabeth Acevedo,

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:50.040
who is a Dominican author,
the author of Poet X,

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.000
did the narration for Pride.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.470
And in that process,
in that sort

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:57.760
of collaboration we realized
that we were healing both

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.090
of our respective countries.

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:05.540
So being honored for this
award that has the title Latin

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:09.970
in it is also just, it means
a lot to me, because Haiti

00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:13.470
in itself can be very isolated

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:16.230
from the larger Caribbean
culture

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:19.200
and within the western
hemisphere itself,

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.270
being dubbed the poorest country
in the western hemisphere,

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:26.790
being one of the countries
that has the closest ties

00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:33.460
to African culture, and part
of writing American Street was

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:38.210
about retaining the
culture that has been sort

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:41.260
of bastardized in
the western media.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:45.300
In American Street, Fabiola
holds onto her Vaudou culture,

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:49.720
and it meant a lot to me to
make that authentic and real

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:52.100
and not make our traditions

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:56.810
and our culture a
caricature in this novel.

00:37:56.810 --> 00:38:01.960
And when readers and
thought leaders, teachers,

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:07.930
and librarians recognize that,
to me that is sort of defiance

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:13.390
and a pushback against what the
mainstream has been feeding us

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:16.930
for the last few decades
about my home country.

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:20.330
So, I'm going to share
the author's note

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:24.010
from American Street,
because I've only written it.

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:28.930
I remember it being a tough
process between my editors and I

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:33.740
to figure out the how's and
why of this story so that

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:36.600
when readers turn to the
last page, whatever it is

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:39.700
that happens in that last
scene in American Street,

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.190
there's an author's
note for readers to kind

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:47.090
of unpack what has
happened and for readers

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:49.740
to understand my intentions.

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:54.070
One of the things that really
care about is being understood.

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:57.410
And I don't always have,
authors don't always have the

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:00.650
opportunity to state their
intentions in a book,

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:04.380
and sometimes we have a certain
sort of insecurity in terms

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:07.780
of did I get my meaning
across, did I get,

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.970
did readers understand
what I was trying to do,

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:15.970
and sometimes those validations
come from awards like this.

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:20.070
And it also comes from the
committees who plan those awards

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:23.760
and read other books and put
your work up against others

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.830
and others that are
really qualified

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:30.410
as well and see it's value.

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:32.490
So, again, I have
to say thank you.

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:34.790
I have to put this down.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.130
So while I did not
come to this country

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:43.480
as a 16-year-old, Fabiola did.

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:47.080
I came to this country
as a four-year-old.

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.200
I moved, the first
neighborhood I moved

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.240
to in New York is a neighborhood
called Bushwick, Brooklyn,

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.380
and I'll explain a little
bit more about Bushwick

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:00.780
and what it means to come
from such a beautiful island,

00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:05.370
I think all the Latin Americas
are like that, tropical, warm,

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:11.340
family, love, food, and to have
that American dream and to come

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:15.110
from what's considered a broken
nation by the western media,

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:18.640
and it is in many
ways, to a broken city,

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.280
which Detroit is still
coming back from,

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:24.380
and many of our cities are
like this as well, and the kind

00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:29.260
of conflict that happens
in that sort of exchange.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:32.210
So the first seeds of American
Street were planted in me

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:36.520
when I read a New York Times
article entitled Last Stop

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:39.750
on the L Train, Detroit.

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:42.390
The article was about the
far-reaching gentrification

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:45.160
of Brooklyn, New York, and it's
progression towards Detroit,

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.640
Michigan.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:49.370
The real last stop on
the L train is Canarsie,

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:51.860
but Bushwick is the
last stop for whites

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:56.630
and affluent residents who won't
venture too deep into Brooklyn.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:59.390
I was four years old when
my mother and I left Haiti,

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.240
and Bushwick was our
first home in America.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:06.650
I didn't know it then, but
1980s Bushwick was described

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:09.430
as resembling a war zone.

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:14.030
While our house on Hancock
Street was fairly intact,

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:16.440
other blocks were lined
with burnt-out buildings

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:21.040
and open lots littered with
torn mattresses and old tires.

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:24.190
When I read the New York Times
article, I remember thinking,

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:26.040
how does present-day
Detroit compare

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.610
to the Bushwick I grew up in?

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:31.470
It seems like there were too
many parallels to ignore.

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:33.980
I could transpose my
own life as an immigrant

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.110
onto the timelines of Detroit.

00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:38.600
I could write a book that
rides the train from Bushwick

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.840
to Detroit and tell the
story of a girl, like me,

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.400
who found her way
to the other side.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.690
While writing American Street,
I pulled from my own memories

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:52.600
of living in between
cultures, the experiences I had

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.590
in high school and the
many tragic stories

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:58.660
about the violence and trauma
that girls have endured.

00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:01.020
In Haiti, many girls
dream of freedom to live

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:03.770
without the constraints
of oppression.

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:06.250
Yet, more often than
not, these girls

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:09.440
and their families leave their
home countries only to move

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.760
to other broken and
disenfranchised communities.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:16.290
I kept thinking about how these
girls negotiate their own values

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:19.630
and culture with the
need to survive and aim

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:20.930
for the American dream.

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:26.700
When Trayvon Martin was killed
in Florida in February of 2012,

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:30.710
he had been on the phone with
Rachel Jeantel, the daughter

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:32.760
of a Haitian immigrant.

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.620
During her testimony in
the George Zimmerman trial,

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:39.500
I recognized a little
bit of myself in Rachel

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:41.930
and in the many Haitian
teen girls I've worked

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:43.750
with over the years.

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:46.760
We fold our immigrant
selves into this veneer

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:50.120
of what we think is
African American girlhood.

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:52.930
The result is more
jagged than smooth.

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:55.780
This tension between
our inherited identity

00:42:55.780 --> 00:43:00.360
and our newly adopted selves
filters into our relationships

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.610
with other girls, with the boys
we love, and how we interact

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:06.940
with the broken [inaudible]
around us.

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:08.590
I saw Fabiola in these girls,

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:11.860
and that's how the
story was truly born.

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:15.090
I wanted to give Fabiola a
strong cultural connection

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:18.450
to Haiti so that she's
spiritually grounded when faced

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:20.410
with a tough decision.

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:23.540
While Vaudou is practiced by
many in the Haitian diaspora,

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:26.240
it still has a negative
stereotype in the media

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:30.330
as being associated with
evil and witchcraft.

00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:35.240
Vaudou has a complex pantheon
and mythological system much

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:36.970
like Greek and Roman mythology.

00:43:36.970 --> 00:43:41.150
Through Fabiola's eyes, her
new world and the people

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:45.030
who inhabit it are just
as complex and magical

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:46.870
as her beloved saint
[inaudible].

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:50.730
She infused Vaudou into
everything that happens to her.

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:53.020
This is the source of courage,

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:56.290
and I think she is more
American because of it.

00:43:56.290 --> 00:44:00.150
This merging of traditions,
this blending of cultures

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:03.450
from one broken place
to another.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:08.010
I remember those rides on the L
train with my mother very well.

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:11.490
Graffiti covered every
inch of the train cars.

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:14.550
I once saw a young man steel
a diamond ring right off a

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:16.300
woman's finger.

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:19.720
My mother pulled me in close
and prayed under her breath.

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:23.790
We'd made it to the other
side, just like Fabiola,

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:27.070
but what was this life?

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:29.440
I don't know what my life would
have been like if I had grown

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:33.100
up in Haiti, but I
know this much is true.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:36.450
I would not have
told this story.

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:38.510
Thank you very much.

&gt;&gt; Colleen McCoy:
Thank you, Ibi.

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:53.640
Hi everyone.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.400
My name is Colleen McCoy,
and I am the co-coordinator

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.100
of the Americas Award.

00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:00.980
Thank you, again, to the Library
of Congress, to Georgette Dorn,

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:04.570
Catalina Gomez, and the Hispanic
division, to the founder

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:06.970
of the Americas Award,
Julie Kline,

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:10.180
and to all of the authors,
illustrators, and publishers

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:13.210
who submitted to
this year's award.

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:16.540
Thank you to the Consortium of
Latin American Studies programs

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:18.000
and all of these
years' sponsors.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.950
And thank you to an
incredible review committee,

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:24.670
especially the committee
chair, Paula Mason.

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:27.190
The thoughtfulness and the
dedication of the award

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:30.790
of each committee member
is truly inspiring.

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:35.160
The Americas Award is not
just a children's book award

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.160
but also represents a
variety of resources

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:40.400
for teachers and librarians.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.610
To commemorate this
special 25th anniversary,

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:46.190
we have put together a
comprehensive toolkit

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:50.240
for teachers, librarians, and
outreach professionals to use

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:54.540
as a guide for engaging with
books recognized by the award.

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:58.690
This toolkit provides classroom
activities, curriculum,

00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:01.910
ideas for community events
and teacher workshops,

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:04.680
and many other resources
and will soon be available

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:08.360
on the class website
shown in your program.

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.970
We extend our gratitude
to Keira Philipp-Schnurer

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:12.980
from the University
of New Mexico

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:15.970
for leading this special
project and for her work

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:19.820
on our 25th anniversary
commemorative poster.

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:22.960
This special poster
features beautiful artwork

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.800
by Americas Award winner
Rafael Lopez, and we invite you

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.090
to take one with you today.

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:33.160
At this time, please join us
for a reception and book signing

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:34.860
with this year's winners.

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:37.410
You're welcome to purchase
titles just through these doors

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:41.750
to the back, and Ibi and Duncan
will be in the adjacent room.

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:43.380
Thank you all so
much for coming,

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:45.510
and we'll see you next year.
