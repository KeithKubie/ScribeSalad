00:00:06.821 --> 00:00:10.809
Imagine you're on a game show,
and you can choose between two prizes:

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.438
a diamond

00:00:12.438 --> 00:00:14.378
or a bottle of water.

00:00:14.378 --> 00:00:15.679
It's an easy choice.

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.028
The diamonds are clearly more valuable.

00:00:18.028 --> 00:00:20.523
Now imagine being given 
the same choice again,

00:00:20.523 --> 00:00:22.780
only this time, you're not on a game show,

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.660
but dehydrated in the desert 
after wandering for days.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.320
Do you choose differently?

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.830
Why? Aren't diamonds still more valuable?

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.260
This is the paradox of value,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.228
famously described 
by pioneering economist Adam Smith.

00:00:38.228 --> 00:00:43.214
And what it tells us is that defining 
value is not as simple as it seems.

00:00:43.214 --> 00:00:47.349
On the game show, you were thinking about
each item's exchange value,

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:50.341
what you could obtain for them
at a later time,

00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:52.990
but in an emergency,
like the desert scenario,

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.213
what matters far more is their use value,

00:00:56.213 --> 00:00:59.250
how helpful they are 
in your current situation.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.971
And because we only get to choose
one of the options,

00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:05.100
we also have to consider 
its opportunity cost,

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.460
or what we lose by giving up
the other choice.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.961
After all, it doesn't matter how much
you could get from selling the diamond

00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:14.572
if you never make it out of the desert.

00:01:14.572 --> 00:01:17.532
Most modern economists deal with
the paradox of value

00:01:17.532 --> 00:01:20.032
by attempting 
to unify these considerations

00:01:20.032 --> 00:01:22.071
under the concept of utility,

00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:25.573
how well something satisfies
a person's wants or needs.

00:01:25.573 --> 00:01:28.580
Utility can apply to anything
from the basic need for food

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.782
to the pleasure of hearing 
a favorite song,

00:01:30.782 --> 00:01:35.051
and will naturally vary 
for different people and circumstances.

00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:38.534
A market economy provides us
with an easy way to track utility.

00:01:38.534 --> 00:01:41.422
Put simply, the utility 
something has to you

00:01:41.422 --> 00:01:44.262
is reflected by how much you'd be
willing to pay for it.

00:01:44.262 --> 00:01:46.433
Now, imagine yourself back in the desert,

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:50.251
only this time, you get offered 
a new diamond or a fresh bottle of water

00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:52.033
every five minutes.

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:55.691
If you're like most people, you'll first
choose enough water to last the trip,

00:01:55.691 --> 00:01:58.793
and then as many diamonds
as you can carry.

00:01:58.793 --> 00:02:01.293
This is because of something called
marginal utility,

00:02:01.293 --> 00:02:04.162
and it means that when you choose
between diamonds and water,

00:02:04.162 --> 00:02:07.472
you compare utility obtained
from every additional bottle of water

00:02:07.472 --> 00:02:09.612
to every additional diamond.

00:02:09.612 --> 00:02:12.532
And you do this each time
an offer is made.

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:16.123
The first bottle of water is worth more
to you than any amount of diamonds,

00:02:16.123 --> 00:02:19.023
but eventually, 
you have all the water you need.

00:02:19.023 --> 00:02:22.291
After a while, every additional bottle
becomes a burden.

00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:25.013
That's when you begin to choose
diamonds over water.

00:02:25.013 --> 00:02:27.313
And it's not just necessities like water.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:30.253
When it comes to most things,
the more of it you acquire,

00:02:30.253 --> 00:02:34.214
the less useful or enjoyable
every additional bit becomes.

00:02:34.214 --> 00:02:37.344
This is the law of diminishing
marginal utility.

00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:40.654
You might gladly buy two or three
helpings of your favorite food,

00:02:40.654 --> 00:02:42.764
but the fourth would 
make you nauseated,

00:02:42.764 --> 00:02:45.654
and the hundredth would spoil
before you could even get to it.

00:02:45.654 --> 00:02:49.344
Or you could pay to see the same movie
over and over until you got bored of it

00:02:49.344 --> 00:02:50.925
or spent all of your money.

00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:52.973
Either way, 
you'd eventually reach a point

00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:57.284
where the marginal utility for buying
another movie ticket became zero.

00:02:57.284 --> 00:03:01.479
Utility applies not just to buying things,
but to all our decisions.

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:05.324
And the intuitive way to maximize it
and avoid diminishing returns

00:03:05.324 --> 00:03:08.753
is to vary the way we spend
our time and resources.

00:03:08.753 --> 00:03:10.614
After our basic needs are met,

00:03:10.614 --> 00:03:13.005
we'd theoretically decide 
to invest in choices

00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:15.855
only to the point they're useful
or enjoyable.

00:03:15.855 --> 00:03:19.755
Of course, how effectively any of us
manage to maximize utility in real life

00:03:19.755 --> 00:03:21.383
is another matter.

00:03:21.383 --> 00:03:25.235
But it helps to remember that the
ultimate source of value comes from us,

00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:26.685
the needs we share,

00:03:26.685 --> 00:03:28.016
the things we enjoy,

00:03:28.016 --> 00:03:29.645
and the choices we make.
