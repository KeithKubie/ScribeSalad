00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.740
Welcome to the presentation
on functions.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.330
Functions are something that,
when I first learned it, it

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.800
was kind of like I had a
combination of I was 1,

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.280
confused, and at the same time,
I was like, well what's even

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.710
the point of learning this?

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.310
So hopefully, at least in this
introduction lecture, we can

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.070
get at least a very general
sense of what a function is

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.470
and why it might be useful.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.560
So let's just start off
with just the overall

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.570
concept of a function.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.450
A function is something that
you can give it an input-- and

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.350
we'll start with just one
input, but actually you can

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.160
give it multiple inputs-- you
give a function an input,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.030
let's call that input x.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.420
And you can view a function
as-- I guess a bunch of

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.080
different ways you can view it.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.820
I don't know if you're
familiar with the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.860
concept of a black box.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.060
A black box is kind of a box,
you don't know what's inside of

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.340
it, but if you put something
into it like this x, and let's

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.440
call that box-- let's say the
function is called f, then

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.760
it'll output what
we call f of x.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.180
I know this terminology might
seem a little confusing at

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.820
first, but let's make some-- I
guess, let's define what's

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.670
inside the box in
different ways.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:14.330
Let's say that the function
was-- let's say that f of x is

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.240
equal to x squared plus 1.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.280
Then, if I were to say
what is f of-- let's

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.870
say, what's f of 2?

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.050
Well that means we're taking
2 and we're going to

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:30.360
put it into the box.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.970
And I want to know what
comes out of the box

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.450
when I put 2 into it.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.430
Well inside the box, we know
we do this to the input.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.060
We take the x, we square it,
and we add 1, so f of 2 is 2

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.500
squared, which is 4, plus 1.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.040
Which is equal to 5.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.900
I know what you're thinking.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.510
Probably like, well, Sal, this
just seems like a very

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.470
convoluted way of substituting
x into an equation and just

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.580
finding out the result.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.400
And I agree with you right now.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.770
But as you'll see, a function
can become kind of a more

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.420
general thing than
just an equation.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.010
For example, let me say-- let
me actually-- actually not,

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.530
let me not erase this.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.150
Let me define a
function as this.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:24.560
f of x is equal to x squared
plus 1, if x is even,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.820
and it equals x squared
minus 1 if x is odd.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.390
I know this would have been--
this is something that we've

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.430
never really seen before.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.320
This isn't just what I would
call an analytic expression,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.540
this isn't just x plus
something squared.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.470
We're actually saying,
depending on what type of x you

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.850
put in, we're going to do a
different thing to that x.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.480
So let me ask you a question.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.470
What's f of 2 in this example?

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.930
Well if we put 2 here, it says
if x is even you do this one,

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.470
if x is odd you do this one.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.480
Well, 2 is even, so
we do this top one.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.830
So we'd say 2 squared plus
1, well that equals 5.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.230
But then, what's f of 3?

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.180
Well if we put the 3 in
here, we'd use this

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.930
case, because 3 is odd.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.410
So we do 3 squared minus
1. f of 3 is equal to 8.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.590
So notice, this was a little
bit more I guess you could

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.720
even say abstract or
unusual in this case.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.527
I'm going to keep doing
examples of functions and

00:03:27.527 --> 00:03:32.590
I'm going to show you how
general this idea can be.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.380
And if you get confused, I'm
going to show you that the

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.250
actual function problems
you're going to encounter are

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.560
actually not that hard to do.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.000
I just want to make sure that
you least get exposed to kind

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.840
of the general idea of
what a function is.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.920
You can view almost anything
in the world as a function.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.740
Let's say that there is a
function called Sal, because,

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.835
you know, that's my name.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.950
And I'm a function.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:08.490
Let's say that if you
were to-- let me think.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:14.190
If you were to give me
food, what do I produce?

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.740
So what is Sal of food?

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:23.050
So if you input food into
Sal, what will Sal produce?

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.770
Well I won't go into some of
the things that I would

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.710
produce, but I would
produce videos.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.690
I would produce math videos
if you gave me food.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.370
Math videos.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.670
I'm just a function.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.900
You give me food and-- and
maybe, actually, maybe

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.920
I have multiple inputs.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:48.140
Maybe if you give me a food
and a computer, and I would

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.830
produce math videos for you.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.215
And maybe you are a function.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.880
I don't know your name.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.540
I would like to, but I
don't know your name.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:09.440
And let's say if I were to
input math videos into you,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.840
then you will produce-- let's
see, what would you produce?

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.080
If I gave you math videos, you
would produce A's on tests.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.910
A's on your math test.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.150
Hopefully you're not taking
someone else's math test.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.000
So it's interesting.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.690
If you give-- well, let's
take the computer away.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.820
Let's say that all
Sal needs is food.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.450
Which is kind of true.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.640
So if you put food into
Sal, Sal of food, he

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.050
produces math videos.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.930
And if I were to put math
videos into you, then you

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.120
produce A's on your math test.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.710
So let's think of an
interesting problem.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:59.080
What is you of Sal of food?

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.620
I know this seems very
ridiculous, but I actually

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.640
think we might be going
someplace, so we might be

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.510
getting somewhere with
this kind of idea.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.000
Well, first we would try to
figure out what is Sal of food.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.340
Well, we already figured out if
you put food into Sal, Sal of

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.080
food is equal to math videos.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:25.630
So this is the same thing as
you of-- I'm trying to confuse

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:32.120
you-- you of math videos.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.230
And I already determined, we
already said, well, if you put

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.830
math videos into the function
called you, whatever your name

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.130
might be, then it produces
A's on your math test.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.480
So that you of math videos
equals A's on your math test.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.180
So you of Sal of food will
produce A's on your math test.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.000
And notice, we just said
what happens when you

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.150
put food into Sal.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.660
This could-- would be a very
different outcome if you put,

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.630
like, if you replaced food
with let's say poison.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:19.810
Because if you put poison into
Sal, Sal of poison-- not that I

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.940
would recommend that you did
this-- Sal of poison

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.510
would equal death.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.610
No, no, I shouldn't say
something, so no no no no.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.190
Well you get the idea.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.720
There wouldn't be math videos.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.600
Anyway.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.400
Let me move on.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.510
So with that kind of-- I'm not
so clear whether that would be

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:46.810
a useful example with the
food and the math videos.

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.700
Let's do some actual
problems using functions.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.990
So if I were to tell you that I
had one function, called f of x

00:07:54.990 --> 00:08:00.610
is equal to x plus 2, and I had
another function that said g

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:11.850
of x is equal to x
squared minus 1.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:19.790
If I were to ask you
what g of f of 3 is.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.440
Well the first thing we want to
do is evaluate what f of 3 is.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:35.070
So if you-- the 3 would replace
the x, so f of 3 is equal to

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:39.210
3 plus 2, which equals 5.

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:45.440
So g of f of 3 is the same
thing as g of 5, because f

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.390
of three is equal to 5.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.080
Sorry for the little
bit of messiness.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.340
So then, what's g of 5?

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.890
Well, then we take this 5, and
we put it in in place of this

00:08:53.890 --> 00:09:02.760
x, so g of 5 is 5 squared, 25,
minus 1, which equals 24.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.110
So g of f of 3 is equal to 24.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.950
Hopefully that gives you a
taste of what a function is all

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:12.000
about, and I really apologize
if I have either confused or

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.730
scared you with the Sal
food/poison math video example.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:19.780
But in the next set of
presentations, I'm going to do

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.420
a lot more of these examples,
and I think you'll get the idea

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:25.110
of at least how to do these
problems that you might see on

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.350
your math tests, and maybe get
a sense of what functions

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.120
are all about.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.720
See you in the next video.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.020
Bye.
