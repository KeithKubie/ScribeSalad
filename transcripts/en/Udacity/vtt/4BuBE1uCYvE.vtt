We saw in the last quiz how important it
is to know what rational numbers look like

00:00:05.328 --> 00:00:10.509
when we write them with decimals instead
of with fractions. How would you write

00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:15.752
7/16 in decimal notation? What about 1/3?
If you can write the entire decimal in

00:00:15.764 --> 00:00:20.824
five or fewer digits, then enter the whole
thing, and otherwise, round to five

00:00:20.836 --> 00:00:21.823
decimal places.
