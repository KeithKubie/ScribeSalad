00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.230 position:61%
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone, and good afternoon.

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.370 position:58%
My name is Kathy Mcguigan, and I work

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.180 position:56%
in the Education Outreach Department
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:15.270 position:75%
We are thrilled to welcome you to day two of the
second annual online conference for educators.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.190
Our session today, Kindergarten
Historians, will be recorded

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.670 position:64%
and posted to the library's Teacher page.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.070 position:67%
Without further ado, I'd like to
introduce Mike Affledorf [assumed spelling]

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.030
from the Education Outreach staff.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.010
He is your MC for the session, and
we hope you enjoy the presentation.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.670
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Kathy.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.030 position:63%
I'm going to jump right in and introduce
our presenter, Theresa St. Angelo,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.770
the 2016-2017 Teacher in Residence
at the Library of Congress,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.550 position:59%
has been a kindergarten teacher within
Manalapan Englishtown School District

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.490
in New Jersey for 18 years.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.450
She also taught both preschoolers
and undergraduate students

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.180 position:72%
in the Rutgers Nutritional Sciences Preschool.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.570 position:72%
St. Angelo was presented with a Teacher of the
Year Governor's Award in her school district,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.560 position:64%
has been recognized by NASA for
contributing to the children's education,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.050
and is a published author
of children's literature.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.480
Welcome, Theresa, and take it away.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.100
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, everybody.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.090 position:75%
It's a sunny afternoon here in Washington, D.C.,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.360 position:63%
and I was thinking it's the perfect
afternoon to talk about primary sources.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.310
So welcome, and let's get started.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.980 position:63%
So on my opening slide there's a picture

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.270
of my kindergarten students
engaged in a primary sources.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.060
And once upon a time, I was
an undergraduate student,

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.340
and I signed up to tutor
students at a local school.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.680 position:63%
And they assigned me a kindergarten boy.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.580 position:73%
He was so enthusiastic, and happy, and excited,
and I treasured the time I spent with him,

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.060 position:56%
that I decided that this was the
age group I just was dying to teach.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.240
There was just one problem, though.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.610 position:56%
I didn't know how to play the piano.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.740
And I remembered my kindergarten
teacher playing the piano,

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.080 position:72%
and I was worried that that was a requirement.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.590 position:63%
But when I went to the education
department, they assured me, no problem,

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.810
I could get my teaching degree
and go on to teach kindergarten.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.480
Well lo and behold, my very first
interview, the kindergarten --

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.940 position:73%
the principal took me to the kindergarten room,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.710
and there was a piano right
in the front of the room.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.430
And she told me, Don't worry
about it if you can't play.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.650
We have a record player.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.880 position:59%
And I know that today, very few people
use record players, but I still do.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.390 position:56%
Maybe I should do a primary source
lesson on record players [laughter].

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.630
Anyway, my goals for you
today, I -- we want to --

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:08.670 position:75%
I hope that you'll learn new strategies to
strengthen a young learner's ability to analyze,

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.110
evaluate, investigate, and
develop reasoned explanations.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:26.020 position:75%
I hope that at the end of this session you feel
confident and comfortable using primary sources,

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.110 position:67%
and also extending that to your colleagues,

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.670
telling them what a challenging
activity it is for everyone.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.400
And I hope you see the value in it.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:46.120 position:75%
Well, I began my commitment to primary sources
when I signed on for a weeklong summer institute

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.890
that the Primary Sources office was
giving at the Library of Congress.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:58.140 position:64%
And if you could see the grandeur of this
main reading room, I would like to say

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.230 position:61%
that the experience I had with teaching

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.930
with Primary Sources Summer
Institute was just as grand.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.670 position:59%
Once there, I met teachers from
across the country, and we learned how

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.500 position:56%
to navigate the Library of
Congress website, that's just filled

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.570 position:66%
with millions of primary source resources.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.700 position:70%
So the magnificence of the building was
equal to that valuable and powerful learning.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.510 position:69%
The lessons that I learned engaged students,

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.830
developed critical thinking,
and construct knowledge.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.820 position:61%
During that week, we all had to create
a lesson to take back to our classroom,

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.940 position:70%
and at the end of the week, we were evaluated
by expert staff from the Library of Congress,

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.840
as well as our colleagues
present during the week.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:51.140 position:72%
And that was a valuable piece of information,
because what I thought was great in my lesson,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.050
somebody else gave me another idea,
and that made it even greater.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.160
I'm sure you can see my excitement
with the primary sources.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.370 position:66%
So when I went back to my school district,
I wanted to get everybody on board,

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.460
to use primary sources, and
to see the value in them.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.300 position:58%
So I first went to my administrators,
and my superintendent of curriculum,

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.740 position:59%
I must have spent two hours with her,
and then we decided that we were going

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.080 position:59%
to do a professional day for teachers.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:30.860 position:70%
I talked to colleagues about what I was doing
and what I learned, and they immediately went

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.040
on the website and were looking
up primary sources.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.160
And the other thing was, I said I
had to get parents on board, too.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.240 position:75%
And to me, getting parents involved in what I do

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.530
in the classroom is vital
to the students' education.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.190
So I drafted this piece, and I read
it to them on Back to School Night.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.010
This is for the parents.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.420
And it's a history in our class.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:01.230 position:66%
I also did show them the slide of the main
reading room, get them a little excited

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.240
about the grandeur of the program.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.560 position:59%
And as you can see, I wrote, you know,
"It's going to be an exciting year,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.910 position:56%
analyzing and discovery, and they'll
learn what a historian is and does.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.530 position:64%
And once a month, they'll have the
opportunity to be a historian, analyzing,

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.150 position:61%
questioning, and discovering the past."

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.820
And then I talked about what
these special lessons would do.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:32.530 position:70%
And then this particular year, my first
lesson was an artifact from the Mien culture.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.570
And so parents at Back to
School Night were all on board.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.580 position:56%
They were so excited to get started.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.080 position:58%
They were thrilled at the engagement
that this would bring their children.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:51.300 position:61%
So what I would like to do next is let
you get involved with a primary source.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.110
This is a photo -- a primary
source photo taken from the Library

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.310
of Congress digitized collection.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:05.250 position:58%
And we're going to begin this primary
source for your first analyzing,

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:12.670 position:58%
by asking you to write something that
you see or something that you notice.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.410
What details did you see
that made you think that?

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:21.170
It's another question you could
pose at this time, which I will,

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.320
what other knowledge did you
use to make that observation?

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.160
I see -- somebody said, a train.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.860
How -- what made you say that?

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.950 position:56%
Okay, and one more question, did you
see a detail that made you say that,

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.860 position:58%
or was it something you already knew?

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.660
Well, I see excellent observations.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.440
You're noticing quite a bit.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.210
You've noticed a lot of the
things that my students notice.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.750
But I'm also going to ask you
now to make some reflection.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:56.430
And when you make a reflection,
you start with, "I think that."

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:05.190 position:69%
For example, I think that's a light, because
I saw one like that in my mother's kitchen.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.680
Oh, I see, man is in charge.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.240
Mailroom , cramped and crowded.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.460
All right.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:18.180 position:58%
I see excellent engagement, excellent
observations, excellent reflections.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:22.730
And now, what do you -- what
are some of your questions?

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.170 position:56%
What do you want to know more about?

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.430
Why is the room so small?

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.860
That's what would happen
if there is -- was a buyer.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.630
Very good questions.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:36.110
I know, I see a lot of people
focusing on the gun.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:38.460
We're going to address that later.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.200
And slips of paper.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:40.690
Very good.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:46.960 position:73%
Okay, so that was a very simple, fast analysis.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.680 position:67%
And we're going to continue, because I want

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:55.050
to show you how my kindergarten
students analyze photographs.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.810 position:66%
So this lesson I gave to them in February.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:06.520 position:66%
So in February, I had a lot of
preliminary work that I did prior to this.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.100 position:56%
They learned about what a
historian is, what a historian does.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:19.210 position:75%
They learned about what a primary source is,
and they also learned that I start these lessons

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:22.860
with an essential question
for the boys and girls.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:27.620 position:66%
I can't tell you the excitement in the
room when I read the schedule for the day.

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:33.780
And whenever I said history lesson
for the day in the schedule,

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:38.180 position:73%
the excitement in the room was just contagious.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:44.850 position:72%
And the boys and girls would ask each other,
"What do you think the essential question is?"

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.100 position:63%
And as a teacher, that was so rewarding.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.950 position:58%
Anyway, are you ready for our lesson?

00:09:50.950 --> 00:10:02.220 position:75%
Okay. Yes, it was the same photo you analyzed,
but the essential question I led this lesson off

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.160
with was, what are these men doing?

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.830 position:56%
Here the boys and girls are involved
in making their observations.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:15.220
I put the primary source
photo in the plastic sleeve.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:21.370
Each student has a dry-erase
marker and a dry-erase eraser.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:29.030 position:72%
I also pass out magnifying glasses so they can
really search for details, and I tell them --

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:34.430 position:67%
I give them the essential question, and
then I tell them to circle things they want

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.420 position:72%
to talk about, or circle things that are going

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.220
to help them discover the
answer to that question.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.530
What are these men doing?

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:45.870 position:66%
So as you can see, they get right into it.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:52.650
They love to circle details, and
I give them about five minutes.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:55.980 position:58%
Probably no longer than five minutes.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.460 position:69%
And then they get their history study buddy.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:05.470 position:61%
History study buddies can be assigned,
or sometimes I just pick their names --

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:11.040 position:67%
two names out that are on craft sticks, and
then they go off with their study buddy.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.320
And then they talk to each other
about the details that they found,

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.330 position:58%
and what they noticed first, and why.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:23.680 position:69%
And I teach them how to ask those questions.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.290
You know, describe that to me.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:27.420
How did you know that was a light?

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.940 position:63%
How did you know that was a bag of mail?

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:34.140 position:61%
So again, I give them about five
minutes to work with their study buddy,

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:39.230
and then we gather back together
as a whole group,

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:45.300 position:56%
and on a large chart paper I have
the primary sources analysis tool --

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.880 position:69%
similar to the primary source analysis tool.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:56.570 position:61%
I divide a large chart paper into three
sections, Observe, Reflect, Question.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.450 position:58%
Under Observe, I write, I see" blank.

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.240
Reflect, I think blank.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.510
And Question, I wonder blank.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:10.640 position:69%
So these are some of the observations made
by my students, some of the things they saw.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:17.450 position:67%
Men, shelves, lights, a lot of bags, a man
wearing boots, hats on men, different hats,

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:23.410
the letters U S. It was interesting
that a lot of you noticed the gun

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.990 position:63%
when you made your initial observations.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:31.300 position:67%
I have to say, very few boys and girls ever
even brought that up, believe it or not.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:36.410 position:69%
And that's probably based on their prior
knowledge, because that gun is in a holster,

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:40.720 position:58%
and I don't know if many of the
students even know what a holster is.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:45.920 position:64%
Anyway, then they make their reflections,
and then I said, "I think what?"

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.740
So then went -- they responded
by, I know they are men.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:55.530 position:61%
I think that's a shelf, because we have
shelves like that in the classroom.

00:12:55.530 --> 00:13:01.330 position:56%
And I think that's a light, because
I have seen lights like that before.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.330
Then some boys and girls
were talking about the boots.

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:09.850 position:73%
And then they would say, I never saw boots like
that on anyone, but it's taller than a shoe.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:14.460
I don't know if any of you
noticed the boot on the gentleman.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.920 position:69%
And he has, like, little buttons, I believe.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:22.680 position:66%
And then, of course, we get the connection
they make to their own prior knowledge.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.460
My daddy wears a hat like that.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.690
That's why I know it was a hat.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:31.590
Okay. And some other questions, I
wonder if they are in a kitchen?

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:37.020 position:63%
And then that just -- then the kids just
ran off on that, and then somebody said,

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.260 position:64%
I wonder," you know, "or is it an office?

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.700 position:63%
And then somebody said, or a schoolroom?

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.980
And then, of course, some boys
and girls noticed the pipes,

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:50.150 position:75%
and you'd be amazed that the lists go on and on.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:55.440
And even though this is one list
from one particular period of time,

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.800
every year the list is different,
and the boys and girls surprise me

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:02.180 position:73%
with the smallest little details that they see.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:10.260 position:73%
Okay. Now what I wanted to do was to -- we do
-- after we did the observe, reflect, question,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:17.120 position:75%
I told the boys and girls that we're going to go
deeper to figure out what those men are doing,

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:23.330 position:59%
exactly, and then we're going to
watch a video, a primary source video.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:27.630 position:72%
And I like in this to like, peeling an orange.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:33.300 position:61%
And I tell the boys and girls, "We
have one piece, we peel the orange off.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.030 position:72%
We have another piece, we peel the orange off.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:39.470
And maybe we even have another
piece that we peel the orange off,

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:43.870
until we get to that juicy,
delicious slice of orange.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:47.970
And we put that in them -- our
mouths, and it's just so delicious.

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:52.440 position:61%
It's a burst of flavor, and you're
just going to have a burst of knowledge

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.430 position:69%
when you discover what those men were doing.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:59.200
So that's my comparison.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:05.060 position:69%
When I was researching for a perfect video
to go with this lesson, I thought to myself,

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.140
the boys and girls are really
going to enjoy this.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.920
And the reaction I have every year
is, you know, this is hysterical.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:13.430
This is great.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:20.650 position:75%
Okay, so then I let them watch the video one
time, and we just watch it quietly, or you know,

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:24.730 position:59%
they can say whatever they want during
that, but I don't pose a question

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.300
or ask them any questions
during that first viewing.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:32.130
Then I show it again and
stop it in certain places,

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:37.030
so that they can make observations
again from this video.

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.530
And again, they're looking
to discover that answer,

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:44.500 position:72%
what were those men doing in that first photo?

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:49.900 position:73%
I know some of you may have already figured out
what those men were doing, and where were they?

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.500
Sorting mail in the post office.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.960
Oh. Sorting mail to be put in bags.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.220
Mailroom sorting.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.200
Sorting mail on a train.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.360
Because the men were on mail trains
sorting mail for various stops.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.230
Okay. Most of you got it.

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.170
They were men.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:12.830
They were on a railroad car,
and they were sorting mail.

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:21.770 position:67%
And like I said, I don't ever even remember
getting into a discussion about the gun,

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.850
and I was thinking, you would
just say, for protection, or --

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:29.910
from when those observations were.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:37.340 position:73%
Okay, after we looked -- we analyzed the video,
then I gave the students this map, this --

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.540
and I tell them, there is
another primary source.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:44.900
Again, we're peeling more of that
orange, and understanding more.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:50.340
And this is a map of railroad
routes across the country.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:56.820 position:72%
Now, I don't know if it's big enough for you
to see, but the lines are the railroad routes.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:05.120 position:56%
And what I did was, I had the boys
and girls take their pointer finger,

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.870 position:61%
and they could follow one of the lines.

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:12.930 position:67%
Now I'm from New Jersey, so I tell the boys
and girls they could start at New Jersey,

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:16.230 position:73%
try to find a railroad line, see where it goes,

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:20.800
and they use their pointer
finger as they go across.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:26.550 position:69%
And then I -- after they use their pointer
fingers, then I tell them, use your markers,

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.990
and they could do different lines
with different color markers.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.390 position:59%
And this is a powerful primary source,

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:40.250 position:64%
because what I like to help them discover
here is how important the railroad was

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.230
for mail delivery, and how
important those men were,

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.500
and how important their job
was to the whole country.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:51.580 position:64%
Let me tell you, they love this activity.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:59.720 position:64%
Okay, after we do that, I put this slide
up of a primary source on my smart board.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:04.600 position:66%
Now this one, I don't have -- I don't give
out individually to the boys and girls.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:10.420 position:63%
This, I just have up on the smart board,
and I use this for an assessment piece.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:15.520 position:66%
And what I do is, I ask the boys and girls
to think about what they just learned

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:22.490
from the video, the railroad map,
and the first primary source.

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:26.640
And then I ask them to tell me
what they see in this picture,

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.340
what do they observe, what
do they think about it?

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:36.460 position:56%
And so from their responses, I get a
quick assessment of who's on target,

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:44.290 position:75%
what are they thinking, what skills might they
be using, what skills might I have to reinforce.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:49.690 position:67%
But this picture just really helped me find
out exactly what everybody was thinking.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:54.230 position:59%
I love that it has U.S. Mail on it,
and that the boys and girls, you know,

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:59.000
connect that to the U.S., the
letters U S on those mailbags.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:06.120 position:75%
I also like when -- they even come up with, you
know, we know it's old, because there's a horse,

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:11.770
and I know that they have a sense
of time and a sense of the past.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:17.910
Now after that, I do give each
one this picture individually.

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.720
Again, it's another primary source.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.410 position:70%
And I do tell them it's a follow-up activity.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:30.760 position:66%
They know that after our primary source
study we always have a follow-up activity.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:37.780
And again, I want them to notice
and -- details in the picture.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:43.960
So if you want to just write some
things you notice in that picture.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.170
A little girl getting a letter.

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:45.880
Mail delivery.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.230
Very good.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:50.950 position:72%
Yes, I do print them on regular printer paper.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:59.570 position:75%
I don't even laminate them, because I'm going to
tell you something else I do with these photos.

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:04.040 position:61%
I see some very good observations here.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.790
Okay, so for this particular
picture, my objective is just

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.890 position:61%
to see that the girl is receiving mail.

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:16.670
And then I go on and tell them
how much I love to receive mail.

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:20.050
I love to get letters from
my family and my friends.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:22.830
And then I tell them, what
we're going to do today is,

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:27.580
we're going to write a postcard
and mail it to our families.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:33.730 position:59%
I have the postcards all ready, set up
with their addresses on the postcard,

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:38.250
and then I read the address, and
then the students raise their hand

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:42.390
as they hear their address, and
then they take their postcard off,

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:47.940 position:64%
and then they write whatever message they
want to on the postcard for their family.

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.190 position:64%
And again, this is an activity they love.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:59.170 position:70%
If it's for their family you see rainbows and
flowers, and, you know, daddy likes football.

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:00.570
You'll see football.

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:03.950 position:72%
It -- they just love to write -- to mail home.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:11.100 position:67%
I give them, you know, as much time as they
need with that, and then we put a stamp

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:15.570
on the postcard, and we all walk
down to the office mailbox --

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:19.650 position:61%
the outgoing mail, and we mail it home.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:25.510 position:61%
When those boys and girls -- when their
families receive that postcard home,

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:30.440 position:75%
the excitement in the classroom is unbelievable.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.870
Did you get your postcard?

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.830
My mom got my postcard.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:40.850 position:70%
And then we have a whole big discussion
again, and the involvement is just thrilling.

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:51.250 position:73%
I see that you're posting that book about Onie,
and that's another follow-up activity I did.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:52.600
It's a really good book.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.640
You do have to preview it
with kindergarten students.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:00.850 position:70%
There are some things I would suggest, some
pages I might skip for kindergarten students,

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:04.030
but make sure you preview it before
you use it with your students,

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:11.830 position:59%
and know what they'll understand and
what they can take away from the book.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:18.340 position:73%
Okay, so after we do that, the one thing I told
you at the beginning, I like to involve parents

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:22.980
with primary sources, so I
made this take-home piece.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:29.940 position:58%
And every time we do a primary source
lesson, I send this piece home,

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.050
and I attach all the primary
sources that we use.

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:36.840
So that's another reason why
I don't laminate the pictures.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.060
It goes home, attached to this.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:45.340 position:72%
And I ask the parents, you know, to talk about
it with their students, but I also ask them

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:50.890 position:61%
to go through it like we just did, too.

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:55.240
But then I tell the boys and
girls that their parents have

00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:00.760
to do some homework, too,
and they love hearing that.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:08.290 position:70%
So this piece goes home, attached, and they
have to write their name and the parent name.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:12.490
And then, what did you think
was happening in the print?

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:15.200
If I use a map, I'll replace
that with map, or --

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:20.550 position:59%
and then I want the parents to tell
me what they learned from their child.

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:26.690 position:63%
And then I want them to circle if they
like this activity, or they didn't like.

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:29.490
And obviously, if they liked
it, it would be a happy face.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:33.790
And if they didn't like it,
that would be a sad face.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:35.850
This is a powerful piece.

00:23:35.850 --> 00:23:37.900
Parents love this piece.

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:39.500
Students love to share this.

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.880
When they bring this in the
next day and share it with me,

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.980 position:67%
it's so thrilling, and they get so excited.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.090
My dad loved that.

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:48.880
He was talking about this.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.650
Mom -- my mom loved that.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:52.610 position:56%
We were talking about this and that.

00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:56.650
And it's just a thrilling piece.

00:23:56.650 --> 00:24:04.010 position:61%
I didn't save a sheet that was filled
out about the train, but I did find one

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.700
about another primary source that
we used, and this was one of my --

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:13.070 position:66%
this was a lesson that I absolutely loved.

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:18.070 position:64%
Actually, I don't know many that I don't
love, with -- when I use primary sources.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:25.080 position:64%
But this one was a primary source of a
boy sitting on a box, and it was raining,

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.850
and he was waiting for the
opening day for baseball.

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.540
It wasn't, waiting for the opening
day of a real baseball game.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:37.580
It was a pretend baseball field,
or it wasn't like a major league.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:39.600
It was a different league.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:44.840
But we had fun comparing that
with the opening day of baseball

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.710 position:58%
when I gave the students this lesson.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:51.920
This one I wanted to share with
you, because where it says,

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.210 position:75%
"What did you think was happening in the print?"

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:57.130
A little boy was waiting in line
to purchase baseball tickets.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:58.930
What did you learn from your child?

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:03.830
I found out Salvitor that you
need money for everything.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:04.720
That's right.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:10.470 position:63%
We were -- we were talking about how you
need to give money to buy the ticket.

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:16.380 position:56%
And then down at the bottom, this is
what is really very telling to me.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:23.300 position:67%
They both enjoyed the lesson, and her son
said that he enjoyed looking at the picture

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:29.570 position:59%
and making -- and making observations,
but Mom enjoyed it because she got

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:34.140 position:75%
to pick his brain and have an activity with him.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.390 position:58%
And really, it's not a long activity.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:38.820
It's quick, and it's enjoyable.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:43.550 position:64%
And I can't tell you the feedback I get
from parents about how much they love it.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:51.050 position:75%
As a matter of fact, I gave a lesson on football
one time, and one father called me up to talk

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:55.170
to me all about football
for about 15, 20 minutes.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:26:05.040 position:66%
It was -- that's -- and they love to share
that knowledge, and it's just fabulous.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:09.370 position:67%
So, why primary sources for young learners?

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:14.970
I hope that you feel the same
way I do about the value,

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:19.260 position:66%
and everything they bring to the students.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:23.430
But I wanted to read to you
something that I just found on --

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:28.240 position:63%
it was on the internet, reverseKids.com.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.810
It's "Empowering children
to create positive change."

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:38.890
And it said that, "Children must
be given time to dream, to touch,

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:43.450 position:61%
to feel, and most of all, to construct.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:51.130 position:75%
To build their ideas, to expand on their
questions, and to develop a sense of rootedness,

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:55.030 position:67%
of connectedness to the world around them."

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:59.880
And that to me, is using
primary sources in the classroom.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:09.210 position:75%
By using primary sources, my young learners grow
in content knowledge, problem solving, respect.

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:11.170 position:61%
They have to -- I teach them, they have

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:16.410
to respect other people's
responses, no matter what they say.

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:22.400
We have to respect and accept
the responses given.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:29.020 position:58%
My young learners grow in cooperative
working skills, speaking skills,

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:35.350
foundational reading skills,
which just skyrocket.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.420 position:67%
They grow in their sense of accomplishment.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:45.990 position:72%
I cannot tell you, the contentment in the
classroom after you give one of these lessons,

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:52.240 position:69%
because their involvement, their engagement,
their thinking, the respect they get,

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:57.320
and how everyone's answer is
respected and acknowledged.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:01.780
It's just so important to
build their sense of self.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:07.280
Their enthusiasm for learning
has grown by leaps and bounds

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.670
since I've introduced primary
source lessons in kindergarten.

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:15.780 position:61%
I can't tell you how many students
will bring in something, a little item,

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:18.150 position:73%
and they'll say, Miss St. Angelo, look at this.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:18.610
Look at this.

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:21.030 position:58%
I really love this, because it's old.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:26.680 position:64%
And then what I do is, we -- I say, "Well
let's go find out when that was made."

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.450
Or, "Can we find out when --
the toy company that made that?"

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:35.190
Or, "Let's dig a little deeper,
find a little bit more about that."

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:39.050 position:56%
Last year, one of my favorite things
was when somebody brought in --

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:42.260
it was Steamboat Willie, a
picture of Steamboat Willie.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.440
And then we got into a big
discussion about that.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:54.040 position:64%
I tell my colleagues that my students can
source, contextualize, and corroborate.

00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:59.380
And I tell my students -- and I did
borrow this from a popular book --

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:09.170 position:70%
I tell my students, I love primary sources to
the moon, but I love how you analyze and work

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:12.730 position:67%
with primary sources, to the moon and back.

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:15.830
And they love to hear me
say that after every lesson.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:24.320 position:70%
So I hope that you enjoyed my presentation of
one of my lessons in my kindergarten class.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:29.490
I hope that you're ready to
run and use primary sources.

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:34.060
Please read on our teacher's blog.

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:39.010 position:58%
I'm going to be posting some blogs
that you can use with young learners.

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:40.770
And thank you for your time.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:43.250 position:66%
I really appreciate sharing this with you.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:43.700
Thank you.
