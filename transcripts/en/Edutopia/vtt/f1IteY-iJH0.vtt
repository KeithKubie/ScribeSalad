00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:04.396
&gt;&gt;Peter: One of our goals
here at School Twenty-One is

00:00:04.396 --> 00:00:09.746
to create interesting people, who have
passions, who care about the world

00:00:09.746 --> 00:00:13.326
around them, who want to
change things, who are curious.

00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:17.466
We need to make school once
more a place of joy and wonder,

00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:21.976
where you're being stretched and
challenged and motivated every day.

00:00:22.576 --> 00:00:23.396
&gt;&gt;Student: Who here have dreams

00:00:23.396 --> 00:00:24.976
and goals they want to
achieve in their life?

00:00:32.076 --> 00:00:33.296
&gt;&gt;Peter: So at School
Twenty-One, everything's a jigsaw.

00:00:33.356 --> 00:00:37.956
By seeing it in action, you see how the
different strands feed of each other.

00:00:38.596 --> 00:00:42.946
Wellbeing is a way of wrestling
with issues about themselves

00:00:42.946 --> 00:00:44.836
and about others that go quite deep.

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:50.876
&gt;&gt;Student: Boys can wear pink
and boys can play with dollies.

00:00:50.876 --> 00:00:51.306
It's their choice and--

00:00:51.306 --> 00:00:52.776
&gt;&gt;Peter: And through drama
techniques, through literature,

00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:55.466
through conversations with
each other and with teachers,

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:59.766
students are exploring in a really
sophisticated way their emotions,

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:03.716
their qualities, what's getting in the
way of their learning and getting on.

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:06.506
&gt;&gt;Anna: Does skin color tell you
much about a person on the inside?

00:01:06.626 --> 00:01:06.966
&gt;&gt;Students: No.

00:01:07.036 --> 00:01:13.036
&gt;&gt;Peter: So what we're developing, and
why wellbeing links so well to oracy is

00:01:13.036 --> 00:01:14.926
that if you're well inside yourself,

00:01:14.926 --> 00:01:17.386
if you've got confidence,
then you will speak.

00:01:17.596 --> 00:01:18.926
&gt;&gt;Student: Isn't this
country a democracy?

00:01:19.586 --> 00:01:23.626
&gt;&gt;Peter: Oral communication is up there
as one of the most important skills

00:01:23.786 --> 00:01:28.146
and we wanted students to find their
voice, metaphorically and literally.

00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:30.266
&gt;&gt;Student: Everybody's people.

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:33.966
&gt;&gt;Peter: Oracy and wellbeing
link to project based learning,

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:37.536
because if they're producing
work of a really high standard,

00:01:37.686 --> 00:01:39.746
that makes them feel
better about themselves

00:01:39.796 --> 00:01:41.876
and really proud of what they've done.

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:45.696
It's a very clever way of combining
knowledge, skills and attributes.

00:01:45.696 --> 00:01:49.736
So you're applying in depth
knowledge to real situations,

00:01:49.736 --> 00:01:57.096
and I think it's very
stimulating for the students.

00:01:57.286 --> 00:02:02.016
We genuinely believe here in educating
the whole child, and developing them

00:02:02.086 --> 00:02:06.086
in all their characteristics so that
they can make a difference to the world

00:02:06.116 --> 00:02:06.846
when they go out of school.
