of the three could have been the
dominant hand and she's the one who had

00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:43.140
dominant hand and she's the one who had

the chicks because the fast defense for
 

01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:09.050
the chicks because the fast defense for
ostriches is speed and the time they

this dam I have been trying to count
 

01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.910
this dam I have been trying to count
them but of course the difficulty with

01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:36.920
them but of course the difficulty with
 

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.430
them but of course the difficulty with
counting hippos is that it's quite

01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440
counting hippos is that it's quite
 

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:41.050

what I mean particularly when they're

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:45.290
what I mean particularly when they're
 

01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:48.160
what I mean particularly when they're
under water for an extended period of

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:48.170
under water for an extended period of
 

01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:50.560
under water for an extended period of
time usually around about 60 seconds

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:50.570
time usually around about 60 seconds
 

01:02:50.570 --> 01:02:53.560
time usually around about 60 seconds
also up to five minutes and at a maximum

now in summer that would obviously be

now in summer that would obviously be
 

01:06:37.990 --> 01:06:39.780
now in summer that would obviously be
lush and green and there'd be plenty of

01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:04.030
the highness having the new discovery of
 

01:59:04.030 --> 01:59:08.070
the highness having the new discovery of
the hydrangea ma and existing Dan here

01:59:08.070 --> 01:59:08.080
the hydrangea ma and existing Dan here
 

01:59:08.080 --> 01:59:10.620
the hydrangea ma and existing Dan here
in the tomorrow triangle of the

01:59:10.620 --> 01:59:10.630
in the tomorrow triangle of the
 

01:59:10.630 --> 01:59:14.010
in the tomorrow triangle of the
Northland it'll be a very good idea to

01:59:14.010 --> 01:59:14.020
Northland it'll be a very good idea to
 

01:59:14.020 --> 01:59:17.760
Northland it'll be a very good idea to
start comparing the two sets of hyenas

01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:17.770
start comparing the two sets of hyenas
 

01:59:17.770 --> 01:59:21.330
start comparing the two sets of hyenas
in terms of behavior and how they raise

01:59:21.330 --> 01:59:21.340
in terms of behavior and how they raise
 

01:59:21.340 --> 01:59:25.110
in terms of behavior and how they raise
the young ones as much as both the

01:59:25.110 --> 01:59:25.120
the young ones as much as both the
 

01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:27.030
the young ones as much as both the
highness there and highness they are the

01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040
highness there and highness they are the
 

01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:29.570
highness there and highness they are the
same species the spotted hyena and

01:59:29.570 --> 01:59:29.580
same species the spotted hyena and
 

01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:33.500
same species the spotted hyena and
sometimes the tree call cutta cutta I

01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:33.510
sometimes the tree call cutta cutta I
 

01:59:33.510 --> 01:59:37.260
sometimes the tree call cutta cutta I
don't think that should be a big firm

01:59:37.260 --> 01:59:37.270
don't think that should be a big firm
 

01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:38.700
don't think that should be a big firm
better things will be very exciting to

01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:38.710
better things will be very exciting to
 

01:59:38.710 --> 01:59:41.400
better things will be very exciting to
see if there could be any difference in

01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:41.410
see if there could be any difference in
 

01:59:41.410 --> 01:59:44.790
see if there could be any difference in
what happens there and here within this

01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800
what happens there and here within this
 

01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:47.520
what happens there and here within this
band on the road there is this piece of

01:59:47.520 --> 01:59:47.530
band on the road there is this piece of
 

01:59:47.530 --> 01:59:50.670

was an idea yeah to the nature in how it
 

01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:58.530
was an idea yeah to the nature in how it
has gotten dark here and if you look

01:59:58.530 --> 01:59:58.540
has gotten dark here and if you look
 

01:59:58.540 --> 02:00:00.390
has gotten dark here and if you look
carefully on the road is some I've got

02:00:00.390 --> 02:00:00.400
carefully on the road is some I've got
 

02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:03.060

sugar on because it has rained more here

02:00:06.210 --> 02:00:06.220
sugar on because it has rained more here
 

02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:09.020

where we are than where we came from and

02:00:09.020 --> 02:00:09.030
where we are than where we came from and
 

02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:12.360
where we are than where we came from and
the temperatures have got really really

02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:12.370
the temperatures have got really really
 

02:00:12.370 --> 02:00:15.420
the temperatures have got really really
low and that should mean it has gotten

02:00:15.420 --> 02:00:15.430
low and that should mean it has gotten
 

02:00:15.430 --> 02:00:18.000
low and that should mean it has gotten
cold and this is my last layer if it

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:18.010
cold and this is my last layer if it
 

02:00:18.010 --> 02:00:19.920
cold and this is my last layer if it
gets much colder then I'll be a problem

02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:19.930
gets much colder then I'll be a problem
 

02:00:19.930 --> 02:00:21.669
gets much colder then I'll be a problem
for me

02:00:21.669 --> 02:00:21.679
for me
 

02:00:21.679 --> 02:00:23.620
for me

out see the bush you need one minutes to
 

02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:37.959
out see the bush you need one minutes to
make a whole difference or one time you

02:00:37.959 --> 02:00:37.969
make a whole difference or one time you
 

02:00:37.969 --> 02:00:40.660
make a whole difference or one time you
look left or you look right and you

might sport some very interesting things
 

02:00:42.980 --> 02:00:45.669
might sport some very interesting things
now the dynamics is that changing as I

02:00:45.669 --> 02:00:45.679
now the dynamics is that changing as I
 

02:00:45.679 --> 02:00:47.530
now the dynamics is that changing as I
said earlier because of the weather of

02:00:47.530 --> 02:00:47.540
said earlier because of the weather of
 

02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:50.919
said earlier because of the weather of
having so much rain and the grass gets

02:00:50.919 --> 02:00:50.929
having so much rain and the grass gets
 

02:00:50.929 --> 02:00:53.620
having so much rain and the grass gets
you very wet so I expect to see as much

02:00:53.620 --> 02:00:53.630
you very wet so I expect to see as much
 

02:00:53.630 --> 02:00:55.360
you very wet so I expect to see as much
as the road could be a bit muddy I

02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:55.370
as the road could be a bit muddy I
 

02:00:55.370 --> 02:00:58.419
as the road could be a bit muddy I
expect to see some sort of cannibals in

02:00:58.419 --> 02:00:58.429
expect to see some sort of cannibals in
 

02:00:58.429 --> 02:01:02.800
expect to see some sort of cannibals in
the middle of the road

02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:02.810
 
 

02:01:02.810 --> 02:01:05.290
 
the roads or the surface of the road

02:01:05.290 --> 02:01:05.300
the roads or the surface of the road
 

02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:07.330
the roads or the surface of the road
will have the substrate that will keep

02:01:07.330 --> 02:01:07.340
will have the substrate that will keep
 

02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:10.240
will have the substrate that will keep
the most heat before it except getting

02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:10.250
the most heat before it except getting
 

02:01:10.250 --> 02:01:18.040
the most heat before it except getting
colder

the hyenas and oats in the North turn
 

02:01:24.619 --> 02:01:27.399
the hyenas and oats in the North turn
enjoy the Northland and I'm looking at

02:01:27.399 --> 02:01:27.409
enjoy the Northland and I'm looking at
 

02:01:27.409 --> 02:01:28.629
enjoy the Northland and I'm looking at
the front there

02:01:28.629 --> 02:01:28.639
the front there
 

02:01:28.639 --> 02:01:30.870
the front there
let's see boom gate wall tree house

02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:30.880
let's see boom gate wall tree house
 

02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:34.540
let's see boom gate wall tree house
another 50 meters

02:01:34.540 --> 02:01:34.550
another 50 meters
 

02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:36.910
another 50 meters
it was switch of my light there it looks

02:01:36.910 --> 02:01:36.920
it was switch of my light there it looks
 

02:01:36.920 --> 02:01:40.950
it was switch of my light there it looks
like a car so let's see straight on

02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:40.960
like a car so let's see straight on
 

02:01:40.960 --> 02:01:45.250
like a car so let's see straight on
it's just something moving towards us it

02:01:45.250 --> 02:01:45.260
it's just something moving towards us it
 

02:01:45.260 --> 02:01:51.580
it's just something moving towards us it
looked like a servo cut maybe let me

02:01:51.580 --> 02:01:51.590
looked like a servo cut maybe let me
 

02:01:51.590 --> 02:01:54.129
looked like a servo cut maybe let me
just go through close and see yeah it's

02:01:54.129 --> 02:01:54.139
just go through close and see yeah it's
 

02:01:54.139 --> 02:01:57.549
just go through close and see yeah it's
coming I can see the eyes so let me just

02:01:57.549 --> 02:01:57.559
coming I can see the eyes so let me just
 

02:01:57.559 --> 02:02:01.569
coming I can see the eyes so let me just
go a little closer and now we are in

02:02:01.569 --> 02:02:01.579
go a little closer and now we are in
 

02:02:01.579 --> 02:02:02.319
go a little closer and now we are in
infrared

02:02:02.319 --> 02:02:02.329
infrared
 

02:02:02.329 --> 02:02:05.140
infrared
so anything very far we might not be

02:02:05.140 --> 02:02:05.150
so anything very far we might not be
 

02:02:05.150 --> 02:02:08.680
so anything very far we might not be
able to see the trip from there again

02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:08.690
able to see the trip from there again
 

02:02:08.690 --> 02:02:09.870
able to see the trip from there again
see what you get

02:02:09.870 --> 02:02:09.880
see what you get
 

02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:16.049
see what you get
look cuts I just saw the eyes and

02:02:16.049 --> 02:02:16.059
look cuts I just saw the eyes and
 

02:02:16.059 --> 02:02:18.760
look cuts I just saw the eyes and
definitely is out of range

02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:18.770
definitely is out of range
 

02:02:18.770 --> 02:02:21.540
definitely is out of range
anyhow to be it look to the cassava cut

02:02:21.540 --> 02:02:21.550
anyhow to be it look to the cassava cut
 

02:02:21.550 --> 02:02:24.910
anyhow to be it look to the cassava cut
or Jocko I got again a little bit close

02:02:24.910 --> 02:02:24.920
or Jocko I got again a little bit close
 

02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:26.770
or Jocko I got again a little bit close
that you never know and to be good to

02:02:26.770 --> 02:02:26.780
that you never know and to be good to
 

02:02:26.780 --> 02:02:29.140
that you never know and to be good to
see a jackhole or a servo cuts in this

02:02:29.140 --> 02:02:29.150
see a jackhole or a servo cuts in this
 

02:02:29.150 --> 02:02:35.720
see a jackhole or a servo cuts in this
darkness

02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:35.730
 
 

02:02:35.730 --> 02:02:38.540
 
alright you try and see if you're lucky

02:02:38.540 --> 02:02:38.550
alright you try and see if you're lucky
 

02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:40.970
alright you try and see if you're lucky
okay I think I still see it on the road

02:02:40.970 --> 02:02:40.980
okay I think I still see it on the road
 

02:02:40.980 --> 02:02:44.440
okay I think I still see it on the road
there see how far the infrared can go

02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:44.450
there see how far the infrared can go
 

02:02:44.450 --> 02:02:48.290
there see how far the infrared can go
something dark there that one there is a

02:02:48.290 --> 02:02:48.300
something dark there that one there is a
 

02:02:48.300 --> 02:02:50.810
something dark there that one there is a
Jocko or a Sava cut to the left of your

02:02:50.810 --> 02:02:50.820
Jocko or a Sava cut to the left of your
 

02:02:50.820 --> 02:02:55.840
Jocko or a Sava cut to the left of your
screen here cuz in this approach eyes

02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:55.850
screen here cuz in this approach eyes
 

02:02:55.850 --> 02:02:58.460
screen here cuz in this approach eyes
this question is very difficult to

02:02:58.460 --> 02:02:58.470
this question is very difficult to
 

02:02:58.470 --> 02:03:04.550
this question is very difficult to
sports look and we might be lucky

02:03:04.550 --> 02:03:04.560
sports look and we might be lucky
 

02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:06.890
sports look and we might be lucky
because once I have my lights on I can

02:03:06.890 --> 02:03:06.900
because once I have my lights on I can
 

02:03:06.900 --> 02:03:09.710
because once I have my lights on I can
see it very well but because the

02:03:09.710 --> 02:03:09.720
see it very well but because the
 

02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:13.490
see it very well but because the
distance okay there we are one more last

02:03:13.490 --> 02:03:13.500
distance okay there we are one more last
 

02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:15.920
distance okay there we are one more last
drop it to the left of the road there I

02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:15.930
drop it to the left of the road there I
 

02:03:15.930 --> 02:03:25.010
drop it to the left of the road there I
think shouldn't be able to get it no all

02:03:25.010 --> 02:03:25.020
think shouldn't be able to get it no all
 

02:03:25.020 --> 02:03:26.930
think shouldn't be able to get it no all
right well then Vinay we have done the

02:03:26.930 --> 02:03:26.940
right well then Vinay we have done the
 

02:03:26.940 --> 02:03:31.010
right well then Vinay we have done the
best we could infrared helps us to see

02:03:31.010 --> 02:03:31.020
best we could infrared helps us to see
 

02:03:31.020 --> 02:03:33.620
best we could infrared helps us to see
animals and making sure the animals

02:03:33.620 --> 02:03:33.630
animals and making sure the animals
 

02:03:33.630 --> 02:03:35.960
animals and making sure the animals
don't see us themselves and we do not

02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:35.970
don't see us themselves and we do not
 

02:03:35.970 --> 02:03:41.930
don't see us themselves and we do not
interfere with them it was definitely a

02:03:41.930 --> 02:03:41.940
interfere with them it was definitely a
 

02:03:41.940 --> 02:03:45.040
interfere with them it was definitely a
servo cut has disappeared no worries

02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:45.050
servo cut has disappeared no worries
 

02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:50.680
servo cut has disappeared no worries
alright okay then we go here

02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:50.690
 
 

02:03:50.690 --> 02:03:55.060
 
you see my poor light yeah this is a

02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:55.070
you see my poor light yeah this is a
 

02:03:55.070 --> 02:03:58.090
you see my poor light yeah this is a
good time to start seeing cast as I said

02:03:58.090 --> 02:03:58.100
good time to start seeing cast as I said
 

02:03:58.100 --> 02:04:01.020
