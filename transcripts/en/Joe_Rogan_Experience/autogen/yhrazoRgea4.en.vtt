they put this generator they set it up

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110
they put this generator they set it up
 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.050
they put this generator they set it up
and then they attach these tubes to it

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060
and then they attach these tubes to it
 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.670
and then they attach these tubes to it
and they stick the tubes in the creek

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680
and they stick the tubes in the creek
 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.890
and they stick the tubes in the creek
and the water coming down the creek goes

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900
and the water coming down the creek goes
 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.719
and the water coming down the creek goes
through the tubes and by the time it you

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:49.729
through the tubes and by the time it you
 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:51.730
