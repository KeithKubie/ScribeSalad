&gt;&gt; Larry: SO I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS THE TOM BRADY

00:00:03.869 --> 00:00:05.438 align:start position:0% line:91%
THING BECAUSE EVERYBODY HAS
BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

00:00:05.471 --> 00:00:07.640 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE WAS PUNISHED, FIRST OF
ALL, HE DID IT.

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:08.975 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT
THAT.

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:10.710 align:start position:0% line:91%
EVERYBODY AGREES ABOUT THAT,
RIGHT?

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:11.878 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:12.679 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:14.881 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT LIKE A --
&gt;&gt; YES, YES.

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:15.948 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; PERSONALLY DID IT?

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:18.785 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HE KNEW ABOUT IT, HE
ORDERED IT.

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:23.022 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HE CALLED THE GUY, THE
DEFLATOR, SO YES, HE KNEW.

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:24.657 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.160 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt;  THEY'RE COMPLETELY
THROWN UNDER THE BUS WHO DID

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.361 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE DEFLATING.

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:30.763 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE 35-YEAR-OLD BALL BOY,
IS THAT RIGHT?

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:31.931 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; 35-YEAR-OLD BALL BOY.

00:00:31.964 --> 00:00:35.535 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE IS 35 YEARS OLD, IF YOU
ARE I BALL BOY AT 35 --

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.738 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT AM I GOING TO DO YOU
KNOW, I HAVE BEEN BALL

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:40.139 align:start position:0% line:85%
BOYING FOR 35 YEARS.

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:43.709 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU GIVE THE BALLS TO
ANOTHER TEAM THEY'RE GOING

00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:46.345 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO-- THIS IS SO DUMB IT IS SO
OVERDONE IT'S RIDICULOUS

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:48.981 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SO WHAT IS WORSE
ABOUT THIS, CHEATING OR

00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:49.548 align:start position:0% line:85%
LYING?

00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:51.084 size:75% position:38% line:85%
WHAT ARE WE MORE MAD AT.

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:55.421 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LYING ABOUT CHEATING I
THINK IS WORSE.

00:00:55.454 --> 00:00:56.522 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:58.591 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO BE GOOD AT
LYING IF YOU WANT TO CHEAT.

00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:00.927 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WE LEARNED THAT WATCHING
BILL CLINTON, RIGHT.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.428 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF ARE YOU GOING TO CHEAT,
CHEAT.

00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:05.598 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THEN THE TELL TRUTH ONCE
YOU GET BUSTED BUT IF YOU

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:09.635 size:84% position:42% line:91%
CHEAT AND YOU LIE ABOUT THE
CHEATING, THEN YOU GOT TO 

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:13.172 align:start position:0% line:91%
DEAL WITH THE BLUE DRESS AND KEN
STARR REPORT.

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:15.241 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I LOVE THAT CLINTON
THOUGHT HE HAD A GOOD LIE.

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:18.778 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HE DID.
&gt;&gt; IT DEPENDS WHAT "IS" IS

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:21.347 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; AM I RIGHT, LADIES?

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.984 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; AND EVERYBODY WAS LIKE
NO.

00:01:25.017 --> 00:01:26.152 align:start position:0% line:85%
N-O.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:28.020 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; MORE MAD AT HIM FOR
CHEATING OR LYING.

00:01:28.053 --> 00:01:30.590 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK HE WAS DOING A
SERVICE BECAUSE WITH ALL THE

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:32.558 align:start position:0% line:91%
CONCUSSIONS YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE HIT IN THE HEAD

00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:35.294 align:start position:0% line:91%
WITH A HARD OVERINFLATED
BALL.

00:01:35.327 --> 00:01:38.164 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU WANT IT SOFT BALL TO
HIT.

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:40.233 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THINK HE'S DOING A
SERVICE.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.535 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: DOING A SERVICE
FOR ALL NFL PLAYERS BY DOING

00:01:42.568 --> 00:01:43.603 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS.

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:46.105 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUT HE'S ONLY BEING FINED
WHAT $2 MILLION THAT IS

00:01:46.138 --> 00:01:46.872 align:start position:0% line:85%
ABOUT-- .

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.708 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: MIGHT ONLY BE $1
MILLION.

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:50.009 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; GISELE WILL PICK UP THE
TAB.

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:54.413 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I MEAN, HE GETS
PAID $2 MILLION TO PUT ON

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:57.984 align:start position:0% line:91%
HEELS, IF HE NEVER WORKS
AGAIN, CAN BE A STAY AT HOME

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:00.786 align:start position:0% line:85%
DAD AND BE KILLING.

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.422 size:75% position:38% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I HAVE TO STAY
HOME WITH MY MODEL WIFE.

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:05.091 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; MY HOT MODEL WIVE.

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:08.628 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; MAYBE IF WE WERE TO BEAT
THE BALLS IN AN ELEVATOR

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:12.331 size:81% position:41% line:91%
SECURITY CAM THEN HIS-- IT
WOULD BE-- HE WOULDN'T BE

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:16.135 size:88% position:44% line:85%
SUSPENDED FOR AS MANY GAMES.

00:02:16.168 --> 00:02:19.805 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HE GOT TWICE THE
SUSPENSION OF RAY RICE.

00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:21.440 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I STILL DON'T THINK THAT
IS THE ENOUGH.

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:23.142 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M NOT THE BIGGEST 
FOOTBALL FAN IN THE WORLD.

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:24.677 align:start position:0% line:85%
I WILL ADMIT THAT.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.112 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YOU DON'T THINK
FOUR GAMES IS ENOUGH.

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:27.213 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:30.082 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IF
YOUR JOB IS TO PLAY THE GAME

00:02:30.115 --> 00:02:32.752 align:start position:0% line:91%
WITH INTEGRITY IN A
LEGITIMATE WAY, AND YOU

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:35.721 align:start position:0% line:91%
DEFLATE THE BALLS, THAT IS
GIVING YOU AN UNFAIR

00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:38.724 size:81% position:41% line:91%
ADVANTAGE AND YOU WIN THE
SUPERBOWL AS A RESULT, NO,

00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:39.892 size:78% position:39% line:85%
YOU DON'T DESERVE TO WIN.

00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:42.295 size:84% position:42% line:91%
NOT ONLY DO YOU NOT DESERVE
TO WIN, YOU DIDN'T DESERVE

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:44.230 align:start position:0% line:91%
TO PLAY FOR THE ENTIRE
SEASON, I WOULD SAY.

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:47.400 size:88% position:44% line:91%
IF THE NFL WAS SERIOUS ABOUT
SECOND A MESSAGE ABOUT THIS

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:50.336 size:75% position:38% line:91%
GAME BEING PLAYED FAIRLY
THEY SHOULD SUSPEND HIM.

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:51.971 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT I DON'T THINK THEY
ARE --

00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:53.406 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt;
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.808 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU MEAN NO, THE
ONLY REASON HE'S NOT-- THE

00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:57.843 align:start position:0% line:91%
ONLY REASON HE'S IF THE
BEING SUSPENDED IS BECAUSE

00:02:57.876 --> 00:03:01.214 align:start position:0% line:91%
HE'S TOM BRADY AND HE MAKES
THE NFL MILLIONS UPON

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:02.081 align:start position:0% line:85%
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:05.751 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT SHOULD BE TEN YARDS,
NOBODY CARES.

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:08.854 size:88% position:44% line:91%
EVERY PLAYER IN EVERY SINGLE
SPORT CHEATS ON EVERY PLAY.

00:03:08.887 --> 00:03:12.825 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF YOU-- EVERY GUARD IS
HOLDING ON TO THE DEFENSIVE

00:03:12.858 --> 00:03:13.893 align:start position:0% line:85%
PLAYER EVERY PLAY.

00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:16.329 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND IF IT WASN'T ON THE
OUTSIDE THEY GET CALLED IT'S

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:17.363 size:88% position:44% line:85%
JUST NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

00:03:17.396 --> 00:03:19.065 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ARE YOU SAYING THAT IT'S
OKAY --

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:23.469 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; LOOK, MY WIFE AND I GOT
INTO A HUGE ARGUE ABOUT THIS

00:03:23.502 --> 00:03:27.740 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO I KNOCKED HER OUT IN THIS
ELEVATOR.

00:03:27.773 --> 00:03:28.808 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND.

00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:30.876 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DID YOU HAVE THE DECENCY
TO DRAG HER OUTSIDE THE

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:32.311 align:start position:0% line:91%
ELEVATOR OR DID YOU LEAVE
HER IN.

00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:33.379 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; WHY WOULD HE DO THAT.

00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:35.881 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I GOT HALFWAY THROUGH AND
I WAS LIKE I GOT A TEXT

00:03:35.914 --> 00:03:36.849 align:start position:0% line:85%
MESSAGE.

00:03:36.882 --> 00:03:38.351 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ARE WE SERIOUSLY JOKE
BEING THIS RIGHT NOW.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:39.585 size:88% position:44% line:85%
THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.

00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:41.887 align:start position:0% line:91%
ARE WE SERIOUSLY JOKING ABOUT
THIS.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.556 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT'S LITERALLY COMEDY
CENTRAL.

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:45.424 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IT IS A CENTRAL PART OF
COMEDY.

00:03:45.457 --> 00:03:47.960 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: IT IS THE CENTRAL
HUB FOR COMEDY, YOU'RE RIGHT

00:03:47.993 --> 00:03:50.129 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WANT TO SHOW BRADY'S
DENIAL.

00:03:50.162 --> 00:03:50.963 align:start position:0% line:85%
I HAVE TO SHOW THIS.

00:03:50.996 --> 00:03:52.565 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS IS HOW HE DENIED.

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:54.700 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IS TOM BRADY A CHEATER.

00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:55.968 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; 
(LAUGHTER)

00:03:56.001 --> 00:03:58.704 align:start position:0% line:85%
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.

00:03:58.737 --> 00:04:01.073 line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I DON'T BELIEVE SO.

00:04:01.106 --> 00:04:03.709 align:start position:0% line:91%
COULD YOU IMAGINE IF-- YOU
HAVE CHEATED ON ME.

00:04:03.742 --> 00:04:07.513 align:start position:0% line:85%
I DON'T BELIEVE SO.

00:04:07.546 --> 00:04:09.415 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
SOMETHING LARRY WILMORE

00:04:09.448 --> 00:04:10.516 align:start position:0% line:85%
WOULD DO.

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.588 size:81% position:41% line:91%
I WASN'T EVEN LISTENING, I
JUST GOT LOST IN HIS EYES.

00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:18.591 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: HOW MUCH OF THIS
IS SCHADENFREUDE?  HOW MUCH OF

00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:21.560 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT IS INSTEAD OF A PLAYER
CHEATING, IT IS PLAYER HATING.

00:04:21.593 --> 00:04:24.096 align:start position:0% line:91%
PEOPLE JUST WANT TO SEE TOM
BRADY JUST COME DOWN.

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:26.365 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, HE'S RICH, HE'S
TALENTED.

00:04:26.398 --> 00:04:29.001 align:start position:0% line:91%
GOOD LOOKING, HE HAS A HOT
WIFE.

00:04:29.034 --> 00:04:31.671 align:start position:0% line:85%
GET RID OF HIM.

00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:34.173 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THAT TO ME IS ONE OF
THE MOST AMERICAN PARTS OF

00:04:34.206 --> 00:04:35.274 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE STORY.

00:04:35.307 --> 00:04:39.145 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE DON'T LIKE YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE
TOO MUCH OF A WINNER.

00:04:39.178 --> 00:04:40.513 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HATE ON THE WINNERS.

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:41.514 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; I LOVE HIM.

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:44.950 align:start position:0% line:91%
I THINK-- LOOK, I'M A
SEAHAWKS FAN AND WE SHOULD

00:04:44.983 --> 00:04:49.955 align:start position:0% line:91%
HAVE RUN THE BALL ON THAT
LAST PLAY.

00:04:49.988 --> 00:04:53.059 align:start position:0% line:85%
WITH AND I STILL-- .

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:56.062 size:75% position:38% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: I THINK-- THEY
SHOULD BE SUSPENDED THE

00:04:56.095 --> 00:04:57.263 size:84% position:42% line:85%
WHOLE SEASON FOR THAT PLAY.

00:04:57.296 --> 00:05:00.733 size:78% position:39% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE ONE TRUE PUSHMENT
EVERY TIME YOU GOOGLE HIS

00:05:00.766 --> 00:05:04.203 align:start position:0% line:91%
NAME NOW SHRUNKEN BALLS WILL
COME UP.

00:05:04.236 --> 00:05:05.571 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: VERY NICE, I LOVE
IT.

00:05:05.604 --> 00:05:06.604 align:start position:0% line:85%
AWESOME.
