00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.630
So you've gone from equation to graph.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.947
Let's go the other way,
from graph to equation.

00:00:04.947 --> 00:00:09.872
Here's the graph of a line, and notice
that it goes through this point and

00:00:09.872 --> 00:00:10.752
this point.

00:00:10.752 --> 00:00:14.210
And I want you to tell me,
what is the equation of this line?

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.630
See if you can choose
the correct equation.
