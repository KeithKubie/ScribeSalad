00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.390
&gt;&gt;presenter: We're excited and honored to
welcome Dan Lynch here at Google today; author

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.560
of Google Your Family Tree.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.030
Dan is
a very experienced Google expert as well as

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.630
family historian.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.450
In his early days he was a vice president
of marketing at

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:25.270
Ancestry.com and has been a professional genealogy
consultant for many years.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.030
We're looking forward, on April 2nd, to the
1940 census release in the United States and

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:36.499
Dan is the public spokesperson for the 1940census.com
public consortium which

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:40.839
is a combination of a number of companies
in the industry.

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:44.440
And when we started the 20 percent effort
at Google over a year

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.239
ago, in family history, one of the first things
we did was pick up Dan's book and read it,

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.710
and it's been a great resource
to us and through that we got in connection

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.510
with Dan and he's been a valuable resource
in helping us in figuring out what

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.019
to do and how to move forward.

00:00:58.019 --> 00:00:59.850
So we're happy to have him here.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.600
I'm gonna turn it over to Dan.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.650
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: Thank you.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.650
[applause]

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:14.030
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: So thank you, both Dave and Robert
for hosting me today, but also thank everybody,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.030
thank all the Googlers for
creating the products which have certainly

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:26.170
saved me a lot of time and have saved millions,
if not billions of family

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.159
historians an awful lot of time and effort
in terms of connecting with the stuff that

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.469
we love and the stuff that we do.

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.140
I
will kind of, like some presentations, I'm

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.259
gonna throw a small disclaimer out in advance
because we've had a few little

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.500
technical issues so if you see me kind of
looking up, it's because I'm gonna look at

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.950
that monitor and not this one.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.720
Hopefully things are working the way I planned,
so if not, the show must go on.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.409
Just as I get started, and I know that
there's some folks who will be viewing this

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.780
from remote locations, my understanding is
they're dialing in some capacities,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.999
so I won't be able to get kind of the full
show of hands, but, at least, for those that

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:11.460
are here I'd like to kind of start
off with some questions that help me.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:19.310
So to jump right in, I'd like to get a quick
show of hands, how many genealogists do

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.180
we have in the audience?

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.190
[pause]

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.681
&gt;&gt;audience member: What's a genealogist?

00:02:25.681 --> 00:02:26.681
[laughter]

00:02:26.681 --> 00:02:27.681
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: Okay, that's good.

00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:28.681
Actually I'm glad that somebody just said
that.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:29.890
They said, "What's a genealogist?"

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.340
But just
by show of hands, if you view yourself as

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.030
a genealogist.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.970
So we have a couple, so that's good to know.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.000
That was a bit of a
set up question because my next questions,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.030
as you might guess; my questions are how many
of you have a collection of family

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.840
photos in a box at home somewhere stashed
in a closet or under the bed or that type

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.290
of thing?

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.510
The next question, how many
of you have at least one family photo or document

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.990
displayed somewhere in your home, apartment,
office?

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.780
Okay.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.700
How many of
you ever had a conversation, this is an interesting

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.210
one, how many of you ever had a conversation
with one of your

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.040
grandparents about their parents or grandparents?

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.370
Okay.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.510
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dave Lynch: And how many of you have visited

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.840
a foreign country with ties to your ethnic
roots?

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.070
Okay.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.710
And then have you,
and then here's the last one, the real set

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.790
up, how many of you have ever sat down at
any point in your life, grade school

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.990
forward, and kind of sketched out anything
that kind of resembles maybe a family tree,

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.460
or an attempt at a family tree?

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.760
So
that's kind of as I had expected because the

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.960
reality is, when you take the word genealogy
and throw it into the mix, the

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.480
word is often misunderstood.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.160
So when I asked the question how many genealogists
are here there were only one or two hands.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.900
Someone appropriately asked the question,
"What's a genealogist?"

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.900
But when I asked the questions that talk about
what it is

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.780
that we kind of do in family history and the
types of things that are involved, there starts

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.400
to be a lot of familiarity.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.950
And so, suddenly, when you ask the question,"
How many people have kind of sketched out

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.290
and played around with a family
tree?"

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.160
Almost every hand went up to some degree.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.970
I'm a big believer that, in some way shape
or form, almost everybody's a

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.620
family historian.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:27.190
I try to stay away from using the term genealogist
because it often, I think, incorrectly suggests

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.440
to
people that genealogy is something that requires

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.180
an advanced degree, it's maybe more academic,
it's maybe reserved only for

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.530
certain types of people that connect to royalty
or something.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.960
The reality is we all have families.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.280
And families have all
sorts of, you know, wonderful stories, have

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.540
stories that people try to sanitize, maybe
there's skeletons, there's all sorts

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.570
of things about people's family histories.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:57.380
And in my experience, in family history, I
grew up in New England, Connecticut,

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.530
Rhode Island and Massachusetts are the three
places I've lived and I had certainly certain

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.430
built in biases in terms of thinking
about family history and the history that

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.850
kind of surrounded me as an American.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.630
I had also made some assumptions
incorrectly that this is how it is here, but

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.450
that genealogy is probably different everywhere.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.560
I've since had the
opportunity, as a result of what I do for

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.030
a living, to talk to family historians and
present all over the world.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.640
And what's
really interesting to me is family history

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.850
really doesn't change from one country to
another.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.340
The content might change, how
it's stored may change, but the motivations

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.770
behind it, in a lot of kind of what's behind
family history really is kind of

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.680
the same, so it's very exciting.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.740
I only speak English, and in some cases, not
even very well, so most of my presentations

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.530
are in English speaking countries.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.320
But it's interesting for me, for instance,
when I go to Australia, and I've done quite

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.590
a
few presentations there, how common the experience

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.060
is for Australians doing family history research
and Americans doing

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:17.150
research, little different perhaps in the
UK just because of the histories of the country.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.871
And so these are things that
all, in some way shape or form, kind of all

00:06:19.871 --> 00:06:21.950
tie together.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.440
This I've learned, this monitor will not help
me at all.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.990
So I'm
just gonna look up there.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.990
[Laughs]

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.921
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: So family historians and Google,
so again, I'm gonna try to go out of my way

00:06:32.921 --> 00:06:36.419
not to use the term genealogists
but you could kind of put an equal sign between

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:37.889
them.

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:41.170
We have an awful lot in common.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:46.110
We both love the internet, I say we
being Googlers and family historians, right?

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.110
We're both trying to organize the world's
information, right?

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.370
We're trying to
do it kind of one family at a time; you guys

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.060
are on kind of a slightly different scale,
thank you.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.919
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: We all collect content, alright,

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.130
all of us.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.639
And for family historians it's kind of any
type, right?

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:05.630
The older
the better and the last thing is, as a family

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.160
historian, we rarely throw anything away.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.070
So we kind of always want to amass
more and more and more.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.850
People who are true family historians tend
to have, you know, folders and binders and

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.420
stuff in
boxes and just all sorts of things that they've

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.470
collected over time.

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.419
Now, those are ways that we're the same.

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:27.920
I think
there's also ways that perhaps family historians

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.260
and Google are maybe a little bit different.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.710
Google has been indexing
content since 1998 and that's wonderful.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.639
As family historians, maybe, oops I skipped
ahead.

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:42.890
Family history enthusiasts have
been indexing content for centuries.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:43.890
[laughter]

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:46.070
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: Okay, literally for centuries.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:50.350
And so there's just wonderful collections
out there from all sorts of, all

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.060
different parts of the world that really,
when it comes down to it, really that kind

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.419
of family history documents, family
history stories, family history artifacts

00:07:58.419 --> 00:08:01.900
that are kind of in museums and things and
archives.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.031
But certainly, as I talk
with my own experience over the last, or I

00:08:06.031 --> 00:08:09.639
say the American genealogy experience, over
the last few hundred years it's

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:13.860
interesting to see the types of materials
that get retained.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:19.090
Um, Google's pursuit of data is worth billions,
right?

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.240
It's a
business.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:29.180
But family history enthusiasts, I like to
say, our pursuit of what we're after is priceless.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.050
Okay, so these are
ways that maybe we're the same maybe we're

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:33.050
different.

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.110
Some of this is a little bit of a set up.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:41.509
Now, lastly I say, search
is your job and we, on behalf of all the family

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:42.579
historians out there, are very grateful.

00:08:42.579 --> 00:08:45.870
For us, search is our passion.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:46.870
And
what do we do?

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.649
You think about all of the different hobbies
that people use Google for, right?

00:08:49.649 --> 00:08:52.070
Gardeners, scuba divers,
whatever it is that people are interested

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.070
in.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:56.610
I'm a golfer, you know, there's a lot of other
hobbies that I have.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.300
But when
I use the tools that you've created for my

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:04.480
other hobbies, I kind of, I go to Google and
I do the quick query and I jump off

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.069
and I learn whatever it is I learn and then
I'm away.

00:09:07.069 --> 00:09:08.449
I'm off on somebody's website.

00:09:08.449 --> 00:09:10.319
I'm doing whatever it is.

00:09:10.319 --> 00:09:15.130
For family
history the hobby is the search.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.749
And the more we find, the more we want to
find.

00:09:18.749 --> 00:09:28.170
And so what you've created is central to
what it is we spend years, decades and sometimes

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.389
lifetimes doing.

00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:34.970
So it's been interesting, personally for me,
to see how

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:39.889
the internet and Google in particular have
truly transformed how family history work

00:09:39.889 --> 00:09:42.930
is done.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:47.269
Just by way of quick, as Dave
was giving a brief introduction, I have a

00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:51.149
hard time saying this; especially since the
cameras are rolling but I recently

00:09:51.149 --> 00:09:52.860
turned 50
[Laughs]

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:57.490
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: Hard to say, last week.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:02.470
And I got involved in family history when
I was a teenager, and it was maybe somewhat

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:10.110
by accident, but in 1976 the country had the
bicentennial celebration and I kind of remember

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.860
that, it was interesting to
me.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:16.529
Six or seven months later there was this little
event that took place on television, Alex

00:10:16.529 --> 00:10:21.790
Haley's Roots, eight nights in
a row, in the tail end of January of 77'.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:25.290
And at the time, there was only 3 channels
to choose from, so if Mom and Dad and

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:30.320
my Grandmother who lived with us wanted to
watch Roots, it looks like I was gonna watch

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.550
Roots too cause there was no
internet.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:41.869
And in a lot of ways, I think about that experience
and that's really the spark, for me, of why

00:10:41.869 --> 00:10:44.829
I initially
became involved in family history and then

00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:47.680
certainly being in New England being surrounded
by a lot of history all the

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.389
time.

00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:54.619
And so, the reason I share that is because
I had the opportunity, and I'm quite thankful,

00:10:54.619 --> 00:10:58.649
that I did not, when I
first got involved in family history it was

00:10:58.649 --> 00:11:02.810
not using computers and it was certainly not
the internet and certainly not

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.040
even computers.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:09.019
It was going the libraries, pulling rolls
of micro films, going to archives, going to

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:13.100
cemeteries, going to
town halls, pulling ledger books off the shelves,

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.269
kind of going through them what I'll call
the old way.

00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:20.929
Had it not been
for the understanding of the problems that

00:11:20.929 --> 00:11:25.749
occur in record keeping and archiving and
information storage and all those

00:11:25.749 --> 00:11:29.679
types of things, I don't think I'd have actually
have the knowledge or appreciation for what

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:33.589
the tools today have to offer
for people who are just getting into family

00:11:33.589 --> 00:11:34.589
history.

00:11:34.589 --> 00:11:37.119
So I think that was kind of fairly relevant.

00:11:37.119 --> 00:11:40.050
In terms of why I wrote
this particular book, I thought about what

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:44.179
to share today, and I do a lot of presentations
about family history but most

00:11:44.179 --> 00:11:49.899
often, forget about most often, never is it
to a group of Googlers at your headquarters.

00:11:49.899 --> 00:11:54.930
I usually go on weekends of week
days to family history societies in different

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.379
parts of the world, and I'm meeting with folks
who've come, you know a

00:11:58.379 --> 00:12:03.850
hundred, two hundred, three hundred people
who've come because they're involved in actively

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.689
researching their family
history.

00:12:06.689 --> 00:12:11.630
Many of them are what I'll categorize, as
age 65+.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:16.779
Few of them grew up with computers as a core
tool that they had at

00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:17.779
their disposal.

00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:21.970
And although the demographic has shifted over
time, which has been excited for me to see,

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:27.990
you're seeing a
younger and younger mix coming into family

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:28.990
history.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.120
So it's kind of neat when I go now I see folks,
well of course I've

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.819
gotten older over time, there's people who
will come to these who are actually younger

00:12:34.819 --> 00:12:36.509
and are really interested.

00:12:36.509 --> 00:12:39.050
And it's
also been interesting kind of exchange of

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.439
information that I've seen take place within
individual families.

00:12:42.439 --> 00:12:45.869
Where you have
the older generation within the family who

00:12:45.869 --> 00:12:50.029
has the family knowledge, you have the younger
generation who has the technology

00:12:50.029 --> 00:12:51.709
knowledge, the comfort level.

00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:53.059
They've just grown up with it.

00:12:53.059 --> 00:12:57.149
I look at my 16 and 18 year old daughters
who they just always

00:12:57.149 --> 00:13:01.100
had, like wasn't Google just always around
and wasn't the internet always there?

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.399
And that's how they view it and that's
how they should view it.

00:13:04.399 --> 00:13:08.989
So when they know that they want to do a research
project or something for school they go and

00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:11.319
they
type in a few words and they're off and running.

00:13:11.319 --> 00:13:14.199
So it's been interesting to see that information
exchanged and kind of

00:13:14.199 --> 00:13:16.489
bringing the two generations together.

00:13:16.489 --> 00:13:21.019
Meaning, kind of grandparents and grandchildren
it's like, "I'll tell you about the

00:13:21.019 --> 00:13:24.480
family, you kind of tell me how this thing
works."

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.350
So it's really a bridging of the generation
gap and what's interesting

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.220
now as well is certainly the baby boomer generation.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:35.050
They have the time, they have the interest,
many of them, of course

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:39.759
I'm at the tail end of the boomer but many
of them are retirement age now and are actively

00:13:39.759 --> 00:13:43.319
pursuing the things they had
intended on pursuing in retirement, family

00:13:43.319 --> 00:13:46.540
history is chief among them.

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.170
So it's kind of a great time.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.869
As far as the tools
that you guys have created, there's almost

00:13:52.869 --> 00:13:55.170
every tool that I could think of.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.250
I actually probably would have needed three
more slides.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.220
I kind of just picked a few.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.470
When you think about, and I don't know in
terms of all the folks that are here,

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.660
what different projects are represented.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.220
My guess is, almost every product, or project
that you can mention within the

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:14.199
buildings somehow have relevance to family
history work.

00:14:14.199 --> 00:14:15.839
And I have here just kind of a list.

00:14:15.839 --> 00:14:20.029
Certainly web search, Google
images, fantastic, maps and Google Earth are

00:14:20.029 --> 00:14:22.329
just indispensable for family history.

00:14:22.329 --> 00:14:26.809
And I'm gonna show throughout the
course of the next thirty minutes or so, just

00:14:26.809 --> 00:14:30.980
different examples of how the tools have been
used and how they're kind of eye

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.709
opening experiences for family historians
around the world.

00:14:34.709 --> 00:14:38.269
You know, Google video and YouTube, Google
News and the News

00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:40.309
Archive.

00:14:40.309 --> 00:14:43.920
The News Archive in many ways is far more
valuable to family historians than Google

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.089
News is.

00:14:47.089 --> 00:14:49.489
Google Books, I got a
couple fascinating slides on Google Books

00:14:49.489 --> 00:14:53.769
and I think that was a great project when
I first read about that some years back

00:14:53.769 --> 00:14:57.889
about digitizing every book ever printed and
we thought, "Good!

00:14:57.889 --> 00:15:00.899
When can you get that done?"

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:01.899
You know?

00:15:01.899 --> 00:15:05.339
Google Alerts, I'm
amazed by how many people, certainly not in

00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:08.709
the building, but when I do my talks I'm amazed
at how many folks are still not

00:15:08.709 --> 00:15:09.929
making use of Google Alerts.

00:15:09.929 --> 00:15:14.509
I usually ask for a show of hands and I see
two or three hands go up and then a year later

00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:16.459
I
might go back to the same society and every

00:15:16.459 --> 00:15:20.619
hand, as soon as you show folks what can be
done with the tools, they all want

00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:25.050
to use them immediately and they're wondering
why they hadn't been using them.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:29.720
Google sites, Blogger, the translate tool
and the language tools are, these are all

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.990
interval, these are not just kind of occasionally
I'll use them for family

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:37.859
history, all of these things tie so nicely
together with one another for the types of

00:15:37.859 --> 00:15:40.489
things we do every single day.

00:15:40.489 --> 00:15:42.839
So
I'll kind of skip over some of the rest of

00:15:42.839 --> 00:15:44.699
this stuff cause I know you guys can read
this.

00:15:44.699 --> 00:15:48.079
Patent search, you may think
how?

00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:50.119
How does that tie in?

00:15:50.119 --> 00:15:55.410
Chances are every name in the patent, you
know, they have a mother, a father, a sister,

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.029
brother,
son daughter, I mean there's some amazing

00:15:58.029 --> 00:16:01.089
things that can be learned from the content
that's out there that you guys have

00:16:01.089 --> 00:16:05.660
helped organize and collect for us.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:12.910
Now, I have a lot of fun with this when I
go do these talks and always talk about WWW

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.060
and how it's critical for family history.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:19.449
And then I usually pause and I ask the question
to the genealogy enthusiasts in

00:16:19.449 --> 00:16:21.940
the room, I say, "We're all familiar with
WWW, right?"

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:27.480
And usually it's a second or two till the
crowd says, "World Wide

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.480
Web."

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.369
And then I stop and kind of make a funny face
and I say, "Well, I guess so, but not really

00:16:32.369 --> 00:16:34.109
because I'm a family
historian.

00:16:34.109 --> 00:16:37.549
And I was a family historian before www was
around."

00:16:37.549 --> 00:16:40.179
And so I remind folks, I say, "The whole reason
we have to

00:16:40.179 --> 00:16:44.701
type www before Google is it reminds you that
these are the three questions that you're

00:16:44.701 --> 00:16:46.149
trying to answer."

00:16:46.149 --> 00:16:49.360
Right, when you
go to the tool and fill in the box, think

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.129
about who am I looking for?

00:16:52.129 --> 00:16:53.670
Where were they?

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:55.290
And when were they there?

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:56.920
And
usually, of course, it's tied to an event.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:03.120
And I continue to make, kind of, a joke about
that cause it's a really nice way

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.720
to remind people, "Hey, when I turn to this
tool these are the questions."

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.280
These are the same questions that we were
trying

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.279
to answer twenty years ago with microfilm,
right?

00:17:12.279 --> 00:17:17.000
But this tool kind of lends itself perfectly
to what we're doing.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.179
Oops,
sorry I skipped something.

00:17:21.179 --> 00:17:22.909
There.

00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:28.179
I've been using this particular image for
at least ten years, if not longer.

00:17:28.179 --> 00:17:34.080
This, to me,
I try to get people to visualize what it is

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:38.150
that we do when turn to the internet and we
turn to, I say we family historians

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:41.590
turn to Google and we're asking an awful lot.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:44.000
In the back of our mind, we have a person
we're trying to figure out one

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.850
little thing for so we're asking a lot because
we expect Google to figure it out for us and

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.799
just give it to us really
quick.

00:17:50.799 --> 00:17:54.289
But really, I try to get people to figure
out what's behind it; it's the concept of

00:17:54.289 --> 00:17:55.289
filtering.

00:17:55.289 --> 00:17:59.470
And again, people, I
worked in the computer industry, Boolean is

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:01.419
kind of familiar to me.

00:18:01.419 --> 00:18:03.419
But if I'm sitting with folks that are in
their 60's,

00:18:03.419 --> 00:18:08.419
70's or 80's and I talk about Boolean Operators,
well they're not gonna, you know, unless they

00:18:08.419 --> 00:18:10.860
came from a specialized
background, they're not gonna be familiar

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.020
with these terms.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:16.389
So what I try to do in very layman's terms
is describe the

00:18:16.389 --> 00:18:18.740
concept of filtering and why it's important.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.670
I show this image and I ask them to always
remember this throughout all my

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:25.960
talks, is that, and you see it on TV all the
time.

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.920
You know, you take a shovel full of dirt,
you pour it into the screen

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.920
and you sift.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:35.110
And gradually the things that, an archeologist
is not interested, gradually the kind of,

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.919
you know, the
irrelevant matter falls to the ground and

00:18:37.919 --> 00:18:40.659
what's gradually left is some kind of nugget.

00:18:40.659 --> 00:18:44.559
And in this particular instance it's
a piece of pottery or something and some expert

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:48.140
could tell you what it is and when it was
carved and who carved it.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.580
Family
historians do the same thing, but what we

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:56.390
look for, we spend, you know, years in some
cases looking for things that look

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:57.860
like this.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.789
This happens to be a passengers list.

00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:06.330
It's got somewhere on there, Domenico De Tota
was my, it's a good ethnic

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.330
Irish name, right?

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.090
Domenico De Tota.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:10.750
Half Irish half Italian.

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.750
And so on the Italian side, you know, they
came to the United

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:14.750
States.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:18.370
It took me an awful lot of time to find this
passenger arrival record because the records

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.920
weren't digitized, they
weren't transcribed.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.139
You had to crank through a lot of microfilm.

00:19:24.139 --> 00:19:26.230
Now things are done a little bit differently.

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:29.490
But we will
spend, we family historians, will spend years

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:31.370
looking for things just like this.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.799
Because when I find the passenger list,
often there will be other information that

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:36.210
gives me a clue.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.470
Who was he traveling with?

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:38.759
Where was he going?

00:19:38.759 --> 00:19:40.490
So it's worth
the chase.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:44.850
The thrill of the chase, it's worth it to
get to it to find out what other clues lie

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:49.710
that kind of point us in
another direction.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.960
The Google homepage, you guys are pretty familiar
with this.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.960
[Laughs]

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.919
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: So I show this and I always remind
people because I know the question's gonna

00:19:57.919 --> 00:20:03.480
come up and I'd say about half
the time they ask it before I get to it, and

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:08.490
they say, "What's that do I feel lucky thing?"
and I say, "First of all you're

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:12.309
a genealogist so don't click it because you're
not that lucky."

00:20:12.309 --> 00:20:15.690
But I explain to me, of course, what it is
so they know

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:18.789
what you guys are creating and how and why
etcetera.

00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:22.960
But the reason I'm purposely mentioning here
is as family historians

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:27.600
really the worst thing we can do, the worst
thing that you guys can probably do is have

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:32.179
someone rely on something like that
because many time in family history it's the

00:20:32.179 --> 00:20:37.950
accidental discovery that becomes the most
important one for us.

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.610
And so we
need to see many results.

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.510
We need to see options.

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:47.850
We need to see and view and evaluate in a
different fashion than what

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:52.320
I'll call a lot of users, because, again,
I'll go back to my comment earlier, search

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.059
is our hobby.

00:20:54.059 --> 00:20:58.120
And search is core to
what we do, all over the world and we're searching.

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.380
So, you know, on that random chance that someone
clicks that do I feel

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:06.340
lucky and actually does get something that's
highly relevant, fantastic!

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.730
I've never had the experience.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.110
Not for genealogy.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:14.320
If I wanted to know Abraham Lincoln's birthday
I could probably get it real quick.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.960
I probably don't even have to click
anymore.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:25.140
Let's see where, now, this is a fake screen
by the way.

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:28.590
Luckily for me I play with Photoshop all the
time.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:30.929
Really
in the back of a lot of family historian's

00:21:30.929 --> 00:21:34.390
minds, they maybe don't admit it, but that's
kind of what they're looking for.

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:41.600
They wanna go to the Google search box, type
in a couple of words that are character strings,

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.830
right, to you guys, but to us
there's emotions, there's family connection,

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:48.440
there's the concept of the brick wall they've
been searching for, for 20 years

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:53.509
or something, they wanna type in a name and
get right to this; the tree that kind of builds

00:21:53.509 --> 00:21:57.230
out and this is it and I wanna
find those five, six generations.

00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:01.990
And I say that a little bit tongue-in-cheek
because the reality is; many family historians

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:07.559
truly
do enjoy the search.

00:22:07.559 --> 00:22:12.570
If you offered, I'd be willing to bet if you
were to go to a genealogy conference or a

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.179
meeting or
something and offered many people the opportunity

00:22:15.179 --> 00:22:18.210
of, " I can tell you, your, about your Great
Grandmother.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:19.870
Matter of fact I
have a chart right here, would you like to

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:20.870
see it?"

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:25.159
Half of them would probably say yes, half
would say no cause half would

00:22:25.159 --> 00:22:27.230
be like, "You know, I wanna be the one to
find it.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:28.880
I wanna be the one to discover it.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.980
I've been looking for too long for
you to just hand it to me."

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:34.309
And then if you did hand it to them, they'd
be looking at it like, "Well, how do I know

00:22:34.309 --> 00:22:35.600
this
is right?"

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.240
So there's a lot of interesting things about
the research that we do.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.620
And another thing about family history, I
try to mention this a little bit I think,

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.169
is we often don't know what we're searching
for.

00:22:47.169 --> 00:22:49.919
We won't know the name.

00:22:49.919 --> 00:22:52.700
We won't
necessarily know the exact location.

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:58.720
We've heard, in some cases, very vague stories
that have either intentionally been

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:04.850
kind of sanitized or accidentally just over
time and memory fade and its third or fourth

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.240
generation of the story.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:10.700
So in
family history there's this adage that says,

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.700
"Don't dismiss whatever family legend exists."

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.289
And every family's got their
stories.

00:23:16.289 --> 00:23:20.580
Whatever story that's out there, don't dismiss
whatever you hear.

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:21.900
Hear it.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.480
Try to objectively listen to it.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.780
Try to
record it and write it down.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.980
Then start your research because there's generally
a scrap of truth to some element of the

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:31.980
story.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:35.020
So you don't know where the piece of truth
is and gradually you can find them.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:40.049
I have a couple of examples of some
that are more entertaining.

00:23:40.049 --> 00:23:41.049
And they're all true by the way.

00:23:41.049 --> 00:23:42.549
None of these are made up.

00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:46.890
And so, I've already mentioned that
the accidental discoveries are the most exciting.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:51.540
So what I'm gonna do, I think the next slide,
I'm gonna jump in and show

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:57.070
how I typically at some of these sessions,
the tools that you folks take for granted

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:01.909
because you've created them, how we
are using them in ways that are truly eye

00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:04.460
opening for a lot of folks.

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:07.890
Okay, I've picked five.

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.000
Typically this is the,
depending on the types of presentations that

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.830
I have, if it's an all day workshop I'll do
four presentations in a day, each

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:18.820
ones about an hour and fifteen hour and twenty
minutes long, I always will start with this

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:19.820
one.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.169
And I talk about, what I
call, search essentials.

00:24:23.169 --> 00:24:27.559
And at the beginning of the presentation I'll
ask a couple show of hands questions and I'll

00:24:27.559 --> 00:24:30.620
say,
"My goal for the session is to make sure that

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:34.570
everybody that leaves today is an expert in
using Google.

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:36.840
Not just okay, but
you're an expert."

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.139
And I always see the looks of stunned like,
"Is he for real?"

00:24:40.139 --> 00:24:41.139
You know?

00:24:41.139 --> 00:24:42.139
[Laughs]

00:24:42.139 --> 00:24:44.039
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: And then I tell them that the
reason that I know they can be experts is

00:24:44.039 --> 00:24:49.960
because this stuff is easy, it's
there, it works every time and then I step

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.890
through and show the examples.

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:56.260
And it's an awful lot of fun, after the fact,
to

00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:01.730
get comments, phone calls, and emails from
people with just bizarre discoveries.

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:05.590
It's gotten, even more so now, because
there be people who will actually be sitting

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:10.169
there with a laptop or an iPad in the talk
and I've had people, even last

00:25:10.169 --> 00:25:14.210
month when I was in Utah doing a presentation,
literally jump out of their seat and wanna

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:15.659
tell everyone in the room,
"Look!"

00:25:15.659 --> 00:25:17.429
You know, what they've just found.

00:25:17.429 --> 00:25:19.610
So it's kind of an exciting thing for folks.

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.769
So I talk about these particular
five commands.

00:25:22.769 --> 00:25:27.519
So let me just describe how it is that we
use them for family history in particular,

00:25:27.519 --> 00:25:28.519
alright?

00:25:28.519 --> 00:25:31.360
Now, I start
of pretty simple and say, "Now, for us, we

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.090
don't want to immediately" First, I try to
remind people, every query does not

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:41.009
have to have multiple words and special syntax
and special commands, right?

00:25:41.009 --> 00:25:43.030
I'd say get that out of your mind.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:46.259
But I like
to expose them to them and I like to explain

00:25:46.259 --> 00:25:50.950
which ones are perfectly suited for family
history so when the need arises

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:56.139
they understand them, they're familiar and
they can put them to use when they need it.

00:25:56.139 --> 00:25:58.570
And by better understanding them I
think it makes them better searchers.

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:01.730
It kind of, asks better questions to get better
results.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:05.269
The first one that I simply
talk about and I do a little talking about

00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:09.690
key words and stop words and some other things,
you know, case sensitivity

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:13.950
etcetera and then I get to the very first
filter.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:18.179
So we're past the point that single word key
queries are gonna get, what

00:26:18.179 --> 00:26:22.040
I'll call, meaningful results anymore because
in my case the last name is Lynch.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.770
If I type in Lynch into Google, of course
I'm gonna get, you know, there's certainly

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:26.879
gonna be at least two commas in the answer.

00:26:26.879 --> 00:26:30.620
And I found them really fast and
that's great but if I'm in my kind of family

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:34.710
history mode, the relevance of those top ten,
top twenty, top thirty are

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:38.090
probably not gonna be all that great unless,
you know, I truly am just extraordinarily

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:40.399
lucky on that given day.

00:26:40.399 --> 00:26:43.299
What I can
immediately do is my first filter that I can

00:26:43.299 --> 00:26:49.049
train people to learn and to use is the similar
words or similar terms feature

00:26:49.049 --> 00:26:55.059
with the tilde and to place the word, the
tilde directly in front of the world genealogy

00:26:55.059 --> 00:26:59.570
because it will ask, "Please, in
this immense index that you guys have amassed

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:03.720
for us, can you please return only the pages
that mention my surname that

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:09.600
I'm researching, and also that mention genealogy
or words with similar meanings to genealogy."

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.919
And what that will
immediately do is, kind of; filter out all

00:27:11.919 --> 00:27:13.649
the other stuff.

00:27:13.649 --> 00:27:16.300
You know that picture I showed with all the
dirt and the

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.570
sifter, the little screen?

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:20.559
All the stuffs that irrelevant will fall to
the ground and the only thing that's gonna

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:23.231
be left
on the screen is the pages that really matter

00:27:23.231 --> 00:27:26.629
because they've got all the right words on
the page.

00:27:26.629 --> 00:27:30.480
And my technique for
figuring out what your similar terms were,

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.330
I'll kind of get to a bit later.

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:38.409
But this is an important, and there's about
five or six phrases that I will often recommend

00:27:38.409 --> 00:27:44.279
in conjunction with the tilde because it calls
out and filters out just the

00:27:44.279 --> 00:27:47.440
kind of things that we, as family historians,
want to see.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.899
The "or" commands, again, second nature to
you guys, but for

00:27:50.899 --> 00:27:54.309
many family historians it's like you would
have thought I created it.

00:27:54.309 --> 00:27:57.040
I mean, I just sit there and there's many,
many, many

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:02.390
cases in family history where there's either
variant spellings of surnames, and I'm sure

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:07.490
in this very room many of you
could either, your own name or a surname in

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:10.999
your family where there's two spellings that
are very common.

00:28:10.999 --> 00:28:14.049
You have that
use for the or, you have family stories where

00:28:14.049 --> 00:28:16.970
people are quite sure, "I think they came
to the Port of Boston."

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:20.110
Or other
people say New York or other people say Philadelphia.

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:23.360
And so there's plenty of times we can use
the or command as a

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.950
conditional operator to allow multiple conditions
as were kind of filtering through but we still

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:32.620
want to get at some other
data.

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:37.940
The minus sign, again, the www piece is so
important to us.

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:41.879
We often are looking for "who" right?

00:28:41.879 --> 00:28:45.549
And then there's a
"where" component tied to some place in the

00:28:45.549 --> 00:28:46.620
world.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.620
But often place names are repetitive here
and there.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:54.200
And in my case, of
course, Waterbury, Connecticut, as luck has

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.330
it there's also a Lynch family, a Patrick
Lynch family in Waterbury, Vermont.

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:00.289
And
there's a lot of stuff up there.

00:29:00.289 --> 00:29:04.960
The only thing from Waterbury, Vermont that
I'm interested in is Ben and Jerry's ice cream.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:09.480
So I do the minus symbol when I do my queries,
and its second nature to me now.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:12.269
If I'm doing it, I just kind of
automatically will if I'm typing, as soon

00:29:12.269 --> 00:29:16.139
as I type in Waterbury it's almost always
I type in minus Vermont.

00:29:16.139 --> 00:29:18.860
And there's
other ways I could get at this but this is

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:24.090
my way of showing how these simple commands
can become power tools.

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:27.750
Alright,
quotations for, kind of exact phrase matching,

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:30.900
this one becomes important as well.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:34.820
Family history data is being put online
at an amazing rate.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:40.389
There are individuals, there are commercial
organizations, there are non profit entities,

00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:42.289
there are Boy
Scout troops that are going around through

00:29:42.289 --> 00:29:45.860
cemeteries and writing down names on headstones
so they can earn a merit badge,

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:48.669
I mean there are so many exciting things happening
right now.

00:29:48.669 --> 00:29:51.629
And as the names get transcribed they get
transcribed like if

00:29:51.629 --> 00:29:56.749
it shows up on a passenger list, many times
passenger lists or census records will have

00:29:56.749 --> 00:29:59.279
the surname listed before the
given name.

00:29:59.279 --> 00:30:03.259
So instead of Patrick Lynch it'll have Lynch,
Patrick.

00:30:03.259 --> 00:30:05.980
So it's great if I do an exact phrase match,
Patrick

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:06.980
Lynch.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:13.110
It'll skip right over Lynch, Patrick, unless
I, of course, ask for different things in

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:14.110
different ways.

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:15.879
And
thankfully you guys have other solutions for

00:30:15.879 --> 00:30:19.419
that but, again, my job when I go to these
sessions is to train people how do

00:30:19.419 --> 00:30:22.529
some of these things work and remember what
you're asking for.

00:30:22.529 --> 00:30:24.990
If you're asking for an exact phrase match,
you're gonna get

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:26.759
an exact phrase match.

00:30:26.759 --> 00:30:33.460
So sometimes it's good to ask, sometimes it's
not.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:35.129
This one someone might have to correct me
and I'm

00:30:35.129 --> 00:30:38.029
in the right place to ask this question and
I think this has changed a little bit over

00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:39.029
time.

00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:42.179
The asterisk used to work
inside quotes only and now, of course, the

00:30:42.179 --> 00:30:46.669
asterisk you can kind of get away with it
in other cases where you can just

00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:52.201
simply type in either portions of a query
and the asterisk will kind of take place of

00:30:52.201 --> 00:30:54.360
what's in between it.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.860
I'm gonna kind
of skip over this and then wait till the end

00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:00.010
because I think I might have a question for
you guys on that one.

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:02.749
But the
ability to do wildcards sometimes becomes

00:31:02.749 --> 00:31:04.960
important in family history.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.220
Now, here's the query, the series of queries
kind of

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:10.919
in action.

00:31:10.919 --> 00:31:17.710
Again, not new to you in terms of what they
do, but in terms of how we're using them,

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:18.710
perhaps.

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:22.110
So family history
throughout the world, all of us are kind of

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:25.309
looking for, you know, "Where was my Grandfather?

00:31:25.309 --> 00:31:26.309
He lived here.

00:31:26.309 --> 00:31:27.919
etcetera,
etcetera ." And so, what I kind of try to

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:34.950
train people to do is to think, kind of start
broad and work your way and refine.

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:40.110
I don't wanna see, I would be frustrated,
personally, and felt like I had not done my

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:44.259
job, if I went and saw someone after
the session and I saw them all thinking that

00:31:44.259 --> 00:31:47.980
this is what they have to do because many
times they don't.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.940
But depending on
the surname, especially some surnames are

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:51.940
difficult.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:56.889
I mean, you have names for instance like,
um, William Gregory.

00:31:56.889 --> 00:31:59.130
That's someone's name I know.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:02.340
Well that's two first names.

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:07.200
You have someone who's last name might have
another meaning; the

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.779
name like Ford or White.

00:32:08.779 --> 00:32:12.110
Well if you're gonna do a search for "Ford"
you're gonna get an awful lot on cars.

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:13.460
You're gonna do
"White" you're gonna get color.

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.899
I mean, there's all sorts of words that have
multiple meanings.

00:32:16.899 --> 00:32:19.460
How do we figure out just
what we're after?

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.240
Sometimes we have to employ certain techniques,
sometimes we don't.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.610
So what I try to show is, stepping
from the top down, is kind of how you can

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:31.659
gradually, within a matter of seconds as you
know, just do a query, look at the

00:32:31.659 --> 00:32:32.659
number.

00:32:32.659 --> 00:32:36.260
Refine and filter, refine and filter, refine
and look to see where it is getting.

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:40.279
To the point that we get,
ultimately, somewhere down here.

00:32:40.279 --> 00:32:46.649
Genealogists, I'm not looking for just one
or two, I'm looking for maybe 25 to 100 because

00:32:46.649 --> 00:32:47.649
then what do I wanna do?

00:32:47.649 --> 00:32:48.649
[Rubbing hands together]

00:32:48.649 --> 00:32:53.570
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: Then I wanna sit down and look
at web pages and I wanna see, "Why is it that

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:54.649
these things are coming up?"

00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:59.070
If I
got 27 results here and it matches all this

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:01.840
criteria for relevance I wanna read every
one.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.259
I'm gonna visit every single one
of these websites.

00:33:04.259 --> 00:33:05.259
Why?

00:33:05.259 --> 00:33:09.749
Because they mention someone named Patrick
Lynch, who I know to be a potential relative

00:33:09.749 --> 00:33:14.169
of mine,
they're genealogy pages, they mention Waterbury

00:33:14.169 --> 00:33:17.899
but they don't mention Vermont, they somehow
mention a date range of 1850-

00:33:17.899 --> 00:33:22.740
1930, I mean, it's pretty relevant to what
I'm doing.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:25.840
And I've, kind of gone from the whole web
to 27 pages.

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:29.120
I'll take the
time to look at the 27 pages.

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.990
Now, what's frustrating for someone like me,
because I've been doing it for so long is

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:36.090
25 of
those pages; I probably put on the internet.

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:37.090
[Laughs]

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:41.090
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: The other two are probably somebody
visited, took my content and then republished,

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:42.600
you know?

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:45.740
But that's okay
because then I actually just say minus Lynchonline.com

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:48.850
and I remove my own website and I'm left with
the two unique

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:50.000
websites.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.119
So there's ways to get at everything.

00:33:52.119 --> 00:33:56.830
Now, the other thing I'd kind of like to share
is there's this mindset, of

00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:04.940
course, there's this thought, you know, that
family history and genealogists like old stuff

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.139
and much of it is, but you
know, family history is, I like to say, family

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:12.540
history is happening every day; it's made
every day.

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.490
I was reminded of this,
in particular, when I was going through, getting

00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:20.350
ready some of the slides and I was looking
for one particular image and I

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:23.980
kind of laughed when I saw this little scan
in the upper right hand corner of your screen

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:29.630
there, and my daughter who is now
a freshman in college drew this some years

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:32.630
ago and I was like, "Wow!

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:34.660
That's family history now."

00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:39.380
No longer is it that cute
little thing I scanned and saved, you know?

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:43.410
Another great photograph in the left there
of my same daughter, my older

00:34:43.410 --> 00:34:50.870
daughter, walking along with a great uncle
of mine, who was 93 when he passed away.

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:55.310
And you look at that picture and one
can only wonder what is it the two of them

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:57.320
are talking about?

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.540
I mean, this is family history.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.320
So it's maybe not the kind of
thing that you're gonna find online.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.820
We'll never know what they were talking about
online but there's a lot of neat things

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.010
that we come across in family history.

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:12.550
Now, I talked about the www before.

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:14.130
Often times it's "who".

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:17.400
But many times there's
little scraps of information that we have,

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:23.950
you know, and I'm often tempted to do show
of hands but I won't here, I remember

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:27.080
distinctly growing up with m Grandmother living
in the house.

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:31.310
I remember the word "campobasso", the word.

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:34.420
I didn't really
even know what a "campobasso" was.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.700
I didn't necessarily know if it was a place
or whatever, I mean, it was just a word I

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.100
heard.

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:44.100
And when I began doing my research, I began
to try to figure out, "What is this place?"

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.620
And now, of course, it's
ease on the internet and you see or hear a

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.960
place name and you go to Google and you start
typing it in and Google kind of

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:55.410
comes up and gives you this wonderful selection
of things and images etcetera.

00:35:55.410 --> 00:36:02.250
This is very common in family history that,
especially as Americans or Australians, we're

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:06.480
kind of countries of immigrants and gradually
the populations, which are very

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.280
diverse, you know, we come from everywhere
else.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:13.650
So it's a matter of chasing down all the clues
and figuring out, you know,

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:16.010
how do we connect the dots.

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:19.330
Now, what's interesting about something like
these queries and I'm gonna get into some

00:36:19.330 --> 00:36:23.190
examples
to show how we everyday are using these tools

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:28.520
to do very basic things that have a profound
impact on our collection of

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.660
information.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:33.150
I type in something like Campobasso, which
I now know to be a place name in Southern

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.850
Italy.

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:38.410
And what's good
is, of course, Google brings me to Google,

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:42.370
on the left hand nav, of course I can start
quickly filtering through and using

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:43.370
options.

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:47.070
What's interesting is how the tools work interchangeably
with each other.

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:51.180
So I type in Campobasso, Google
recognizes it, I click on images and there's

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.800
often an awful lot of images.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.810
I might have to take my glasses off to see
this

00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:55.930
one.

00:36:55.930 --> 00:37:01.010
It found 3 million plus results.

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:04.540
But if I click over to Google images in particular,
I might say, "You know, I'm not

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:09.340
interested in just any image from Campobasso,
maybe right now I'm looking for pictures of

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:11.960
the cemetery or pictures of a
church."

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:17.260
And so I type in the word "cemetery" or "church"
and I get a little bit more refined.

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:21.720
And I drop down to 30 thousand
results.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:28.800
What I've found is if I'm looking for pictures
of a cemetery and church from Campobasso Italy,

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.340
it's probably more
useful to ask using the Italian words for

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.800
cemetery and church.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.420
And I routinely and I only speak English,
so I routinely

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.830
will flip over and just do real quick translations.

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:41.270
Sometimes it's of whole documents.

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:42.410
Sometimes it's of a sentence.

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:43.760
Sometimes it's an email.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.840
Sometimes it's a single word or two.

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.810
And then I go back and re execute the query.

00:37:47.810 --> 00:37:51.780
And, of course,
I've since, I kind of keep on hand a list

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:55.040
of the words that over time I can remember
some of them.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:59.120
But I have a list of
words in Italian with the corresponding English

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.120
word.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:03.220
And I'll turn around and I'll execute the
same query and I'll ask

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:08.350
Google, "Give me Campobasso, chiesa or cimitero."

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:10.130
Anybody speak Italian?

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:11.250
How bad did I do with the pronunciation?

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:12.740
I don't
know.

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:19.250
But what happens is I get ten times as many
results, relevant images and I can look and

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:23.400
often times it's a much
richer mix and a more interesting selection

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.640
of images than I would get if I just used
the English version.

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:28.980
And chances are
real good that they're also coming from Italian

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:29.980
websites.

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.790
Okay, and there's a lot of other things that
end up happening as

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:33.990
a result of this.

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:36.010
This truly did happen, okay?

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.310
I did a query and I was simply looking for
a picture of a church.

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:41.500
And I
really didn't even care which church at this

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.500
point.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:46.560
I wanted a church from Campobasso for something
I was working on.

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:51.420
And I
noticed that the first image that was there

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.560
it gives a little description.

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:59.950
And I saw it said "Chiesa San Giovanni Battista"
and I thought how do I know that phrase?

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:03.230
How do I, that rings a bell to me.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:06.340
I switched over, I went to my pedigree chart
in

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:11.430
my genealogy software and I went to the Italian
half of the family and suddenly I look and

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:16.260
I see there's this individual
right here named Giovanni Battista Orsatti

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:17.930
in my family tree.

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:20.920
And then I picked up the phone cause people
like genealogists

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.350
still use these other devices.

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:28.020
I picked up the phone and called an 88-year-old
aunt, great aunt, who's in Florida and I

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:33.970
had her talk to me about her, in this case,
her uncle John.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:37.430
And Giovanni Battista, he took his name, he
of course that's

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:42.140
where his family was from and he was named
for the patron saint of this area; Giovanni

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:45.060
Battista, and that's where they got
the name from.

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:49.100
So there's a lot of things you kind of learn
these are some of the small accidental discoveries

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.860
and how they
tie together.

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.700
How, who would have ever thought, I certainly
wouldn't of thought I was gonna find that

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:56.080
necessarily through
Google image search.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:00.110
But just in a small description it triggers
a thing and I can actually go back now and

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:03.310
kind of tie
some more specifics of this family to that

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:04.310
church.

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:07.410
I've since actually gotten copies of the baptism
records for this

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:11.330
individual from the church too, which is fun.

00:40:11.330 --> 00:40:14.030
And some of that stuff is still got the old
fashioned way.

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:15.180
You write letters.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:19.700
I send emails, I get a, I write an email in
English, I use Google translate to translate

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:23.100
it into Italian, I send it to
somebody over there who will go physically

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.180
pull the record, scan it and send it to me.

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:29.060
I mean, there's a lot of other,
there's this other thing that I shared too,

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:32.890
in genealogy, and genealogists like to share
with one another all over the

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:35.390
world.

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:39.440
And they don't have to have any connection
to the other individual that they're helping

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.440
out.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.980
There's this neat thing
that we do as genealogists and it's called

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:45.860
random acts of genealogical kindness.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:49.400
And it's a website with the initials, you
know, R- A whatever it is, you have to spell

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.400
it out.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:54.280
And it's essentially a way that if you really
need someone to zip over

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:58.990
to a cemetery and take a photo of a headstone
or get a transcription or go maybe pull an

00:40:58.990 --> 00:41:02.680
obituary on microfilm that's not
online yet or something, you can go online

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:07.040
and sort through a map and sort through a
place and find, ultimately, like in a

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:11.010
particular town, if there's anyone registered
as a volunteer and then they basically say

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:12.010
yeah.

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:15.220
I'm a volunteer for a couple
of towns and other people are as well.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:19.650
And I've had situations where within a matter
of a couple of hours people have been able

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:22.210
to
turn around and literally have gone, have

00:41:22.210 --> 00:41:27.150
driven, strangers have driven to a cemetery,
taken photographs of headstones,

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:29.370
come back, pop it in an email and send it
to me.

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:33.450
I mean, it's just kind of the mindset that
family history mindset, the

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:39.820
collaboration and the sharing that we do with
one another is a lot of fun.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:42.270
I share this, anybody in the room work on
Google

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:44.040
images?

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.900
Thank you anyway.

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:51.980
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: Um, I talked earlier, or I asked

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:55.460
the question how many people have the box
of photos somewhere at home, even

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:56.579
one or two?

00:41:56.579 --> 00:41:58.680
And almost all the hands went up.

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:02.770
I have, as you might guess, quite a collection
of photographs.

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:05.710
While families
may squabble over other things, you know,

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:08.940
furniture, money etcetera, I just kind of
always say you know, "I'll take the

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:10.410
pictures, thank you!"

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:12.060
So I have this great collection of photos.

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:15.590
But sadly, which is often the case, many photos
that

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:20.480
people have, it's not like you turn them over
and it's got the date and all the metadata

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:24.790
on the back, right, names and who
they are, when and what kind of camera etcetera,

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:25.790
etcetera.

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:28.940
And so what we do as family historians, of
course, is we torture

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:32.370
ourselves into figuring out how many years
and what's it gonna take for me to figure

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:33.770
out who these people were.

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:37.450
Now, I go
to a fair amount of conferences and sometimes

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:40.640
I'm speaking at the conferences and many times,
even if I'm speaking, I also

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:44.950
kind of have my bag and then I kind of sneak
away and I'll go and I'll go and stand in

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:50.970
line, and wait for people who are
specialists in dating photographs based on

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:54.030
photo techniques and the paper that's used
and the clothing style, the hair

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:55.520
style etcetera.

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:59.110
And so they can kind of narrow down at least
when it was taken, where it might have been

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:01.130
taken etcetera.

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:04.290
This
particular photo haunted me for the longest

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:05.350
time.

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:08.760
And all I knew about it, because I knew I
recognized the word that was

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:12.200
stamped on the cardboard that the photo was
mounted on.

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.670
It said, "Campobasso."

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:14.670
I thought, well there we go.

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:17.590
It's clearly
not Dad's family, right, cause they're the

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:18.590
Irish.

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:19.760
So, somehow this is connected.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:24.880
And I said that I could kind of confer
that it's from my Mom's family because, um,

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:29.590
it came into my possession after my maternal
Grandmother passed away.

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:31.910
And I
truly didn't think that there was ever gonna

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:36.230
be a shot that I'd ever know who was in this
picture, but I was gonna try.

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:38.530
And
I tried for awhile and then almost gave up

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:39.850
and then I thought, "Well."

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:42.070
So I scanned it in and finally I put it on
the

00:43:42.070 --> 00:43:46.910
website, one of my websites and I simply told
the story of what I thought I knew or didn't

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:47.910
know about the photo.

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:50.980
And it sat
there for a couple years.

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:54.880
And then gradually, thanks to the fact that
you guys have indexed all the words on the

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.660
page, I
got an email from a complete stranger in England

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:02.610
and it came in a few years back and it was
two days before Christmas.

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:08.520
And
this British guy wrote to me, he's writing

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.380
to Dan Lynch in the United States.

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:14.110
His name was Giuseppe Gianfanga and Giuseppe
was

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:19.740
writing to me about our common Italian heritage
which was a lot of fun.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:22.130
The chain of events that follow, I'll spare
all the

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:26.270
detail, but in the end what a treat it was
for me, if you'll look in the lower right

00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:29.230
hand corner.

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:33.050
I had made assumptions as
a family historian, and I thought a fairly

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:37.520
experienced family historian, I had made assumptions
about the photograph as I

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:38.520
looked at it.

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:44.560
One of my assumptions was, and I tried to
match it up with my tree chart, I had assumed

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:49.130
that the father had
passed away because he's not in the photo.

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:51.760
I thought, "Well who's gonna pose for a family
photo without Dad if he's still

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.780
alive?"

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:57.940
I got the whole story, actually, from this
little girl.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:44:58.940
[pause]

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:02.370
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: She was a few years older when
I met her.

00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:04.520
She was 95 when I met her.

00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:07.150
I met a gentleman who was able to
introduce me.

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:10.410
He said, "Well let me introduce you to my
cousin, maybe she has a better memory than

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:11.410
me."

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:14.530
And we drove to her
house in Italy and she told the whole story.

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:18.820
First of all she didn't speak English and
I didn't speak Italian, and it was

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:22.510
kind of a lot of, you know, but luckily the
people that were there were kind of able to

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:28.730
translate and she couldn't quite
understand the concept of why I, an American,

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:30.600
had a photo of her family.

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.890
And she was trying to kind of get the photo
which

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:36.350
I gave her a copy of, but I kept the original.

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:39.970
But she told the whole story of the photograph,
one by one, went through her

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:44.930
brothers and sisters, everybody's name and
this and that and just an absolutely fantastic

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:48.180
and to me it would have been
better, of course, had I understood it, you

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:51.610
know, right directly from her lips and in
Italian.

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:55.540
But I kind of got the
translated version as we were going along.

00:45:55.540 --> 00:46:01.510
But a fascinating experience in terms of being
able to match up what I'll call

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:06.690
kind of new age genealogy and genealogy and
all the different facets of research and how

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:07.770
it's done.

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:12.010
And something like this
truly would not be possible if it weren't

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:15.590
for the types of work that you guys do, in
terms of allowing people to put things

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:18.520
there and having them indexed.

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.670
You know, I can't say enough good stuff about
it.

00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:25.890
What's also neat, incidentally, is I
realized that woman sitting in the center

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:32.160
of the photo is my great, great Grandmother,
I had no idea I was even related to

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.160
her.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:37.140
And her name is Maria Luisa Patruti.

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:41.490
So what a treat to be able to meet this, oh
I think I skipped ahead, to be able

00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:47.360
to meet this woman and spend a little time
even though you, you know I can't speak to

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.760
her, she can't speak to me.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.670
The whole
time we were with her, I mean I was probably

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:54.480
with her maybe for an hour with a couple other
people she said one word,

00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:57.690
actually two words that I understood the whole
time.

00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:00.990
And she told the story about the fact that
the whole reason the photo

00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:05.050
was taken, she remembered it because it was
the first time she had ever had her picture

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:06.500
taken.

00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.240
And she told the story of
having to trek through and walk to the middle

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:15.100
of town and it was a snow storm and she gave
them elaborate detail which I'm

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.670
sure was lost in the translation.

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:25.320
The photo was taken to send to the father,
Antonio, because he was in Waterbury, America.

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:30.730
He came over to the United States to work,
he stayed for five years, and I had certainly

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:34.970
verified, I mean I saw this guy
Antonio De Tota show up in the city directories

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:38.500
in Connecticut, he showed up, he was there
for awhile and then gone.

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.220
I
didn't know what happened to him.

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:43.380
I never actually considered not everybody
stayed.

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:46.580
He got money, he went back, he bought
the farm that she was actually working on

00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:49.140
the day that I was there visiting her.

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:53.100
And so while he was gone they took the
photo to send to him like, "Hey, don't forget

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:55.970
you got a family here."

00:47:55.970 --> 00:48:00.310
Now, some other things you find online, you
know, I

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:03.970
joke when I give the presentations and sometimes
I'll ask, "How many folks have used," and

00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:07.630
I'll say, "How many folks have
used Google video or Google You, you know,

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:09.470
YouTube for family history?"

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:11.900
And a couple years ago not a whole lot of
hands

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:12.940
went up.

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.880
And I'd say, "You have to change your mind
set."

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.830
It's not like you're gonna go there, go to
YouTube and type in

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:20.710
your ancestors name and then suddenly you're
gonna find a video of them walking off the

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:23.160
boat at Ellis Island, not gonna
happen.

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:25.280
But, what can you expect to find?"

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:29.980
And I will simply sometimes show something
like this, you know, I do a simple

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:35.500
query for Campobasso and it's a place that
I've not been and know a lot about.

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:39.850
I go here, not because I understand the
language, the more I listen to this guy the

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:44.760
more I know, but I can listen for 20 minutes
as this complete stranger to me,

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:48.680
he's got a lot of videos that he's put on
YouTube, turns out that he's a priest, he

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:52.930
simply speaks in the dialect in the
part of Southern Italy that my family was

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:53.930
from.

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:57.820
And I, prior to going there, listened to a
number of these videos to kind

00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:04.050
of become familiar with the pace of the language
and really can kind of put myself in the mode

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:08.250
of, "Okay, this is probably
how my great Grandfather might have sounded

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:10.480
when he came to the United States."

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.610
Alright, so there's different things.

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:14.180
Of
course now there's all sorts of things that

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:18.701
we do, we can go online to watch videos to
learn about DNA research or all

00:49:18.701 --> 00:49:25.450
sorts of, you know, there's different uses
for the video tools.

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:30.100
Google maps, Google Earth and Street View;
I can't say

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:31.860
enough good about those as well.

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:34.600
Again, show of hands, anybody working on any
of those things?

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:38.940
Alright, I mean, uh
[pause]

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:45.010
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: I'm not gonna use the word wasted,
let's just say I've put a lot of time into

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:46.010
these tools.

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:50.750
[Laughs]]
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: It could be, time goes by pretty

00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:54.960
quick as a user when you log into these tools
with something in mind and then

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:59.140
realize I've been on here an hour, what was
it I was looking for?

00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:02.760
What's particularly useful in, and I always
kind of talk

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:08.690
about them together, right, Maps, Street Viewer,
Earth, one of the things that you might not

00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:12.670
appreciate, that we as family
historians, we're often dealing with partial

00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:16.220
names; partial people's name, partial place
names.

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:20.940
And it's great just the
suggest feature alone to go into Maps and

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:25.191
to be able to use that to help us figure out
what the rest of the place name

00:50:25.191 --> 00:50:26.470
might be.

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:29.570
Okay, what the rest of an address might be.

00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:34.300
And I say might be because we often have other
things at our disposal

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.550
to kind of cross reference.

00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:40.260
Somebody might have clipped the date out of
the newspaper and it will say the Obituary,

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:44.730
or of
the obituary and it'll say, "The funeral will

00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:49.650
be held at 124 Main St." But it won't tell
us where and we'll look and it

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:51.950
might say down below you know, "Cuyahoga something."

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:55.310
Alright and you type in pieces of words and
back your way into

00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:58.880
figuring out where some of this stuff is.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:01.710
And so I just show a couple of examples here.

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:04.120
Oh, sorry.

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:09.880
Campobasso, again, I'm
gonna kind of a beat a few examples of that

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:15.180
but you guys kind of know this stuff , I kind
of zip through it, but to be able

00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:21.301
to sit down with family historians and give
them an ability to travel, you know, kind

00:51:21.301 --> 00:51:22.530
of before lunch,
[Laughs]

00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:27.220
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: to almost anywhere they want
in the world and see with some pretty rich

00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:35.880
detail, the places, the homes, the
town halls, the churches, the cemeteries,

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:42.160
is very, very powerful and can't be understated.

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:46.320
If certain people took up the
pursuit later in life and they're not able

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:51.910
to travel, I have a good friend at home, he's
87 about to turn 88, he's addicted

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:52.910
to this stuff.

00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:53.910
He loves it.

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:57.800
You know, he's addicted to the whole internet,
I mean, he loves being able to go online and

00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:00.260
go
to YouTube and type in Glen Miller and just

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:01.640
like, "Wow!

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:02.740
They have that there too?"

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:04.920
You know?

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:09.170
Alright, here's another good
example, right, there was another branch of

00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:12.900
the family that was from a place called San
Giovanni in Galdo, and I never

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:16.820
quite, especially when family members would
tell me and they would say it so fast I never

00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:20.700
knew it was discreet words I
always thought it was one big word.

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:27.380
But using the tools at Google I could gradually
kind of piece this stuff together.

00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:30.160
One
of the other things that neat, I'm gonna go

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:34.921
through these I guess I'll show, so to be
able to go into Street View and to

00:52:34.921 --> 00:52:37.500
literally walk down the street where you know.

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:41.340
Many of the old certificates that family historians
might have actually have

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:46.950
the street address and certainly the Italian
ones and I know other countries as well.

00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:52.590
It's the actual street address where
the family, where the people were born.

00:52:52.590 --> 00:52:56.160
So it's kind of powerful to be able to kind
of pull this stuff up and look and say,

00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:00.750
certainly the places look a little different
now than they did, and then after having been

00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:05.240
to a place as well it's a lot of
fun to kind of come home and kind of take

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:08.320
that journey a second time around and perhaps
kind of walk up the street.

00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:10.450
And I
look at the clarity of some of these images,

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:14.320
which still boggles my mind, and I look at
something like this and I see that

00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:18.060
particular church and I compare it to the
photo I took and there's kind of not a whole

00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:20.950
lot of difference, really, and I had
a pretty good camera with me.

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:27.850
And I thought, well you know, I go back and
forth, it's really neat, very powerful.

00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:30.700
To be
able to walk down this particular street and,

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:34.430
of course, you guys are doing your job there
in terms of blurring out the

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:41.110
faces and license plates but I actually walked
down this street and I was like, "I know her."

00:53:41.110 --> 00:53:44.990
Then I went to my photos from
the trip and I remembered this group of Italian

00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:50.180
women sitting outside and they were pulling
the peas out of the thing,

00:53:50.180 --> 00:53:51.410
throwing them into a bucket.

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:55.300
And I didn't know how to speak so I just kind
of looked at them and made hand motions and

00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:56.550
asked, I said, "Permisso photographia?"

00:53:56.550 --> 00:54:01.310
That was the best I could do and they smiled
and nodded and let me take their

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:05.960
picture and I haven't put it online by the
way.

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:09.030
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: Alright, so it's a lot of fun.

00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:12.750
Here's another thing that kind of boggles
my imagination.

00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:18.330
I have census records
and birth certificates for an address that

00:54:18.330 --> 00:54:24.920
was important in my mom's side of our family;
466 Hamilton Avenue, Waterbury,

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:25.920
Connecticut.

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:27.380
That address no longer exists.

00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:30.400
That address hasn't existed since the 1950's.

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:35.230
This little concept called
eminent domain, alright, the house, the land,

00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:39.060
everything was taken so the interstate highways
could be put in.

00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:45.970
Somehow when
I typed that into Google Maps, it still pin

00:54:45.970 --> 00:54:49.670
points the exact location of where that house
was.

00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:52.410
And how do I know that's the
exact location?

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:57.310
You'll notice across the street from, of course
where you see the little red pin, on the right

00:54:57.310 --> 00:54:59.930
hand corner
of that page there you'll see, that's actually

00:54:59.930 --> 00:55:02.950
a cemetery; St. Joseph Cemetery in Waterbury.

00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:08.420
I have a wonderful collection
of many, many, many photos from, you know,

00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:11.140
people in their Sunday best, maybe on Easter,
and what's the last thing they did

00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:12.140
before they went to church?

00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:14.960
They stood on the porch and somebody would
take their picture.

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:19.310
And in the background there's a
crooked tree and a headstone and there's certain

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:24.190
things to where I was able to take a few of
these photographs, at risk of

00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:30.370
my own life, kind of literally walk around
this highway and kind of step off the thing

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:32.940
and say, "Alright, this is pretty much where
the front porch of this house

00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:36.620
must have been because there's the headstone,
there's the crooked tree."

00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:38.100
All these years later you can still figure
out

00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:39.510
exactly where it was.

00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:43.830
And then I went back and looked how close
this was and I'd like somebody before I leave

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:47.510
campus maybe to
explain to me how that works.

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:48.820
It's really neat.

00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:52.240
It's very powerful to be able to actually
pinpoint locations that

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:58.530
certainly have changed over time and bared
no resemblance to when they, certainly when

00:55:58.530 --> 00:56:00.860
my Grandmother lived there.

00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:04.190
Okay, so
these are fun pieces.

00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:08.480
Let me, in the interest of time; kind of show
some other things kind of quickly.

00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.460
Very common that we
find ourselves going to a place that we've

00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:13.000
never been.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.990
Or needing to correspond with someone but
we're not quite sure who

00:56:16.990 --> 00:56:18.330
or where.

00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:22.270
We know, for instance, it might be somebody
say, well I'm pretty sure they were buried

00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:23.760
in Oswego, New York.

00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.030
Now,
if somebody in their 80's told me that their

00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:30.020
recollection was that the burial was in Oswego
cause they remember how cold it

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:33.350
was the day of the burial, that's first hand
information and I'm gonna say, "Okay."

00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:37.720
And I'm gonna record that but they, "I
can't really remember the name of the cemetery."

00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.720
I don't push.

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:41.360
I try to get it but if they can't remember
it at all I say

00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:42.360
"Okay."

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:46.150
And then I leave after the interview and I
sit down and I'll type in "cemeteries near

00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:47.600
Oswego New York."

00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:51.640
Or "cemeteries
near", and to be able to get the list of cemeteries,

00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:55.460
you know, get the map, pin point it down,
of course, get the phone

00:56:55.460 --> 00:57:00.380
number be able to call and find out if they
have any records online or if they're available

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:02.220
on microfilm or if I have to go
there in person.

00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:08.200
I mean, all these things are just tremendous
time savers for family historians.

00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:12.800
And, in the event there's
cemeteries where you've maybe been there or

00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:16.440
somebody from your family may have been there
or I've had situations where

00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:20.940
people tell me, "I can't really remember quite
where they're buried, but I know that if you

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:24.060
drive in the main entrance and
take a right there's a big building and then

00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:25.670
you go there and you take a left."

00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:31.490
Or as a kid you've been there and remember
kind of, so some cases if you have a big cemetery,

00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:36.620
it's better than nothing cause it kind of
starts to narrow it down.

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.640
I
keep waiting for Street View for cemeteries

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:41.010
by the way.

00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:42.920
Just saying, you know.

00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.100
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: But this is neat.

00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:49.510
A lot of times you get older cemeteries, maybe
there's not a caretaker anymore.

00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:52.400
Or maybe
there are but they're not there when you're

00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:53.470
there.

00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:56.200
You're not gonna get a map, sometimes you're
able to find a headstone

00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:58.890
and you can actually, I print some of these
out and I'll take them and I'll make kind

00:57:58.890 --> 00:58:04.070
of little notations, I can come back
and put a little pin on it and put it online

00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:06.560
so that somebody else in the family has the
benefit of now knowing.

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.480
And, of
course, the other great thing now is we all

00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:12.400
walk around with these phones in our pockets
that have these wonderful GPS

00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:13.880
coordinates.

00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:18.850
Family historians are, don't get the credit
that they deserve for being early adopters

00:58:18.850 --> 00:58:19.850
of technology.

00:58:19.850 --> 00:58:21.910
And I'll
tell you, even something like you look at,

00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:26.950
and I'll talk about it later, you know Google
Plus and Google Hangouts, yes

00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:30.410
there's a lot of photographers, yes there's
a lot of other kind of bright folks doing

00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:36.510
some neat things, jump into a Hangout
and see what the family history community

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:39.040
is doing with Hangouts.

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:40.040
It's fascinating.

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:43.160
So I think about GPS technology.

00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:45.821
How
early on, very early on, family historians

00:58:45.821 --> 00:58:49.940
were trying to figure out like, "How could
I get the GPS coordinates for every

00:58:49.940 --> 00:58:53.490
headstone in every cemetery and then tie the
name to it?"

00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:56.330
And this is the kind of stuff we think about
all the time.

00:58:56.330 --> 00:59:03.250
Alright, here's a kind of rare, bizarre, extreme
case but it happens; it's real.

00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:07.320
This happens to be that Main St in that
town in Italy, San Giovanni in Galdo, and

00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:11.560
as I was walking down the street on Street
View I remember walking by, and

00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:16.380
believe it or not yes that car was still parked
there, but I remember walking by this and

00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:19.590
on the side of this particular
building I had seen something that caught

00:59:19.590 --> 00:59:20.590
my eye.

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:22.830
And I asked about it when I was down there
because it was unfamiliar to

00:59:22.830 --> 00:59:23.830
me.

00:59:23.830 --> 00:59:26.250
In the U.S. we have newspapers and, of course,
there's obituaries.

00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:28.340
In a lot of these small towns in Italy and
I'm sure

00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:31.930
in other countries they don't have newspapers
and they don't have obituaries.

00:59:31.930 --> 00:59:36.960
What they do do is they have a custom, when
someone dies, they post what they call manifests

00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:40.530
and they print up, essentially an obituary,
but a poster and they just

00:59:40.530 --> 00:59:43.451
plaster it on the sides of all the buildings
down there to kind of let everyone know that

00:59:43.451 --> 00:59:47.820
poor so and so has passed away,
the services are gonna be, you know, Wednesday

00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:49.680
at 7 o'clock etcetera.

00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:51.000
And so they post it on the side.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.680
And so I recognized
on this particular building, on Street View

00:59:54.680 --> 01:00:00.140
I could practically read the name there and
probably if I wanted to be really

01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:05.460
diligent researcher I could probably pin point
when this guy died and tell you within a couple

01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:10.400
of days when that image was
likely taken, but it wasn't my family so there

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.540
was no need.

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:13.661
But what was neat was I was actually able
to go back to my

01:00:13.661 --> 01:00:18.220
archival photographs from my trip and I remember
that brick building with the manifests.

01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:22.710
And because it was new to me I
took a couple photographs of it to kind of

01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:26.480
teach myself about a custom I didn't know
about.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:31.060
And it's kind of a neat, you
know, kind of a neat but extreme thing.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:34.490
Earlier I mentioned that woman, Luisa De Tota,
who was the woman that I met, who

01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:36.740
was the little girl in the photo.

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:42.910
When she passed away a couple of years ago
I actually wanted one of the manifests and

01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:45.360
I
tried to kind of, when I heard that she passed

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:50.410
away I instantly tried to get in touch with
people online saying, "Get me a

01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:51.410
manifest!"

01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:52.410
This is as good as I got.

01:00:52.410 --> 01:00:55.940
Somebody took a picture and actually sent
it to me.

01:00:55.940 --> 01:01:03.310
[pause]
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: So I talk about accidental discoveries

01:01:03.310 --> 01:01:04.320
being the most intriguing.

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:09.580
I have two examples I'll show and then I'll
stop and kind of take questions, I think,

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:13.820
I'm trying to remember the order of some of
the slides.

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:18.060
I could probably go on; I
could talk about Google Books for hours.

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:19.620
Google Books is fascinating.

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:23.860
We family historians, we have this love for
anything

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:24.860
old.

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:29.280
The fact that there are full view public domain
things that we can download and save to our

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.130
hard drive is fantastic.

01:01:32.130 --> 01:01:36.950
One of the things I found just kind of trolling
around, often times we don't know, as I mentioned,

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:39.400
what we're looking for,
we certainly don't know where it might show

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:40.400
up.

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.920
And if we put in a person's name that we maybe
haven't been able to find

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:48.310
for a long time, it's amazing what will actually
accidentally show up in sources like Google

01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:49.520
Books.

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.540
Or even the news
archives or timeline.

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:56.830
In this particular instance I will say that
this one stopped me in my tracks.

01:01:56.830 --> 01:01:59.980
It was through Google
Books for someone I hadn't been able to find

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:01.080
for quite some time.

01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:04.720
And I found this document that had been digitized
and you

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:08.200
can't see it yet, I could, and I'm gonna enlarge
that portion.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:11.450
The header of the page says, "Prisoners under
Sentence for

01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:18.390
Life" And sure enough Patrick Lynch and I
started to get nervous and think well maybe

01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:22.310
that's why I couldn't find him for
10-15 years.

01:02:22.310 --> 01:02:26.070
But luckily as I look at the date of birth
and the date of conviction, you know, he was

01:02:26.070 --> 01:02:29.810
convicted 15 years
before my guy was born so I was able to kind

01:02:29.810 --> 01:02:31.190
of wipe him off the list.

01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:36.310
But these are the kind of neat accidental
discoveries and this isn't my family but guess

01:02:36.310 --> 01:02:38.320
what, this is someone else's family.

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:41.910
And so, who would ever stop to think to
look in these sources.

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:43.720
Not even family historians, really.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.950
We'll kind of take what we can get.

01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:50.970
So we kind of use your tools
to do that.

01:02:50.970 --> 01:02:53.270
This is one of the more fun stories as well.

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:58.810
I had the opportunity back in, I think it
was in the very late

01:02:58.810 --> 01:03:07.400
80's, '89-'90 timeframe, prior to getting
married I started to do some research into

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.900
my soon to be wife's family.

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:14.260
And, as a
long time family historian, to me this was

01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:16.710
just kind of normal, like I wanted to know
stuff.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:20.620
And they said, you should
actually chat with Uncle Bob cause he was

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:25.580
in his 80's but nobody had been in touch with
him for years but they said he had

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:28.600
been interested in family history for a long
time.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.140
So I thought, "He's the guy I wanna talk to."

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:34.040
So, I hopped in the car,
after making contact, and drove to southern

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:38.660
Jersey and sometimes you have to be careful
because when you connect up with

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:43.140
some elderly folks, I mean sometimes the physical
may be fine but the mind might not be all

01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:45.980
there, you take what you can
get.

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:52.830
I had a wonderful afternoon with this gentleman,
Bob Wells, but throughout the conversation

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:56.050
he had these kinds of
spats where he would just wander or rant and

01:03:56.050 --> 01:03:59.470
talk about things that were seemingly unrelated
to family history.

01:03:59.470 --> 01:04:02.210
And at one
point, and I recorded this, and took a lot

01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:09.050
of notes, and with his permission, and he
repeatedly kept mentioning throughout

01:04:09.050 --> 01:04:14.650
our discussion, he didn't want to talk about
his mom's family, the mom's maiden name was

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:19.150
Strowger and when I kept trying to
steer the conversation to get a little bit

01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:21.640
of information he didn't wanna go there.

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:25.100
But he kept referencing the fact that
the Strowger family had been screwed by the

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:26.810
phone company.

01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:29.240
And I kind of didn't really know what to make
of that.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:33.120
I mean, I
get my bill every month and thought, "Me too."

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:37.850
But some time later I had been going through
the notes after really a couple

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:41.410
of years and thought, "You know, I really
gotta figure out what this is about."

01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:42.410
So what do I do?

01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:43.560
I do a simple query.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:49.990
Nothing fancy about it, you know, Strowger
telephone.

01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:52.500
Just to see, is there any connection to anything?

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.750
And what happens is
I come across this little thing called Google

01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:57.930
patent search.

01:04:57.930 --> 01:05:01.140
Let's see, do you have it?
[pause]

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:06.790
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: And low and behold I start reading
and I start seeing a lot of things.

01:05:06.790 --> 01:05:10.530
Now interestingly I see Strowger, then
I start reading and then I see the name Almon

01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:15.230
Brown Strowger which I knew was a name connected
and I start reading through

01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:22.420
and I'll spare you the detail but some, through
significant reading, historical information

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:28.940
and the patents, come to find
out that Oris, I'm sorry Almon Brown Strowger

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:34.260
was the inventor of what we know as the switchboard
and the rotary phone.

01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:36.150
And
it's a kind of interesting story that I won't

01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:42.450
tell you as to why he was motivated to invent
these, but had the patents and

01:05:42.450 --> 01:05:48.700
sold them to what became ultimately AT&amp;T for
a very small amount of money in the late 1800's

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:50.350
very early 1900's.

01:05:50.350 --> 01:05:53.200
So indeed I
pinpointed the fact that his family indeed

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:57.520
had been screwed by the phone company.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:02.580
And again, these things tie in so nicely
because not only did I find the patents and

01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:05.690
download them and read through the patents,
but then I went through and

01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:09.820
realized okay the Strowger phone then I turn
around, I go back on, I go to Google images,

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:13.730
pull up countless numbers of
Strowger phones, I jump over to EBay, I try

01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:19.010
to buy one, little bit beyond my reach.

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:23.880
So there's a lot of neat things that we
do.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:28.490
Newer to the mix, certainly these other tools
are something we've been using for, you know,

01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:31.480
ten years, maybe not all of
them 10 years but many of them for the last

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:32.640
decade.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.800
As fast as you could come out with them we'll
put them to use.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:39.830
Google,
I forget the exact day that Google Plus was

01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:44.350
kind of unleashed to the public, I think it
was within a week I'd done a

01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:49.250
presentation at, I was actually at BYU at
a conference that had been scheduled and in

01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:52.950
the works for months and I called the
conference organizers and I was already on

01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:55.810
for like four or five talks and I called him
and I said, "Hey look, next week

01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:59.380
when I'm out there's this new thing that just
came out, why don't you just kind of squeeze

01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:01.080
it into the agenda somewhere?"

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:04.711
And I did, what turned out to be a standing
room only, people didn't even know what it

01:07:04.711 --> 01:07:05.711
was yet.

01:07:05.711 --> 01:07:08.310
Standing room only audience
and everyone wanted to know what Google Plus

01:07:08.310 --> 01:07:09.310
was.

01:07:09.310 --> 01:07:12.920
One of the other things that was neat within
the genealogical community

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:18.050
was, has anybody heard when Google Plus came
out in the Hangouts, the longest Hangout?

01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:21.940
And there was a gentleman, there was
a group of family historians and the gentleman

01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:26.880
who certainly deserves most credit is from
Utah, his name is Mark Olsen and

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.740
Mark and I had never met.

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:32.550
We met through Hangouts and have since actually
met in person a number of times and actually

01:07:32.550 --> 01:07:33.990
had
a lot of business dealings with one another

01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:37.590
now but they created the longest Hangout and
they just decided, "Hey if you can

01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:39.510
do a Hangout why not just keep it going?

01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:43.550
And just kind of talk 24 hours a day with
people all over the world?"

01:07:43.550 --> 01:07:46.960
And it
lasted for 77 days.

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.230
It was a really long hangout.

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:52.770
I don't really, I never did hear quite how
after 77 days it kind of died

01:07:52.770 --> 01:07:58.010
but I will tell you that it was a lot of fun
to be able to jump in at the end of almost

01:07:58.010 --> 01:07:59.330
every day.

01:07:59.330 --> 01:08:01.910
My day didn't seem
complete unless I checked in.

01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:05.650
But because it grew in popularity, you couldn't
get in and I'd have to sit there and try

01:08:05.650 --> 01:08:07.160
again, try again, try again.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.400
And I felt like, "Hey, come on!

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:11.250
These are my friends now."

01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:15.781
Family historians can't get enough
of everything that Google has to offer and

01:08:15.781 --> 01:08:18.270
in particular Google Plus.

01:08:18.270 --> 01:08:21.150
The searching, the ability to share, the ability
to

01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:27.190
collaborate, the ability to have the profile,
for instance, and I'll show just quickly a

01:08:27.190 --> 01:08:29.210
piece of my profile here.

01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:31.980
If
family history is kind of what primarily drives

01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:35.400
you in terms of your use of the internet which
is the case for many family

01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:37.920
historians.

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:44.290
There are certain ways that we can feed information
into our profiles so when the page gets indexed,

01:08:44.290 --> 01:08:46.250
there's a
good shot that actually my name is gonna start

01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:47.250
coming up.

01:08:47.250 --> 01:08:49.270
Now, later on when somebody's doing research
about the De Tota

01:08:49.270 --> 01:08:56.020
family or the Orsatti family or San Giovanni
in Galdo or these places, very simply you

01:08:56.020 --> 01:09:00.880
have people who have wanted to put
this information online but they don't really

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.440
want to have their own website and try to
maintain a website, now they have

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.980
the ability to do that.

01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:11.520
And they didn't really wanna use Google sites
really, this is kind of just right for many

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.779
of them.

01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:14.180
Many family historians they go, "Perfect!

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:16.440
I can just go and kind of put this on there."

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:19.279
And now they can be found and
others can sort of come to them.

01:09:19.279 --> 01:09:26.540
So in the time we had I know I kind of bounced
around because I really tried to cover a

01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:28.700
little bit of everything.

01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:33.109
And you guys have been kind in terms of building
the tools, too about giving me the opportunity

01:09:33.109 --> 01:09:37.020
to come talk to you about this stuff and,
again, I appreciate the invite to come here.

01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:41.880
And for you to sit and listen as I
kind of wandered down this meandering path

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:46.580
of how it is that we use these tools to do
what it is that we kind of care about

01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:47.580
every day.

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:54.930
So with that I'll kind of stop and take any
questions that you guys might have.

01:09:54.930 --> 01:09:55.930
Or not have.

01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:56.930
[Laughs]

01:09:56.930 --> 01:10:02.151
&gt;&gt;male #1: Are you working on a new edition
of the book?

01:10:02.151 --> 01:10:04.060
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: The question is, "Am I working
on a new edition of the book."

01:10:04.060 --> 01:10:05.680
The answer is yes.

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:06.680
I am.

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:09.810
I don't have a date
that I can give you but yes.

01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:14.810
I think I'm lucky, in some regard, when I
wrote the book having always worked in technology,

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:17.020
I
wrote the book with the mindset and it was

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:23.460
published on the tail end of 2008 and technology
stuff has a tendency to date

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:24.460
rather quickly.

01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:28.750
But I wrote it with kind of an intentional
mindset to try to prevent it from dating as

01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:31.890
much as possible by
kind of reminding folks that throughout the

01:10:31.890 --> 01:10:36.270
book it was kind of written as a tutorial
and kind of a workbook and tried to

01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:39.830
get them to realize that if your screen looks
a little different than what you see on this

01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:41.450
page, that's okay.

01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:43.410
It will be
refined over time.

01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:45.900
It was more the techniques I was trying to
teach.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:47.670
And so the book still holds up pretty well
except for

01:10:47.670 --> 01:10:51.190
maybe the chapter about Google notebook.

01:10:51.190 --> 01:10:53.210
[Laughs]

01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:59.280
&gt;&gt;male #2: [Inaudible]

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:09.600
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: Yeah, so the question is do I
find any value in the historical data built

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:16.210
into Earth and my answer is yes to
that and also to the historical time-life

01:11:16.210 --> 01:11:22.670
collection in the images is where I thought
you were going with that but yes it's a

01:11:22.670 --> 01:11:27.090
valuable, there's been many discussions in
the genealogical community kind of wondering

01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:31.380
wouldn't it be great to kind of get
all the historical maps that are available

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:37.770
everywhere and to the extent that they could
kind of be resized and kind of

01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:39.990
pointed correctly and have various overlays.

01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:46.230
And I know in some cases we have some of those
but it's maybe not as valuable

01:11:46.230 --> 01:12:00.640
as some other stuff that we use but it's neat
to see and a lot of fun, yeah.

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:11.790
&gt;&gt;male #3: So you're a professional genealogist,
I was wondering what kind of work [Inaudible]

01:12:11.790 --> 01:12:14.250
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: Um, yeah, so the question is
as a professional genealogist what are some

01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:17.510
of the things I get involved with and
whether or not I've been engaged in any kind

01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:20.730
of, the legal end of it.

01:12:20.730 --> 01:12:24.080
I actually did work on the probate of an estate
some

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:27.950
years ago and I still remember that, I won't
say the name cause I know we're being taped.

01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:30.570
I do remember very clearly the
name of the family.

01:12:30.570 --> 01:12:35.560
It was a Connecticut family, the woman died
just shy of her hundredth birthday.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:40.660
She was 99 years old
and left a very sizeable estate with one heir.

01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:44.980
And it was very interesting scenario because
the belief had been that the

01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:50.910
heir had died and things would have taken
a very different path.

01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:53.860
That was a lot of, I hate to say a lot of
fun but that

01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:58.670
case was actually a lot of fun because I was
able to prove in very short order that the

01:12:58.670 --> 01:13:04.870
woman had not died and that the
assumption had been that the sole heir had

01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:05.870
died.

01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:11.000
About a year later I got a little thank you
note from the woman and I

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.360
called her up, and I opened the letter and
I kind of shook it and no check fell out.

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:19.030
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: But I thought, you know, it was

01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:20.030
a sizeable estate.

01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:23.440
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: You know, the concept of professional

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:28.500
genealogists is interesting because, there's
a group called, a

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:32.900
professional association called the Association
of Professional Genealogists or APG.

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:37.900
And there are different people among
the members of APG, people have different

01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:38.900
specialties.

01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:42.640
So I mentioned earlier, for instance, some
people specialize in

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:45.920
photography or forensic photography and kind
of the photo aspects.

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:48.880
There are others that specialize in research
for hire

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:51.880
and there are people that specialize in probate.

01:13:51.880 --> 01:14:00.080
My end of it is I tend to focus and consult
with organizations mostly

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:04.800
technology focused that are trying to create
products and services to serve the market

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:06.410
for family history.

01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:10.360
And so that's
kind of my piece of it, the Statue of Liberty,

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:14.570
Ellis Island Foundation has been a client
of mine for years and I helped them

01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:20.300
with that by virtue of the association I certainly,
I help from time to time trying to find, you

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:24.020
know there might be a,
some interesting folks that kind of want their

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.860
background kind of looked into.

01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:30.020
It's always fun to kind of get a phone call
and say, "Hey, can you look up so and so's

01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:31.420
family?"

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:33.250
It's fun stuff.

01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:34.541
That's when you know you have the addiction
is when you

01:14:34.541 --> 01:14:38.440
enjoy researching other people's families
as much as your own.

01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:53.500
&gt;&gt;male #4: If you could think of one tool
that's not readily available [inaudible]

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:59.900
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: Yeah, the question is what is
one simple tool, I only get one?

01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:09.630
One simple tool or most important, that's
a

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:12.640
good question, uh
[pause]

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:20.790
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: And I don't really have a snappy,
I mean there are so many good ones that are

01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:28.261
there and truly I, and forget
about me, I mean I really try to be a one

01:15:28.261 --> 01:15:32.060
man evangelist of getting all the folks and
all the enthusiasts of family history

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:35.140
around the world to just use the ones that
we have already.

01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:42.440
I mean, keep coming up with the new ones.

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:43.440
There's no huge gap.

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:49.030
I wish, this is a great opportunity to say,
"Hey, here's the thing."

01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:53.020
There's no huge gap that comes to mind immediately
that says you're really missing the boat on

01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:56.570
this.

01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:59.630
I jokingly put a slide up there earlier that
showed the pedigree chart

01:15:59.630 --> 01:16:00.630
with the tree, you know?

01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:04.920
I mean, would it be neat if there was a pedigree
viewer because there is a standardized format

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:05.920
for
data?

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:09.000
Yeah, that might be neat, you know, to have
that built in.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:14.720
But I'm happy to have met Robert and Dave
who have a 20%

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:19.900
project internally and we kind of share ideas
from time to time about different family history

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:25.190
related things and over time
I'm sure some great things will come of it.

01:16:25.190 --> 01:16:29.090
So I hope you found it a useful discussion.

01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:31.300
One more question?

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:36.040
&gt;&gt;male #5: [Inaudible]

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:45.670
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: Yeah, so the question in this
case is how do the search capabilities in

01:16:45.670 --> 01:16:49.770
Google compare to something like
Ancestry or thefamilysearch.org site from

01:16:49.770 --> 01:16:52.130
the church?

01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:55.420
In my opinion it's really kind of apples to
oranges comparison.

01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:58.710
I
mean, we're talking about a kind of a free

01:16:58.710 --> 01:17:06.770
form query situation versus a kind of structured
data set query where I know

01:17:06.770 --> 01:17:10.710
that Dominico is the first name and I know
that De Tota is the last name and so I put

01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:14.780
it in the appropriate boxes and so it
goes off and it parses off fields in a database

01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:18.150
that are specifically called that.

01:17:18.150 --> 01:17:22.250
That's a whole lot different than just
being able to kind of throw in like, "I heard

01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:24.820
this word Campobasso, is it a name?

01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:25.820
Is it a person's name?

01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:26.820
Is it a place
name?

01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:27.820
Is it a disease?"

01:17:27.820 --> 01:17:29.630
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: You know, you throw it out there

01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:31.310
and you're not sure what you're gonna get.

01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:36.260
And so, they are different tools
for different tasks.

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:42.400
What would be very interesting to see, for
me, and Dave referenced this at the introduction

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:47.000
phase,
April 2nd, you know the U.S. Government's

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.290
been taking a census every 10 years since
1790.

01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:54.590
You may or may not be aware of
this but there's a 72 year privacy mandate.

01:17:54.590 --> 01:17:57.420
And so all the data that's collected, although
they turn around and compile

01:17:57.420 --> 01:18:02.770
statistics and statistically they'll share
what's going on but they retain private for

01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:06.760
72 years, all the personally
identifiable information.

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:14.200
Just so happens come April 2nd of this year,
the 72 years expires for the 1940 census and

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:16.880
as a
result it passes from the census bureau over

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:21.600
to the national archives and becomes part
of our collective national history.

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.790
We now have access to that.

01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:27.880
One of the things that's neat is to see companies
coming together in the space, and I talked

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:34.080
about things like Google Plus and collaboration
etcetera, it's the ultimate form of collaboration

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:39.720
where the community is
coming together, both organizations and individuals

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:43.960
to come together to embark on a volunteer
indexing project.

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.570
Because
although the national archives is going to

01:18:45.570 --> 01:18:51.490
make the images available, there's no key
word searchable index.

01:18:51.490 --> 01:18:54.500
So the images
are gonna be there but we gotta wait till,

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:57.540
you know, 132 million names have to be key
stroked.

01:18:57.540 --> 01:19:01.390
So rather than have three or
four or five different companies go off and

01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:06.380
all compete and do it, three of the major
organizations have banded together;

01:19:06.380 --> 01:19:12.340
and so you have archives.com, findmypast.com
and familysource.org and created a consortium

01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:17.500
to actually create a community
project to voluntarily index the records.

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:20.840
And the goal is that within six months there
will be a searchable index so then

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:27.090
everybody can enjoy, so that's kind of a neat,
you know, if you guys wanna build a tool for

01:19:27.090 --> 01:19:32.840
that, I mean, in the next
couple weeks that'd be great.

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.250
[laughter]

01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:38.480
&gt;&gt;male #5: [Inaudible]

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:47.590
&gt;&gt;Dan Lynch: So the question is, is anybody
building OCR that works across handwriting,

01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:52.290
I think, handwriting recognition is
a very tricky issue.

01:19:52.290 --> 01:19:56.430
There's people that are trying different things
and there's technologies that have been developed,

01:19:56.430 --> 01:20:01.160
especially when you look at structured data
like a census.

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:05.090
If you look at a column in the census where
a particular column

01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:10.470
is gonna say son or daughter there's different
things that you can do.

01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:16.150
But it's a tricky issue, a lot of different
languages, cause your talking on a worldwide

01:20:16.150 --> 01:20:18.040
basis, a lot of languages, a lot of variations.

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:22.900
The 1940 census had over 120
thousand individual enumerators that went

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:23.900
out and did it.

01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:26.270
So it's not like you have one handwriting
that you gotta do,

01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:27.630
there's a lot of variations.

01:20:27.630 --> 01:20:32.231
So I've not seen anything reliable out there
yet that will just kind of feed it through

01:20:32.231 --> 01:20:34.880
and
OCR's the name.

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:39.230
So I'm happy to stay around for any questions
or just kind of chat you might want to have.

01:20:39.230 --> 01:20:43.030
I appreciate our
camera man kind of recording this but I'll

01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:45.960
give him a pass on the rest of this and we'll,
Thank you.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:46.310
[applause]
