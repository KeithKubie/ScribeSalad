&gt;&gt; Jon:  WELCOME TO "THE
DAILY SHOW."

00:00:04.136 --> 00:00:06.072 align:start position:0% line:85%
MY NAME IS JON STEWART.

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:07.240 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:09.509 line:85%
MY GUEST TONIGHT, ERIC GREITENS,

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.644 line:91%
HE'S THE FOUNDER OF THE MISSION
CONTINUES, A GREAT ORGANIZATION.

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:14.414 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.051 line:91%
BUT I WANT TO START TONIGHT BY
TALKING ABOUT NOT A GOOD PERSON

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:19.552 align:start position:0% line:91%
LIKE ERIC GREITENS, BUT A
TERRIBLE PERSON.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:22.255 align:start position:0% line:91%
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A MAN
ROTTEN TO HIS VERY CORE WHICH IS

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:25.558 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN ITSELF A TINY BLACK HOLE
FROM WHICH NO JOY OR LIGHT CAN

00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:26.626 align:start position:0% line:85%
ESCAPE.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:31.798 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE ANCIENT COPTICS KNEW THIS
MAN AS "THE DARK ONE."

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:34.434 line:91%

THE "THE JAGGED-TOOTH FOREST

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:38.738 align:start position:0% line:91%
DEMON WHO STEALS OUR CHILDREN"
WHO STEALS OUR CHILDREN.

00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:43.643 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE KNOW HIM AS FORMER VICE
PRESIDENT DICK CHENEY.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:53.052 align:start position:0% line:91%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
NOW AND THEN,

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:59.926 line:91%
NOW AND THEN HE SLITHERS OUT
FROM HIS LAIR INSIDE A MOUNTAIN

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:00.927 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF KITTEN CORPSES AND GOES ON
TV OR RADIO SAYING AWFUL THINGS.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.396 align:start position:0% line:91%
USUALLY WE IGNORE IT, BUT
SOMETIMES JUST CAN'T.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:05.698 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; MR. VICE PRESIDENT, YOU DEALT
WITH IRAN A LOT, BOTH AS

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:07.333 align:start size:97% position:3% line:91%
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND EIGHT
YEARS AS VICE PRESIDENT.

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:10.369 align:start position:0% line:91%
DO THEY STRIKE YOU AS A
PRACTICALLY MINDED OR

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:11.470 align:start position:0% line:85%
RESPONSIVE REGIME?

00:01:11.503 --> 00:01:14.907 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A TOTALLY RADICAL
REGIME THAT IS THE PREMIER

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.043 line:91%
SPONSOR OF STATE TERRORISM IN
THE WORLD, AND OBAMA IS ABOUT

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:18.644 line:85%
TO GIVE THEM NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

00:01:18.677 --> 00:01:24.117 line:91%
IT'S-- I CAN'T THINK OF A MORE
TERRIBLE BURDEN TO LEAVE THE

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.455 align:start position:0% line:91%
NEXT PRESIDENT THAN WHAT OBAMA'S
CREATING HERE.

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:30.556 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  REALLY?

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:32.692 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU CAN'T THINK OF AN
ADMINISTRATION THAT LEFT A MORE

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:34.961 align:start position:0% line:91%
TERRIBLE BURDEN?
( LAUGHTER )

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:36.028 align:start position:0% line:85%
THINK -- THINK HARD.

00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:37.864 align:start position:0% line:85%
NO, WAIT.

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:40.633 align:start position:0% line:91%
THINK-- IF I CAN ASK YOU, THINK
HARDER.

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:42.702 align:start position:0% line:91%
CAN YOU THINK-- MAYBE YOU NEED A
VISUAL AID?

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:46.506 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU CAN THINK OF AN
ADMINISTRATION THAT LEFT-- CAN

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.341 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU-- ALL RIGHT.

00:01:48.374 --> 00:01:51.144 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THAT WASN'T EVEN THE WORST
THING CHENEY HAD TO SAY.

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:52.445 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; IS HE NAIVE?

00:01:52.478 --> 00:01:56.415 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU HAD SOMEBODY AS
PRESIDENT WHO WANTED TO TAKE

00:01:56.448 --> 00:01:58.885 size:84% position:42% line:91%
AMERICA DOWN, WHO WANTED TO
FUNDAMENTALLY WEAKEN OUR

LOOK EXACTLY LIKE WHAT

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:10.530 align:start position:0%
BARACK OBAMA IS DOING.

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:13.699 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  I-- WAH-- IS BARACK
OBAMA A TRAITOR?

00:02:13.732 --> 00:02:16.002 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T-- WAH--

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:21.307 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:24.843 align:start position:0% line:85%
WAH.

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:26.078 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
BUT BASICALLY THE VICE

00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:28.948 line:91%
PRESIDENT'S POINT APPEARS TO BE
THIS-- ANYONE WHO STRENGTHENS

00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:32.752 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE STRATEGIC POSITION OF IRAN
IS BY DEFINITION WORKING TO

WEAKEN THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.925 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO I GUESS THE FORMULATION WOULD
BE WHOEVER STRENGTHENED IRAN

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:42.328 align:start position:0% line:91%
MORE WOULD BE THE GREATER THREAT
TO AMERICA.

00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:46.766 line:91%
USING DICK CHENEY'S OWN METRIC
AS OUR BASELINE, CAN WE UNCOVER
