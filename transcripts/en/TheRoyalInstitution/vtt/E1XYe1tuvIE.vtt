00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.920
Have you ever wondered how your
immune system is able to

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.300
recognise and destroy the
apparently infinite number of

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.410
pathogens that exist
out there?

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.400
Paradoxically, it does this
with a relatively

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.460
small number of genes.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.120
These genes are called
immunoglobulins, and one of

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.360
them is on Chromosome 14.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.140
So if you imagine this is what
it looks like, that this is

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.660
the piece of DNA on Chromosome
14 that codes for the

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.710
immunoglobulin, we have the
beginning and the end of the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.200
gene are yellow.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.040
But the interesting part is
the middle, because in the

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.830
middle we have lots of these
red component and lots of

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.540
these blue and green
components.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.390
These are called the
VDJ components.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.650
And this is the way it is in
the gene as you inherit it

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.040
from your parents,
but this isn't a

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.750
usable form of the gene.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.240
A correct immunoglobulin
has just one red, one

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.180
blue, and one green.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.160
So what needs to happen is
this needs to recombine.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.370
The DNA needs to break and
rejoin with one of the reds

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.370
and with one of the blues.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:29.550
So what this does then is it
generates one of the many

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.990
possible combinations of the
immunoglobulin, and it

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.130
generates other versions of the
immunoglobulins in other

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.490
cells in your immune system.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.160
So the amazing thing about
this system is that it

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.000
produces a really huge diversity
of immunoglobulins,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.150
all from one gene.
