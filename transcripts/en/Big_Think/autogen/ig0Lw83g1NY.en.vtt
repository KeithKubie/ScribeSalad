situation it's very bad for your
 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.010
situation it's very bad for your
ultimate development but if you you have

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
ultimate development but if you you have
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.649
ultimate development but if you you have
that same allele the serotonin

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659
that same allele the serotonin
 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.570
that same allele the serotonin
transporter with and you shown a lot of

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580
transporter with and you shown a lot of
 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.190
transporter with and you shown a lot of
love it has the opposite effect it kind

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
love it has the opposite effect it kind
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.899

this is amazing so it really made sense

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:08.909
this is amazing so it really made sense
 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:10.809
this is amazing so it really made sense
and it really is like a biological

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819
and it really is like a biological

biological reasons for it I think it's

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270
biological reasons for it I think it's
 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.840
biological reasons for it I think it's
very compelling and that has been

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850
very compelling and that has been
 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.820
very compelling and that has been
exciting because I'm for me it's

exciting because I'm for me it's
 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.680
exciting because I'm for me it's
exciting because it's scientifically

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690
exciting because it's scientifically
 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.230
exciting because it's scientifically
interesting it it opens up something

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240
interesting it it opens up something
 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.120
interesting it it opens up something
about the universe and that's what

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130
about the universe and that's what
 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.640
about the universe and that's what
drives me it really does and if it

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650
drives me it really does and if it
 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.740
drives me it really does and if it
didn't it would it wouldn't but on the

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750
didn't it would it wouldn't but on the
 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.960
didn't it would it wouldn't but on the
side I knew that I was really lucky to

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970
side I knew that I was really lucky to
 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.030
