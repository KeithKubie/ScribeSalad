00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.870
The Olympic Tug-of-War... and 8 Other Sports
Facts

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.860
1) About 5% of all Association Football (Soccer)
injuries occur during celebrations after scoring

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.870
a goal.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.940
2) Former Major League baseball player Benji
Molina was one of the slowest base runners

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.859
in baseball during his career.

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.930
So slow that he once hit a home run that he
never scored on, with a pinch runner put in

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.089
after Molina made it to first base…

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.970
What happened was Molina hit a home run that
initially was ruled a single and a pinch runner,

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.420
Emmanuel Burris, was put in.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.510
However, manager Bruce Bochy challenged the
call and it was ultimately ruled a home run,

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.520
but because the pinch runner had already been
put in, the umpires ruled that Molina could

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.030
not go back out to complete the home run trot.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.420
So Burris, not Molina, was given credit for
scoring the run, while Molina was credited

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.870
with hitting the home run.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.000
This makes Benji Molina the only player in
MLB history to hit a home run and not score

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
on it.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.360
3) Tug of war was an Olympic event until after
the 1920 Olympics.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.470
Multiple teams from countries were allowed,
which is how the U.S. won bronze, silver,

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.030
and gold in 1904.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.780
Britain did the same thing in 1908.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.469
4) In 1996, when Pete Sampras played Alex
Corretja in the U.S. Open, he had a bit of

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:11.469
a stomach bug.

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:14.219
He actually threw up on the baseline during
the fifth set.

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.689
One of the referees warned Pete Sampras that
he would be disqualified if he caused another

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:18.689
delay.

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.179
Sampras pulled himself together and was not
only able to finish the match, but he came

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:23.689
out victorious.

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:29.359
5) Henry Chadwick, the creator of the baseball
box score, was the first to setup a demonstration

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:32.950
proving that the rotation of a baseball could
cause the ball to curve.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.240
Before this, some pitchers had already observed
and used this to their advantage (even though

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.959
many of the day considered it cheating), but
no one had yet proved that it was actually

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:44.670
happening and not just in the pitcher’s
heads or an optical illusion.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.119
To prove it, Chadwick set up two stakes placed
twenty feet apart in a line between the pitcher

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.210
and batter’s box.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.619
A pitcher, Fred Goldsmith, then threw a ball
which ended up being to the right of the first

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.349
stake, but then curved to end up to the left
of the second stake.

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:03.149
6) Chadwick chose the “K” to denote a
strikeout in a baseball box score because

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.630
it was the last letter in “struck” as
in “struck out”.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.440
Chadwick often liked to use the last letter
of words instead of the first, particularly

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.580
when he felt they were more memorable.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.820
In this particular case, Chadwick said “the
letter K in struck is easier to remember in

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.840
connection with the word, than S.”
7) “Super Bowl” and “Super Sunday”

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.580
are trademarked by the NFL.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.890
As a result of this, any advertisement, event,
promotion, etc. that wants to refer to the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.100
Super Bowl has to come up with some colloquialism
or be granted rights to do so by the NFL,

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.280
which rarely happens.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.430
For the Super Bowl, the most popular colloquialism
is “The Big Game”.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.840
Once this became common, the NFL tried, unsuccessfully,
to trademark “The Big Game”.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.280
8) Soccer balls were originally painted with
the now classic black and white checkered

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.340
look in order to make them more visible on
black and white TV during the 1970 FIFA World

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.340
Cup.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.250
Naturally, people wanted to buy balls that
looked like those that the professionals used

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.670
on TV and thus everybody bought the black
and white checkered soccer ball instead of

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.500
the previous traditional solid color ball.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.360
9) Mickey Rourke, most recently known for
his parts in Iron Man 2 and The Expendables,

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.830
shocked Hollywood back in the early 90s when
he decided to quit acting and become a professional

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:14.830
boxer.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.110
Rourke intended to fight until he got a title
shot, but after three years and a series of

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.320
serious injuries he decided to quit.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.440
However, he did manage to retire undefeated
with 6 wins and 2 draws, joining an elite

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.270
club of boxers who retired undefeated such
as the great Rocky Marciano and arguably the

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:47.640
greatest super middleweight boxer of all time,
Joe Calzaghe.
