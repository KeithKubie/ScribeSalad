JOHN DAY-RICHTER: All right,
hello, ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.990
and thank you for attending take
two of introducing the

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.870
Google Drive SDK.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.180
Thanks for being here.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.170
I'm John Day-Richter, I'm the
tech lead for the Google Drive

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.600
SDK, and this is my
very good friend--

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.650
JOSH HUDGINS: I'm Josh Hudgins,

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.640
I'm the product manager.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.720
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: All right,
well, thanks for coming out.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.380
We're going to tell you all
about the Google Drive SDK.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.600
Take us through what we're
going to talk about.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.750
JOSH HUDGINS: So here's what
we're going to do today.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.800
First off, I just want to point
out that we do have free

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.190
T-shirts in the back, so--

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.670
[CHEERING]

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.190
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Yeah,
that's right.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.900
JOSH HUDGINS: Yeah.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.220
So you know how we're going to
roll in this session today,

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.700
free T-shirts.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.470
So the way we'll do it is we'll
have a little Q&amp;A at the

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.670
end, and if you ask a really
awesome question, you're going

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.520
to have a T-shirt coming your
way, so look forward to that.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.570
So here's what we're
going to cover.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.740
First, we're going to talk a
little bit about Drive, what

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.230
it is as a product and why we
felt like an SDK is such a

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.510
critical part of Drive as a
product, and how you might use

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.460
it, why we built it,
that sort of thing.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.750
Then we're going to talk through
what we launched in v1

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.565
of the SDK when we launched
Drive back in late April.

00:01:01.565 --> 00:01:03.750
Then we're going to get to the
exciting stuff, the stuff that

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.370
we have just launched over the
last couple days, and then

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.420
some things that will be coming
down the pipe soon,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.420
some stuff we're very
excited about.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.810
So first, a little bit about
Drive and the SDK and why we

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.560
think the SDK is an important
part of the product.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.170
So Drive itself, when I think
about Drive, I like to

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.490
describe it along three
main features,

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.700
or three main pillars.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.965
You saw a little bit of this in
Clay's demo in the keynote,

00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:27.270
but we'll kind of go through
this, and as we go through

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.680
these things you'll see why
overlaying an SDK over the top

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.350
of these things can be such
a powerful thing.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.350
But the first pillar is this
idea of access anywhere, and I

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.210
think you saw that demonstrated
very well today.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.030
No matter where you are, we have
given you access to the

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.920
content you have put in
Drive, so we do this

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.860
through a number of ways.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.810
The first is through the web
UI at drive.google.com.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.910
Everything in your drive is
available to you through any

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.540
web browser that we support, and
you can do everything you

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.760
need to do there through the
web-- you can share, you can

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.270
manage your files, you can
collaborate on them with

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.230
Google Docs, you can do a whole
number of things through

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.210
the web UI.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.480
There's also the sync clients.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.840
We have sync clients now for Mac
and Windows, and the sync

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.820
client is a really terrific
piece of software that you

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.150
install on your desktop machine,
and it's going to

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.490
sync content on your desktop
machine back and

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.550
forth to the cloud.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.070
So changes you make locally will
be reflected back in the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.470
cloud, and changes you make in
the cloud are broadcast back

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.960
down to your local machine.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.570
So wherever you have these sync
clients installed, all of

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.390
your content will always be up
to date across all of your

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.350
different machines.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.580
And we also have
mobile devices.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.890
Native apps on mobile devices,
we just announced that the iOS

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.720
app is available today on iPads,
iPods, pretty much any

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.780
iOS device.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.000
We have mobile devices on
Android, and now we also have

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.290
Drive integration built directly
into Chrome OS, so

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.580
virtually any device you're
working on you're going to be

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.900
able to access your content
there and interact with it in

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.340
meaningful ways.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.130
The next thing is Drive
is really all about

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.840
collaboration.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.210
It's not just about storing
things, it's about giving you

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.290
ways to work with other people
on the content in Drive.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.740
So there's three main ways we
allow you to do this, and then

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.610
at the end of the presentation
we'll talk about some really

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.200
exciting things coming
in this space.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.750
But the first one of these
things is sharing.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.600
In Drive, we let you share
content with people for a

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.410
variety of different ways-- you
can make content public,

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.650
you can share content with large
groups of people through

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.530
an unlisted link, you can share
directly with other

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.430
Drive users--

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.120
just adding them directly to the
content, and then only you

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.680
and they can see it, or you can
even share it with groups.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.520
And when you do that sharing,
it's not just a blanket share,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.940
you can decide what kind of
things that person can do with

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.740
the thing you're sharing.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.670
So I can say, for instance, if
I shared something with John,

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.980
I probably don't want to let
him edit my file, he's not

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.350
really that reliable,
so I would just

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.030
give him view access.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.090
Whereas other people you could
give edit access, or even

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.930
access to add comments, and
comments is the very next

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.170
thing I want to talk
about here.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.350
We now have given people that
use Drive the ability to add

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.460
comments to anything
in their drive.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.720
In the past, you could do that
for Google Docs, but arbitrary

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.770
files you couldn't.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.820
Now you can add comments to any
file at all in Drive, and

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.170
so you could work together in
your team and add comments to

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.240
things and collaborate on those
things all at once.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.640
And the last thing I want to
talk about in terms of

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.320
collaboration is-- you saw
this today in the demo as

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.110
well-- is Google Docs,
of course.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.480
Google Docs allows you to
collaborate on a level that's

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.920
virtually unique across
this space.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.400
You can co-edit documents in
real time and everyone's

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.810
changes are automatically
broadcast to everyone else.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.000
If I'm working with John on
a document, I can see

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.290
immediately the changes he's
making to the document, so

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.710
it's an incredibly powerful
tool for collaboration.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.415
And then the last
thing is search.

00:04:25.415 --> 00:04:27.595
And I think this also came
across very well in the demo

00:04:27.595 --> 00:04:28.930
today as well.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.410
If you talk about this for
images, it's a really cool

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.550
thing, every image that is
uploaded into Drive we run

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.700
through the Google Goggles back
end, which is the same

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.150
technology that powers Google's
visual search.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.810
So this back end can recognize
a number of different things

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.940
in your images-- it can
recognize famous landmarks,

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.880
faces, corporate logos, and it
does a terrific job in doing

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.970
optical character recognition on
the content and the images.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.620
So if you upload pictures
of mountains, or famous

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.050
landmarks, or buildings,
and you can

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.130
search for those things.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.600
The demo we like to do is Mount
Everest, we just upload

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.150
a ton of different pictures from
users of Mount Everest.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.430
No metadata at all associated
with the image-- no file

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.340
names, no Exif, no geotagging,
nothing.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.000
And Google Goggles can identify
them as pictures of

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.910
Everest, it's really quite
amazing to see.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.710
So all that power of search
right there in

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.420
Drive for you to do.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.410
What we do then--

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.620
go ahead and click it--

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.810
is over the top of all of these
different services we

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.560
have overlaid in SDK, which
we're going to give developers

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.040
the ability to access all of
this technology, and John's

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.360
going to talk more about that.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.970
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: So the Drive
SDK really cuts across all of

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.990
these three different pillars
of Google Drive, and makes

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.980
them available to
the applications

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.270
that you want to write.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.890
And before we go into what the
Drive SDK does, we felt like

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.880
we needed to explain why we
built an SDK at all because we

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.680
know we are not the only game in
town, and other people have

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.730
SDKs too, but we felt like there
were some things about

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.910
our product that were so special
that it was important

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.310
for us to make an SDK so that
other people could start

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.940
writing apps on top of it.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.090
So first of all, with Google
Drive we wanted to make sure

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.220
that it wasn't just a place to
keep stuff, we wanted to make

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.220
it a place to do stuff.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.200
So no matter which of the Google
Drive clients you're

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.750
using, you can use your
file on that system.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.420
So if you're using the Google
Drive web client, you can do a

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.230
whole lot more than just
download the files that are in

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.480
Google Drive.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.240
Using Drive apps-- which you
heard a little bit about at

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.530
the keynote, and Josh is going
to show us an awesome demo of

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.010
in a second--

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.140
you can take your apps on the
web, and just edit them with

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.320
other web apps that
you've installed.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.230
And if there's something that
you want to do on the web that

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.450
Google hasn't written a product
to handle, doesn't

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.580
matter because chances are
somebody else did and you can

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.590
use the file there.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.230
Also, on our Android client you
can, of course, open your

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.060
files using any app that
you've got installed on

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.550
Android that can handle those
files, but if you want to use

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.780
a web app that you've installed
on the web, our

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.780
Android client can open your
file in that web app on your

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:00.960
mobile device.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.200
And with the improvements that
we've made to our mobile API

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.070
if you don't want to have to
go through the hassle of

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:08.870
downloading your file and
handing it off to another app,

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.840
apps can be written that can
access Google Drive's data

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.090
store directly.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.580
So there's a lot of ways to
continue to use your files

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.050
even when they're stored
on Google Drive.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.100
And you can reach millions
of users.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.740
Google Drive has a lot
of users, I can't

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.630
talk specific numbers--

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.600
it's more than two.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.860
There's a lot of
guys out there.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.540
And then you're not just getting
access to Google

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.230
Drive's users, you're getting
access to the entire Google

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:42.620
ecosystem of users via things
like OAuth login and all these

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.190
different mechanisms that will
bring Google users to your

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:48.070
app, if you build it on
top of Google Drive.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.410
And we are really committed
to helping our developers

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:57.170
succeed, and there's a lot of
ways that we really think that

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:59.740
developers can do well
using this API.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.470
So, for example, when--

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.020
like almost everything
at Google I/O--

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.810
when you use the Google Drive
APIs, you get access to the

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:09.860
entire world of Google APIs,
so it's really easy to

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.800
integrate calendar and
contacts, and all the

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.260
different stuff that we've
already got APIs for, it's

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.640
really easy to build that into
your app that's already

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.380
talking to Google Drive.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.960
And Google Drive is all
integrated with Google Docs,

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.960
so lots of features that are
features of Google Docs become

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.870
ways of publicizing your app.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.210
When you share a document that
was created with your app, the

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:37.700
user gets shared your app too,
or at least an opportunity to

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.860
install the app.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.169
So your app can grow virally
just through users sharing

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.030
content and collaborating.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.360
And then, finally, we wanted
to make sure that there was

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.840
really every mechanism to
publicize the work you've

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.730
done, so we've integrated with
the Chrome Web Store and

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.170
there's this entire store where
users can discover new

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.260
Google Drive apps and find
out more about what

00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.730
you're working on.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.130
Did I forget anything
there, Josh?

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.770
JOSH HUDGINS: I think you've
covered pretty much everything

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:03.470
in the preview.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.990
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: So here's what
we've launched already--

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.210
what we launched before Google
I/O started-- and we wanted to

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.020
just do a brief overview.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.190
So first, there's the
Google Drive API.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.600
So we've completely rebuilt this
from the old Google Docs

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:19.650
List API, which is sort of
similar, but we built it as a

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.270
RESTful API--

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.410
credentials and authentication
are now based on OAuth 2--

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:25.370
far more modern--

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:28.110
and we've got client libraries
and code samples in six

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.060
different languages, so there
are really a lot of options to

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.870
build your app however
you want to.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.830
JOSH HUDGINS: So as part of the
SDK v1, we also introduced

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.520
this concept of a Drive app.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.080
So as we were building out Drive
we had built a viewer

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.010
that could give you read-only
views of between 30 and 40

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:49.470
different file types, many of
the major things people like

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.190
to view like PDFs, and Word
documents, and images, and

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.160
things like that.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.670
We realized there was still this
entire constellation of

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.540
content that we just didn't
provide much of an experience

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.710
for, so what we wanted to do
was open up our UI to third

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.130
party developers, so they could
take an app that they

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:06.610
had already built that maybe
provided a nice experience for

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:09.100
a certain type of content and
integrate that app directly

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.550
into the Drive UI, and
so that's what Drive

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.020
apps are all about.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.530
So you can build an app, and
then you basically tell us

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.760
what sorts of MIME types or
file extensions you can

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.750
handle, and once the user
installs that app, we

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.450
interweave that app into the
very fabric of the UI, so

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.200
everywhere you interact with a
piece of content of that type

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.090
users have the choice
of using the app of

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:30.970
yours that they installed.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:32.830
We also offer you a neat option,
if you've already

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:36.350
built a web app that stores
content in its own back end or

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:38.210
some sort of proprietary system,
but you still want to

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.470
integrate with Drive, you don't
necessarily have to

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:43.800
store the content in Drive, you
can continue to store the

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.360
content in your own system and
then provide a pointer to it

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.550
in Drive, so users will see it
in their drive as if it were

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:50.770
any other type of item.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.820
They can do things with it like
sharing, or manage it

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.080
within the Drive UI, so it's
pretty much like any other

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.880
item, but when you click on it,
it opens the content up

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.590
from your system, so you have a
lot of different integration

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.620
options depending on where
you're at as a web app.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.070
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: And if you
write an app that handles a

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:09.720
type that already is handled
by Google Drive,

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.790
we're fine with that.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.440
If you wrote a better viewer,
the user can choose to make

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.350
that the default, and they'll
use yours from now on.

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:17.820
JOSH HUDGINS: But the best thing
about it is is we give

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:19.720
users control over
the experience.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.160
So if you provide a great
experience, we don't favor our

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.500
own in any way, so they can
build a customer experience

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.140
that makes sense for them.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.190
And another thing that we've
done, I think, that makes the

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.840
development experience very
fulfilling here in Drive is

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:34.330
we've done a lot of great
integrations with

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:35.090
the Chrome Web Store.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:38.125
So if you built an app that does
integrate with Drive, you

00:11:38.125 --> 00:11:40.200
can list it and distribute it
through the Chrome Web Store,

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.440
and there's a lot of
great things that

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.870
come along with that.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.520
It's a great mechanism for
discovery, so users can come

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.460
in through the Chrome Web
Store's front page, and then

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.640
find the Drive apps collection,
and if you had

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.490
integrated with Drive, your
app would show up there.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:54.690
But not just promotion and
servicing and discovery

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:56.790
through the Chrome Web Store,
but we also link to the Chrome

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.630
Web Store all throughout the
Drive UI, we take tons of

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:02.270
opportunities to promote apps
in different scenarios where

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.540
it makes sense that will link
off to the Chrome Web Store so

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:08.255
users can make more avenues
to find and discover and

00:12:08.255 --> 00:12:09.320
install your app.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.510
So as part of the Chrome Web
Store, you also get a lot of

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.380
other things for free.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.740
You get things like bug
reports, ratings,

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:15.880
reviews, and analytics.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.100
And all these things-- great
feedback from your user

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.020
community--

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.590
all come for free as part of
being listed in the store, and

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.620
then maybe the best thing about
it now is it doesn't

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.790
just work for Chrome, despite
the fact it's called the

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.960
Chrome Web Store you can now
install Drive apps from the

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.570
Chrome Web Store
in any browser.

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.820
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: So the Drive
SDK also has some great

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:36.920
security features.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.660
And we found that users are more
likely to use apps that

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.460
they trust, so if you have a
very scary security warning

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.010
when your app is installed,
users often walk

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:48.070
away at that point.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.370
We've done everything we can
to make sure that your app

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.550
gets at the data that it needs,
but only the data that

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:58.070
it needs so that users aren't
scared off and there's less of

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:02.000
a danger of a user installing
an app that misbehaves.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.290
So many people have asked, can
I do this thing with the

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.270
Google Drive SDK version one?

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:12.540
And I will say, no, you can't
do that, and they will say,

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.410
are you lazy?

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:15.460
And I will say, yes,
but that's not it,

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.640
it's actually a feature.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:22.030
So with Drive apps in the SDK
version one, apps can only

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:25.270
access files that the app
created, or that the user

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.100
explicitly gave access to.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:31.970
So if a user's installed your
app, your app still can't get

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:35.420
at their files until they choose
to open the file with

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.620
your app in Google Drive, and
that way if the user installs

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:41.960
an evil app, it's still only
being evil at one or two

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.350
files, and it's very easy in
the Google Drive UI to

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:49.110
uninstall apps and revoke
access to files for a

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.840
particular app if a user feels
like it's misbehaving.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.900
And all of this is bringing
great peace of mind to our

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.910
suspicious web users.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.450
And, finally, there's a file
picker here because we know

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.730
that a lot of apps need the
ability to have a user pick a

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.670
file from their corpus, and we
don't give you any way to do

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.770
that through the API.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.250
So with this JavaScript
component, you can pop up a

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:16.640
view of the user's drive, served
from Google, so it's in

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.640
a trusted context from Google,
they choose the files that

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.910
they want to open with your app,
the picker grants access

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:25.220
to your app when the user
chooses it, and then your app

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.280
has access to the file.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.450
So you can still make apps that
operate on any arbitrary

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:34.670
file in the user's corpus,
and it's very secure.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:38.890
So it's demo time.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:39.490
JOSH HUDGINS: OK.

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:40.940
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Let's show
how all of this works.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.790
JOSH HUDGINS: So what I want
to do is walk you through a

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.690
scenario where John
here is my boss.

00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:46.540
JOHN DAY-RICHTER:
I'm the boss?

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:46.880
JOSH HUDGINS: Yep.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.800
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: All right.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.790
JOSH HUDGINS: And he has just
come up with a revolutionary

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.420
new idea for a software
product.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.660
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Hudgins!

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.040
I gots me an idea for
a software project.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.620
JOSH HUDGINS: And so he is a
dedicated Microsoft Project

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.830
user, and he has shared with me
a Microsoft Project file.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:07.820
So what I need to do is figure
out what he wants me to do,

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.540
and then do it, but the catch is
that I don't have access to

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.770
any of my local desktop
applications that I would

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:15.890
normally do, I have to figure
out how to do all this stuff

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.460
all from the cloud, all
in a web browser.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.290
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Hudgins, did
I just see you uninstall the

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.480
app so you can demo installing
the app?

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.480
JOSH HUDGINS: You may have
seen that very thing.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.690
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: OK.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:28.000
JOSH HUDGINS: So here's
the MPP file that

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:28.940
he shared with me.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:32.580
Now, if I click on this in
Drive, Drive doesn't actually

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:35.510
preview this file, it's one of
the file types that Drive

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:38.850
doesn't do anything with, so I
have no preview, so without

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:40.540
Drive apps I would be
stuck right here.

00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.830
But fortunately, we give you
this little icon down here

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.980
that says I can get more apps,
and what this is going to do

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:49.080
is open the Chrome Web Store and
show me all the apps that

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.640
are integrated with Drive that
can do something with

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.630
Microsoft Project.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.050
So fortunately, we have three
different choices here I can

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:58.962
choose from, and I'm going
to install Gantter.

00:15:58.962 --> 00:16:00.770
It's going to take me here, and
I'm going to hit Add To

00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:04.100
Chrome, and that's going to
install it into Drive, and if

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.500
I go back here and hit Refresh,
you can see that my

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.200
project plan now has the Gantter
icon next to it, which

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.640
means when I click on
this, it's going

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.790
to open it in Gantter.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.260
So I'm going to do that, and
it's going to ask for

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.570
permission to access my drive,
so this is our auth screen,

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:18.550
you can see all of
the different

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.700
things it wants to access.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.080
I'm going to hit Allow
Access, and it's

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.636
going to open the file.

00:16:23.636 --> 00:16:25.020
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Hudgins,
where are we with

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.640
that project plan?

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.890
JOSH HUDGINS: Getting close.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.720
So it's pulling the binary over
from Drive, and now it's

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.180
going to open it
and render it.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.470
And using John's typical project
code words I can see

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:42.250
First Task here, I know
exactly what that is--

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:46.090
he needs me to create a
wireframe mockup of his great

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:47.090
new software idea.

00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:48.710
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Oh yeah, and
we're going to have buttons.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:51.670
The kids love buttons
nowadays.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:53.670
JOSH HUDGINS: So I need to
create this new product that

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:55.620
has more buttons than we
typically have, so

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.710
fortunately, I have an app
installed into Drive that can

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:58.620
do something like that.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.610
I have an app called Balsamiq,
which allows me to create

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.630
mocks and wireframes, and
that sort of thing.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.000
So I'm going to open that up,
and I'm going to start

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
designing this new product
that he wants to see.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.780
And it's clear we're going to
need a lot of buttons based on

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.740
the feedback I've
gotten so far.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:15.160
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Make a button
so you can plus one

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.410
another button.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:21.349
JOSH HUDGINS: So that's probably
a good amount of

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:22.690
buttons there.

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:27.609
So I'm going to save that, and
I'm going to call that the New

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:30.500
Button Design.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.060
The cool thing about this is
when I save it, it doesn't

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.880
save a local copy of that file
down to my machine, it saves

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.320
it directly back to my drive.

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.590
So I can go back to my drive and
see it right here as New

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.070
Button Design.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.960
So now I'm going to share that
back with John because he

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.380
needs to see it and make sure
that the buttons are numerous

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.790
enough and properly
positioned.

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.850
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Oh, they
better be numerous.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.100
JOSH HUDGINS: So I'm going
to share that.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:58.870
And I believe John's [? MO ?]

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:00.510
email address is demo two.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:05.390
Hit Share.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:11.680
And so now when I switch over
to John's account, that will

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.500
show up here--

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.390
New Button Design.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.660
So when I click on
that, he doesn't

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.020
have Balsamiq installed.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.410
JOHN DAY-RICHTER:
What is this?

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.120
JOSH HUDGINS: But it tells him
that-- it knows that Balsamiq

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.855
created this file, so when he
tries to preview the file it

00:18:24.855 --> 00:18:27.010
says, hey, you're going to need
Balsamiq to look at this,

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.090
and there's a button right here
to install it so he can

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:29.500
install it.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.600
So we'll talk about this a
little bit more in a minute,

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.910
but this is just a great growth
channel for web app

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.190
install bases because as people
across these teams

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:39.810
start to share content they
create with these apps around

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.780
there are constant upsells all
through the UI to help users

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.170
find and discover apps they can
use to work together on

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:45.900
these things.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.220
So what John would do then is
install that app and he would

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.760
be able to look at and
approve it and all

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.910
those different things.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.600
So let's pretend
he's done that.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.230
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Oh, that's
a good design.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:56.050
JOSH HUDGINS: Buttons
looking good?

00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:57.670
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Yeah,
buttons all right.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.720
JOSH HUDGINS: So now we need to
get legal approval for this

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.650
thing, and our legal department
has some sort of

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:02.800
unusual requirements--

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.940
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: They need to
get the documents via fax

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:08.270
because that's what those
people understand.

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:09.900
JOSH HUDGINS: So apparently our
legal department has no

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.160
computers whatsoever and
they only receive

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.840
documents via fax.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.400
And from long experience working
with these guys, I've

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.450
also learned that if I draw
a smiley face on the paper

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:22.500
before I fax it, they'll
tend to approve it.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.760
The problem is I don't have a
printer, and I don't have a

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.020
fax machine.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.970
But fortunately, I do have an
app that allows me to edit

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:32.600
images, but before we do that,
we need to save our mockup

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.860
back to Drive as an image.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.910
So I can open the
mockup back up--

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:36.960
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Hudgins,
is that contrived

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.990
example done yet?

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.680
Getting closer.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.890
And I'm going to export that
to PNG, and we see the New

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:46.080
Button Design show up
right here in Drive.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.130
I'm going to click on
it and make sure

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:48.180
everything's looking good.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.080
There's the PNG, it looks
good viewing it in the

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.060
Google Drive Viewer.

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.090
So now I need to edit that
because it's going to have to

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.310
have a smiley face on it.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.490
So I'm going to open that with
an image editor that I've

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.960
installed called Pixlr Editor,
and that will open up the

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.320
image and if you've used a lot
of image editing tools, this

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:06.960
is a fairly familiar
interface.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.210
And I'm just going to draw
a smiley face right here.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.710
Close enough.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.820
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Like
money in the bank.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.550
JOSH HUDGINS: So now I'm going
to save that, and it's going

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.290
to save it back over
the original

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:21.750
file back in my drive.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:25.120
That's saved, now let's go back
and make sure that my

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.530
smiley-- yep, everything's
looking good.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:29.090
So now all I need to do
is fax this to legal.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:31.400
I don't have a fax machine, but
what I do have is an app

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.760
called HelloFax that will
allow me to fax almost

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.400
anything in my drive
to a fax number.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.635
So now I'm going to open
this PNG with HelloFax.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.145
And what that's going to do is
start loading the document in

00:20:44.145 --> 00:20:45.300
the background, and it's
going to ask me what I

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.080
want to do with it.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:48.360
Well, I want to fax it.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.840
I'm going to click that.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.640
It's loading the document and
while it's doing that I'm

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.970
going to type a made
up fax number.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:57.020
And you can see that the
document has been loaded here,

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.790
it's got my smiley face, its got
our design, and all I have

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:02.370
to do is hit Send It Now, and
it will fax that document

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.140
directly to our legal
department.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.210
We managed to do all of that
without touching any local

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:09.350
software, or any hardware,
doing it

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:10.720
all through the cloud.

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:11.770
It's pretty cool stuff.

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:12.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.380
JOHN DAY-RICHTER:
Aww, thank you.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:19.780
I don't have to do boss voice
anymore, I'll stop doing that.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.080
Yeah, OK.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.540
JOSH HUDGINS: All right, so now
I want to talk a little

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.290
bit about the value proposition
of this whole

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:28.200
thing from the developer's
point of view.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:31.370
So if you decide to go down this
path of integration, what

00:21:31.370 --> 00:21:33.800
is your cost to do it and what
type of return do you want to

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:34.800
see from that?

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.290
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Is this
the money part?

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:38.240
JOSH HUDGINS: This might be
a little bit producty.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.560
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: OK, I'll
translate for [? amateurs. ?]

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.080
Go ahead.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.910
JOSH HUDGINS: So first is what
are you investing to do the

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:43.970
integration?

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:47.210
So in our experience working
with our partners, the

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:50.330
feedback we have gotten-- the
API is simple, it's very easy

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:52.930
to use, and we've had several
reports of partners that were

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:55.080
able to build their entire
Drive integration on an

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.610
existing web app in less than
24 hours, a couple of them

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.000
even talked about that directly

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.210
in their press release.

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:01.450
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: So guys, your
boss is going to be all

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:03.480
like, how long is it going to
take to do the Google Drive

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.020
integration?

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.920
And you'll be like, man, it's
only going to take a week.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.760
And then you do it in a
day, and then you go

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.740
see Avengers, again.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.340
JOSH HUDGINS: So your investment
is relatively

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.970
small, so what do you
get in return?

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.660
So you're going to get access
to two things we think are

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:18.810
very important.

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:21.350
The first is the Drive user
base, and you heard this

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:24.150
morning that Clay announced
we're already over 10 million

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:25.870
users after a couple months.

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:29.170
And pretty soon, you'll get
access not only to that user

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.550
base, but anyone, basically,
who has a Google account,

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:33.300
you'll be able to interact with
their drive in some way,

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.660
so that's a very large,
very active user base.

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.240
And then what we're going to
talk about more in just a

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.040
minute-- and I think Clay kind
of touched on this, we're

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.770
going to explore it in
more depth here--

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:43.430
is that the users you get as
part of a Drive integration

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:46.570
tend to be more engaged and more
active users, so that's

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:47.750
definitely something you're
going to want

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:48.560
in your user base.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.330
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Not
just more users,

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:53.290
they're better people.

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:55.990
JOSH HUDGINS: And we also give
you many opportunities to grow

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:57.660
your install base, it's
a great way to get

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.140
exposure for your app.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:02.400
And as you saw in the demo, we
promote apps all throughout

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.310
the UI and virtually
anyplace users can

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:06.300
interact with files--

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:08.280
like the chip you saw in the
bottom left corner of our

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.350
viewer that helps you go to the
Chrome Web Store and find

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:12.980
apps specifically for
that type of file.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.540
Every time users share files
created with apps, we give the

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.460
receiving user an upsell to
install your app if somebody

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:23.960
shared a piece of content with
them, and the CWS shift that

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.830
we mentioned before.

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:27.790
So all those things help you
give you new channels to grow

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:30.780
your install base, and is a
very nice return on this

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.090
relatively small investment.

00:23:32.090 --> 00:23:34.080
So we're going to walk through
a couple case studies now and

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.460
kind of show you what that looks
like with actual numbers

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.970
from our partners.

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:38.755
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Yeah.

00:23:38.755 --> 00:23:41.550
JOSH HUDGINS: All right.

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:43.430
So first a SlideRocket.

00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:45.810
So SlideRocket has a web-based
presentation editor that

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:47.740
allows you to create
presentations, and they store

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:48.760
the data in their own system.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.000
They've been around for a while,
and already have a

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.110
relatively stable and large user
base, and they did their

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:57.100
Drive integration and launched
with us back in late April.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:00.250
So since that time, 8 out
of their top 10 days for

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:02.560
registrations have come after
the Drive launch, so they've

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.480
seen incredibly accelerated
growth and installs because of

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.010
their Drive integration.

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:08.210
And then this really speaks--

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.300
this next point-- to this viral
growth channel that

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.890
happens when people start
sharing content they create

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:16.310
with Drive apps, over a quarter
of all their new users

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:19.260
since Drive launched have
originated from one user

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.410
sharing a SlideRocket
presentation with another

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.990
user, so it's a very powerful
channel for growth.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:27.060
And when they compared Drive
users to their original

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:28.880
baseline non-Drive users
they found some

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.410
pretty surprising things.

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:33.580
Drive users were three times
more active, they logged in to

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.300
the product three times as
often, and they also created

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.540
over three and a half times
more presentations than

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:39.780
non-Drive users did.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:42.130
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: See,
better people.

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.560
JOSH HUDGINS: So the next case
study is Lucidchart, which is

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.010
a flowchart and diagramming
tool.

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.300
They gave us two interesting
numbers that came out of their

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.080
analysis comparing their
original baseline users with

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.450
the new users that came as part
of the Drive integration.

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.420
So for them they had a very
interesting result, one of

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.050
them was that the users they
were getting via the Drive

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:02.880
channel tended to be more large
team-based enterprise

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.660
accounts, which for a piece of
software like this is a very,

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.520
very important metric for them
because that means it's going

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.900
to be higher retention rates,
better monetization, better

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:12.840
conversion.

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.450
So they're getting exactly the
users they want in larger

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:18.590
numbers because of the Drive
integration, and a large part

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:20.950
because the Drive integration
makes it so much easier for

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:22.850
their users to work in teams.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:24.870
And then they saw something
very similar in terms of

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:27.990
engagement and document
creation, that Drive users

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:31.180
were creating three times as
many documents through

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:35.310
Lucidchart as their non-Drive
users were.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:37.210
The last case study
is HelloFax.

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:40.800
And HelloFax measures user
engagement with two metrics.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.900
One of them is how many faxes
are sent, and the other one is

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.060
how many documents are
sent per signature.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:47.040
And they are seeing
significantly higher

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.820
engagement along both metrics
for the same comparison of

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.310
Drive users versus
non-Drive users--

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:54.280
26% more faxes and
twice as many

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:55.640
documents sent per signature.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.300
So I think the data we're
getting back from the

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.060
developers and the people in
the ecosystem are pretty

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.030
significant, and that's that
when you do the Drive

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:06.530
integration it creates a much
richer environment for users

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.810
both to collaborate and to
create more content.

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.990
It's much more interactive
and there's a lot more

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:14.990
opportunities for you to
grow your install base.

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:18.280
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: So here is
what we're launching at Google

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:24.640
I/O. So first, the Drive API
version two, and it adds all

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.400
of the Drive operations that the
Drive UI can do, or that

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.820
the old Doc List API can do,
to the existing v1 API.

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.280
So it's the new RESTful API with
all of those different

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.850
languages we talked about
before, and OAuth 2 and all of

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.440
that stuff, but it can do
anything that you can do in

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.720
Google Drive.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:46.840
And there are two levels of
access in the Drive API now.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.610
So there's the level of access
I talked about before, where

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:52.340
your app can just get at files
that it created or were

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.320
granted access to the app--

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.130
and that works fine with
all operations--

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:00.410
so if you list files, you'll
just see the files that your

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:03.090
app has access to, so it filters
the view of Google

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:06.170
Drive based on what your
app has access to.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.950
But if you've written the kind
of app that really needs

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:13.260
complete access to the user's
drive, you can write that too.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:15.440
So if you want to write an
alternate client for Google

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.080
Drive, you have all the tools
you need to do it.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:22.890
You will get a scarier message
at authentication time, of

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:27.290
course, but that's the price
of functionality.

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:31.180
And now there's no Drive app
required for API access.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:33.910
That was true in the original
version of the API, not true

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:36.910
anymore, you don't have
to have an app at all.

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:40.050
And there are two new client
libraries available, so if you

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:43.370
want to write apps in JavaScript
or Objective-C

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:44.980
because say you want
to write--

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:48.250
well, you know what Objective-C
is for-- then

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.030
those libraries are available
to you to.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:54.620
And we're improving the
mobile experience,

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:55.980
to my previous point.

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:59.780
So now you can launch Drive apps
right from the Android

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.330
Drive application.

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:03.510
So if there's a web app, you
can launch it right from

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:05.700
there, we talked about
that before.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.610
As you heard earlier, we've
got an iOS app for Drive

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:12.090
nowadays, and although this
functionality isn't available

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:14.370
in that app, it's coming soon.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:17.650
And you can open and save to
Drive from within mobile apps.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:20.670
So if you want to write an app
that's not at all integrated

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:24.360
with the drive client, that's
fine, you can do that on iOS

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.790
or on Android mobile
devices right now.

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:30.460
And then finally the mobile
libraries are just a lot

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:31.770
easier to use.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:34.960
With the new rebuilt APIs,
you'll find the whole

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:39.450
experience of developing for
mobile clients a lot smoother.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.290
JOSH HUDGINS: So if you're
interested in writing any sort

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:42.860
of Drive integration on mobile,
we're going to have a

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:46.200
session later today at 4 o'clock
in Room Six where

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.730
we're going to walk you through
that process in a

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:51.180
whole lot more detail, so how
you would do Drive integration

00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.120
on a mobile device.

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.510
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Yeah, if it
turns out that I'm wrong about

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:57.180
it being easier, feel free
to punch me in the face.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.366
JOSH HUDGINS: Deal.

00:28:58.366 --> 00:29:00.080
All right.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.210
So the next thing that we're
launching as part of this new

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:05.880
version of the SDK is the
embeddable sharing widget.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.310
So we talked about how important
sharing is to third

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:12.240
party developers as a growth
channel, so what we want to do

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.190
is make that even easier for
your users to access because

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:18.420
right now when you create third
party content in Drive,

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.840
you have to go back to the Drive
UI in order to share it

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:21.770
with other people.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:23.970
We want to take that
functionality of sharing and

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:26.540
be able to bring it directly
into the third party app, so

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.790
we've made sharing
now embeddable.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:31.160
All you have to do is drop in
some JS libraries and do some

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:33.500
client code and users will be
able to access this very

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.430
dialogue directly from any
third party experience.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:38.250
So you're probably thinking
that sounds extremely

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:40.400
complicated and it's going to
make my auth story and my

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.470
security story way
more complicated.

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:45.010
The good news is we've taken
care of that for you and it's

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:48.990
really easy to integrate this
directly into your app.

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:51.820
The next thing we're launching
as part of this new SDK is the

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:56.030
ability for third party apps
to open native Google

00:29:56.030 --> 00:29:58.806
documents directly from
the Drive UI.

00:29:58.806 --> 00:30:01.710
So, for instance, say you're
HelloFax and you would like to

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:03.970
be able to have users
fax Google

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.060
documents using your app.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:09.200
Well, the way it works is Google
documents are able to

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.535
export to a number of different
formats, and if

00:30:11.535 --> 00:30:14.340
you're HelloFax, all you have to
do is declare your ability

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:17.790
to handle those export formats
and we will do the magic

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:20.340
behind the scenes where we'll
export it to, say, PDF,

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:23.160
HelloFax takes the converted
PDF, and they can fax it.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.260
So that'll be available for all
the native Google document

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:29.060
editors, Google documents,
spreadsheets, presentations,

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.130
and so all the conversion
formats that they support

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:33.050
you'll be able to open
as part of your apps.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:37.500
So all that content that exists
from all these Google

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:41.210
Docs users for years will be
available to you to manipulate

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:43.630
with your appies.

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:44.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.100
JOHN DAY-RICHTER:
Aww, thank you.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.150
We like it, too.

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:49.250
JOSH HUDGINS: So now we're going
to show you a little bit

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:51.730
about what's going to be coming
down the pipe here over

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:52.870
the next few months and--

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:54.400
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Get out of
the way, son, I'm driving.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.080
OK, so here's what's coming soon
to the Google Drive SDK,

00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.310
I'm very excited about
all this stuff.

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.950
Well, both of this stuff.

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:04.650
There's a lot of stuff coming
soon, we're just talking about

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:05.340
two things.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:07.160
So the first is push
notifications.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:10.180
If you're using the Google Drive
APIs right now and you

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.990
need to show a kind of updated
view of what's going on in a

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:16.700
user's drive, then you are
polling, and that is

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.090
inefficient for you, and it's
not great for our system

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:22.420
either, so we are adding real
time notifications.

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:22.710
So now--

00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:23.130
[FAINT APPLAUSE]

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:26.150
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Aww,
there it is.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:26.760
Yeah.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:30.730
So you will just set up a kind
of listener and you will get

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:34.200
invalidation notices when the
drive changes, and then you

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:37.400
can go in and ask what's
different, and you'll get it.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.380
And we're going to support a
variety of mechanisms that

00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.800
will be appropriate for whatever
device you're on, so

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:45.060
if you're trying to do this from
JavaScript, it'll use one

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:49.340
mechanism, if you're trying to
do it from Android, it'll use

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:53.340
a different one, but your code
will be almost the same in all

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.480
of those environments.

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:59.310
So it's going to be fairly
consistent and easy to write.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:01.770
So here's the other thing, which
I'm very excited about.

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.090
If you've ever used Google
Docs, there's real time

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:09.720
collaboration where two people
can work on a document at the

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.670
same time and they can just see
their changes interposed

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:15.030
together, and it's
really cool.

00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:16.740
We saw a demo of it earlier.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:20.345
We put together our own
demo that we'd like

00:32:20.345 --> 00:32:21.447
to share right now.

00:32:21.447 --> 00:32:22.938
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:32:22.938 --> 00:33:04.210
[TYPING]

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:04.750
JOHN DAY-RICHTER:
Based on a true

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:05.600
story, ladies and gentlemen.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.030
Yes, thank you.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.370
So we are--

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:11.020
yeah.

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:12.130
So what if--

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.640
let's go back to the
presentation--

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.620
what if you could add those
features to your app, and what

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:18.810
if it was easy?

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:21.520
Well, it turns out that there
are a number of engineers that

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.710
worked on Google Docs that are
on the Google Drive SDK team,

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:27.450
and it turns out that if
you're clever, you can

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:30.530
generalize the technology using
Google Docs to work for

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:32.120
any data model.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:36.070
And so maybe we went ahead
and did that, so

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:38.350
let's go to the demo.

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:41.040
You'll notice this little
paint program,

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.830
and isn't it adorable?

00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:46.550
I'm going to reload because
the network went down.

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:49.740
OK, so I've got a little thing,
and when you've got a

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:54.920
paint program, you draw
a little man.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.170
And he's happy.

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.235
And then, [GASP].

00:34:01.235 --> 00:34:05.210
A ghost is drawing in
my same documents.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:08.969
But it's not, it's Josh, because
this is collaborative.

00:34:08.969 --> 00:34:11.110
Now, here's the thing.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:15.671
The code behind this was
incredibly simple to-- what

00:34:15.671 --> 00:34:16.339
are you drawing?

00:34:16.339 --> 00:34:19.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.900
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: A paramecium
is firing a bow and arrow, oh,

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.310
and then you've defaced
my guy.

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:27.199
OK, well, your paramecium
gets a beard, how

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:28.106
you like that punk?

00:34:28.106 --> 00:34:28.533
JOSH HUDGINS: I like it.

00:34:28.533 --> 00:34:32.310
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Oh, and also,
let's say that we both

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:33.860
decided to change the
title of this

00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.070
document at the same time.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:35.810
You want to get in there?

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:37.060
JOSH HUDGINS: Yeah,
let's do that.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.330
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Right on
top of my cursor, huh?

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:50.969
Nice.

00:34:50.969 --> 00:34:52.219
Jeez.

00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:59.250
Thank you for having some
constructive input.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:34:59.760
OK, good.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.990
So we're simultaneously
editing on that.

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:05.780
The code to wire up that text
box to be collaborative was

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:08.120
two lines, and if you
add another text

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.700
box, it's three lines.

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:13.870
The code to get this paint
thing working--

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:16.090
we'll show it to you in a
second, actually-- but it

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:18.470
turns out it's very, very
simple to set up.

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:21.040
And when you write these apps,
you don't have to know

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:25.380
anything about the operational
transform theory that goes

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:28.210
behind resolving changes,
or any of that stuff.

00:35:28.210 --> 00:35:31.780
You write your code like it's a
local JavaScript data model,

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:35.900
you just call like setters and
getter methods, or add and

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.465
remove methods if you're dealing
with an array, and it

00:35:38.465 --> 00:35:39.350
all just works.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:41.630
And the only difference between
writing one of these

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:45.410
apps and writing a completely
in-memory JavaScript app is

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:48.600
that you need to add listeners
to your data models because

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.110
unlike a traditional data model,
these things might

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:54.340
change because somebody else did
something in the program.

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:56.330
So if you wire up your
listeners-- and you might be

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:58.350
writing your code this
way anyway--

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:01.410
then that's it, you've built
a collaborative app.

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:05.530
Now, this paint program,
although Google doesn't

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:08.530
provide anything like this, it
is the kind of thing Google

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:09.480
might provide.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:12.440
So we wanted to show you that
this really works with any

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:17.710
data model, so I decided to do
the geekiest thing possible.

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:23.050
So here is a text adventure that
we wrote using this tool,

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:26.060
but it's a text adventure where
you can modify the world

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.290
as you play.

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:30.110
So right now we're in the
Drive SDK session.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:32.160
We appear to be in some sort
of conference venue.

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.980
Two geeks drone endlessly on a
stage at one end of the room.

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.260
And there is an exit north.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.540
Let's go north.

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:40.610
We're in the hallway.

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:42.530
Because there are sessions going
on, the hallway is a

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:43.750
deserted wasteland.

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:45.660
Tumbleweeds roll past
piles of abandoned

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.230
business cards and swag.

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:48.360
And there is an exit south.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:52.560
There's not a lot going on in
this game, but now, let's have

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:58.090
a collaborator add an
item to the game.

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:03.680
So I've already set this up
so it's easy for me to--

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.210
something is different.

00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:07.100
Let's look.

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:10.870
The hallway now contains
a disco wand.

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:13.660
Let's take disco wand.

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:16.330
And let's try to use it.

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:18.170
It only works in conference
rooms, well,

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:19.675
let's go back south.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:36.930
And so the 1970s reign supreme
in the discophonic

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:37.620
phunkisphere.

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.280
We feel free and alive for the
first times in our life.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.430
We win the game.

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:44.840
Now, the cool thing here
is that the world was

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.840
persistently changing
the whole time.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:50.060
So when I reload this, it's
using that collaborative data

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.800
model, and, again, not doing
anything special, just setting

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.940
properties on it.

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:57.670
But when I reloaded, I was back
in the disco because that

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:00.600
state was just automatically
persisted as we changed the

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.800
data models.

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:06.320
So these things are really,
really easy and, I dare say,

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.810
fun to write.

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:10.810
And if you notice those URLs,
don't bother going to them,

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:12.900
like I said they're only white
listed for Googlers, and they

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.150
will be busted.

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:21.340
So, real quick, this is half
of the JavaScript code for

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:24.650
that paint application, which
was not written by me, by the

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:26.770
way, it was written by
Eric Schoeffler on

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:28.250
my team, who's awesome.

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:32.110
I just adapted it to use
the collaboration API.

00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:33.480
So this is half of the
code, you're not

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.570
expected to read it.

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:38.810
The green stuff is all of the
code that has to do with

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:42.350
collaboration, and I'm being
liberal in determining what

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:46.280
has to do with collaboration
because I included stuff like

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.120
setting up listeners and things
like that, which you

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:51.000
might be doing in your
code anyway.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.930
So did you have a question?

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:54.620
JOSH HUDGINS: Well, it looks
like you don't have to add a

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:56.410
lot of client-side code, but
you probably had to write a

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:57.520
ton of server-side
code to make--

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.110
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Oh
yeah, that's right.

00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:00.460
Let me show you the server-side
code, oh wait.

00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:01.600
There isn't any.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.180
Boom!

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:04.590
Yeah.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:05.751
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:05.751 --> 00:39:07.001
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Damn.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.220
Thank you.

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.800
You can, of course, write
server-side code if you want,

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.140
you can write your own JSON
calls, and build your own

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:16.710
servlets, and call out to other
Google APIs, and do

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:17.600
whatever you want.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.590
We don't care, the code
that actually does

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:22.630
this is all in clients.

00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:26.110
And so with that, I believe
we're wrapped up.

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:28.560
So thank you, ladies
and gentlemen.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:29.639
This is Josh, and I'm John.

00:39:29.639 --> 00:39:36.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:38.280
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Now, I believe
most of you are here

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.670
for free T-shirts, so let's
start earning those.

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:42.120
Hello.

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.590
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:45.830
You mentioned the addition of
the JavaScript client-side

00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:47.370
library in version two.

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:48.400
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Yep.

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.260
AUDIENCE: Is that specifically
for UI in front end, or do you

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:54.906
think we could maybe
use that in OJS?

00:39:54.906 --> 00:39:55.910
JOHN DAY-RICHTER:
You know you--

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:57.010
yes.

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:00.290
My DevRel guy is telling me that
that'll work just fine.

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:01.290
[FAINT APPLAUSE]

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:02.220
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: And
everybody loves

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.060
it, so thank you.

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:05.440
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.340
AUDIENCE: So is there an effort
to provide some kind of

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:12.000
application framework to help
us build these great client

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.130
apps that have integration with
Drive in collaboration?

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:18.550
There seems to be efforts with
things like Dart and Go in

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:20.260
different languages and GWT--

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.360
there's rumors of
it going away.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:27.550
What's the sustainable path
I should be going down?

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:29.470
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: The APIs that
we are providing right

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:32.180
now, we are very committed
to continuing to support.

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:37.030
So if we've published an
API in your language--

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:39.620
you'll have to check in with our
developer relations people

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:42.980
to be sure what the exact time
horizon we promised to keep

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:46.780
them around in, but we're
following this path.

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:48.530
You have nothing to fear, sir.

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:51.000
AUDIENCE: No, I don't mean the
APIs itself, but as far as

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.260
providing like an app framework
that maybe gives me

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:57.420
things like menus, and dialogs,
and all the building

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:01.630
pieces so that I can just start
with a Hello, World! app

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:04.356
and build my specific
functionality.

00:41:04.356 --> 00:41:08.080
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Well, I don't
think that we have any

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.150
specific plans to provide a
larger kind of application

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:16.140
development framework, but the
developer sites have a ton of

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:19.040
extremely useful examples
that you can get into.

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:22.150
I think that part of our
philosophy has been, let's

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:27.140
keep our APIs compact so that
it's at your discretion how to

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.290
integrate them with the rest of
the tools you like to use.

00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:31.020
JOSH HUDGINS: We want to make
sure it's really easy for

00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:34.550
existing web apps to add small
footprint amounts of code and

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:37.080
integrate existing investments
with Drive.

00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.480
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Yeah, that's
something we really care about

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.010
is if you've already invested in
building an app, we want to

00:41:41.010 --> 00:41:43.250
make it as easy as possible
for you to add this

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:44.640
functionality in
and not have to

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.828
re-engineer your whole thing.

00:41:46.828 --> 00:41:47.724
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:41:47.724 --> 00:41:49.520
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Yeah.

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.530
AUDIENCE: One of the things you
mentioned as far as being

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:55.812
able to get data through Google
Docs like export to a

00:41:55.812 --> 00:41:59.280
PDF and then pull in like that
fax program, which they

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.180
mentioned in the talk
yesterday as well.

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.380
Say there's a third party app
that sorts [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:07.360
proprietary format, but can
also export to PDF or some

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:08.755
intermediate format.

00:42:08.755 --> 00:42:11.690
Is there some way you can say
like well, my app can accept

00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:14.560
things that can be exported to
PDF and this app can export to

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.450
PDF so allow me to
see any apps--

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:19.600
any documents that can possibly
be imported on an app

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:20.550
through that?

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:22.060
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: That's
a great idea.

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:23.105
That's--

00:42:23.105 --> 00:42:24.230
JOSH HUDGINS: We've thought
a lot about that.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.300
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: We have
thought a lot about that.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:29.420
So although, again, we're not
announcing any specific plan

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:32.630
to do that, consider your
suggestion duly noted.

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:33.566
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:33.566 --> 00:42:34.816
Thanks.

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:42.241
AUDIENCE: Cross-origin
requests.

00:42:42.241 --> 00:42:44.720
We've noticed that several
APIs don't return their

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:51.120
cross-origin header for star,
is that intentional or--?

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.570
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: I don't--

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:56.880
you mean APIs as called
from JavaScript?

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.740
AUDIENCE: Yes, we have an
application that has an

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:03.650
embedded one could view that
is trying to access some of

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:06.070
the REST APIs in Google Drive.

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:09.140
If that's happening, there's
some sort of buggy behavior

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.610
and you should talk to our
developer relations team

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:12.840
because they're telling
us that we

00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.190
absolutely do support that.

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:17.570
AUDIENCE: Oh OK, yeah, we
have some issues, so--

00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:19.380
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: OK, yeah, I
mean, the examples that I

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.520
showed you for the collaboration
API are making

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.470
CORS requests and
they're working.

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:23.920
AUDIENCE: For your site?

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:24.130
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Yeah.

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:24.810
AUDIENCE: OK, sure.

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:27.120
Thanks.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:30.550
AUDIENCE: So this is a little
bit more about Drive itself,

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:36.150
specifically enterprises
and teams and how

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:37.200
you're dealing with--

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.080
I want to share, or rather--

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:42.710
if I'm the CIO of an
organization, I want to know

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:47.630
all the files that are being
stored in my user's Google

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:49.300
Apps account.

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:52.240
Is that possible in Google Drive
in general, and then

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:55.060
also from the SDK and API?

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.330
JOSH HUDGINS: It's possible with
the API and there are a

00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:01.400
lot of really good third party
products that do exactly that

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.710
kind of thing, that help you
manage your enterprise-wide

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:06.400
corpora, and they'll give you
all kinds of nice data and

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.520
reports on what your user base
is doing and the traffic and

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.570
the types of documents and
that sort of thing.

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:14.170
Our general philosophy around
that is we want to give third

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:17.090
parties the ability to build
those exact kind of tools with

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:21.200
our API, and that's what a lot
of this new launch is about if

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.490
you have these much more
powerful file system type

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:25.480
operations that will enable
exactly those types of

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:26.080
integrations.

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.515
AUDIENCE: And sorry, just
as a follow-up.

00:44:27.515 --> 00:44:28.760
JOSH HUDGINS: Sure.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.960
AUDIENCE: For the permissions of
that, does each individual

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.440
user have to then enable the
app to have full access

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:38.140
permission, or is it done
similar to like the Apps

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:41.160
Marketplace where it can
just be applied to all

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.110
the users at once?

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:44.290
JOSH HUDGINS: Yeah, there are
like admin users that API

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:47.200
calls can [INAUDIBLE] and
that sort of thing.

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:49.820
It doesn't require like a lot
of specific user actions in

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.270
order to enable that
type of monitoring.

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:52.100
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:52.820
Great, thanks.

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:54.070
JOSH HUDGINS: Sure.

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.340
AUDIENCE: I was wondering, is
there any way to have data

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:02.520
locality like to do some
processing in the Drive?

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:05.300
Like I like being able to share
everything, but if I

00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:08.120
want to have some structured
files in the way that I'm used

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:11.340
to and I maybe need to run sed
or grep or something like

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.890
that, if I wanted to implement
it, is there any way to do

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:16.480
some processing next to those
files, or would it just be

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:20.120
that the user would say, oh, I
want to run such and such an

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:23.070
AWK command and I would
downloaded it from the web

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:26.680
service, process it, and then
write it back to the Drive?

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.500
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: That is
probably how you would want to

00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.930
do it, especially if you
wanted to do sort of a

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:34.120
massively parallel type thing.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.870
Although you might be interested
in looking at Apps

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:41.030
Script because Apps Script is
capable of doing a lot of the

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:45.330
same analyses that things like
AWK and grep can do, and that

00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:47.920
processing is done in the same
data center as the data, so

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.310
often you'll get good
performance without having to

00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:52.450
download the whole file.

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:53.150
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:54.400
Great.

00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:59.100
AUDIENCE: Two separate
questions.

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:02.810
The first question is on the
Chrome store, you were saying

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:04.610
that anybody can download
any of the apps.

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:07.670
Is there anyway to restrict
the access to those

00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:09.640
applications to a specific
corporation

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:10.890
or a specific domain?

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:14.870
JOSH HUDGINS: The only
granularity we have there now

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:19.520
is an individual domain can
either turn apps on or off.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:22.220
Being able to whitelist or
blacklist specific apps is

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:24.220
still something that's on our
road map that we're moving

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:26.750
towards, but as of right now we
can't give you that level

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.490
of granularity in terms
of configuration.

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:30.420
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: That's right,
you can't restrict the

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:34.030
ability to actually install
them, but then you can make

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:36.870
sure that they don't work
on your domain.

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:40.240
And also, if you're writing a
third party app that needs to

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:43.790
be constricted to a certain
group of users, there are

00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:46.230
Google APIs that will give you
enough information about the

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:48.660
user for you to do that
on your own app.

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:50.910
So it'll be a bit awkward if a
user does something that they

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:54.280
shouldn't do, but you have the
ability to shut out users that

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:54.970
shouldn't be there.

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:55.940
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:55.940 --> 00:46:58.480
And the second question is kind
of a follow-up to one of

00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.670
the previous people.

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:04.890
In one of the previous sessions
someone had mentioned

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:07.160
that you were coming out with
service account capability for

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.860
administrative access.

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:12.268
Is there any time frame on
the road map for that?

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:18.255
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: It is coming
out officially soon.

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:21.290
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:22.540
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Yeah.

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:28.090
AUDIENCE: It seems that you have
some overlap with some of

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:32.710
the features of Cloud Storage,
although it seems almost more

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:34.890
robust than Cloud Storage.

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:39.090
As a developer, should I look
towards using Cloud Storage

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:42.360
for higher performance
or for a task?

00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.730
I mean, have you benchmarked
it and checked out how it

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:48.425
compares performance-wise
against Cloud Storage?

00:47:48.425 --> 00:47:51.020
JOSH HUDGINS: Well, there's not
as many overlapping use

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:53.410
cases, I think, as
you would think.

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:56.300
We're trying to position Drive
to developers as a place you

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:57.310
want to store user data.

00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:00.010
If the data's user intermediated
in any way, it

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.850
makes more sense to put it there
than in Cloud Storage.

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:04.590
If you want to store assets
that aren't necessarily

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:07.130
related to individual users,
then Cloud Storage is the

00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:08.110
product you would want to use.

00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:10.310
They have a lot of similar
features, but the use cases, I

00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:11.440
think, are fairly different.

00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:13.710
AUDIENCE: We actually have an
application that serves user

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:17.240
data, and we use Cloud
Storage for that.

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:20.300
If I migrate to Drive, would I
get a performance hit on the

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:21.370
serving of the data?

00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:23.360
JOSH HUDGINS: They use very
similar back end systems.

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:26.560
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Yeah, I
mean, but they do serve

00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:31.920
different purposes in that like
Drive is really best for

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:34.710
file-centric data that you want
users to be able to see

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:35.710
and access anywhere.

00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:39.450
So if you care about having
sync clients that

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:41.600
automatically can sync data
to your user's machine or

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:44.960
devices, those kinds of features
in the built in

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:47.930
search probably make Google
Drive a good choice.

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:50.190
But if you're looking for
something that is more a pure

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:53.510
storage back end, then Cloud
Storage is a great choice.

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:55.870
JOSH HUDGINS: And the economics
of the two systems

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:58.710
are drastically different
because in Drive all of the

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:01.020
storage is accounted directly
to users, but if you use

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:02.950
Google Cloud Storage, developers
have to pay for the

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:05.140
storage directly, and if you're
doing that on behalf of

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:08.290
users, then you have to figure
out some way to pass the cost

00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:10.190
of your storage onto
individual users.

00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:13.150
So if it is user intermediated
in any way, it probably makes

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:14.910
more sense to have
it in Drive.

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:18.100
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:20.850
AUDIENCE: With the new
Collaboration APIs, will that

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:25.130
support the offline
type capabilities?

00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:27.460
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Yes, there
will be offline.

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.940
We are still trying to figure
out whether or not we're going

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:33.130
to handle offline automatically,
or if we'll

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:36.190
give you the ability to get a
version of the data model that

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:39.040
you can flush offline instead.

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.590
So if anyone wants to tell me
suggestions about why you

00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:43.520
prefer one mode or the other,
I'd love to hear them.

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:44.890
Because that's still
up in the air.

00:49:44.890 --> 00:49:45.180
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:46.970
JOSH HUDGINS: Yeah.

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:49.470
AUDIENCE: So along that lines,
in the segue of version

00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:52.070
control, do you have any roadmap
plans for how you plan

00:49:52.070 --> 00:49:55.910
on integrating previous versions
of documents being

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:58.680
released into a changed
management system?

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:00.050
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Are you
talking about for

00:50:00.050 --> 00:50:02.960
Collaboration API or for
Drive in general?

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.920
AUDIENCE: Drive in general, I
guess, but also in terms of

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.740
how it might affect API.

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:09.810
JOHN DAY-RICHTER:
Well, let's see.

00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:13.660
For Drive, when you upload a
file, you can choose to--

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:16.920
you're always uploading a new
revision of the file.

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:20.760
And then you have the ability
to say that this is a pinned

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:23.730
revision, and so that revision
is guaranteed not to get

00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:25.480
cleaned up.

00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:29.680
If you upload a revision that
you choose not to pin, it

00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:32.640
means that later revisions might
cause earlier revisions

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:35.000
to get deleted if they're ones
that you didn't care about.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.940
But history is kind
of built right in

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:38.600
when blobs are uploaded.

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.970
AUDIENCE: So on the question
where they had the offline and

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:45.750
they demoed in the keynote
the changes made

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:46.590
automatically applied.

00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:48.460
How does it affect--

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:52.010
is it time stamped for
clobbering other users'

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:53.220
offline versions?

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:55.370
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: In his
particular demo, he used

00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:57.860
Google Docs, and Google Docs
uses something like the

00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:03.110
Collaboration API, so that
stored the data in a temporary

00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:06.050
browser cache, and then it used
the same protocol that it

00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:08.640
uses to sync in real time
to get all those

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:09.940
things back into sync.

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:14.150
So Google Docs and the
Collaboration API are very

00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:16.910
tightly revisioned, so almost
everything you do gets a

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:18.882
revision in a history log.

00:51:18.882 --> 00:51:19.380
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:22.320
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Yeah

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:24.240
AUDIENCE: I really liked the
demo earlier in the keynote

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:27.220
and searching inside
your image files.

00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:30.790
You guys have any plans of
indexing and searching custom

00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:33.880
formats delivered by the apps?

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:35.760
JOSH HUDGINS: So what we do
right now is we expose through

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:38.040
the API the ability
for you to set the

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:40.050
indexable text yourself.

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:42.780
So whatever you feel like is
important to allow users to

00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:45.050
search for within your data, you
can pass that directly to

00:51:45.050 --> 00:51:47.950
Drive via the API and then when
users search for things

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:50.090
in that body of text, they'll
show up directly in the UI

00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:50.890
under search.

00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:54.310
AUDIENCE: Does this include also
searching from the API?

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:55.560
JOSH HUDGINS: Yeah.

00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:01.850
AUDIENCE: So say I'm building
a voting application and I

00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:05.290
want people to vote between
carrot sticks and cookies.

00:52:05.290 --> 00:52:08.110
And I share my ballot with
Cookie Monster, and Cookie

00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:10.790
Monster is a pretty
savvy programmer.

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:14.300
What's to prevent Cookie Monster
from using the RESTful

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:18.000
APIs to vote for cookies
2,000 times.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.010
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Well, nothing
because Cookie Monster

00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:22.650
was given a very high level of
access to that document.

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:28.550
So I suggest that in a situation
where you need to

00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:33.670
really have more granular
control of how data is

00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:37.210
written, that you don't
want to use the

00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:38.420
Google Doc sharing model.

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:43.210
Because there's no write-only
access to a doc really.

00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:45.650
I guess you could use forms
for something like that.

00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:48.310
But the point is if you want
to expose things to Sesame

00:52:48.310 --> 00:52:50.630
Street characters and in this
very volatile political

00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:55.510
context, I suggest that you
build a strongly authenticated

00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:57.700
front end and write to a back
end where there's no direct

00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:58.690
user access at all.

00:52:58.690 --> 00:52:59.151
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:52:59.151 --> 00:53:01.920
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Yeah.

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.260
AUDIENCE: So there's a natural,
I guess match,

00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:07.630
between Docs and Drive.

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:10.230
And I think your Docs files

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:11.820
automatically show up in Drive.

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:12.590
JOSH HUDGINS: Right.

00:53:12.590 --> 00:53:17.000
AUDIENCE: What about Contacts
and Calendar, is that--

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.020
I don't know if they show
up automatically, I

00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:20.230
don't think they do--

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:22.040
and what is the plan for that?

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:25.060
Because I don't want to write
some sync client that maybe

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:27.600
shows these things up in the
thing when Google is going to

00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:30.310
be releasing that
relatively soon.

00:53:30.310 --> 00:53:33.480
JOSH HUDGINS: Contacts and
Calendar events will stay in

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:36.670
their own product data silos,
we're not going to attempt to

00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:37.500
surface those in Drive.

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:40.850
We do have some plans around
other types of internal

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:43.200
product integrations, but those
are still pretty far

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:44.390
down the roadmap list.

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:47.050
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: But if you
want to write that app, you

00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:48.340
have all the tools you
need to do it.

00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:51.670
It's possible to just write
short cuts into Google Drive

00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:54.550
that when clicked go out to your
site, where then you can

00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:57.610
fetch whatever other Google
entity you want and show it

00:53:57.610 --> 00:53:59.080
using their APIs.

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:03.856
So yeah, go start yourself a
million dollar business, sir.

00:54:03.856 --> 00:54:04.750
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:06.010
Well, I already have, but.

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:07.660
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Oh.

00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:08.910
Can I have some?

00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:13.430
Yes, sir?

00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:15.480
AUDIENCE: Just thinking about
the sharing and also

00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:18.630
notifications, is there any
plans to kind of [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:22.010
share and could do like a
workflow, sort of route a

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:24.970
document to Person A, if they
approve it, it's going to

00:54:24.970 --> 00:54:28.480
route to Person B, and they'll
get some kind of notification

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.620
of the sharing.

00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:31.410
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: Well,
we don't have anything

00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:33.470
like that right now.

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:35.660
JOSH HUDGINS: So you have a
couple different options.

00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:38.440
We are linking more and more
actions that occur in Drive

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:40.745
into wiring them into our
scripting language, Apps

00:54:40.745 --> 00:54:43.170
Script, so you could build
a custom workflow

00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:44.350
solution that way.

00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:46.600
And then we're giving you a
whole lot of tools via the

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:49.000
same events and with the
API, so you can--

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.350
like via the notifications that
we were talking about you

00:54:51.350 --> 00:54:53.020
can monitor for certain events,
you'll get push

00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:55.870
notifications that can perform
actions using the API.

00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:58.290
So a lot of ways to build a
custom workflow solution, but

00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:00.540
we're not going to overlay that
type of functionality

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:01.840
directly in the product
itself.

00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:02.332
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:04.300
Thank you.

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:06.400
JOHN DAY-RICHTER: And
we are over time.

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.570
So thank you so much
for coming, and

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:09.440
T-shirts are in the back.

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:13.747
[APPLAUSE]
