00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.380
 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.090
Hello.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.650
I'm Terry Fisher.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.920
This is the ninth of 12
lectures on copyright.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.410
In the seventh and eighth lectures,
I described the four economic rights

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.730
enjoyed by the copyright owner, the
rights of reproduction, modification,

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.330
distribution, and public performance.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.870
Along the way, I identified several
specific exceptions and limitations.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.680
Each of which narrows the reach of
one of those four economic rights.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.760
In addition to the specific
exceptions that we considered there,

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.910
there are in the United
States two general limitations

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.739
on copyright entitlements.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.490
In other words, limitations
that are applicable to all four

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.220
of the economic rights.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.780
These are the doctrines of
fair use and copyright misuse.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.300
Of the two, fair use is
by far the more important,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.330
so I will concentrate exclusively
on it in this lecture.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.400
If you're curious
about copyright misuse,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.880
you can, of course, explore on
your own the pertinent branch

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.930
of the map of copyright law
that accompanies this lecture.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.950
Here's how my presentation
will be organized.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.080
In the first segment
of the lecture, I will

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.250
describe the history of the fair
use doctrine in the United States.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.810
In the second segment, I will describe
the shape of the fair use doctrine

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.220
today, illustrating my
analysis with examples

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.380
drawn from several modern cases.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.750
In the third and final
segment, I will describe

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.720
how some countries other
than the United States

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.480
attempt to deal with the
issues that in this country

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.290
are addressed using fair use.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.090
My hope is that, by the
end, you'll not only

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.860
have a sense of how the fair use
doctrine works, but also its merits

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.010
and demerits, and how it stacks up
against alternative approaches employed

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.835
by other countries.

00:02:20.835 --> 00:02:21.460
So let's begin.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.990
 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.810
The seeds of what would become the
fair use doctrine in the United States

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.740
were planted in English law
beginning in the mid 18th century.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.710
Then, in the case of Folsom
vs. Marsh, just a story

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.880
relied in part on the
English precedents to hold

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.190
that some activities inconsistent
with the US federal copyright statute

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.220
nevertheless constituted "Fair
and bona fide abridgments"

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:59.270
or "Justifiable uses," and therefore
did not give rise to liability.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.240
The language in which just his story
purported to distill English cases

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.580
was to prove as we'll see influential.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.310
Here's how he put it.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.520
In deciding whether to
excuse a particular use,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.330
one should look to the nature and
objects of the selections made,

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.670
the quantity and value
of the materials used,

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.250
and the degree in which the
use may prejudice the sale,

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.880
or diminish the profits, or supersede
the objects of the original work.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.690
 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.630
In several other US cases in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries,

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.100
federal courts followed
Folsom in excusing

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.540
as fair various activities that appeared
to run afoul of the copyright statute.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.570
In these early decisions, the question
of what constituted a fair use

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.530
was not crisply
differentiated from the issue

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.010
of whether the defendant's
behavior abridged

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.850
the plaintiff's exclusive rights.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.560
But by the middle of the 20th
century, courts in the US

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.370
had begun consistently
to refer to the concept

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.780
of Fair Use as a distinct legal issue.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.800
Specifically, as an affirmative defense
excusing otherwise unlawful conduct.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.870
 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.070
For most of its history, fair use
was an entirely judge made doctrine.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.730
That changed in 1976 when Congress
revamped the copyright statute,

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.230
it acknowledged and approved
the line of judicial decisions

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.530
that had created fair use, and
Congress codified those decisions

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.790
in Section 107 of the
reconstructed copyright statute.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.660
When codifying fair use
however, Congress made explicit,

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.160
but it did not intend to
"freeze" the doctrine.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.750
But rather expected it to continue
to evolve particularly in order

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:05.680
to accommodate "rapid
technological change."

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.510
The text of Section 107 is
set forth on your screen.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.980
As you can see it has three parts.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.660
The first maybe thought of
as a general introduction.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.340
It provides "Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 106 and 106a,

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.900
the fair use of a copyrighted work
including such use by reproduction

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.630
in copies or phonorecords for
purposes such as criticism, comment,

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.260
news reporting, teaching,
scholarship, or research

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.780
is not an infringement of copyright."

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.490
The most important words in this portion
of the provision are the first eight.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.430
As you can see, they make clear
that Section 107 qualifies

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.070
all of the exclusive rights
enjoyed by a copyright owner,

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.775
including the Visual Artists Rights
Act, which is embodied in Section 106a.

00:05:55.775 --> 00:05:58.730
 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.400
The middle portion of this
introductory paragraph

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.345
appears also to be
important because it seems

00:06:04.345 --> 00:06:07.770
to identify a set of activities that
are especially eligible for treatment

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.640
as fair uses.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.690
As we will see, however,
the courts have not

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:17.120
given this list of illustrative
activities much weight.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.940
The heart of Section
107 to which the courts

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.310
have given a great deal of
weight is the middle portion.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.740
"In determining whether the use made
of a work in any particular case

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.380
is a fair use, the
factors to be considered

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.390
shall include-- One-- the
purpose and character of the use.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:37.200
Two-- the nature of
the copyrighted work.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.360
Three-- the substantially
of the portion used.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.040
And four-- the effect of the
use upon the potential market

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.790
for the copyrighted work."

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:53.210
Several dimensions of this
paragraph merit emphasis.

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.230
Most importantly, fair
use, as you can see,

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:59.790
is an ad hoc case specific doctrine.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:04.840
It is applied on a case by case basis by
considering the four factors set forth

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.690
on the right side of your screen.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.100
No one of these factors
is determinative,

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.100
nor is the list of
factors exhaustive as one

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.910
can tell by the use of
the verb shall include.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:20.250
 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:25.840
The third segment of Section
107 can be thought of as a coda.

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.500
"The fact of the work is
unpublished shall not itself

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.190
bar a finding of fair use if such
findings made upon consideration

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.100
of all of the above factors."

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.930
This provision was added later.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.480
Its purpose was to repudiate some
decisions by the Court of Appeals

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.230
for the Second Circuit
that had sharply limited

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:48.630
the availability of the fair
use doctrine for biographers

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:53.730
who quoted in their works, unpublished
letters, diaries, and so forth.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.480
The coda does not grant the
biographers an unqualified privilege

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.630
to use such things, but it
reduces the height of the hurdle

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.360
that biographers must clear.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.290
 

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:09.350
Since the adoption of Section
107, the fair use doctrine

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.860
has been construed and applied four
times by the United States Supreme

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.220
Court.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:18.760
In three of those four cases, the
court's analysis was elaborate.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.910
In the remaining portion of
this segment of the lecture,

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:26.170
I'll describe the three major cases, the
way in which the Supreme Court resolved

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:30.640
them, and how, as a result, the
fair use doctrine has evolved.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.720
The first of the three
decisions was Sony Corporation

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:41.140
vs. Universal City Studios--
popularly known as the Betamax case.

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.500
Here's some background.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.970
The chart set forth on your screen
should by now be familiar to you.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:51.020
It describes the legal
relationships and business models

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.310
and gives shape to the film
industry in the United States.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.700
If any portion of this
diagram is puzzling,

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.870
you should review the pertinent
section of lecture number three.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.760
In the 1970s, a significant
portion of the revenues

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.720
upon which the film studios depended
came from this segment of the industry.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.220
Specifically, the
license fees the studios

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:16.870
derived from television networks.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.910
Those fees were generated as follows.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:23.670
You'll recall from the preceding lecture
that the US film studios traditionally

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:28.710
relied on a so-called windowing
system to maximize revenue

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:33.390
they were able to extract from a
heterogeneous group of customers.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:38.330
We're concerned here with the seventh
of the eight traditional windows.

00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:42.080
Roughly two years after a film
was first released in US theaters,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.150
the studio would typically license
it to a television network.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:51.750
The network would remove material
inappropriate for general audiences,

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.880
and divide the film into roughly
10 minute segments inserting

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.230
advertisements in
between those segments.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:03.980
This composite would then be
broadcast to the network's viewers.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.230
The viewers would not pay either the
networks or the studios directly.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.790
Instead, they would
purchase, or so it was

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:16.090
thought, more of the products that were
advertised in the course of the film.

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.730
The advertisers paid a portion
of their increased revenue

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:22.410
to the television networks in
the form of advertising fees,

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.320
and the networks in turn
paid a portion of those fees

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.950
to the studios thus closing the loop.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.800
This system has been running
well for several decades.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.040
Then in the late 1970s,
the Sony Corporation

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.310
disrupted it by offering
consumers, for the first time,

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:47.300
affordable and convenient
videocassette recorders known as VCRs.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.370
Sony sold these machines
to a rapidly growing set

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:55.020
of consumers receiving in
return substantial revenue.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:00.450
I know because I bought one
in 1983 and it wasn't cheap.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.730
One of the functions
of these recorders was

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:06.580
to enable consumers to make copies of
the films broadcast by the television

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.672
networks.

00:11:07.672 --> 00:11:09.630
Now you might think that
this development would

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:13.570
please the networks and the studios
because the markets for their shows

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.060
and films would grow.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:20.170
But the studios, as it turned out,
were more worried about the likelihood

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.170
that viewers would use
their new VCRs to avoid

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:26.740
watching the embedded advertisements.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:31.250
The simple way of doing this was by fast
forwarding through those advertisements

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:35.540
during the playback of the
tapes-- a technique still commonly

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:40.710
employed by viewers using
more modern technologies.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.980
A more complex way of avoiding
of avoiding the advertisements

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.790
was to designate a member of the
family to watch a program when

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:52.110
it was broadcast live, and to pause
the recording whenever advertisements

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.060
appeared, thus enabling the
other members of the family

00:11:55.060 --> 00:12:00.130
to watch the tape later to avoid
seeing the advertisements altogether.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.080
Advertisers fearing
this effect threatened

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.040
to reduce the fees
they paid the networks.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.010
The networks in turn
threatened to reduce

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.815
the license fees they paid the studios.

00:12:09.815 --> 00:12:12.380
 

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.530
Two of the studios,
Disney and Universal,

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.410
decided to try to stop this threat.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.120
How?

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.160
In theory, they could have
pursued individual VCR

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.830
users for copyright infringement.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:30.450
As you know by now, making a
verbatim copy of an audio-visual work

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.810
violates Section 106.1 of the statute.

00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.780
That's what the viewers were
doing with their new machines.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:41.380
So the studios could have brought
infringement suits against the viewers.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.670
They did not for two reasons.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:47.380
First, there were too many viewers
to make this strategy effective.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.940
Individual lawsuits would have
been hopelessly impractical.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:55.200
Second, the studios did not wish
to alienate their customers.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.710
So instead, they brought
an infringement action

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.280
against Sony, the
manufacturer of the machines

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.010
that made this conduct possible.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:07.060
Now Sony was not making
any copies of any film.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.080
So the studios were unable to
assert that Sony was itself

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.100
violating section 106.1 of the statute.

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:18.060
Instead, the studios asserted that Sony
was engaged in contributory copyright

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:21.850
infringement by
facilitating and encouraging

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:25.670
the unlawful behavior of the viewers.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.740
The lawsuit percolated
slowly up through the courts.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.130
The trial court found in favor of Sony.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:33.100
The ninth circuit reversed.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.380
And finally in 1984, the
United States Supreme Court

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:40.980
decided by a vote of
five to four with Sony,

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:46.320
ruling that it had not engaged in
contributory copyright infringement.

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:50.740
The court's ruling depended
upon two nested propositions

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.080
which are listed on your screen.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.170
First, the manufacture
of a device that can

00:13:56.170 --> 00:14:01.060
be used to violate the copyright laws
is liable for contributory infringement

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:08.900
only if that device is not "capable
of substantial noninfringing uses."

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:16.340
Second, timeshifting copyrighted
programs is a fair use.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.420
The first of these two
propositions has had a major effect

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.220
on the law governing the doctrine of
contributory copyright infringement.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:26.040
We will return to this
aspect of the Betamax case

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.470
when we examine
contributory infringement

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:33.130
doctrine in the 11th
lecture in the series.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:37.340
For now, our focus is on the
second of the propositions.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:42.160
Here's a bit more detail
concerning its underpinnings.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.530
The majority of The
Supreme Court pointed out

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:49.020
that VCRs are commonly used for
two quite different purposes.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:53.380
First, they're sometimes
used for "libraring",

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.800
a term the courts invented
to describe taping

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:01.810
broadcast television shows or films with
an expectation of retaining the tapes

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:06.650
and using them to replay the
shows or films repeatedly.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:12.550
That activity is tacitly
promoted by this advertisement.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:16.170
Second, VCRs are even
more often employed

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:19.430
to tape shows or films that are
broadcast at a time inconvenient

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:24.100
for the viewer, enabling the viewer
to watch them once at a later time,

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.610
whereupon the tapes are erased.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:30.800
The latter function, promoted
by this advertisement,

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.540
the court described as "timeshifting".

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:38.440
Because time shifting is a common use
of the machines, if it were lawful,

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.040
Sony could escape liability under
the first of the two holdings.

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.170
And the court decided that
timeshifting was indeed

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:51.510
lawful because it qualified as a fair
use under Section 107 of the statute.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:56.220
And therefore, Sony was home free.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:59.630
To support its judgment
on this issue, the court

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:04.010
surveyed the four
statutory fair use factors.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:07.100
With respect to the
first factor, the court

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.920
emphasized the fact that the
behavior of the VCR users

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:15.770
was in the court's judgment
noncommercial in character.

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:19.840
Here's how Justice Stevens writing
for the court put the point.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.780
Although not conclusive,
the first factor

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:27.820
requires that the commercial or
nonprofit character of an activity

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:31.100
be weighed in any fair use decision.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.340
If the Betamax were used to make copies
for a commercial or profit making

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:40.220
purpose, such use would
be presumptively unfair.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.640
The contrary presumption is
appropriate here, however,

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.850
because the district
court's findings plainly

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:49.970
establish that timeshifting
for private home use

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:54.180
must be characterized as a
noncommercial, nonprofit activity.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.390
 

00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:01.370
Interestingly, Stevens did
not mention in his opinion

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:05.500
the second statutory factor-- the
nature of the copyrighted work,

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.660
so we'll leave that box blank.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.599
The third factor-- the
amount of copying--

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:16.640
would seem to disfavor of finding a
fair use, insofar as the VCR users

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:20.560
were making verbatim copies
of entire shows or films.

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:23.690
"Nevertheless, the court ruled
that in light of the fact

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.250
that timeshifting
merely enables a viewer

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:29.910
to see such a work which he had been
invited to witness in its entirety

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:33.740
free of charge, the fact that
the entire work is reproduced

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.630
does not have its ordinary
effect of militating

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.790
against the finding of fair use."

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:46.840
The court thus implied that
this third factor was neutral.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.260
The decisive factor in
the court's judgment

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:53.530
was the fourth-- the magnitude
of the adverse impact

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:58.240
upon the potential market
for the studio's films.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.590
In the court's judgment,
the noncommercial character

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.860
of the viewer's activities
cast the burden of proof

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.640
with respect to this
factor upon the studios.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:11.220
Here's how it put the point.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.170
"A challenge to a noncommercial
use of a copyrighted work

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:19.810
requires proof either that
the particular use is harmful.

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.610
Or that, if it should
become widespread, it

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:26.810
would adversely affect the potential
market for the copyrighted work.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:30.070
Actual present harm need
not be shown, nor is it

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:33.570
necessary to show as certainty
that future harm will result.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:37.990
What is necessary is that showing
by preponderance of the evidence

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:45.680
that some meaningful likelihood
of future harm exists."

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:51.700
In the court's view, the record in the
case-- which had been created in 1978--

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:57.910
failed to establish a likelihood
of economic injury to the studios.

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:00.420
Accordingly, the court
ruled that the fourth factor

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:05.940
inclined in favor of
a finding of fair use.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:09.510
Finally, the court pointed
to a variable not included

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.630
in the statutory list of factors.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.120
"The district court's
conclusions are buttressed

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.860
by the fact that to the
extent time shipping

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.970
expands public access to freely
broadcast television programs,

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:27.420
it yields societal benefits."

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.170
Taking all these variables
into account, the Supreme Court

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.220
affirmed the district court's
judgment that timeshifting

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.630
should be considered fair.

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.200
 

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.420
Justice Blackmun wrote
a dissent in the case,

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.950
which was joined by
three other justices.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:48.840
Blackmun disagreed with the majority
of the justices on two main points.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.310
First, drawing on the
Ninth Circuit's opinion,

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:57.740
he differentiated what he called
ordinary and productive uses

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.050
of copyrighted materials.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.720
Suggesting that the latter--
meaning productive uses--

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.940
are more likely to qualify
as fair than the former.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:11.240
Here's how Blackmun made his argument.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.950
"The situations in which fair
use is most commonly recognized

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.540
are listed in section 107 itself.

00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:20.040
Fair use may be found when a work is
used for purposes such as criticism,

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:24.650
comment, news reporting, teaching,
scholarship, or research.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:27.590
Each of these uses
reflects a common theme.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:31.520
Each is a productive use resulting
in some added benefit to the public

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:35.030
beyond that produced by
the first author's work.

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.320
The fair use doctrine,
in other words, permits

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.660
works to be used for
socially laudable purposes.

00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.530
I am aware of no case in which
the reproduction of a copyrighted

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:51.660
work for the sole benefit of the
user has been held to be fair use."

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.590
Second, Blackmun interpreted
the fourth statutory factor

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:59.660
more expansively than did the majority.

00:20:59.660 --> 00:21:06.290
Specifically, Blackmun emphasized the
adjective potential in the statute.

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:09.910
Here's how he interpreted that word.

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:14.040
"The requirement that a putatively
infringing use of the copyrighted work

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:18.810
to be fair must not impair a
potential market for that work

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.680
has two implications.

00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.570
First, and infringer cannot prevail
merely by demonstrating that

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:28.550
the copyright holder suffered no net
harm from the infringer's action.

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:31.400
Indeed, even the showing that
the infringement has resulted it

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.670
in a net benefit to the copyright
holder will not suffice.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:39.030
Rather, the infringer must
demonstrate that he had not

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:43.800
impaired the copyright holder's
ability to demand compensation from,

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.650
or to deny access to any
group who would otherwise

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:51.460
be willing to pay to see or
hear the copyrighted work.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:55.040
Second, the fact that a given
market for a copyrighted work

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.100
would not be available
to the copyright holder

00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:01.260
were it not for the infringer's
activities does not permit infringer

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:07.470
to exploit that market without
compensating the copyright holder."

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:12.210
Applying this definition of potential
market to the facts of the case,

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:15.820
Blackmun concluded that the
needle tilted toward the studios.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:19.980
And so far as a finding of fair
use, we deprive them of access

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:23.990
to the "market consisting
of those persons who

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:27.870
find it impossible or inconvenient
to watch the programs at the time

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:31.360
they are broadcast, and who wish
to watch them at other times.

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.950
These persons are willing to pay for the
privilege of watching the copyrighted

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:41.230
work at their convenience
as is evidenced by the fact

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:45.000
that they are willing to
pay for VTRs and tapes.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.440
Undoubtedly, most also would be
willing to pay some kind of loyalty

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.660
to copyright holders.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.750
The studios correctly argue that
they've been deprived of the ability

00:22:55.750 --> 00:23:01.630
to exploit this sizable market."

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.730
A majority of the justices, as
you've seen, were unconvinced.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.540
 

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:11.080
In the many briefs filed
with the Supreme Court--

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.870
and in associated
congressional testimony which

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:16.770
was being conducted at more
or less the same time--

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:20.050
the studios and their allies
predicted dire consequences

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.960
if Sony escaped liability.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:28.580
Most lurid was a statement by Jack
Valenti, the president of the MPAA

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:31.970
whom you encountered
in lecture number six.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:36.860
Valenti famously declared, "The
VCR is to the American film

00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:41.470
producer and the American public as the
Boston Strangler is to the woman home

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:44.520
alone."

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:49.030
As it turned out, the result of the
court's decision was not so dire.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:53.050
Indeed, the film industry seems to
have benefited from the machines.

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:56.280
Box office revenues
did not seem to suffer.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.040
Even more dramatically, the
widespread distribution of VCRs

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:03.410
made possible the emergence of
a new and even more lucrative

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:06.850
market consisting of home
video rentals and purchases.

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:09.670
 

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.470
While the courts were dealing
with the Betamax case,

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:17.190
a second major dispute implicating
the fair use doctrine was brewing.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:19.580
The facts were very different.

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:23.360
In the late 1970s, former
President Gerald Ford

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:28.470
with a substantial assistance of a
ghost writer wrote an autobiography.

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:31.750
He assigned the copyright in
the book to Harper and Row

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.920
in return for a substantial payment.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.010
In 1979 Harper and Row
entered into a contract

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:42.670
with Time Magazine, under which Time
acquired the right to publish excerpts

00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:46.800
from the book just before the
publication of the book itself.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.690
Unfortunately for Time, The
Nation Magazine scooped it.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:52.270
Here's how.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:56.080
A few weeks before the
Time article was to appear,

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.710
an unknown person provided
a copy of the manuscript

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:03.320
to Victor Navaski, who was
then editor of The Nation.

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.980
Navaski hastily drafted an
article describing the book.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:13.650
Included in that article were some 300
words taken from Ford's manuscript.

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:16.360
When The Nation's story
appeared, Time Magazine

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.360
canceled its contract
with Harper and Row,

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.320
and refused to pay the
balance of the contract price.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:24.710
Harper and Row thereupon brought
a copyright infringement suit

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:28.170
against The Nation.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:31.830
Once again, the parties traded victories
as the case wound its way upward

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:34.160
through the judicial system.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:38.110
The district court ruled in favor of
Harper and Row by a vote of two to one.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.880
Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit reversed,

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:44.190
ruling that the modest amount of
verbatim copying made by The Nation

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:46.620
should be excused as fair.

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:50.700
The Court of Appeals ruling was in turn
reversed by the United States Supreme

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:54.940
Court by a vote of six to three.

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:58.020
Justice O'Connor, writing
for the court, concluded

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:03.830
that all four of the fair use factors
tilted in favor of the plaintiff.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:08.000
With respect to the first factor, she
emphasized the following two points.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.180
First, the defendant was making
money from the unauthorized use.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:17.100
The Betamax opinion, you'll
recall, had included the sentence,

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.460
"Every commercial use
of copyrighted material

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:24.770
is presumptively an unfair
exploitation of a monopoly privilege

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:28.090
that belongs to the owner of copyright."

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:31.030
That presumption,
O'Connor ruled, operated

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:33.850
to the disadvantage
of the defendant here

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:38.710
because he was engaged in
a profit making venture.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:42.300
Second, O'Connor
stressed the illicit way

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:46.760
in which Navaski had gained access
to the plaintiff's manuscript.

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:49.980
This was germane, she
contended, because one dimension

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.860
of the "character" of
the defendant's use

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:58.180
is "the propriety of the
defendant's conduct."

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:02.460
Fair use, she insisted, presupposes
good faith and fair dealing.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.220
With respect to the
second statutory factor,

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:10.910
O'Connor conceded that "the law
generally recognizes a greater need

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:16.100
to disseminate factual works than
works of fiction or fantasy."

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.090
However, she concluded
that the quotations

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:25.630
Navaski had taken from Ford's manuscript
were more expressive than factual.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:28.080
Even more important was the
fact that the manuscript

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:33.440
had been unpublished at the time
the defendant acted, and thus

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.405
economically especially vulnerable.

00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:39.810
With respect to the
third factor, O'Connor

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:45.880
ruled that the assessment of amount must
be as much qualitative as quantitative.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:49.200
The fact that Navaski had
only taken some 300 words

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:54.020
was less important than the fact that
the portion taken was "essentially

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:57.980
the heart of the book,"
including the precise language

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:04.550
in which Ford explained his
decision to pardon Richard Nixon.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.840
Like the court in the
Betamax case, O'Connor

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.540
placed greatest weight on
the fourth and final factor.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:14.440
But she defined the phrase "potential
market" in the fourth factor

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:19.580
more broadly than had just
Stevens in the Betamax case.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:23.410
Citing Justice Blackmun's
Betamax dissent,

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:27.580
O'Connor ruled that "to
negate fair use, one

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:32.450
need only show that if the challenged
use should become widespread,

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:36.970
it would adversely affect the potential
market for the copyrighted work.

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:41.740
This inquiry must take into account
not only harm to the original,

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:46.570
but harm to the market
for derivative works."

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:49.360
Application of that framework
to the facts of this case

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.500
plainly favored the
plaintiff, she ruled,

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:56.440
because Time Magazine's decision to
cancel the contract with Harper and Row

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:59.780
cost it significant revenue.

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.745
The bottom line is the
fair use defense failed.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:09.820
The third of the three cases
arrived in the Supreme Court

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.000
almost a decade later.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.590
Where as the Betamax case, as we
saw, involved audio-visual works,

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:18.370
and the Harper and Row case
involved literary works,

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:20.650
this one involved music.

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:24.830
The plaintiff was Acuff-Rose
Music, a music publisher

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:28.960
that held the copyright in the
composition, "Oh, Pretty Woman",

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:35.080
originally written by Roy Orbison, the
person who is depicted on your screen.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:40.028
Here's an excerpt of Orbison's
rendition of his composition.

00:29:40.028 --> 00:29:44.012
[MUSIC ROY ORBISON, "OH, PRETTY WOMAN"]

00:29:44.012 --> 00:30:23.940
 

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:30.510
In 1989, Luther Campbell, one of the
members of the rap group, 2 Live Crew,

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:35.600
wrote a song that he characterized
as a parody of Orbison's composition.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:40.180
Here's an excerpt of 2 Live Crew's
rendition of Campbell's song.

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:43.610
[MUSIC -- 2 LIVE CREW, "PRETTY WOMAN"]

00:30:43.610 --> 00:31:39.100
 

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:43.610
Before this recording was released,
the manager of 2 Live Crew

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:47.680
sought a license from
Acuff-Rose, but was refused.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.950
2 Live Crew released
the recording anyway.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:55.160
A year later, after roughly
200,000 copies have been sold,

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:59.380
Acuff-Rose brought a
copyright infringement suit.

00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:03.200
Now you might wonder why 2 Live Crew
did not rely upon the Section 115

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.989
so-called cover license that
we've discussed previously,

00:32:06.989 --> 00:32:10.030
which would have allowed them to
release the recording without permission

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:13.170
provided they paid
Acuff-Rose a modest fee which

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:15.900
they seemed to have been going to do.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.950
The reason is that, as
you'll recall, I hope,

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:22.360
the Section 115 license is
only available to a musician

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:26.410
who makes a cover that does
not alter "the basic melody

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:30.960
or fundamental character"
of the composition at issue.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.270
2 Live Crew, as you
might expect, conceded

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:37.020
that they could not
satisfy that requirement.

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:41.620
As a result, the only basis on which 2
Live Crew might have avoided liability

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:43.890
was fair use.

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:47.660
Once again, the courts that
consider the case split.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:52.150
The trial court ruled that 2 Live Crew
was shielded by the fair use doctrine.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:55.170
The Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit reversed by a vote of two

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:58.700
to one, and the United
States Supreme Court in turn

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:03.680
reversed the Court of Appeals,
this time in a unanimous opinion.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.100
Although technically, the
Supreme Court remanded the case

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:10.770
for further proceedings, its
ruling was widely and rightly

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:15.540
interpreted as a
victory for 2 Live Crew.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:18.110
Although Justice Souter,
writing for the court,

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:22.010
purported to merely be applying
well settled principles.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:25.910
In fact, his opinion represented
a substantial reconfiguration

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:29.000
of the fair use doctrine.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.280
The most important of the shifts
implicit, in Souter's opinion,

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.940
concerned factor number one.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:40.350
You'll recall that in the Betamax
case, Justice Blackmun, in dissent,

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:45.240
had differentiated ordinary from
productive uses of copyrighted works,

00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:50.160
arguing unsuccessfully that the
latter deserved wider latitude when

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.240
applying the fair use doctrine.

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:57.780
And Campbell, just as Souter,
tacitly adopted Blackmun's position.

00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:01.630
The crucial language is on your screen.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:04.820
"The first factor in a fair use
inquiry is the purpose and character

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:05.910
of the use.

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.840
The central purpose
of this investigation

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.010
is to see, in Justice Story's
words, whether the new work merely

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.639
supersedes the objects
of the original creation.

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:19.940
Or instead adds something new with a
further purpose or different character,

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:24.570
altering the first with new
expression, meaning, or message.

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:29.400
It asks, in other words, whether
and to what extent the new work is

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:34.170
'transformative.' Although such
transformative use is not absolutely

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:38.080
necessary for a finding
of fair use," citing Sony,

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:42.610
"the goal of copyright is to promote
science and the arts in that goal is

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:46.969
generally furthered by the
creation of transformative works.

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:50.830
Such works thus lie at the
heart of the fair use doctrine

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:56.659
to guarantee of breathing space within
the confines of copyright," citing

00:34:56.659 --> 00:35:01.330
Blackmun, "and the more
transformative the new work, the less

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:04.910
will be the significance of
other factors like commercialism

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:09.860
that may weigh against
a finding of fair use."

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:13.080
The principles set forth in
this paragraph, as we will see,

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:17.250
have colored all subsequent
fair use jurisprudence.

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.820
Applying this approach to the
facts of the Campbell case,

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:23.230
the Supreme Court
announced broadly "parody

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:28.520
is an obvious claim to
transformative value."

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.240
What then constitutes a parody?

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:36.520
The court offered several
definitions, including the following.

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:40.320
"'Modern dictionaries accordingly
describe a parity as a literary

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:44.340
or artistic work that imitates the
characteristic style of an author,

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:48.550
or a work, for comic effect or ridicule.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:52.170
Or, as a composition in prose or verse,
in which the characteristics turns

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:56.920
of thought and phrase, and an author or
class of authors are imitated in such

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:00.840
a way as to make them appear
ridiculous.' For the purposes

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.530
of copyright law, the nub of the
definitions and the heart of any

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:08.370
parodist's claim to quote
from existing material,

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:11.990
is the use of some elements of a prior
author's composition to create a new

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:19.700
one that, at least in part,
comments on that author's works."

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.660
All of the justices,
except Justice Kennedy,

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:27.290
seemed satisfied that 2 Live Crew's
song fit within this definition,

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:32.810
and thus that the first statutory
factor favored the defendant.

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:35.200
To be sure, the Supreme
Court did not rule

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.580
that any work that falls
within this definition

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:39.870
automatically qualifies as fair.

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:44.940
On the contrary, the court announced
that "parody, like any other use,

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:48.000
has to work its way through
the relevant statutory factors

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.770
and be judged case by case in light
of the ends of copyright law."

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:55.890
However, as we will
see, the way in which

00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:00.335
the court worked those statutory
factors strongly favored parodists.

00:37:00.335 --> 00:37:03.337
 

00:37:03.337 --> 00:37:05.170
With respect to the
second factor, the court

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:09.480
conceded that Orbison's song "fell
within the core of copyright's

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:14.470
protective purposes," but it discounted
the significance of that fact

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:19.364
when the defendant's work
consists of a parody.

00:37:19.364 --> 00:37:21.280
You'll recall that in
the Harper and Row case,

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:23.550
Justice O'Connor
countered the third factor

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:26.180
against Victor Navaski
on the grounds that he

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:30.870
had taken the heart of
President Ford's biography.

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:34.210
In the Campbell case,
the Court of Appeals

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:38.570
relied in part on O'Connor's language
when ruling against 2 Live Crew.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.260
Justice Souter, writing
for the Supreme Court,

00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.400
appeared to agree with the premise.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:51.110
Namely that 2 Live Crew had taken
the heart of Orbison's song.

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:55.310
However, Souter did not
consider that fact fatal.

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:58.510
Here's the way he put the point.

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:01.620
"If quotation of the opening
riff and the first line

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:04.410
may be said to go to the
heart of the original,

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:08.570
the heart is also what most readily
conjures up the song for parody.

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:12.090
And it is the heart at
which parody takes aim.

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:16.080
Copying does not become excessive
in relation to parodic purpose

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:20.420
merely because the portion
taken was the original's heart.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:23.410
If 2 Live Crew had copied a
significantly less memorable part

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:26.210
of the original, it is
difficult to see how

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:32.600
its parodic character
would come through."

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:35.050
The Supreme Court did
not definitively resolve

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:37.160
the application of the fourth factor.

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.740
Instead remanding the
case to the lower courts

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:42.860
for reconsideration of this issue.

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.870
But the guidelines that Souter
provided the lower courts strongly

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:50.650
suggested that the outcome of that
inquiry would favor 2 Live Crew.

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:55.580
In particular, the Supreme Court
repudiated the "presumption

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:58.390
that the Court of Appeals
had quite plausibly derived

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:01.230
from the Betamax and
Harper and Row opinions.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:05.670
Namely the presumption that commercial
uses of copyrighted materials give

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:10.300
rise to injuries to the
market for the original work."

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:16.080
Souter and Campbell limited the
scope of that ostensible presumption

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:19.920
to the context of "verbatim
copying of the original

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:23.910
in its entirety for
commercial purposes."

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:26.920
No such presumption, he
contended, is appropriate

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:32.910
when the defendant's use is
transformative as in parody.

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:37.910
The likely result, the 2 Live Crew
song would qualify as a fair use.

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:44.350
So this concludes our review
of the way in which fair use

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:48.640
doctrine in the United States
evolved from its inception

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:52.760
in the early 19th century
through the Campbell case.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:57.000
In the next segment of the lecture,
we'll consider the shape of fair use

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.550
today.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:59.595
