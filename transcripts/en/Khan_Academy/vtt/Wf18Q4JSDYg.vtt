00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.620
- [Instructor] We are
asked over which interval

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.720
does g have a negative
average rate of change?

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.450
So like always, pause this video

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.760
and see if you can have a go at this

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.900
before we do it together.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.470
Alright, now let's do it together.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.690
So there's a couple of ways
that we can conceptualize

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.360
average rate of change

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.260
and then think about negative
average rate of change.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.420
So the average rate of
change for a function

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.340
let's just imagine a function really fast

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.410
and this isn't necessarily g of t

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.130
but that's our t-axis

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.060
and let's call this our y-axis

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.570
and let me draw y is equal to g of t.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.480
Let's say it looks something like that.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.903
So this is y is equal to g of t

00:00:42.903 --> 00:00:46.230
my hand just drew g of x without thinking,

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.830
g of t right over there.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.480
And let's say we are
concerned about the interval

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.370
from t equaling zero

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.370
to t equaling whatever this
value is right over here.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.900
So what you do is you'd say, okay

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.610
what is our function equal
at the left boundary?

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.060
Well it looks like it equals that

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.440
and what is our function
equal at the right boundary,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.900
it looks like it equals that

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.200
and then you could think about,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.110
well, what is the slope of the line

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.120
that connects those two points

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.530
and that slope, the slope of this line

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.050
would be our average rate of change.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.100
So in this example, it looks like

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.750
it's slightly upper sloping.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.580
So this would have a positive
average rate of change.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.030
On the other hand, if we
tried to look at the interval

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.520
from here to say here,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.660
well then, we'll be looking at this point

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.470
and this point, and that clearly

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.820
has a negative average rate of change.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.910
You can view the average
rate of change is,

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.910
what is your change and why
per change in t in this case?

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.840
Sometimes we would say change in x,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.440
whatever the horizontal variable is.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.220
So there's a couple of
ways to approach it.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.300
The easiest way that I could
think of approaching this one

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.890
is setting up a table.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.770
So let's put the t-values here

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.350
and let's put the g of t values here.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.250
And let's see, on the left boundaries,

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.150
they have zeroes and ones.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.150
So let's think about when t equals zero,

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.830
let's think about when t equals one,

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.920
and on the right, they
have four, six, and eight.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.140
So I'll go four, six, and eight.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.480
And let's just evaluate our function

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.700
on all of these points.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.760
So what is g of zero?

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.490
Well this is going to be
equal to zero minus three,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.680
so negative three squared
which is positive nine

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.490
plus two which is equal to 11.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.680
What is g of one?

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.870
Let's see, one minus three
is negative two squared

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.890
which is equal to positive four plus two

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.163
which is equal to six.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.880
G of four

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.160
is equal to four minus
three which is one squared

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.640
which is one plus two is equal to three.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.640
G of six is equal to
six minus three is three

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.490
you square that, you get nine

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.420
plus two is 11.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.910
And then last but not least,

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.130
g of eight is going to be equal to

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.710
eight minus three is
five, you square that,

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.540
you get 25 plus two is equal to 27.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.550
So let's think about it,
when we go from t equals zero

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.980
to equals six, so going from t equals zero

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.280
to t equals six,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.020
our g of t goes from 11 to 11.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.680
So here, we have a zero
average rate of change.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.817
On average over that interval,

00:03:25.817 --> 00:03:29.170
the value of our function has not changed.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.200
So that's not going to be a
negative average rate of change

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.650
so I'll rule that one out.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.060
What about going from zero to eight?

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.630
So when we go from zero to eight,

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.700
the value of g of t goes from 11 to 27.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.520
So as we increase t, we've
also increased g of t

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.890
so that's a positive
average rate of change,

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.600
not a negative one,
I've ruled that one out.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.870
What about when we go from one to four?

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.210
So let's see, when we increase t by three,

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.870
it looks like we're
decreasing g of t by three.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.650
So here, we have a negative
average rate of change.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.080
If we were to visualize it,
we would see a negative slope

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.740
connecting this point and this point.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.140
And so this would be our choice.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.280
And we could verify the last one.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.680
So when you go from t equals one to six,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.370
from one to six,

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.120
so your t is increasing by five

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.820
and your g of t is also
increasing incidentally by five.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.840
So there, you have a positive average

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.220
rate of change as well so we could rule

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.573
that one out as well.
