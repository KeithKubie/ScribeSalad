Learn new things..with brilliant minds

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.100
hey guys i brought you out to the islands of hawaii today

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.180
to show you the method that i use for cracking opening coconuts

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.980
Now when you going down to the store

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.980
and buy coconut its already riped

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.180
out of the husk for you. But out on an island

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.980
if you stranded like you are on castaway

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.980
you have to get through the husk

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.280
in order to get to the coconut

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.980
But these husks are deceivingly tough they take an enormous amount of energy to rip through

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.980
and so if you are in a survival situation trying to conserve energy

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.980
the last thing you want to do is burn it all up trying to get to your source of food

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.520
*grunts*

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.620
So here's a little method I've played around with to crack these things open using as little energy as possible

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.480
When you give your coconut a good shake you should be able to hear the water sploshing around inside

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.640
if you don't hear anything it's either choked full or completely empty

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.020
and you can tell that by the weight of the coconut itself

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.000
now when you look at the coconut you will notice it kind of has a sharp pointy end on one side

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and a blunt end on the other

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.620
and what we're gonna need to do is smash the top so we crush the fibres, and peel this thing apart

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.580
if we tried using rocks to chip at this we would be chipping all day

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.380
and we are not strong enough to pry this open with our fingers

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.420
what we actually need to do is crush the fibres and make them weak enough

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.820
so that we can pull them apart with relative ease

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.720
and the easiest way to do that is by using gravity

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.640
now if you are on an island like I am, all you need to do is come down to a rocky part of the beach

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.540
set your coconut upright on a hard surface and surround it with other rocks

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.620
and then grab a rock that is about as big as you can lift on your own

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.280
raise it 4 feet high and throw it straight down into the top pointy part of this coconut

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:34.220
and it might take a few tries to really get the fibres broken up so throw that rock as many times as it takes until you actually physically see the strands of coconut starting to bust loose

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.920
*grunts*

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.600
Whoo!

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.620
So you can see after two smashes with a heavy rock how there is busted lines down this husk

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.620
that is a very good sign, it is already weakening the structure

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.820
and now if we turn it over and give it one more good smack from the bottom side

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.820
it should be enough crack that

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.400
so instead of spending hours peeling away at this thing we can let gravity do the hard work for us

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.400
sweet

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.400
thats looking pretty good!

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.200
so at this point i can feel this has softened up quite a bit

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.520
and look at that it just peels right apart

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.240
that's exactly what i was going for right there

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.240
so it took three hits with the rock

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.240
two on the top, one on the bottom

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.840
and now it is to the point where we can just peel this off

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.840
almost like husking corn

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.600
it is not difficult, doesn't take a lot of energy

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.600
and there we have it

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.060
there is our coconut (looks tasty!)

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.640
needs a little bit of a haircut, but in essence that is what we are after right there

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.940
and the rest of this husk makes really great fire tender, for starting your survival fire

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.200
there it is!

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.420
so i just gave our coconut a little bit of a haircut and you can see now

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.420
this is what they look like in the stores... Don't they?

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.420
which is already where the hard work has been done for you

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.560
now we need to just find a sharp rock that we can bang this against and crack it open

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.160
which shouldn't be to difficult on a big rocky beach like this

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.300
now to get inside our coconut there is a cool trick we can use that involves these three dots on the face of coconut

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.220
and if you think of it as a face, you can see two of the dots look very similar were gonna call those the eyes

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.120
the other one is a little bit odd shaped and we are gonna call that the mouth

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.560
now if you split the eyes and follow it straight up the back, you will see a hard ridge line

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.780
and if you stop right in the center, that is the place that we need to smack very hard against a rock

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.020
so find a rock with a nice sharp edge and set your coconut so that your line is perpendicular to it

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.320
and what we are going to do is give it a nice crack right in the center of the coconut

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.940
and it should split a line right across the center

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.420
*cracking sounds*

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.300
Look how cleanly that splits the coconut open there

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.140
*cracking sounds*

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.320
*cracking sounds*

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.480
and now if we just put our fingers into that line and pull back

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.500
we can pop it open and salvage the water from our coconut

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.340
as easy as that

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.680
Mhmm

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.660
That's good stuff

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.160
So there you have it guys! If you are ever stranded on a desert island and need to survive on coconuts! (Crazy right?)

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.740
There is a quick an easy way to get the nutrition you need

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.840
Thanks for joining for this experiment, and i will be looking for you in the next video!

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.500
Talk to you then!

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.700
*Punch Sound*

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.300
*Punch Sound*

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.800
Multi-Purpose!

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.820
Aw dude one shot! Look at that!

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.860
With the green coconut all the milk just cracks right out!

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.480
There's not even a shell thick enough to withstand it!

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:25.060
