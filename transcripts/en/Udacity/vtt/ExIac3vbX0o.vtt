00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.040
In the previous lesson,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.270
we looked at different ways that one
view controller can present another.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.620
In this lesson, we're going to learn
about the delegate design pattern.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.100
Many of the most common views in
UIKit use this design pattern,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.840
including text views, pickers,
tables, and collections.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.040
Delegates are used to make important
connections between model, view, and

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.150
controller.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.190
We'll start out by focusing on how
the delegate pattern is used with

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.960
text fields.
