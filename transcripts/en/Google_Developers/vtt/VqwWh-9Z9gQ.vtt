00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.120
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome to Google
Developers Live.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.090
I'm Louis Gray here, from
Mountain View, California from

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.390
Google headquarters.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.910
I'm really excited to talk about
today's event, focus on

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.030
organizational manipulation.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.580
I brought with me one of my
good friends and great

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.010
colleagues, Brian Fitzpatrick,
all the way down from Chicago.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.440
Welcome Brian, or as
I call you, Fitz.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.390
I guess that's how most people
call you these days.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.930
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah, most
people call me Fitz.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:01.400
LOUIS GRAY: That's good.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.890
It's easy to understand,
easy to remember.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.590
It's great to have
you on board.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.820
We've been talking quite
a bit over several

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.030
different Google I/Os.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.180
I think I see you a
few times a year.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.230
And one of the discussions you
regularly do with Ben--

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.420
Ben Collins-Sussman, who could
not be here today--

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.080
is on organizational
manipulation.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.870
So let's start right
at the top.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.570
What is this all about?

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.070
Why do you have these big words,
which really just mean

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.060
office politics, right?

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.850
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah, we
purposely chose the words,

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.220
"organizational manipulation"
because even though it is

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.210
politics, we wanted to focus
people on the fact that it's

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.490
an active bending, an
organization, whether it be a

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.780
company or any organization, to
your will, to some extent,

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.190
to making things happen.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.150
And it's an element, I think,
something engineers can do

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.550
that isn't a technical solution,
but one that allows

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.480
you to leverage your
technical skills.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.460
And so it's sort of a
force multiplier.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.480
LOUIS GRAY: So you mentioned two
things that catch my mind

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.950
right away.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.670
First, you say engineers.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.730
I assume that there are
more employees in the

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.980
world beyond engineers.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.610
Maybe engineers are the best
employees, and we can talk

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:10.670
about that.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.670
But also, bending a big
organization to your will

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.680
might sound impossible,
especially for an individual

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.320
contributor, maybe somebody who
hasn't been at a company

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.990
for very long.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.090
So what is that can have
somebody look at this type of

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.620
scenario, where an individual
can have a big impact on a

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.180
company and make that change?

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.430
What does it take?

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.390
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Before I
start with what it takes, I'd

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.630
say the reason we focus on
engineers, I think is because

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.780
I think engineers typically
spend a lot more effort

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.570
working on technical solutions,
and think that the

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.360
sort of people part is
tangential and unimportant.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.820
The point is, that with a
little dosage of this

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.480
organizational manipulation,
you can get a lot further.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.930
You can make a lot more
things happen.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.560
So that's my objective
with that.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.530
Now as to how you can do it,
I think, first of all,

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.590
acknowledging that it's
something worth spending your

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.530
time on is the most
important thing.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.170
And so I tried to explain
it as it's like

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.970
a lever and a fulcrum.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.960
You may be able to pick
up that really heavy

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.280
object and move it.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.780
But it's probably going to be
a lot easier if you use a

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.710
lever and fulcrum, or a
forklift, or whatever

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.030
the case may be.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.570
So the way that you implement
that is by basically

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.080
understanding how people
work in a company.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.370
LOUIS GRAY: One thing
I've experienced--

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.210
I've been at a number of
companies in my 15 years in

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.200
the Valley.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.930
And I remember sometimes people
would get especially

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.560
worked up at upper management,
and feel like the only way to

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.030
get something solved
was to make change.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.370
And we'd often talk about
this political move.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.230
And one thing--

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.860
I remember talking to
a guy and, he said,

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.440
Louis, you know what?

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.060
The people who play politics,
don't talk about it.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.940
And you just kind of
do it quietly.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:53.970
Like, that guy's a snake.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.450
Or he does something.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.840
What is it that you're doing
that kind of breaks the rules

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.160
to talk about the
political side?

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.880
Aren't you're kind of being
subversive here?

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.560
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, I
like being subversive.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.470
I don't think it's subversive.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.200
I don't talk about it.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.300
I think it's worth talking about
because I learned the

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.330
hard way, and how to make
things happen in bigger

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.720
companies, how to work within
the organization instead of

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.800
against it.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.070
And I think that I found these
tips and tricks, along with

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.180
Ben, because we've
been looking into

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.920
this thing for years.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.540
And I think it's worthwhile
to think about them

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.940
just because it's--

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.160
I want engineers, in general, to
have a stronger say in what

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.070
they're doing.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.400
I want them to have
a bigger impact.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.770
And a lot of times, their voices
aren't heard in the

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.480
organization because they're
too busy, heads

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.530
down writing code.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.120
That's often the solution, if
you're an engineer, is you see

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.420
some problem, well, I'm just
going to work harder, and

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.955
write more code, and write
better code, and

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:55.160
make a better product.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.340
And that will win.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.460
Unfortunately, that's
not always the case.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.300
So by sharing these general
tips and tricks, it's not

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.750
something that anyone who knows
them, will say, oh my

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.260
god, that's terrible.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.480
You shouldn't talk about that.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.230
It's much more of a--

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.370
I think most people are more
likely to say, well, that's

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:13.000
kind of obvious.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.090
I'm sort of doing that
to some extent.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.680
But a lot of engineers, I think,
abhor the thought of

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.380
doing that because
they see people

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.630
who are openly political.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.900
They see people who are
interested in showing that

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.700
they're having an impact, but
not interested actually in

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.370
having an impact.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:35.360
So the people that focus a lot
of energy into looking

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.050
impactful tend to make the
people who are focusing energy

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.400
into having impactful abhor
that idea of showing that

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.670
you're having impact.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.020
LOUIS GRAY: And I think some of
that, also, is a little bit

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.740
of push pull between engineering
and marketing, in

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.160
terms of saying, let's go out
and make something incredible,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.390
or let's just tell the world
it's incredible, maybe when

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.800
it's not ready.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.950
I've been somebody who's worn
that marketing hat for a long

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.050
time and always tried to have a
way to at least communicate

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.710
with the engineers.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.680
How do I speak their language,
and bring it to a point where

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.540
they understand that what we're
trying to do is tell the

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.960
truth, but bring it
to more people.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.930
And you talk about this sharing
mentality, of being

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.730
able to speak up
on your behalf.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.480
But what are some of those tips
and tricks that you refer

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.800
to that a typical engineer
can either

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.360
recognize or start applying?

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.500
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, I would
say that the first thing

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.940
is to understand that the
marketing part is incredibly

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.925
important and good, if
you've got a product.

00:08:32.925 --> 00:08:37.520
The general thing is that when
you see case after case of

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.500
products where marketing gets
up and they show all this

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.860
sizzle, and then they pick
up the big cover,

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.030
and there's no steak.

00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.630
And I think that makes
people gun-shy.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.720
So if you acknowledge the fact
that hey, we've got awesome

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.570
steak here.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:52.910
It's OK to dress it up a little
bit and have this

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.250
marketing flourish.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:59.230
Beyond that, I think a lot of it
is just respecting the fact

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.030
that there's a lot of really
good marketers out there.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.280
I think one of the things,
most valuable things I've

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.490
learned in my career over the
past, gosh, many, many years,

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:11.820
is that there are people who
don't do engineering jobs--

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:16.900
whether it's marketers,
salespeople, PR people, policy

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:17.995
people, lawyers--

00:09:17.995 --> 00:09:21.420
who are really, really freaking
good at their job.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:27.440
And that suddenly changes your
attitude towards these people.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.870
And I think a lot of engineers
have had bad

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.200
experiences with that.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.050
I think most engineers I know
have worked in the small

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.900
company with the bad salesperson
who doesn't

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.870
understand the product, or who
isn't a very good salesperson,

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.250
or just is a jerk to them.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:41.380
And they get burned by that.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.740
And they feel like they're
going to--

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.930
You arrange your life
around that.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.280
LOUIS GRAY: I think everybody
has bad experiences.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.830
I don't want to say, for better,
for worse because

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.350
they're usually for the worse.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.150
And what I find is when you
go through this type of

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.560
experience, it's what you
end up being on the way

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.430
through at the end.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.440
Did you learn from it?

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.405
Did it become more refined?

00:09:59.405 --> 00:10:03.320
Are you better off from having
had a bad time, albeit someone

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.760
who operated in a manner that
you weren't accustomed to.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.380
I think as someone who's been
in the Valley for a while,

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.870
I've had bosses that I was a
really good friend with.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.670
I've had bosses who gave me
really good instruction, but

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:16.860
didn't want to hang out
on the weekends.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.900
And I've had bosses who didn't
really understand what it was

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.610
that I was bringing to the table
and it took a lot more

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:23.980
convincing than I would
have expected.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.780
So how can somebody who's in
maybe a tough spot with

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.770
management, and feels like
they're producing a good

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.210
steak, as you put it, how can
they try and make their case?

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.410
What is it that they can to
help understand different

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.920
communication styles,
for example, to

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.460
take that next step?

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.610
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, I think
the first thing to do is

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.510
understand that companies
are made of people.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.720
It's not software.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.600
It's not building.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.670
It's made of people.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.130
And you need to learn how to
navigate these people.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:54.990
And sometimes that might take
you a GPS, dump truck, and a

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.750
flashlight, a dump truck full of
bread crumbs to leave your

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:58.500
little trail.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.520
But it's important to
be able to do that.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:05.060
And so the first and foremost
thing is understand that there

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.650
are different kinds of
companies, just like there are

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:07.870
different kinds of people.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:11.780
There's the ideal company, which
is where everything is

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.370
very lovely, think
of it as a lovely

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.500
Japanese garden or something.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.456
And then there's the actual
company, which is like

00:11:20.456 --> 00:11:22.810
somebody ripped the hood off an
old car and puts a bunch of

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:25.050
dirt and flowers in it or
something like that.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:29.190
So the first thing I would say
that you could do is to

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.970
understand the organization
of the company.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.620
And you'd never learn this from
looking at the org chart.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:41.190
Because there are ways that
power flows through companies,

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:45.540
and it's typically not through
the org chart.

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:47.330
There are people who have
influence in your company that

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.540
have been there a long time.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.220
There are people who have
influence in your company that

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.650
have been there less time.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.670
Maybe they have industry
influence.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.110
Or they're well-known
and well-respected.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.210
Or they just have the
ear of the CEO or

00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.200
something like that.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.290
Knowing who these people are
and being able to talk to

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:06.510
them, being able to earn their
respect, I would say, is an

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:08.320
important part of that.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.280
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.250
Now, one thing that you were
talking about in terms of an

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.150
individual contributor level--

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:16.290
sometimes there's a big gap
between the people who are

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.330
coding and the people
who are managing.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:21.210
And what often happens as
people's careers progress is

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.780
they stop coding once they
get into management.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.240
I've seen a lot of this happen
even at a company like Google,

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.600
where you'll have
a VP who hasn't

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.240
touched code in a while.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.990
Do you find that as you move up
and start to manage people,

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.400
and managing people becomes to
be a bigger part of your job,

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.990
do you not need the little
people anymore?

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.060
Do you kind of move beyond that
and say, it's a us versus

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.540
them mentality?

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.800
Or how do you avoid that
type of separation?

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.063
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, I would
say you would do that at

00:12:46.063 --> 00:12:48.840
your own peril.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.360
There's always going to be a
separation that's perceived

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.500
from people in a lower parts
of an organization.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.740
I don't think it's perceived of
as big of a separation as

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.200
you get further up in the
organization or up the

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.570
management chain.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:06.120
But I think as you move into
a leadership position or

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:06.640
management--

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.510
I prefer to talk about
leadership rather than

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:10.810
management because I always
think that managers are

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:14.580
concerned with how people do
something, and leaders are

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.890
more concerned with what
they're doing.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.240
But as you move in the
leadership position, you'll

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:23.390
find the biggest challenge
is that you've got--

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:27.270
The first challenge is that
you have your previous

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.500
conceptions of every bad
manager you ever had.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.030
That's why so many engineers I
know are horrified of ever

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.580
moving into management because
they're like, I don't want to

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.600
just write email, and I don't
want to be like the micro

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.810
manager, and I don't want to do
all these terrible things.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.520
And the big secret is
you don't have to.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.960
Your role is what you make it.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.170
But the biggest challenge is
that you now have two bosses

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.290
or multiple bosses.

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:53.040
One is the person that you
report to on the org chart.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.600
And the other person, other
boss, as I say it, is everyone

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.930
that reports to you.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:59.420
Those are the people.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.830
We call this managing up
and managing down.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:05.620
And you really need to be good
at both of those things.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.095
The organizational manipulation
component is more

00:14:08.095 --> 00:14:11.680
about the managing up and
beyond your manager.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:16.000
The good leadership portion is
more about being, I would say,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.360
a servant leader.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.160
The best managers that I've
ever had at Google or

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.400
elsewhere have been what I would
call servant leaders,

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.740
meaning they're there
to help me out.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.870
When I first started at Google,
Ben and I were the

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.170
first engineers in
Chicago office.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.690
Eric Schmidt came out
to meet with me.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:35.745
And I had all these things
prepared to talk to him about

00:14:35.745 --> 00:14:38.580
and report on what we were doing
and where we were going.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.710
And we had this very
casual meeting.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:43.590
And halfway through it, he
asked me what I needed.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:44.570
He said, what can
I do for you?

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:45.770
What do you need?

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:46.940
And I was looking through
my notes.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.730
I had no answer prepared
for this.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:52.570
But that is servant leadership
right there.

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:52.920
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.070
It kind of reminds me
of someone I think

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:54.750
we both know well.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.160
It's DeWitt Clinton.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.430
DeWitt's another great guy who
focuses on open source and

00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:59.840
standards here at Google.

00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.370
And there's a phrase he told
me several years ago.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.920
He said, I go to meetings, so
my people don't have to.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.710
He calls himself like--

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.510
The buffer was him sitting in
that room and fighting on

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.590
behalf of his team, and giving
them the air cover that they

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:16.410
needed to go and get
their jobs done.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:16.780
And it's interesting.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.650
We've talked a little bit about

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:19.130
that leadership strategy.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.710
But in terms of the organization
manipulation, if

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:25.670
you are a fantastic engineer,
you're a great individual

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:29.290
contributor, how do you look at
something in your team, in

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.160
your company, that you
want to change and

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:32.130
start to affect that?

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.970
Do you have to understand what
the power brokers are, or what

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.670
the deliverables are that
are important to the

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.420
company as a whole?

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.890
Or how do you start
to make change?

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:41.750
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, I would
come at it first from

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.150
understanding your company.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:46.340
So first of all, you have to
understand what you can do in

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.280
your company, what you
can get away with.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.790
On the continuum of an ideal
company versus the worst

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.720
company in the world,
where does your

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.540
company fall on that?

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:03.060
What can you do and get away
with in the beg for

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.900
forgiveness versus asking
for permission?

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.270
And what do you have to ask
for permission to do?

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:12.150
So understanding your company
a bit is the first thing.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:16.290
But beyond that, I would say a
lot of this can be done by

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.990
pursuing responsibility in your
company, looking to pick

00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.350
up things that other people
may not be interested in,

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:24.750
questioning things.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.500
So you're going to
want to know--

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.200
If you're told to do something
or your company's doing

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.060
something, you might want to
ask, why are we doing this?

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.840
Give me some more information.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.690
Helping the company to make
better decisions.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:40.200
Now, some companies it's not
acceptable to question things.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.300
Other companies, it's
encouraged.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:46.900
And again, that falls back
on the good versus ideal.

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.720
But more importantly, I would
say as part of the foundation

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.440
is to communicate proactively.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.770
A lot of people just assume that
because someone is the

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.140
director or vice president
or manager, that they're

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.740
omniscient, and they know
everything that's going on,

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.220
and they know exactly
what you're

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.730
thinking, what you need.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.650
And because they didn't give it
to you, they're trying to

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:06.310
screw you over.

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:10.109
What I tell people who report
to me when I get a new

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:14.000
employee, I say, look, if I'm
doing something that you don't

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.990
like or that bothers you, or you
think is wrong, I beg you

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:18.210
to let me know about it.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:21.250
Because if you don't tell me,
I guarantee you one thing--

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.329
I'm going to keep doing it.

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:25.170
And it's not malicious and
it's not cruel-hearted.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.599
It's just the way things are.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:28.880
I can't see that thing that
I'm doing that's--

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.540
And oftentimes, if you're a good
leader or a good manager,

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:36.330
not only will you work to change
that or to understand

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.360
why this is having this effect
on this person, but you can do

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.490
something that is another sort
of secret weapon, in general,

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.270
which is apologizing when
you make a mistake.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.590
It's really hard to
do sometimes.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:48.840
LOUIS GRAY: And you mentioned
keeping people informed and

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.810
knowing that they're
not omniscient.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.840
One thing that I was almost
taunted by when people knew I

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.050
was joining Google, they said,
oh, good luck reporting and

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:58.970
writing your snippets and doing
your OKRs, and the types

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.920
of things that we do at Google
to keep people updated and

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.370
keep us looking at
long-term goals.

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:08.080
How do you find that things like
weekly reports or staff

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.820
meetings and such can be used
to communicate both up the

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.160
chain and down the chain?

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.380
What do you find valuable, and
what's a waste of time?

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:18.680
To be honest.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.465
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: So having
been in and worked in a number

00:18:20.465 --> 00:18:24.620
of different companies, I
love weekly snippets.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.620
And what we do every
Monday morning--

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.420
LOUIS GRAY: Tell some of
the viewers who don't

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:27.970
know what these are.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:28.290
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:31.390
Every Monday morning, I come
into work and I get a nag-mail

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:34.600
reminder-- because I would
forget everything otherwise--

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.040
that tells me, this is what you
did last week, your little

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.650
three, four bullet points.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:39.970
What are you doing this week?

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:42.730
And I sit down, and I correct
what I did last week because I

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.320
thought I was going to do
this last week, and I

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.780
actually did this.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.700
And then I say, oh, this is
the three or four bullet

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.350
points of what I plan on doing
this week, top-level things

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.080
I'm working on.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.870
And the great thing about this
is it goes out in an email to

00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:58.590
people who work with me, but
it goes up into my internal

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.510
profile or whatever you
want to call it, so

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:01.700
everybody can see that.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.320
Anybody can, [INAUDIBLE], they
can go here and they can look.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.450
This is what Fitz has been doing
in the past few months,

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.360
like my internal resume.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.565
This is what Fitz has
done at Google over

00:19:10.565 --> 00:19:12.260
the past eight years.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.400
I think that having that open
and available for everybody is

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.420
very valuable.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:21.310
I worked at another company
where we had to do weekly

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:23.390
detailed logging what we
did for every hour.

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:25.260
It wasn't that we were
billing time.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.690
It was just this is how
they wanted to do it.

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:30.780
They wanted to be able to divide
it up per project and

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.160
as a number of hours and
a percent of your time.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.530
And it all went to my manager.

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:35.982
And you know what
happened then?

00:19:35.982 --> 00:19:37.670
Nothing.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:38.630
It went nowhere.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:39.950
So I would say in that
case, it was a

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:41.040
complete waste of time.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:44.420
Because it took me 40 minutes to
do this report some weeks.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:46.436
I always tell people that if it
takes you more than four or

00:19:46.436 --> 00:19:47.690
five minutes to do
your snippets,

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:49.280
it's a waste of time.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.710
So I would say the fact that
it's visible internally by

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:56.185
everyone, I think that's
the kind of thing

00:19:56.185 --> 00:19:57.230
that makes it valuable.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:58.810
The same goes with OKRs.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:02.490
I think OKRs, as a set of goals
for what you're going to

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:05.780
do this quarter, are very
valuable, not only to help you

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.870
and your team focus, but also
to be able to look back and

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.960
say, did I get everything done
I wanted to get done?

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.480
Is it because I wasn't as
productive as I wanted to be?

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.620
Is it because I was too
ambitious in my goals?

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:19.600
And then you set the next
quarter's goals.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.040
And over time, you can sort
of calibrate yourself.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.085
You get a better feel for what
you can do in a quarter and

00:20:25.085 --> 00:20:26.100
what you can't do.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.700
And so again, those
are visible to

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:28.760
everyone in the company.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.020
And I think that that
broad internal

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.750
visibility is very valuable.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:35.760
LOUIS GRAY: I'm looking over
here at this book.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.500
I feel like we're on one of the
shows where I'm hawking a

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.680
book and telling people
to buy this book.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:40.830
But buy this book.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.670
"Team Geek," from Brian
Fitzpatrick and Ben

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:44.920
Collins-Sussman.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.400
It talks about a software
developer's guide to working

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.670
well with others.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.230
And so a couple questions
on this.

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:53.910
First, is this working with
other software developers?

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:55.460
Other humans?

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:56.810
Other non-software developers?

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:58.980
What do you mean by others?

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.930
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: It starts
with understanding yourself,

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.990
which is sort of step one.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:07.850
It moves onto your team, to
managers and leadership.

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:10.340
So there's a chapter on how
to be a good leader.

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.700
And part of that chapter is how
to manage your manager.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.750
It's how to work with
managers or leaders.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.820
We talked a little about
that earlier.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.640
Then we talk about dealing
with jerks in the

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.710
organization, what we call
poisonous people.

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:25.990
And then organizational
manipulation is part of that.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.720
So it's dealing with
an entire company.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.870
And lastly, we devote a bit of
time into users and to how to

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:33.890
relate to your users.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:37.950
So it's a broad spectrum of
others, of working well with

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:39.080
other people.

00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.370
But more than anything, it's
about the importance of

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:47.210
leveraging the human factor, and
how you can basically get

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.360
more done with less effort by
spending a little bit of time

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.690
in that lubrication, we call
it, the human element of

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:55.850
programming.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.270
LOUIS GRAY: You mentioned
poisonous people.

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.630
And that's really hard to
nail down sometimes.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.880
I was at a company at one
point where we did a

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.150
reduction in force.

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:04.550
We needed to do it.

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:06.810
The company was at a point where
we would only get to

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:08.510
break-even if we made changes.

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:12.660
And it seemed to me that we
reduced force by eliminating

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.990
people who were already negative
about the company.

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:18.180
And it was like, you take
the cancer out and

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.590
the body was better.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:21.790
And it was a really interesting
transformation to

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:24.040
see within a quarter, people
felt better about themselves.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.080
You didn't have that
negative element.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.190
Have you ever been in
a scenario where the

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.890
organization itself
seemed toxic, and

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:32.550
it was almost untenable?

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:35.470
And then what does a person do
when they're surrounded by

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:38.730
naysayers or people who are
waiting for severance, rather

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:40.090
than waiting for
something good?

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:41.250
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well,
that's really hard.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:47.390
And I acknowledge that there
are companies like that.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:49.780
I've always considered myself
really fortunate to be working

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.780
in tech and to be working
at Google.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.690
And I've had the opportunity
to work at other companies

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:55.770
like Apple.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.930
And I've had many opportunities,
so I feel like

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.910
I could go and find another
job if I needed to.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.370
And it's harder for
some people to do.

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:07.460
But I would say that when you're
surrounded by this sort

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.940
of thing, it tends to be a
cultural problem, if you're

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.750
surrounded by a culture of
negativity or a culture of

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:13.490
aggression.

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:17.850
Like we've seen companies, as
well as open source projects,

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:22.240
that are based on people being
very abusive to each other.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.480
And they're like, well, you
know, we're shipping software.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.610
This is OK.

00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:28.220
And I don't think it is OK.

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.630
I think it's inefficient.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:32.320
And I'm not going to say it's
morally wrong, but I'm just

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.050
going to say that if I had a
choice between spending more

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.810
time shipping product or more
time yelling with other

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.490
people, I'm going to choose
shipping product.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:45.030
And I feel like having
a good atmosphere--

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:47.540
And negativity isn't
always bad.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.260
I mean, a lot of the times
having someone with a

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.350
controversial position or
someone who doesn't agree with

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:56.980
everyone else is very valuable,
as a way of helping

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:58.630
you make a better decision.

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:01.450
So I think these people
can be very valuable.

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.700
The poisonous people
part is more about

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.190
addressing bad behaviors.

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.610
The title of that chapter,
I think is a little

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:11.150
controversial.

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.540
Again, like organizational
manipulation, we're

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.620
deliberately trying
to provoke people.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:17.800
But it's not about the people.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.910
It's about the behaviors.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:21.930
And if you address the
behaviors and not the

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.330
individuals, you'll wind up with
individuals who can learn

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:27.510
a little bit about things that
they were doing that might not

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:31.450
have been having the effect
that they were having.

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:33.670
This has happened time and again
where someone was doing

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:37.390
something that was devastating
the other members of the team.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.810
And I pulled them aside and I
said, are you aware that when

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:43.380
you do A, people are upset
and they're really,

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.880
really mad at you?

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.640
Really?

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.640
And they've been floored.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.520
And this has happened
time and time again.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:50.150
I said, yes.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:52.840
I said, I don't feel like you're
doing this maliciously,

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.520
but people feel that you're
doing this maliciously.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.350
Well, they shouldn't.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.010
And that "shouldn't" is
always a trigger word.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:01.910
That's a word that should make
you think, ah, maybe we're

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:04.640
getting off into theory land as
opposed to reality world.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.310
By addressing the behavior in
many cases, we wind up with an

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:15.420
even better person on our team
who's more aware of what

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.050
they're doing.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.510
We've got, they already
know what's going on.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.580
The team already knows him, as
opposed to just saying, oh

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:20.800
this guy's an idiot.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.170
Flip the bozo bit.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.640
We'll get rid of him and we'll
bring somebody else in.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.330
LOUIS GRAY: I've heard theory
land is a very nice place.

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:28.920
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: In theory,
it's perfect.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.110
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:33.080
So we've talked about having
to be a challenging

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.790
organization, working with
challenging people.

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:38.090
Have you ever tried to
make a change and the

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:40.720
organization said no?

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.790
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Oh, absolutely.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:43.040
All the time.

00:25:46.294 --> 00:25:50.650
There's a difference,
I think, between--

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.170
I'm a big fan of fail early
and fail often.

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:53.380
Let's put it that way.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.960
I often get crazy ideas.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.920
And before I go right in front
of the CEO with my idea, or

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.190
try and get headcount, or try
and build a product, I will

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:03.400
often-- as you know, because
I've talked to you about

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.470
things like this in the past--

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:07.650
I'll often grab people I trust
and I know within the company

00:26:07.650 --> 00:26:10.720
in a one-on-one, and grab a cup
of coffee and say, hey,

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.680
I'm having this crazy idea.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.610
What do you think?

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:16.060
And sometimes they'll say,
that's completely crazy and

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:16.860
you shouldn't do it.

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:17.500
You're bats.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:18.480
LOUIS GRAY: There's that
word shouldn't again.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.020
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Shouldn't.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:19.470
Exactly.

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.790
That's a different kind
of shouldn't.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.620
Other times, they'll say,
oh, that's interesting.

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:24.930
I think there is
a problem here.

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:28.560
Have you thought about this,
this, this, and this?

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.220
So that usually helps me get to
a point where by the time

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:34.720
I'm looking to move things
into the organization and

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.510
bigger, I have an idea
of whether it's the

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:37.690
right thing or not.

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:39.420
And it still might
get shot down.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:44.470
And the point that we make in
our chapter about organization

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:47.030
manipulation, is that there's a
lot of different things you

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:51.560
can do to facilitate change in
your company, or your group,

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.350
or your organization.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.540
And make sure that you're
being smart about it.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.660
Make sure that you're
trying these things.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:01.710
You're acknowledging that humans
are imperfect, and in

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:02.920
some cases, indifferent.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:06.230
But if you can't affect any
change, and you've tried and

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:08.030
tried again, it's foolish
to continue

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:09.360
throwing energy into that.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.830
And you should probably think
about if not looking for

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:15.180
another job, at least
start training.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.250
Get some training to
learn some skills.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:18.530
Update your resume.

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.400
And then start poking around.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.910
Because one pattern that I've
seen-- you talked about

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:25.730
companies where there are people
sitting around waiting

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:27.670
for pension, that
sort of thing--

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:30.250
is that if people are in a
corporation or organization

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:32.930
where they can't affect change,
and they're very

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:36.340
passionate and enthusiastic,
they'll affect change.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.130
They'll sabotage.

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.140
Because you can always
sabotage.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.410
And that is a dangerous
place to be.

00:27:42.410 --> 00:27:44.120
That's why I really
think that.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:48.910
I've seen good people in
companies switch from being

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:52.470
the strongest advocates to the
worst enemy because they

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.320
really wanted to
affect change.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:57.130
And they're so upset and so
disillusioned, that they're

00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:59.185
going to make change
one way or another.

00:27:59.185 --> 00:28:00.160
LOUIS GRAY: And I was
thinking about this.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.160
I realized that a lot of our
discussion already has been a

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.150
little bit negative.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:06.240
And I don't want to overdo it
and close on a sorrow note.

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:06.940
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well,
anti-patterns

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:07.610
are memorable though.

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:07.770
LOUIS GRAY: Yeah.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:09.670
And this is clearly my fault
because I'm the one firing you

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:11.770
these questions.

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:14.800
There was this one boss I had
where we were talking about

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.730
career progression.

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:17.620
And when you get a boss who will
actually sit you down and

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:19.850
say, this is where I see
you going, and you

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:20.695
remind me of me.

00:28:20.695 --> 00:28:23.030
And you start to be like
friendly and chummy.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:24.760
It can be very helpful,
as you know.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:25.870
And I remember, I
spoke with him.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:29.060
He said, you're going to be VP
of marketing at this place.

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:32.410
But what you need to do is you
need to understand not just

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:33.530
the corporate marketing
you've done.

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.070
You need to have product
marketing experience.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.320
I'd like you to be product
management as well.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:41.000
And so you would start to have
more skills and more buckets.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.440
And you talked about possibly
either updating your resume or

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.550
getting another set of skills.

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:48.400
Should somebody be looking to
rounding their resume out, so

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.390
that they're not so
niche focused?

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:52.880
And how do they go about
starting to get, I guess, the

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.890
next bowling pin in that
analogy, to round out their

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:57.910
resume and have a job that's a
little bit different, so they

00:28:57.910 --> 00:28:59.870
know it even better?

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:01.280
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: I
think it depends.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.490
Different companies have
different ways of doing this.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:06.480
One of the neat things about
Google is, we talked about 20%

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.560
time in the past.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.200
And that's something, I think,
that you have to earn.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:14.140
You can't just show up on day
one and start doing that.

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.310
But I think if you start taking
a little bit of time to

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.760
do other things within
the organization--

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.510
and it might be outside of your
normal work hours even--

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:24.650
but that's a way, a relatively
cheap way of exploring new

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:26.780
things and finding new things
and trying them out.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:31.080
I mean, I came to writing
software and software

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.250
engineering very late in life.

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:33.700
I think I was 24 when I started

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.605
programming in earnest.

00:29:36.605 --> 00:29:39.270
And I got there because I kept
trying things until I found

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:40.720
something I really liked.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.410
And holy cow, was I
crazy about it.

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:47.890
So I would say kibitzing is
really effective in that case.

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:49.160
It's just trying out
different things

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.470
until you find something.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:53.020
Once you've found something you
love, I think it's OK to

00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:55.010
really dig deep and
maybe become a

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:57.980
domain expert on that.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:01.840
Otherwise, you see a lot of
people who are, I'd say,

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.740
dilettantes because there's
a lot of different things

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:04.530
they're interested in.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:06.420
They're good at a lot of
different things and they try

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.150
a lot of different things.

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:09.850
So a lot of that depends on
what you're interested in.

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:11.660
LOUIS GRAY: I wanted to bring
up one point of fact before

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:12.830
we're all done.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.060
You started the Google
Chicago office.

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:15.910
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Engineering
office.

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:17.120
LOUIS GRAY: Engineering
office.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.980
So you had to manipulate the
organization, first of all, to

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.460
let you live out there instead
of living over here in

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:22.370
Mountain View.

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:24.300
Every time I see Fitz is coming
out to San Francisco or

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.680
Mountain View, I'm like stay.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.220
We don't want you to leave.

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:29.630
And you keep telling me no.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:31.670
How did you make that happen,
as best as you're

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:32.300
able to tell us.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.650
How did you get them to see this
is what I'm doing and I'm

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:35.220
planting my flag?

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.860
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, I think
they didn't know what

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.280
they were getting into.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.490
So Ben and I actually, we both
interviewed at the same time.

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:44.670
And we both said we really
want to stay in Chicago.

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:47.470
And some folks at Google
said, well, we

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:48.790
have this sales office.

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:51.080
And you're going to be working
a project that's fairly

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.120
distributed.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.750
It was a different world
eight years ago.

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:56.910
And so they let Ben and I
start things off there.

00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:01.000
And we hired a third guy, third
engineer, about four

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.090
months later.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.500
And for a long time, it
was the three of us.

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:08.660
And so I think, don't ever
discount luck, the luck of the

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.875
draw, whether it was persistence
or people inside

00:31:10.875 --> 00:31:14.370
of Google advocating
for me or whatever.

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:15.470
But it was the timing.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:16.450
It was luck of the draw.

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:18.370
It was somebody saw
and decided to

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:20.040
take a chance, I guess.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.510
So I'm very grateful for that.

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:23.330
Because I really wasn't--

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:25.420
when Google first approached
me and said, why don't you

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:26.220
move to Mountain View?

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.130
I said, forget it, man.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:29.170
They said, well, how
about New York?

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:30.940
I said, that's not in
Chicago either.

00:31:34.896 --> 00:31:37.110
I guess, we were
so very lucky.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.850
LOUIS GRAY: Very cool.

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:40.500
Well, the great thing that's
lucky for us is we get to have

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.260
you back the next two days.

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:43.630
So thanks for coming by.

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:46.050
Tomorrow, we're going to talk
about Data Liberation project.

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:47.590
It's something that's near
and dear to you,

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:48.680
near and dear to me.

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.110
And in two days, we're going to
talk about the Transparency

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:53.640
Report, and all the work that
you've done to help the world

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.430
understand exactly what Google
goes through when we try to

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:59.450
get our data to you,
and vice versa.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.520
So thanks for coming over and
meeting with us today, Fitz,

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.480
and talking with us.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.730
This has been Louis Gray at
Google Developers Live.

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:05.400
We'll see you tomorrow.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.200
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Thanks.

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.000
