RETO MEIER: As developers,
we spend most of our time

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.370
staring at our IDE, so we
care a lot about our tools.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.980
I'm Reto Meier, this is
Android Tool Time time,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.210
and this is Android Studio 1.5.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.490
Android Studio 1.5
includes a number

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.490
of bug fixes and enhancements
that includes an upgrade

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.400
to the memory profiler.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.390
This new analysis
feature can analyze

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.070
a heap dump to look
for known problems,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.680
such as leaked activities.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.740
To use this feature,
open a heap dump and look

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.554
for the Analyze the Tasks
window on the right.

00:00:32.554 --> 00:00:34.720
In the analysis window, you
can press the Run button

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.930
to perform an analysis, and
then drill into the results.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.750
Here's an example of
a leaked activity.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.510
There are several
new link checks, too.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.009
Here's one which
warns you if you're

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:48.770
intending to override resources
referenced from the manifest.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.060
Hmm, the rest of this
looks like bug fixes.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.410
Hide module selector when only
one module in theme editor.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.290
Correct title set for
creating new module

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.440
in New Module Wizard.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.080
Provide documentation and XML
attribute values completion.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.994
This can't be right.

00:01:04.994 --> 00:01:05.494
Jamal?

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.766
JAMAL: Yes?

00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:10.890
RETO MEIER: Is that right,
or did I miss something?

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.110
It seems just like a bunch
of stability improvements

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.160
and some bug fixes.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.330
JAMAL: Basically, it's
a lot of good bug fixes.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.788
RETO MEIER: OK,
but, you know, this

00:01:17.788 --> 00:01:20.120
is my first What's New
in Android Studio video.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.390
So I was kind of hoping to
make a big splash, you know?

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.200
JAMAL: Look, I understand
that, but these

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.100
are very important bug fixes.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.990
RETO MEIER: I guess.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.295
Ooh, what about this box?

00:01:33.295 --> 00:01:34.820
Can I tell them
what's in the box?

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.320
JAMAL: No.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.689
We can't talk about the box.

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.730
RETO MEIER: Are you sure?

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.604
It looks pretty interesting.

00:01:39.604 --> 00:01:41.270
JAMAL: Look, Reto,
we can definitely not

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.490
talk about the box.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.030
Why is it even here?

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.470
We should really
focus on the bugs.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.760
RETO MEIER: OK.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.750
Well, the Theme Editor
now has a preview

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.780
of the theme that's
about to be created.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.420
There's a number of bug fixes
in the editor area, where we've

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.670
been working hard to
polish code completion

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.770
for resource and manifest files.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.810
For example, you can
now use short names

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.350
when doing code completion
for custom views.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.150
We also made sure that Android
Studio doesn't steal your focus

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.479
if you switch virtual desktops
during the build and run phase.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.130
Download Android Studio 1.5 now
for these and many other bug

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.110
fixes and stability
improvements.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.280
That's Android Studio 1.5.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.910
This is Android Tool Time,
and you should totally forget

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.100
I said anything about the box.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.110
Seriously, I shouldn't
have mentioned it.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.790
JAMAL: Stop talking
about the box!

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.540
