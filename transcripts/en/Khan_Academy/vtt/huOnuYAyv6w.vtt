00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.470
In the last video, we left
off with the assassination

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.520
of Archduke Franz Ferdinand
of Austria, the heir

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.970
to the Austro-Hungarian empire.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.360
And so you could imagine,
the Austro-Hungarian empire

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.650
did not take that well.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.120
They already did not enjoy the
kingdom of Serbia trying to,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.470
essentially, provoke this
nationalistic movement.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.880
And they viewed them as this
small, little, weak country

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.480
right below them.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.690
And so they use this
to, essentially,

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:32.690
issue an ultimatum.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.600
Essentially say,
look, immediately

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.460
bring all the people
who did this to justice,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.330
all the people who might have
conspired with the Gavrilo

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.700
Princips to allow
this assassination

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.870
attempt to occur,
and do it or else,

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.890
and accept full responsibility.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.240
And actually, the
kingdom of Serbia

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.780
was in no mood to get into
a war with Austria-Hungary,

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.860
and so they tried
their best to comply,

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.410
but their best wasn't enough.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.630
So then July 28,
a month later, you

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.930
have the Austrians declaring
war on the Serbians.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.057
Now up until this point,
the Austro-Hungarian empire

00:01:19.057 --> 00:01:21.390
is thinking, OK, Serbia is a
small, little kingdom here.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.290
It has some ties and
obviously, it's a Slavic nation

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.310
so it has some linguistic
ties with the Russian empire.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.850
The Russian empire also had
some political ties to it,

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.350
but Russia is not going to get
into a war with us over this.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.990
We're justified
in attacking them.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.187
They've just killed
the heir to our throne.

00:01:36.187 --> 00:01:38.520
So we're going to go in there
and Russia is probably not

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.020
interested in actually creating
a larger skirmish here.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.290
That was a severe miscalculation
on the part of the Austrians.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.510
The Russians were
not happy about this.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.740
They felt close
ties to the Serbians

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.020
and they felt a need to
protect the Serbians,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.560
or you could argue,
that maybe they

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.349
wanted to mobilize just
to scare the Austrians.

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.140
Whatever it might be,
whether it was Russia

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.950
wanted to get into a war,
whether they were really

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.491
looking to protect the Serbians,
or whether they were looking

00:02:06.491 --> 00:02:09.720
to mobilize to scare the
Austrians from actually

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.610
attacking, the Russians
began to mobilize.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.820
So the Russians began
to gather their troops.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.280
So the Russians mobilize.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.720
And now, this is where
all of the alliances

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.570
start to come into effect.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.710
If you remember
about the alliances

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.180
we talked about several
videos ago, if you go to 1879,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.070
you have the Dual
Alliance Treaty

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.220
between Germany
and Austria-Hungary

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.830
to protect each other if
Russia attacks and actually,

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.230
if Russia attacks or mobilizes.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.260
So now, Germany is
like, hey, maybe I

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.130
am obligated to protect
Austria-Hungary from Russia.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.260
You also have to remember
in 1892, the Franco-Russian

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.620
Military Convention.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.720
Military assistance both
ways in the event of attack.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.650
So Germany is thinking,
look, we signed this treaty

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.410
and we, to some degree,
are maybe eager for war

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.190
because we've been
militarizing so much.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.080
And I can't just fight Russia.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.900
I also know that
France and Russia

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.040
have this alliance
right over here.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.500
So Germany in quite
surprising quickness

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.990
decides to declare war on both.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.470
So on August 1, Germany
declares war on Russia.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:42.764
And then on August 3, Germany
declares war on France

00:03:42.764 --> 00:03:44.180
because they know
or at least they

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.470
feel that they can't declare
war on only one of them.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.845
And they wanted to do it very
quickly because they didn't

00:03:48.845 --> 00:03:51.557
want Russia a chance
to mobilize too much.

00:03:51.557 --> 00:03:53.890
And the fact that they were
able to do this so quickly--

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.639
we're talking three days after
Austria declares war on Serbia

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.180
and then another
two days declare war

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.800
on France-- kind of shows
that Germany was already

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.540
in a war footing.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.850
It's not a joke to
all of a sudden invade

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.330
or declare war on countries.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.380
So Germany was, essentially,
preparing for this.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.680
And this right
over here gave them

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.310
the excuse to,
essentially, declare war.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.709
So they declare war on both
of these characters, Germany

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.880
against Russia.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.140
Germany is declaring
war on France.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.702
Now, the easiest way for
them to move into France--

00:04:25.702 --> 00:04:27.410
so they're literally
going on the offense

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.025
here-- is for them to
go through Belgium.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.093
But the Germans were aware.

00:04:36.093 --> 00:04:39.600
They're aware that there's this
75-year-old treaty, the Treaty

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.110
of London in 1839,
Article 7 said

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.070
that Britain was to protect
the neutrality of Belgium.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.140
And Germany was in
no interest to get

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.940
into a war with the British.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.340
The British had a
powerful military,

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.585
especially a very powerful navy.

00:04:55.585 --> 00:04:56.960
The Germans said,
hey, let's just

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.962
take on the Russians
and the French for now.

00:04:58.962 --> 00:05:00.920
And so they actually
reached out to the British

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.045
and said, hey, this little
treaty that you got here

00:05:03.045 --> 00:05:04.967
from 1839, this
75-year-old treaty,

00:05:04.967 --> 00:05:06.800
you don't really take
this seriously, right?

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.560
I mean if we have to
go through Belgium,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.840
you're not really going to
hold true to this treaty?

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.600
And the British
said, no, we actually

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.040
take that very seriously.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.284
Obviously, the
British didn't want

00:05:17.284 --> 00:05:18.700
the Germans to be
aggressive here.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.760
The British didn't
want the Germans

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.840
to be able to invade France.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:31.170
And so on August 4 when
Germany, essentially,

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.890
rolls through Belgium,
Germany invades

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:40.760
Belgium to get to France, this
gave the legal justification

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.795
for the British to
declare war on Germany.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.980
And so in a matter of only--
I mean not even, we're

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.560
talking a few months here from
the assassination of Franz

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.080
Ferdinand of Austria,
you essentially

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.830
have all of the major
powers of Europe.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.610
And then as we'll see because
they had these empires, in not

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.840
too long most of the world
is at war with each other.
