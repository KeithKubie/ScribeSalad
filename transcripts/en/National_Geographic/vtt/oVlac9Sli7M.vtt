00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:04.470
Parag:<i> That world of political
geography is not going away.</i>

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.538
<i> But, at the same time</i>

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:09.809
<i> we are engaging in this
topographical engineering.</i>

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.379
<i>These very robust engineering
 systems by which</i>

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.517
<i> we modify the planet to
suit what we want it to do</i>

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:20.653
<i>what our various economic and
political activities are.</i>

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.756
<i> This is a very different
 way of thinking about</i>

00:00:23.756 --> 00:00:27.627
<i>how we map and what we map and
what matters most on the map.</i>

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:30.929
( audience applause )

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.099
<i>Connecto-graphy, connect-ography</i>

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.601
<i>I've already heard it pronounced
 a thousand which ways.</i>

00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:37.303
<i> But of course, what
 I'm talking about</i>

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:40.873
<i>is the fusion of connectivity
 and of geography</i>

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:43.976 line:0%
<i>And all of that "connectivity
revolution", as I call it</i>

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:46.146 line:0%
falls into three
particular categories

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:49.915 line:0%
that I liken to three
systems in the human body.

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:54.687
<i>And what we have here is the
world's highways and railways</i>

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:57.723
<i> oil and gas pipelines,
 electricity grids</i>

00:00:57.723 --> 00:00:58.991
<i> internet cables.</i>

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:03.129
All of this infrastructure that
has massively, exponentially

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.767
accelerated our ability to move
people and goods and resources

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:11.170
and knowledge and technology
and ideas around the world.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.641
And that revolution is in, by
many measurements or metrics

00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:17.510
really just getting underway.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.546
As I said,
we are just in the early phases

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:23.115
of this incredible build-out
of global infrastructure.

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:24.316
By some estimates

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:28.087
we'll spend, not just the
$4 trillion per year

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:29.989
on infrastructure
that we spend today

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:33.660
but, rising to $7-8 trillion
in the coming years.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.329
Meanwhile,
military spending worldwide

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.732
<i> though it's rising in
 quite a few geographies</i>

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:42.368
<i> as an aggregate, is
 relatively steady</i>

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:44.070
<i> at around $2 trillion.</i>

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.505
So, what happens
when we build-out

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:46.572
all of this infrastructure

00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:48.507
as this... as these
infrastructures

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:50.910
sort of envelop and
wrap around the world?

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.846
I believe that we...

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:55.048
we evolve beyond one
of the most

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:57.817
ancient adages and phrases
that we all know.

00:01:57.817 --> 00:01:59.752
<i> Geography is destiny.</i>

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:02.688
<i> Instead, we think of
 the arc of history</i>

00:02:02.688 --> 00:02:04.957
as really taking us in
a certain direction.

00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:08.027
And that direction is more and
more and more connectivity.

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:10.196
There's a term in this
for academia.

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:14.667
<i>Extra-statecraft, in which
that infrastructure is so real</i>

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:17.737
<i>where so many borders are
 considered artificial</i>

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:20.740
<i>that it has an authority,
 a gravity if you will.</i>

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.009
And when countries
build infrastructure

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.045
like a highway or a railway
or an electricity grid

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:27.346
something really basic

00:02:27.346 --> 00:02:29.315
you know, that they
share with each other

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:32.618
it winds up being something
that is almost a...

00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:35.688
irrevocable bond.
It's obviously positive sum.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.390
And the more of
those that you have

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.958
<i>the less one thinks about</i>

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.927
<i>not sovereignty as guiding
 their relations</i>

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:44.463
<i> but this connectivity
 really shaping</i>

00:02:44.463 --> 00:02:46.632
<i>how they relate to each other.</i>

00:02:46.632 --> 00:02:49.635
And so, that's the shift
that's happening now

00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:51.637
from political geography being

00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:54.440
the most paramount
feature of the map

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.842
which is again the borders

00:02:56.842 --> 00:02:58.244
to the functional geography

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:00.480
which is the infrastructures
and the supply chains.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:03.683
<i>Gradually, what I believe
 what happens next</i>

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:06.652
<i> is what I call the</i>
"Global Network Civilization"

00:03:06.652 --> 00:03:09.855
<i>that eventually emerges from
all of this infrastructure.</i>

00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:13.225
Within that, you still have
empires, you still have nations

00:03:13.225 --> 00:03:17.363
you have city-states, you have
all of these various actors.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:23.068
But, it all adds up to a sort of
co-existing civilization.

00:03:23.468 --> 00:03:25.004
<i>The Sijori growth triangle.</i>

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:27.139
<i> Singapore,
 Malaysia and Indonesia</i>

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.209
<i> are trying to
 optimize their space.</i>

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.310
And what you have here is
a case, where you have

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.412
a country Singapore,
which has very--

00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:35.581
almost no land,
but a lot of capital.

00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:36.549
Country like Malaysia

00:03:36.782 --> 00:03:40.219
that has quite a bit of land
and labor and some capital.

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.455
And Indonesia, which has a lot
of land and a lot of labor

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:43.990
and very little capital.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.458
So, you take these
three countries

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:47.660
that are all very close to
each other and they said

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.762
starting in the 1970s,
in the 1980s

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:52.198
"Let's start to take
Singaporean money

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:54.133
and Malaysian and
Indonesian land

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:57.003
and Indonesian labor and
put it on some islands

00:03:57.003 --> 00:03:58.770
that nominally
belong to Indonesia

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.072
and let's start building ships

00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:02.108
that are owned by
Singaporean companies.

00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:04.143
But, let's optimize
our geography

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:08.547
let's treat it like we are
connected by one supply chain."

00:04:08.547 --> 00:04:10.016
<i> And that's what
 they started to do.</i>

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:11.617
And you wouldn't
know that there is

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:13.853
one set of rules in
one place and another

00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:15.154
because now people can

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:17.489
increasingly move
seamlessly around them.

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.761
And that's how places one
by one, gradually...

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:25.598
neighbors shift, transition
from political geography

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:26.966
to functional geography.

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:28.667
<i> But, the supply
 chains are in fact</i>

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:30.536
<i>the original worldwide webs.</i>

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:33.539
<i> And they are,
that system of transactions</i>

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:35.508
<i>that gets any one thing to--</i>

00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:38.110
<i> one thing from one place
 to any another place.</i>

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.880
<i> And in many cases in the
global supply chain today</i>

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.050
we no longer really know
where something is made.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.652
And so, I believe that
the labels on everything

00:04:46.652 --> 00:04:48.554
from clothing to computers
and so on

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:50.089
should really be
made everywhere.

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:53.226
If you look at where
the design is done

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:54.894
the manufacturing is done

00:04:54.894 --> 00:04:57.897
the production, the
marketing, the distribution

00:04:57.897 --> 00:05:00.933
the insurance,
the repair of any given product.

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:05.104
It involves companies and
sub-contractors and so forth

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:06.605
from all over the world.

00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:09.441
There's very little that is made

00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:13.546
exactly where the label
says it is, in fact.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.116
And that's what happens when we
get to the supply chain world.

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:18.851
<i>You can see it in the fact</i>

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:21.954
<i>that trade now reaches every
 corner of the planet.</i>

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:24.223
<i> You can see it in
 the ways in which</i>

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:26.224
<i> people in the financial
 industry are affected</i>

00:05:26.224 --> 00:05:28.261
<i>by the financial crisis of 2008.</i>

00:05:28.261 --> 00:05:32.064
<i>Collapse of manufacturing as a
result of the financial crisis.</i>

00:05:32.064 --> 00:05:33.265
<i> Automobile workers and</i>

00:05:33.265 --> 00:05:35.300
<i> manufacturing workers
 around the world</i>

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.303
<i>simultaneously lose their jobs.</i>

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:38.571
You may not have noticed it

00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:40.573
because that may not
be your circuit.

00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:43.375
But, people who work in that
industry all over the world

00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:45.211
simultaneously affected.

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:47.847
Such is the nature of that
connectivity among this project.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:49.882
It is a very human thing

00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:52.985
because each and every one of us
belongs to some kind of circuit.

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:58.190
<i>And we move, we gravitate
 towards the supply chain</i>

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.658
<i> towards these circuits.</i>

00:05:59.658 --> 00:06:02.161
<i>We want to be part of them
and when the supply chain</i>

00:06:02.161 --> 00:06:05.697
<i>and when infrastructure doesn't
come to you, you go to it.</i>

00:06:05.697 --> 00:06:08.667
Right, and that is why
so many people today

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:11.503
that's why there's more migrants
than ever in history today.

00:06:11.503 --> 00:06:12.838
People are on the move.

00:06:12.838 --> 00:06:16.174
One of the ways in which
economists or others

00:06:16.174 --> 00:06:19.712
would measure the extent of
globalization is, they would say

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:21.447
"Well, X and Y
number of people

00:06:21.447 --> 00:06:24.016
have crossed borders
any given year."

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:26.685
That's not the correct way
to measure

00:06:26.685 --> 00:06:28.120
a globalization in my view.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.290
It's how many people are
connected and to get connected

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.625
you don't have to move across
an international boundary.

00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:36.361
Most people will never leave
the country they were born in.

00:06:36.628 --> 00:06:39.932
But, if you move to a city,
you have access to services.

00:06:39.932 --> 00:06:42.435
You may work in a factory
of a foreign company

00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:44.403
you're connected
to supply chains

00:06:44.403 --> 00:06:46.038
you'll have a mobile phone.

00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:47.873
All of these things
connect you to the world

00:06:47.873 --> 00:06:49.542
even though you have never
left the country.

00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:51.910
So, to me,
the rate of urbanization

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.145
is the greatest measurement

00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:55.148
of the extent to which mankind
is getting connected.

00:06:55.148 --> 00:06:56.148
And of course,

00:06:56.215 --> 00:06:59.252
we live in a rapidly,
rapidly urbanizing world.

00:06:59.252 --> 00:07:01.086
Now, most of the
world's population

00:07:01.086 --> 00:07:03.122
does live in cities already.

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:05.524
<i> Part of this global
 network civilization</i>

00:07:05.524 --> 00:07:09.595
<i>part of this move from political
to functional geography is that</i>

00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:11.196
<i>perhaps, not surprisingly</i>

00:07:11.196 --> 00:07:13.766
<i> cities can be seen
 as more important</i>

00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:15.467
<i>in many ways than countries.</i>

00:07:15.467 --> 00:07:19.204
<i>So, what is on this map is every
human being in the world.</i>

00:07:19.204 --> 00:07:21.573
You have the entire
world's population here

00:07:21.573 --> 00:07:24.510
and you have the population
density as well.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.013
And you have these ovals showing
you the kind of outlines

00:07:28.013 --> 00:07:33.318
<i>of where the largest, most
populous mega-city clusters are.</i>

00:07:33.318 --> 00:07:36.221
<i>And then the large circles
tell you, what percentage</i>

00:07:36.221 --> 00:07:40.492
<i>what share of the national
economy those cities represent.</i>

00:07:40.492 --> 00:07:42.161
So, what you're seeing here

00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:45.664
is not only where
mankind is concentrated

00:07:45.664 --> 00:07:47.666
but of course,
just how significant

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:51.270
those particular clusters
are where they're located.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.573
And so,
30 or 40 of these

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:57.343
represent a growing share
of the world economy.

00:07:57.343 --> 00:08:00.913
And by the year 2030,
most projections estimate

00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:04.884
there will be about
50 mega-city archipelagos.

00:08:04.884 --> 00:08:06.618
And these really represent

00:08:06.618 --> 00:08:10.222
the preponderant share of the
world economic activity.

00:08:10.222 --> 00:08:13.359
So, I've put, kind of all
of them up on one map here.

00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:14.627
And again,
I ask the question

00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:17.329
you're trying to understand
how the world works.

00:08:17.329 --> 00:08:18.931
It's not a naive question

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:20.699
I wonder which map
tells you more.

00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:23.068
This one or
the conventional ones?

00:08:23.068 --> 00:08:24.803
Or maybe some mix of the two.

00:08:24.803 --> 00:08:27.272
But certainly not one
that ignores this.

00:08:27.272 --> 00:08:30.442
Because a map that ignores
this is not actually capturing

00:08:30.442 --> 00:08:33.279
who we are, where we are
and what we do.

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:37.316
Part of this story is what
I call 'pop-up cities'.

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:38.918
Special Economic Zones.

00:08:38.918 --> 00:08:40.419
Fifty years ago
we had almost

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.955
no Special Economic Zones
in the world today.

00:08:42.955 --> 00:08:46.658
Geographies, industrial
parks that were set aside

00:08:46.658 --> 00:08:48.494
and designated primarily
for the purpose

00:08:48.494 --> 00:08:50.796
of attracting in
foreign investment

00:08:50.796 --> 00:08:52.265
bringing in technology

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:54.900
training workers,
boosting exports

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.768
allowing countries and
their labor force

00:08:56.768 --> 00:08:58.571
to rise up the value chain.

00:08:59.004 --> 00:09:01.073
<i> Today, we have 4,000</i>

00:09:01.073 --> 00:09:03.142
<i>such Special Economic Zones
 in the world today.</i>

00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:07.046
<i> It is the most rapidly
 expanding type of city.</i>

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:10.882
<i>So, this is a very significant
trend in the world today.</i>

00:09:11.116 --> 00:09:14.620
<i>China has become an empire
 of such mega cities.</i>

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:19.391
<i>Each of which has almost a
designated economic function</i>

00:09:19.391 --> 00:09:21.393
<i>in the global supply chain.</i>

00:09:21.393 --> 00:09:22.828
And if you think about it,
it's fascinating.

00:09:22.828 --> 00:09:24.163
It's very, very instructive

00:09:24.163 --> 00:09:27.566
in the shift from political
to functional geography.

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:31.070
That the world's oldest
continuous civilization

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:35.807
with very diverse provincial
and linguistic histories

00:09:35.807 --> 00:09:39.178
in many of its provinces,
would say

00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:40.980
"That's all fine and good.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:44.216
You can keep your dialects
and your culture and so on.

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:47.820
But, we need to organize
the country in a new way

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.856
so that each of these
mega-city clusters

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:52.825
has an internally
viable economy.

00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:56.829
So, it has anywhere from
20 to 100 million people.

00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:59.598
So that it has lots of
services and transactions

00:09:59.598 --> 00:10:01.634
going on among people,
so it's not dependent

00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:05.871
just on exporting one kind
of widget or product.

00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:08.874
But, at the same time, each one
is very connected to each other

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:11.776
through high speed rail networks
and highways and so forth

00:10:11.776 --> 00:10:14.479
and internationally
to the global economy.

00:10:14.479 --> 00:10:18.984
And this process of
reorganizing the sort of

00:10:18.984 --> 00:10:21.487
the management of a
country is something

00:10:21.487 --> 00:10:23.722
that we're starting to
see around the world.

00:10:23.722 --> 00:10:27.326
<i>This is how I believe it should
happen in the United States.</i>

00:10:27.326 --> 00:10:29.494
<i> What I'm basically
 saying is that</i>

00:10:29.494 --> 00:10:31.530
<i> the 50 United States
 that we have</i>

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.065
<i> are very, very useful</i>

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:34.600
<i>when you're trying to win
 an election.</i>

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.535
<i> When you're out
 there campaigning</i>

00:10:36.535 --> 00:10:38.704
<i> But, it tells you
 absolutely nothing</i>

00:10:38.704 --> 00:10:42.008
<i> about how to properly
govern America's geography</i>

00:10:42.008 --> 00:10:44.977
<i> to be an economically
 competitive superpower.</i>

00:10:44.977 --> 00:10:48.981
Right, what we need is for these
mega regions, if you will

00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:51.050
that have certain
common internal

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.987
economic characteristics
like agriculture or industry

00:10:54.987 --> 00:10:57.823
to be much more seamlessly
connected to each other

00:10:57.823 --> 00:10:59.090
and to the outside world.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.260
They need to be built around
urban economies at their core

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.095
and they need to be
connected to each other

00:11:04.095 --> 00:11:05.997
through freight rail corridors

00:11:05.997 --> 00:11:07.632
high speed rail networks
and so forth.

00:11:07.632 --> 00:11:08.967
<i>So, if you take this layering</i>

00:11:08.967 --> 00:11:10.869
<i> of the natural
 economic geographies</i>

00:11:10.869 --> 00:11:14.940
<i>these big patches and the urban
clusters that are in white</i>

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.708
<i> that are gonna be
 the economic hubs</i>

00:11:16.708 --> 00:11:18.878
<i>and then the infrastructural
 connectivity.</i>

00:11:18.878 --> 00:11:21.780
<i>That's how you would turn
The United States of America</i>

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.348
into United City-States
of America.

00:11:23.348 --> 00:11:27.353
And that would be one, that
would be far more efficient

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:29.821
far more viable,
far more sensible

00:11:29.821 --> 00:11:31.456
and certainly far
more competitive.

00:11:31.456 --> 00:11:33.459
The optimistic note
that I want to end on

00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:35.660
and that I end the book on
is this idea that

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.732
we are actually returning
to a fairly ancient model.

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:44.202
<i> We are a coastal urban
 network civilization.</i>

00:11:44.202 --> 00:11:46.972
<i> Right, a world in which
people are more interested</i>

00:11:46.972 --> 00:11:49.942
in trade and commerce with
each other than conquest.

00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:51.143
And this is what I call

00:11:51.143 --> 00:11:54.212
the Pax Urbanica,
a peace among cities

00:11:54.212 --> 00:11:56.615
in which, if we think about
the way cities view the world

00:11:56.615 --> 00:11:59.051
versus the way
countries view the world.

00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:02.487
Cities are interested in
trade and connectivity

00:12:02.487 --> 00:12:05.256
whereas, we think of
countries being interested

00:12:05.256 --> 00:12:08.127
in territorial aggrandizement.

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:10.296
And so, the more we
move into a world

00:12:10.296 --> 00:12:14.900
in which that mentality of
inter-urban connectivity

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:18.070
in sharing lessons with each
other, trading with each other

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.939
positive sum relations

00:12:19.939 --> 00:12:23.675
the more peaceful ultimately,
the entire world system can be.

00:12:23.675 --> 00:12:25.844
But, the punch line
really is that

00:12:25.844 --> 00:12:30.015
if you want to have this world,
you actually have to build it.

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:33.184
And it starts with,
what we're doing today

00:12:33.184 --> 00:12:34.987
and what we could
do a lot more of.

00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:37.956
Which is investing, first and
foremost in connectivity.

00:12:37.956 --> 00:12:40.692
Connectivity for countries,
connectivity for cities

00:12:40.692 --> 00:12:43.129
and connectivity for people.

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:45.864
And with that, I'll stop.
Thank you so very much.

00:12:45.864 --> 00:12:48.701
-( audience applause )
-Thank you.
