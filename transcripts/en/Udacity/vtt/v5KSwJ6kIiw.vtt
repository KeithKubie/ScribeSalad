00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
How do we solve this problem? Well, there's two objects we really care about--the two masses.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The pulley we're largely ignoring--the only purpose of the pulley

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is to redirect where this rope is going.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Well, two objects means we have to do two diagrams. Let's think of M₁ first.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Well, of course, there's weight going downwards. Every object has its M₁g.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
But then the rope is also providing a force and that force is called tension.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now remember we're dealing with the case where M₂ &gt;&gt; M₁.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So I want to know what's the relationship between this weight

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
force going downwards and this tension force.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Are these M₁g = FT? Is the M₁g &gt; FT? Or is the M₁g &lt; FT?

00:00:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So what do you think is the correct answer.
