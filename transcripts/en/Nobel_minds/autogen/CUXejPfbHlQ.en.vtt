challenge them when I say encouragement
 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.620
challenge them when I say encouragement
it is also a challenge but it is obvious

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630
it is also a challenge but it is obvious
 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.949
it is also a challenge but it is obvious
that a legal ban by an international

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959
that a legal ban by an international
 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.520
that a legal ban by an international
treaty will have to be part of a

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530
treaty will have to be part of a
 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.800
treaty will have to be part of a
solution but it is not a sufficient

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810
solution but it is not a sufficient
 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.949
solution but it is not a sufficient
solution in itself and exactly the

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959
solution in itself and exactly the
 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.199
solution in itself and exactly the
states you mentioned they have other

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209
states you mentioned they have other
 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.800
states you mentioned they have other
challenges and perhaps they will have to

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810
challenges and perhaps they will have to
 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.270
challenges and perhaps they will have to
start a more active disarmament policy

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280
start a more active disarmament policy
 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.479
start a more active disarmament policy
before they can enter a ban treaty that

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489
before they can enter a ban treaty that
 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.050
before they can enter a ban treaty that
is understandable but it is also a fact

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060
is understandable but it is also a fact
 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.960
is understandable but it is also a fact
that the non-proliferation states they

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970
that the non-proliferation states they
 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.180
that the non-proliferation states they
haven't been active enough they have not

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190
haven't been active enough they have not
 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.059
haven't been active enough they have not
proceeded to speed on the obligations

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069
proceeded to speed on the obligations
 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.300
proceeded to speed on the obligations
they have under the treaty so if there

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310
they have under the treaty so if there
 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.479
they have under the treaty so if there
is a criticism in this price it is on

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489
is a criticism in this price it is on
 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.000
is a criticism in this price it is on
that level and the treaty is just one

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010
that level and the treaty is just one
 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.360
that level and the treaty is just one
step of the strategy so you could say

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370
step of the strategy so you could say
 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.550
step of the strategy so you could say
that a potential element of controversy

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560
that a potential element of controversy
 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.390
that a potential element of controversy
is actually enhancing the public debate

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400
is actually enhancing the public debate
 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.080
is actually enhancing the public debate
yes perhaps and also reminding everyone

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090
yes perhaps and also reminding everyone
 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.539
yes perhaps and also reminding everyone
of their obligations you considered the

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549
of their obligations you considered the
 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.640

way the committee which is behind the
icon it's actually working I mean how

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450
icon it's actually working I mean how
 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.099
icon it's actually working I mean how
significant it is and and

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109
significant it is and and
 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.039
significant it is and and
the methods they're using well we have

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049
the methods they're using well we have
 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.460
the methods they're using well we have
considered I think in the reasons that I

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470
considered I think in the reasons that I

read today we have given a description
 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.040
read today we have given a description
of the strategy that they use and the

of the strategy that they use and the
 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.580
of the strategy that they use and the
way they approach these problems that is

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590
way they approach these problems that is
 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.089
