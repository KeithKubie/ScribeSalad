What the hell is that?

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:16.582
The--what? No, nothing.

00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:18.818
It's nothing. I'm nothing.

00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:21.087 align:end position:100%
You need to work on
your self-esteem, you idiot.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.455
It looks like a letter to me.

00:00:22.488 --> 00:00:23.689
I got a letter once.

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:25.358
From an old lover telling me

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:27.326
she contracted
the Sailor's Virus.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.596
- I hate letters.
- Oh, please tell us.

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:32.932
It's a letter from
the Triangle Shirtwaist factory.

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:35.635
They offered me a job interview
for tomorrow.

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.670
It's always been my dream
to work in a factory.

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:39.772
To feel the steam on my face

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:42.708
and the hot crush of machinery
against my finger pads.

[laughs]

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:46.345 align:start position:0%
Factory life!
No, thanks.

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:48.281
Well, I hope everyone's

00:00:48.314 --> 00:00:52.885
happily lazing about savoring
the delights of all meal.

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:55.521 align:start position:0%
Thanks to your indolence,
the urine buckets under the sink

00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:57.957
have become filled
to the point of over slosh.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.492
Why hasn't this been taken
care of?

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:01.861 align:end position:100%
I believe that was
Garfield's job, sir.

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:03.729
And you sacked him
for stealing a towel, sir.

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:07.100
So, it wasn't indolence, sir.
It was a staffing issue, sir.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.734
Call me sir one more time,

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:10.269
I shall dock your gruel
for a week.

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:11.838
What would you like me
to call you?

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:14.740
Sir will do.
Just pace it out.

00:01:14.773 --> 00:01:16.576
Hamish,
you will empty the urine.

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.511
Sorry, Peeps,
according to my contract,

00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:21.247
I don't touch piss, mops,
or Gypsies.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.817
Oh, very well.
I shall empty it myself.

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:26.519 align:start size:72% position:28%
I'm so excited for you!

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:27.787 align:start size:41% position:59%
Factory life!

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.955
[both laugh]

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:33.860
[laughs]

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:34.893
[rap music]
