00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.480
We're on problem 119.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.980
Is 2x minus 3y less
than x squared?

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:17.330
2x minus 3y less than x
squared they ask us.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.290
All right, let's see if
we can figure it out.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.130
Statement 1, 2x minus 3y
is equal to minus 2.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.530
So they're telling us that the
left-hand side of this

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.280
original question is
equal to minus 2.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.400
So now this question, if we
take statement 1 into

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.680
consideration, it boils
down to is minus

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.780
2 less than x squared?

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.680
So first you might be saying,
oh, I don't know.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.850
I don't know what x is.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.060
But think about it.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.850
Can x be a negative number?

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.400
At worst case, x is 0.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.990
That's the worst case.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.940
If x was anything else, x
squared is going to be a

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.880
positive number.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.590
So we actually know, just from
statement 1, that negative 2

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.040
has to be less than x squared,
unless x was some type of

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.660
weird, imaginary number
or something.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.730
I think that doesn't
occur on the GMAT.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.790
So statement 1 alone
is sufficient.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.200
x squared is going to be at
least 0 or some positive

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.960
number larger than 0.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.490
So statement 1 is sufficient.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:31.790
Statement two, x is greater
than 2 and y is

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.676
greater than 0.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.620
So let me just try to come up
with two contradictory cases

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.390
using these conditions to see.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.460
Let's say if x was-- and they
don't tell us that anything is

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.330
an integer here.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.980
So if x was 2.1, x is equal to
2.1 and y is equal to-- I

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.730
don't know-- y is
greater than 0.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.250
So let's say that y
is equal to 0.1.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.300
Let's see what happens here.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.420
So 2 times 2.1.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.520
You get 4.2 minus 3 times y.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.160
So minus 0.3 is less
than x squared.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.770
It's what?

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.930
It's like 4 point something.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.990
So it's greater than 2.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.240
This is interesting.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.980
Actually this is interesting.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.840
So actually, you don't have
to try examples out.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.990
Let's just write the
equation down.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.080
2x minus 3y is less
than x squared.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.610
So if y is greater than 0,
which they tell us in

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.660
statement 2, then the quantity
on the left-hand side is

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.620
always going to be 2x.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.380
It's always going to be
less than 2x, right?

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.070
Because this'll have some
positive value.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.170
It might have an insignificantly
small value.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.590
We could make it 0.000001.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.120
But it's still going to have
some positive value.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.940
So no matter what y we choose,
as long as it's greater than

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.880
0, 2x minus 3y will be
greater than 2x.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:21.660
So we could say that if 2x is
less than x squared for any x

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:28.580
we pick, than 2x minus 3y is
definitely going to be less

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.440
than x squared.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.090
Why is that?

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.250
Because minus 3y is going to
subtract from the 2x, because

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.146
we know that y is
greater than 0.

00:03:36.146 --> 00:03:38.230
So let me ask you a question.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.780
Is 2x always going to be less
than x squared if x is

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.390
greater than 2?

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.050
Sure.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.100
I mean whatever x is, on the
left-hand side it's going to

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:54.110
be 2 times-- pick a random
number-- 2 times x.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.520
It could be 2.5.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.743
But on the other side, on the
right-hand side, you're going

00:03:58.743 --> 00:04:01.760
to have 2.5 squared.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.680
So if you think about
it, you're going to

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.200
have 2 times a number.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.040
That's always going to be less
than that number, which

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.310
happens to be larger
than 2 squared.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.860
The smallest possible
is 2 times 2.00001.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.480
You could make a lot
of 0's there.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.829
But I think you get the point.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.880
That's still going to be less
than 2.0001 squared.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.090
Because you only have a 2 here
instead of a 2.0001.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.440
So actually, statement 2
alone is sufficient.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.490
Hopefully that made sense.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.050
You just have to see oh, if y is
greater than 0, then the 3y

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.660
is definitely going to take
away from the 2x.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.750
Then as long as x is greater
than 2, 2x is always going to

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:44.910
be less than x squared.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.120
If that makes sense to you, then
you should realize that

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.650
statement 2 alone is sufficient
for this.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.430
That was interesting.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.020
Oh, no sorry.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.000
Either of them alone
were sufficient.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.600
We did that in the
first one, right?

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.810
Statement 1 or statement 2,
independently are sufficient

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.300
to answer that question.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.100
120.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.480
A report consisting of 2,600
words is divided into 23

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.200
paragraphs.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.050
So 2,600 words and it
has 23 paragraphs.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.230
A two-paragraph preface is
then added to the report.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.510
Is the average number of words
per paragraph for all 25

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:38.720
paragraphs less than 120?

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.720
So this is interesting.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.730
So the average number of words
per paragraph for all 25

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.790
paragraphs less than 120.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.510
So if we knew the total
number of words in the

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.710
document we'd be set.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.740
We would just take the total
words divided by the total

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.820
paragraphs they have now.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.240
They have the 23 original plus
the 2 from the preface, you

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.480
have 25 total paragraphs.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.350
Now it told you the average
words per paragrah.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.210
Now, we don't know the total
words, because the total is

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.330
going to be equal to the 2,600
words in the body of the

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.840
document plus the words from the
preface-- I'll call that

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.230
words sub preface-- all
of that divided by 25.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.710
This is the average.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.760
This is what we really have to
figure out, to figure out if

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.270
it's less than 120.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.170
That's what they want to know.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.200
So statement number 1.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:44.670
Each paragraph of the preface
has more than 100 words.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.900
So I guess we could say that
the preface, the words from

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.320
the preface are greater
than 200.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:59.230
That's another way of saying
that the total is going to be

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.130
greater than 2,800.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.800
Now if the total is greater
than 2,800, what does that

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.070
tell us about the total divided
by-- excuse me.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.320
So then the total divided by 25
is going to be greater than

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.310
2,800 divided by 25.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.980
What's 2,800 divided by 25?

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:27.960
Let's see, 25 goes into 2,800.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:37.780
1, 25, 30, 1, 1 times
25, 25, 50, 12.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.190
So it tells us that the
average is going to be

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.150
greater than 112.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:45.200
So that doesn't help us.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.250
If it told us that the average
was going to be greater than

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.440
120, we would be done.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.400
We would say oh, we have enough
information to answer

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.010
the question.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.330
Actually, the answer is no, that
the average is going to

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:56.680
be greater than 120.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.740
But here, this tells us the
average is greater than 112.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.610
It could be 113 or
it could be 121.

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:02.840
So it doesn't answer our
question of whether the

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.990
average is less than 120.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.310
So statement one alone
is not that useful.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:13.230
Statement number 2 tells us each
paragraph of the preface

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.650
has fewer than 100 words.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:23.160
So the total preface has
less than 300 words.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.190
They say each paragraph of the
preface, and there's 2 of

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:27.310
them, has fewer than
150 words.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.990
So the total preface has
less than 300 words.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.725
So we could do the same logic.

00:08:35.054 --> 00:08:41.530
So that means that the total is
going to be less than what?

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:45.190
The total is going to be less
than the original number of

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.710
words plus the preface.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.080
So it's going to be less
than 2,600 plus 300.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.480
It's going to be less
than 2,900.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:09:00.000
Then if you divide both sides
by 25 to get the average, 25

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.220
goes into 2,900 really
four more times.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.420
That's right.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:14.700
The average is going to be less
than-- let me make sure

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.860
I'm getting that right.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:21.000
So 4, 25 goes into 2,900.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.435
1, 25, 40, 1, 25.

00:09:26.435 --> 00:09:29.970
Then we have 150.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:32.400
25 goes into 150 six times.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.830
So we have the average
is less than 1/16.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.500
So statement 2 alone
is sufficient.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.800
Statement 2 tells us that the
average of the words per

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.110
paragraph is less than
116, which is

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.340
definitely less than 120.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.580
So statement 2 alone is
sufficient, and statement 1

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.120
doesn't help us much.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.130
I've run out of time.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.950
See you in the next video.
