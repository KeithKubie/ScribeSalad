that I've gotta kind of two things at
one is the blog I also have wrote wrote

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:13.750
one is the blog I also have wrote wrote
 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.609
one is the blog I also have wrote wrote
this book and so the anyway firm for

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619
this book and so the anyway firm for
 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.249
this book and so the anyway firm for
many years I was I wasn't very happy

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:20.259
many years I was I wasn't very happy
 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:21.510
many years I was I wasn't very happy
with what was going on there and I was

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:21.520
with what was going on there and I was
 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.950
with what was going on there and I was
kind of observing it okay this is

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960
kind of observing it okay this is
 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.749
kind of observing it okay this is
becoming more more problematic there's

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759
becoming more more problematic there's
 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.140
becoming more more problematic there's
this you know not only are our people

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150
this you know not only are our people
 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.310
this you know not only are our people
kind of not admitting if this isn't

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320
kind of not admitting if this isn't
 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.109
kind of not admitting if this isn't
working out but you know there's there's

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119
working out but you know there's there's
 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.630
working out but you know there's there's
this whole you know there's a lot of

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640
this whole you know there's a lot of
 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.189
this whole you know there's a lot of
kind of public promotion of the subject

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199
kind of public promotion of the subject
 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:36.900
kind of public promotion of the subject
and and it's a very difficult

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910
and and it's a very difficult
 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.220
and and it's a very difficult
complicated separate refute a lot of

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230
complicated separate refute a lot of
 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.790
complicated separate refute a lot of
people don't understand it and so it's

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
people don't understand it and so it's
 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.049
people don't understand it and so it's
this is really not a healthy situations

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059
this is really not a healthy situations
 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.970
this is really not a healthy situations
that someone should kind of you know

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980
that someone should kind of you know
 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.150
that someone should kind of you know
kind of clearly explained larger

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160
kind of clearly explained larger
 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.160
kind of clearly explained larger
community physicists and also to non

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170
community physicists and also to non
 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.389
community physicists and also to non
physicists you know exactly what the

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399
physicists you know exactly what the
 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.240
physicists you know exactly what the
situation is here and and so I wrote an

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250
situation is here and and so I wrote an
 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.889
situation is here and and so I wrote an
article about this and then I finally

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899
article about this and then I finally
 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.009
article about this and then I finally
wrote this book and it took a while to

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019
wrote this book and it took a while to
 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:00.720
wrote this book and it took a while to
get the book publishers that's a long

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730
get the book publishers that's a long
 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.930
get the book publishers that's a long
and interesting story but but then Wow

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940
and interesting story but but then Wow
 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.969
and interesting story but but then Wow
after I guess after after the book was

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979
after I guess after after the book was
 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.310
after I guess after after the book was
written I also started it's hard to see

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320
written I also started it's hard to see
 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.630
written I also started it's hard to see
there are a couple other physicists

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640
there are a couple other physicists
 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.340
there are a couple other physicists
which started blogs and thought well

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350
which started blogs and thought well
 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.169
which started blogs and thought well
this isn't interesting interesting thing

00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:13.179
this isn't interesting interesting thing
 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:15.510
this isn't interesting interesting thing
to try to do and I can both talk about

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520
to try to do and I can both talk about
 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.339
to try to do and I can both talk about
you know these issues related to string

00:01:17.339 --> 00:01:17.349
you know these issues related to string
 

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:19.740
you know these issues related to string
theory and things which I was trying to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750
theory and things which I was trying to
 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.089
theory and things which I was trying to
get out through the book but also kind

00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:21.099
get out through the book but also kind
 

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:23.029
get out through the book but also kind
of follow it in a day to day basis and

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039
of follow it in a day to day basis and
 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:24.749
of follow it in a day to day basis and
also just kind of write about whatever

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759
also just kind of write about whatever
 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.080
also just kind of write about whatever
I'm interested in so the the blog I

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090
I'm interested in so the the blog I
 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.059
I'm interested in so the the blog I
guess I don't worry a lot about who

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069
guess I don't worry a lot about who
 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:33.150
guess I don't worry a lot about who
about the about the audience for it it's

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160
about the about the audience for it it's
 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.190
about the about the audience for it it's
kind of written because I realized it's

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200
kind of written because I realized it's
 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.779
kind of written because I realized it's
very much it's really just kind of

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789
very much it's really just kind of
 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.600
very much it's really just kind of
whatever whatever I would like to read

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610
whatever whatever I would like to read
 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.710
whatever whatever I would like to read
so I'm gonna write I'm kind of writing

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720
so I'm gonna write I'm kind of writing
 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.120
so I'm gonna write I'm kind of writing
whatever I would like to read so this so

whatever I would like to read so this so
 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.040
whatever I would like to read so this so
there's somebody out there exactly like

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050
there's somebody out there exactly like
 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.089
there's somebody out there exactly like
me they much find this really

00:01:45.089 --> 00:01:45.099
me they much find this really
 

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:46.770
me they much find this really
fascinating and if there's something

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780
fascinating and if there's something
 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.270
fascinating and if there's something
quite different they find it not at all

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280
quite different they find it not at all
 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.130
quite different they find it not at all
interesting and so but because of that

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140
interesting and so but because of that
 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.169
interesting and so but because of that
it's um

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179
it's um
 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.130
it's um

something or something new interesting
 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.330
something or something new interesting
going on and even in pure mathematics

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340
going on and even in pure mathematics
 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.040
going on and even in pure mathematics
I'll be writing about that or pretty

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050
I'll be writing about that or pretty
 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.059
I'll be writing about that or pretty
much anything going on in between

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069
much anything going on in between
 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:01.830
much anything going on in between
mathematics and physics I'll be writing

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840
mathematics and physics I'll be writing
 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.900
mathematics and physics I'll be writing
about that writing a lot about the LHC

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910
about that writing a lot about the LHC
 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.460
about that writing a lot about the LHC
and but and also just about whatever is

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470
and but and also just about whatever is

going on in this controversy over a
 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.839
going on in this controversy over a
string theory and um it's kind of

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849
 
 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.429
 
memorial at this my book came out and

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439
memorial at this my book came out and
 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:18.509
memorial at this my book came out and
there was at the same time there's a

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519
there was at the same time there's a
 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.209
there was at the same time there's a
book by another physicist with a similar

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:21.219
book by another physicist with a similar
 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:22.050
book by another physicist with a similar
point of view to mine

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060
point of view to mine
 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.210
point of view to mine
that came out so that that caused a lot

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220
that came out so that that caused a lot
 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.710
that came out so that that caused a lot
of controversies with a lot of reviews

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720
of controversies with a lot of reviews
 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.110
of controversies with a lot of reviews
and a lot of argument going on on these

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120
and a lot of argument going on on these
 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.330
and a lot of argument going on on these
blogs and a lot of people refer to this

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340
blogs and a lot of people refer to this
 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.490
blogs and a lot of people refer to this
as the string Wars and so the there's

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500
as the string Wars and so the there's
 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.030
as the string Wars and so the there's
this very for for a year or two there

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040
this very for for a year or two there
 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.150
this very for for a year or two there
there was a kind of a very interesting

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160
there was a kind of a very interesting
 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.229
there was a kind of a very interesting
if you're interesting this kind of thing

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239
if you're interesting this kind of thing
 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.759
if you're interesting this kind of thing
there's an interesting warfare in terms

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769
there's an interesting warfare in terms
 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.620
there's an interesting warfare in terms
of blog postings and comments going on

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630
of blog postings and comments going on
 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.080
of blog postings and comments going on
on my site and various others and that

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090
on my site and various others and that
 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.420
on my site and various others and that
was a all that would lead to all sorts

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430
was a all that would lead to all sorts
 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.530
was a all that would lead to all sorts
and strange things

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540
 
 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.849
 
some I mean III often learn you know

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859
some I mean III often learn you know
 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.009
some I mean III often learn you know
interesting things from common you know

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019
interesting things from common you know
 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.869
interesting things from common you know
so so now that the blog is fairly well

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879
so so now that the blog is fairly well
 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.089
so so now that the blog is fairly well
known so you know people will write in

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099
known so you know people will write in
 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.039
known so you know people will write in
comment so I've logged often telling me

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049
comment so I've logged often telling me
 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.149
comment so I've logged often telling me
about something I hadn't heard about her

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159
about something I hadn't heard about her
 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.470
about something I hadn't heard about her
new button you don't know about and that

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480
new button you don't know about and that
 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.640
new button you don't know about and that
that's where interesting or though

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650
that's where interesting or though
 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.380
that's where interesting or though
they'll often send it to be privately by

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390
they'll often send it to be privately by
 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.539
they'll often send it to be privately by
email saying you know hey you might be

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549
email saying you know hey you might be
 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.429
email saying you know hey you might be
interested in this and so I get a lot of

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439
interested in this and so I get a lot of
 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.280
interested in this and so I get a lot of
that and learn a lot that way

well one interesting I thought amusing
let the whole string theory thing

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500
let the whole string theory thing
 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.289
let the whole string theory thing
discussion was that it's a it really is

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299
discussion was that it's a it really is
 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.690
discussion was that it's a it really is
it's an incredibly complex and a

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700
it's an incredibly complex and a
 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.770
it's an incredibly complex and a
difficult subject and so it's really

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780
difficult subject and so it's really
 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.159
difficult subject and so it's really
hard to overemphasize how it's a

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169
hard to overemphasize how it's a
 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:36.569

asking them what they think of string
 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.819
asking them what they think of string
theory and they'll say you know I don't

theory and they'll say you know I don't
 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.020
theory and they'll say you know I don't
know I don't really understand what's

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030
know I don't really understand what's
 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.460

these discussions in the blog was I

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569
these discussions in the blog was I

found it one way to figure out exactly

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:03.699
found it one way to figure out exactly
 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.479
found it one way to figure out exactly
what's going on in in string theory and

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489
what's going on in in string theory and
 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.159
what's going on in in string theory and
whether you know something is really a

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169
whether you know something is really a
 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.430
whether you know something is really a
problem or or not is to just put up my

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440
problem or or not is to just put up my
 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.800
problem or or not is to just put up my
understanding of it you know in a blog

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810
understanding of it you know in a blog
 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.360
understanding of it you know in a blog
post or in a comment or whatever and

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370
post or in a comment or whatever and
 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.879
post or in a comment or whatever and
then fairly quickly you would find that

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889
then fairly quickly you would find that
 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.560
then fairly quickly you would find that
either you know either I was wrong and

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570
either you know either I was wrong and
 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.390
either you know either I was wrong and
there there was some reason that this

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400
there there was some reason that this
 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.439
there there was some reason that this
actually made sense even though I

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449
actually made sense even though I
 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.330
actually made sense even though I
thought it didn't and this would I would

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340
thought it didn't and this would I would
 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.490
thought it didn't and this would I would
I would quickly often abusively he

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500
I would quickly often abusively he
 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.020
I would quickly often abusively he

explained me what an idiot I was and why
this was you know here's here's the

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099
this was you know here's here's the
 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:31.500
this was you know here's here's the
answer what you really should have known

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510
answer what you really should have known
 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.219
answer what you really should have known
or and then then I found out that okay I

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229
or and then then I found out that okay I
 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.230
or and then then I found out that okay I
learned something or or or often I would

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240
learned something or or or often I would
 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.790
learned something or or or often I would
found out that if I was right if there

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800
found out that if I was right if there
 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.649
found out that if I was right if there
really was a problem here the answer I

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:40.659
really was a problem here the answer I
 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:42.510
really was a problem here the answer I
would get would often be just this abuse

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520
would get would often be just this abuse
 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.520
