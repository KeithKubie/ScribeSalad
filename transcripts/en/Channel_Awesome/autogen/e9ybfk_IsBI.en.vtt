legs are this idea that there's still
 

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.340
legs are this idea that there's still
some patterns I would still somehow get

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:26.350
some patterns I would still somehow get
 

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.470
some patterns I would still somehow get
going you know and so gets into motion

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480
going you know and so gets into motion
 

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.720
going you know and so gets into motion
they were just resulting in certain

exactly you know that yeah and somehow

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:36.430
exactly you know that yeah and somehow
 

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.640
exactly you know that yeah and somehow
actions would still lead to a person

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:38.650
actions would still lead to a person
 

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.520

very similar to choose goose you know

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:41.530
very similar to choose goose you know
 

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.010

every even fit or whatever so I I kind
 

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:50.190
every even fit or whatever so I I kind
of like that idea um but I felt they

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:50.200
of like that idea um but I felt they
 

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.980
of like that idea um but I felt they
didn't touch upon that was another that

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:52.990

so I'm still looking at that mechanical

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:28.710
so I'm still looking at that mechanical
 

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:29.900
so I'm still looking at that mechanical
I'm gonna like how would that even

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:29.910
I'm gonna like how would that even
 

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.699
I'm gonna like how would that even
remotely work how would it be able to

00:13:31.699 --> 00:13:31.709
remotely work how would it be able to
 

00:13:31.709 --> 00:13:34.610

you know close and open and then he just

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:34.620
you know close and open and then he just
 

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.410

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.460
plugs in a you know a knife and it's
like but there has to be some connection

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:40.470
like but there has to be some connection
 

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.910
like but there has to be some connection
to make it open and close and and why

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920
to make it open and close and and why
 

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.889
to make it open and close and and why
would you choose burst be making this

00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:45.899
would you choose burst be making this
 

00:13:45.899 --> 00:13:48.230
would you choose burst be making this
knife to begin with why do you have if

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240
knife to begin with why do you have if
 

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.720

they actually can open but that's the

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160
they actually can open but that's the
 

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.550
they actually can open but that's the
thing that's where you'd attach this to

00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560
thing that's where you'd attach this to
 

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.370

off the hand
 

00:14:04.709 --> 00:14:07.430
off the hand
I guess well then again I guess maybe if

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440
I guess well then again I guess maybe if
 

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.050
I guess well then again I guess maybe if
you take off the hand and there's the

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:09.060
you take off the hand and there's the
 

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.360
you take off the hand and there's the
same attachment but you but even taking

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:11.370
same attachment but you but even taking
 

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.540
same attachment but you but even taking
that out of it uh the arm had virtually

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:14.550
that out of it uh the arm had virtually
 

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.639
that out of it uh the arm had virtually
no purpose you know and I was really

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:16.649
no purpose you know and I was really
 

00:14:16.649 --> 00:14:18.590
no purpose you know and I was really
like like what happened with the arm how

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:18.600
like like what happened with the arm how
 

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.210
like like what happened with the arm how
