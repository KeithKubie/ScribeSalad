00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.170
&gt;&gt; Mario: Hello. Good afternoon everyone.
My name is Mario [inaudible]. I'm originally

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.430
from Mexico and I work in Platforms here as
a software engineer. This is part of my 20

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.340
percent and today we have a great speaker.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.360
Just to give you a little bit of background,
a couple of Googlers got together about a

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.090
year ago and we said, "Why can't we do different
at Google to spread role models?" And it was

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.930
very, very easy we say, "Why don't we invite
them to speak at Google and we put them on

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:33.930
YouTube."

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.570
And we created a channel and we have tons
of visitors, but today we are really, really

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.890
honored just not to have a role model, but
one of the greatest role models in the Hispanic

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:45.890
community.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.060
And today we hope you enjoy this talk. You
still can go go/nasatalkquestion to ask questions

00:00:53.060 --> 00:01:01.960
on Dory. We have about 25 offices most of
North America, Mexico City, SÃ£o Paulo, Belo

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.400
Horizonte, and-and Buenos Aires that are also
listening to this talk remotely. So feel free

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.400
to ask questions.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.060
We also have a couple of live questions at
the end. The time is very short at the end

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.930
so feel free to-to go to Dory if you can.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.040
And today we have an-an honor to introduce
him, but in order to do so I'm going to hand

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.800
off the mic to two great Googlers, one of
them is Tiffany Montague. She runs all of

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.650
our space related programs. She's going to
talk a little bit about that and then Gonzalo

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.780
Begazo is one of the founders of SEN. He's
going to introduce the speaker today.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.409
So I hope you really enjoy this talk.

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.340
[applause]

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.790
&gt;&gt;Tiffany Montague: Thank you Mario.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.030
My name's Tiffany Montague. I manage our Space
Initiative. Some of you might know me by my

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.470
moment title which is the Commander of the
Universe.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.100
[laughter]

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.750
I-I used my incredible space powers today
to summon actually not one but two astronauts.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.650
We have two astronauts here, Yvonne Cagle.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:10.940
[applause]

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.529
I-I've always known that I wanted to be involved
in the space business. In fact prior to Google

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:20.189
I was in the space field. I was flying in
a high altitude airplane as a flight test

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.889
engineer at Johnson Space Center.

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:28.760
I even applied for astronaut training twice
and I didn't make it and I was heartbroken

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.749
for about a day until I realized that there
were two ways into the space community: one,

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:43.010
NASA, the government and two, commercial space.
And that's partly why Google is involved in-in

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.010
the Space Initiatives.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:52.239
I've spent the fast, past several years cultivating
some space projects that you are probably

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.791
familiar with: one, our relationship with
NASA, two, the Google Lunar X PRIZE.

00:02:57.791 --> 00:03:06.059
In the past 12 months alone we have launched
some amazing products with NASA: Google Moon;

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:07.059
Google Mars.

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:12.569
And the Google Lunar X PRIZE is well on its
way to success. I think it'll be won before

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.230
2015 and we have 22 teams, 22 global teams
from around the world who are competing in

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.939
a race to the moon.

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:29.260
So why is Google involved in these space projects?
Well, we are all technologists, all scientists,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:36.430
all engineers, and most of us are space enthusiasts,
right? Yeah.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:44.980
We are also really strong supporters of openness:
open source, open Internet. Why not open access

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.620
to space, right?

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.010
In the case of Google Lunar X PRIZE it's the
largest incentive prize ever offered and the

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:02.249
goal is not just technical achievement and
the demonstration of lunar capability, it's

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:08.430
investing in a future technological work force.
And it's demonstrating a new space economy.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.730
And in my short conversation with Jose earlier
today I learned that he shares those goals.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:21.139
But to do that we need to first remove this
mental log jam that exists about the access

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:26.070
to space; about whether it's possible to go
to space and not be a government.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:32.759
We need to fundamentally change the public's
perceptions about space exploration so that

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.889
they know space should be open and accessible
to everyone.

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:41.590
And I don't know about you, but when I was
a kid I was promised that in the future we

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:48.919
would have robots and jet packs and we'd all
be vacationing on the moon. Well it's 2010

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:49.919
and I'm ready.

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:50.919
[laughter]

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.669
So, I hope all this happens in our lifetimes,
in my lifetime specifically. Otherwise we're

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.010
gonna need a prize for cryogenics.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.690
[laughter]

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.560
And with that I'll hand it off to my colleague
Gonzalo.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.560
[applause]

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.689
&gt;&gt;Gonzalo Begazo: Thank you very much, Tiffany.

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:12.789
Hi everyone. My name is Gonzalo Begazo, I'm
Director of Accounting and on behalf of Google

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:19.490
and the Hispanic Google Network I'm extremely
happy to introduce you, Mr. Jose Hernanez.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.840
Jose's an engineer and also a NASA astronaut.
He was born in California a Mexican descendant

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.090
and as a child he worked alongside his family
and other farm workers in the fields of California

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.280
moving from one town to another harvesting
crops. He did not learn to speak English until

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.979
he was 12 years old.

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:44.770
It was until he was 41 that NASA finally accepted
him into the Astronaut Training Program and

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.680
later assigned him to the crew of the Space
Shuttle Mission STS-128.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.240
Jose also served as a chief of the materials
and processes branch of Johnson Space Center

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.860
and received recognition for his work at Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory where he co-developed

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.659
the first full field digital mammography imaging
system proven to detect breast cancer at an

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:12.409
earlier stage than previous techniques.

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:17.290
He also worked in the international arena
where he represented Lawrence Livermore and

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:24.189
the U.S. Department of Energy in-on Russian
nuclear non-prof, non-proliferation issues.

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:31.070
He earned a BS in electrical engineering from
the University of the Pacific, and MS in electrical

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.449
and computer engineering from the University
of California Santa Barbara and, where he

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:42.460
was also awarded an honorary doctor of law
degree in 2006.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.819
Jose created the Jose Hernandez Reaching for
the Stars Foundation in December 2005, a non-profit

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:49.819
organization.

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:55.770
Having been raised by parents in-in a migrant
jet [inaudible] family, Jose believes that

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:01.159
all children despite family challenges should
have the same educational opportunities he

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:02.159
did.

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:09.340
Inspired by Dr. Franklin Chang-Diaz who in
the 19, in the 1980's became the first Hispanic-American

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:15.540
astronaut, Jose now wants children to also
become inspired to learn more about math and

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.540
science.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.819
With that please let me introduce you Mr.
Jose Hernandez.

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:20.069
[applause]

00:07:20.069 --> 00:07:30.240
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: Thank you, thank you Gonzalo
for that kind introduction.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.830
And Tiffany I think Lockheed Martin just announced
that they have their commercial jet packs.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:36.830
[laughter]

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.349
They're a little expensive right now, but
I think, I think, I think they're developing

00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:44.000
it pretty good and-and Mario, thank you very
much and to the whole Hispanic Googlers Network

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.029
for extending this invitation; also to my
colleague Yvonne Cagle from NASA Ames. She's

00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:54.599
the one that actually put us in contact and
she sent me the original email and of course

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:57.669
when they said, "Google," I said, "Hey, I-I'm
interesting in seeing what you guys are doing

00:07:57.669 --> 00:07:58.680
over here."

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.159
And let me tell 'ya I spent the whole morning
here and-and I wanna come work with you guys.

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:04.159
[laughter]

00:08:04.159 --> 00:08:07.319
I mean this is, it's a, it's a neat place.
You think NASA's neat, you guys, you guys,

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:09.180
have it all man. It-it is neat.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.620
I think my colleague Ed Lu already beat me
to it though. I think you guys already have

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:18.110
your-your quota of one astronaut so whenever
he moves on just make sure you guys give me

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.110
a call, alright?

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.370
But this is gonna be a little bit like church,
okay?

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.030
[laughter]

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:28.699
I-I have, I have, I have a treat for you guys
at the very end, but first you gotta listen

00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:29.699
to the sermon.

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:30.699
[laughter]

00:08:30.699 --> 00:08:31.699
Okay?

00:08:31.699 --> 00:08:36.370
The treat, the treat at the very end, its
gonna be, I have about an 18 minute video

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:42.860
that summarizes my mission from last year.
It was aboard, on board STS-128 Discovery

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.890
and it was from August 28th of last year through
September 11th. And we went all the way up

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:54.230
to the International Space Station, connected
with them, and we formed a-a group of seven

00:08:54.230 --> 00:09:00.030
of us from-from my crew and six from the station,
the 13 of us were up in space simultaneously,

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.090
which was somethin' very incredible.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:07.930
But-but before I do that I-I think I need
to tell ya a little bit about myself so that,

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:14.570
so that you guys can better appreciate what-what-what
you guys are to the community, be, like it

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:19.340
or not I think you guys are-are role models
to our community.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:26.680
And-and I'm sure the 80/20 that you guys have
the ability here a lot of you choose to use

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:32.800
that 20 to go out in the community and do
some good in terms of influencing our kids

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:38.240
to get into science, technology, engineering,
and math; get into the STEM fields. And I

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.330
think that is, that is very important.

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:47.280
I think the-the-the, I was listening to-to
the White House when they were, they had this

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:54.350
event for community colleges and I think it
was Joe Biden said some quote that really

00:09:54.350 --> 00:10:04.650
stuck to me and-and that is the-the-the "countries
that out educate us today are gonna out compete

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:05.820
us tomorrow."

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:12.030
And it's very important that we engage our
kids into the STEM fields if were gonna remain

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:17.970
competitive on a global basis. And so-so that's
sort of the soapbox that I'm gonna get into

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:21.900
that you guys are gonna have to put up with
for the next 15-20 minutes and then, and then

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:25.600
I'll give you guys the treat, alright?

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.510
As was mentioned I come from a typical migrant
farm working family. I'm first generation.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:35.010
I was born here in the States and-and so you
would say, "Well, what's a typical migrant

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:41.210
farm working family?" And let me, let me paint
the scenery for you. It's actually quite simple.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:46.960
My parents came from Michaocan, the state
of Michaocan in Mexico. If you, if you balance

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:53.450
Mexico on a pin that center of mass there,
that's where Michaocan's at. So we're dead

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:54.450
center in Mexico.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:11:01.070
And every year my Dad would-would load up
the kids in the car, there was four of us,

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:06.700
and I was the youngest one, would load up
the kids in the car, Mom as well and we would

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:13.170
make a two day trip through Mexico, Northern
Mexico all the way up to Southern California.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:18.380
We would reach Ontario near Los Angeles and
we would spend about a month and a half there

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.950
picking strawberries. That's how we would
start the season.

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:26.000
Then about month and a half later we would
drive up to Salinas and then we would pick

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.220
lechuga which is the lettuce. We would work
in the hoe, hoeing with respect to thinning

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.120
out sugar beets and whatever it was they were
planting.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:41.160
And then after that we would then two months
later move up to the Stockton area; Stockton,

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:47.370
Tracy, Modesto. And we would hang out here
the bulk of our time; start working in picking

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:53.580
cucumbers, tomatoes, cherries, anything that
was in season we picked it.

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.850
And then after that November would roll around
and now we would make what would be a two

00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:04.800
and half day trip back to Mexico. And we would
cool our heels between November and February

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:11.120
in Mexico and then that process would begin
again and we would do that year after year.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:18.520
So you can see that that is why it took me
until I was 12 years old to dominate the English

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.600
language. I mean while we was being pulled
out from different school districts throughout

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.550
the year and-and so there was very little
stability.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:32.760
And-and-and-and so I remember, I remember
that-that-that one thing that my parents did

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.620
different than what a typical migrant farm
working family was in spite of their third

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:41.590
grade education, was that they put a lot of
emphasis in education. They didn't understand

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.240
it, but they knew it was something good.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:49.550
And so Monday through Friday where ever we
were we were in school. And Saturday and Sunday

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:54.410
rolled around where ever we were we were working
right aside Mom and Dad in the fields trying'

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.200
to supplement the family income.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:13:04.910
And-and-and while a lot of kids looked forward
to summer vacation, the Hernandez kids kinda

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.570
hated summer vacation 'cause we knew what
that signified --

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:08.570
[laughter]

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:12.530
that represented we had to be out there in
the fields seven days a week so that was no

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:13.530
fun.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:20.550
I-I also remember, I also remember that my
parents were very, very smart. I swear they

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:25.150
would have made great psychologists 'cause-'cause
one of the things that they always did is

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:30.910
they did little things that kinda had a lot
of strong, a strong message with respect to

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.110
education.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:38.250
I remember every day when we used to, it almost
turned out to be a game, but-but whenever

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:43.820
we used to go home after a long day's work,
for example if we were picking cucumbers you

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:48.200
wear Levis and they get muddy in the morning
and then they dry up during the day, the sun

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:53.850
bakes 'em. I remember when we used to go home
us kids used to play games see who could make

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:55.370
their Levis stand up on themselves.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.620
[laughter]

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.390
And we used to kid around that that's the
person that worked the hardest that day, but

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:05.690
actually it's, I always won 'cause I was always
rolling around in the mud 'cause I was the

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.320
youngest one, right so.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.840
But anyway I remember every day my Dad used
to, we used to get in the back seat of the

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:17.980
car after a long day's work, we were hot,
sweaty, dusty, and before he start the car

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:21.230
and like I said we used to, we used to make
this a game 'cause we said, "He's gonna forget

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:25.760
today. He's gonna forget." And before he put
the key in the ignition he would look back

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:30.930
and say, "How do you guys feel today?" And
that was the message all, every day. And of

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.270
course we would always say, "Well we're tired."
And he'd say, "Well good." He says, "Remember

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:38.600
this feeling 'cause if you don't go to school
so I'm not gonna force you to go to school,

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:43.190
but if you don't go to school, get good grades,
this is what you're gonna do the rest of your

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:47.140
life." And so it was pretty, a pretty powerful
message.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:53.670
Also I remember each time we came home from
school, each time we came home from school

00:14:53.670 --> 00:15:00.310
my Mom would always sit us on the kitchen
table while she made her homemade tortillas

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:06.200
and-and food for us to eat after school, she-she
made sure that we finished our homework.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.150
And she helped us with our homework up to
the third grade. After the third grade since

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.680
that's all she went to school for I mean she
couldn't help us anymore.

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.750
But it only took me once though I figured
out she was smart enough not to, not to help

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.810
us, but she was smart enough to realize that
we, if we, to know if we finished our homework

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:24.500
or not. 'Cause it only took me one test --

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.110
[laughter]

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.320
to test her out on that and a visit with the
belt to-to --

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.320
[laughter]

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:35.950
Not-not try it again. So I made sure I-I did
finish my homework every day.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:42.380
But-but-but things, that's how it was when
I was in, was small as-as I remember it.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:48.430
And things actually changed a bit when I was,
when I was in about in second grade.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:53.180
I mentioned I'm, I was the youngest in the
family and I was in the second grade and November

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:59.730
rolled around and it was time to go to Mexico,
right? And we, here we were in Stockton and-and

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:03.930
my teacher tell, my Dad tells me, "Hey we're
gettin' ready to go to Mexico," like he always

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:07.680
did every year. "Get three months worth of
homework," 'cause when we went to Mexico we

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:12.450
self-studied ourselves. We did our own homework
since Christmas vacation was around the corner

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:16.170
and it wasn't worth it for us to go to school
in Mexico, so we took three months worth of

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.170
homework.

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:21.590
And so I said, "Okay that's fine." So I went
to school that day and I talked to my teacher

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:26.950
Mrs. Yung, a-a young Chinese teacher; she
was real tall, well I mean tall for a second

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.730
grader 'cause she's actually short, but-but
to a second grader she looked --

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:31.730
[laughter]

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:37.060
she looked tall to me and anyway a beautiful
young Chinese teacher and-and I told Mrs.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.850
Yung I said, "Mrs. Yung we're gonna to Mexico.
Can I have my three months' worth of homework?"

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:45.140
And-and then she looked at me and her eyes
rolled, she rolled her eyes and of course

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:49.130
she had been through this routine with my
three other siblings 'cause they'd been through

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:54.220
the second grade. So she knew the routine.
But this time she said, "You know what? Tell

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:58.129
your Dad and Mom that I'm coming home today
to visit them." And I said, "Oh, okay."

00:16:58.129 --> 00:17:03.340
So that day I ran home. We lived about a mile
and a half from school. You crossed railroad

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.520
tracks, packing sheds, and all that and in
those days you could walk to school for a

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.510
mile and a half. I guess these days you'll
get arrested for child abuse if you let your

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:12.510
kid --

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:13.510
[laughter]

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.189
your kid walk a mile and a half to school,
right? But in those days it was alright.

00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:20.900
I remember I ran that day as fast as I could
and I told my par, my parents I said, "Hey

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:25.780
the-the teacher's gonna come today." And of
course you get two separate reactions from

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:26.780
your parents, right?

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:27.780
[laughter]

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.830
The first reaction is your Dad. First thing
he starts doing, he starts taking off his

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:31.830
belt --

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:32.830
[laughter]

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:33.830
and says, "Alright boy, what'd you do?"

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:34.830
[laughter]

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.680
And I, I tell him, "I didn't do anything.
I promise." He said, "You know it's gonna

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.530
be twice as bad if she tells me what you did
 --

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:40.530
[laughter]

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:41.530
if you don't tell me, right?"

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:42.530
[laughter]

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:46.480
[laughs] And I said, "I-I promise. I think
it has to do with Mexico." And he said, "Okay,

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.840
you better be right boy." He said, "You better
be right."

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.840
[laughter]

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.840
I say, "Yeah."

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.720
And of course the other reaction's completely
opposite from the Mom, right? Mom, and if

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.940
you're Hispanic you would understand this
more, I think. But you get that home alone

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:04.880
reaction from Mom. "The teacher's coming?
We gotta clean the house!"

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.880
[laughter]

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:10.470
"We gotta cook a feast 'cause la maestra is
coming." It's, the Hispanics have this big

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:16.070
respect for educators and so, and so-so all
the bells and whistles come out when they

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:17.820
figure that the maestra was coming.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.810
And as I remember she came, we ate very good,
I-I remember even telling my teacher, Mrs.

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:25.270
Yung, I said, "You oughta come more often."

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.270
[laughter]

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:33.030
'Cause we ate so well that day. And-and-and
so, and so, and so she came and after-after

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:39.260
dinner and everything in her words and-and
I remember she used terms that my parents

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:44.161
could understand because I was sort of helped
interpret and-and she basically told my parents,

00:18:44.161 --> 00:18:49.640
she said, "Hey you guys oughta stay in one
place. Don't live a nomadic life. Set root

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:54.010
in one place so the trees can grow strong."
And obviously the trees were the kids; the

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:56.160
four kids 'cause she had had all four kids.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.790
And she said, "Look your kids, I've had all
four of them they're-they're kind of bright

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:05.130
and if you give 'em a chance they can be something
when they grow up."

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:12.770
And my parents to again, to their credit they-they-they
actually took that advice. I mean We still

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:18.640
went to Mexico that year, but we instead of
coming back to Ontario and doing the-the migrant

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.720
thing, we went straight to Stockton. And we
started making Stockton our home.

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:28.710
And then our three month trips started shrinking
to about three weeks centered around Christmas

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.990
holidays so we didn't miss a lot of school.

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:37.650
And that's when our education started to get
traction. And it was, it was also the fact

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:42.470
that my parents, my Mom like I said she would
have made a great psychologist, I mean she

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:46.960
also put the burden on us with respect to
gettin' an education 'cause she, she would

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.870
never say, "Oh you know I hope you guys go
to college. I hope you guys are gonna do this."

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:57.361
She always said, "When." She sort of set that
bit in our brain and she always said it was

00:19:57.361 --> 00:19:58.361
expected.

00:19:58.361 --> 00:20:03.190
We didn't know any better even though they
only went to the third grade, we knew we had

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:08.420
to go to college else our, we were gonna have
to answer with our parents, to our parents.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:14.220
So-so-so that's when we started gettin' traction
in our education 'cause we started gettin'

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.110
a little bit more stability.

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:21.880
And I-I guess the other thing, the question
would-would say is well then how was it that

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:27.380
you actually became an astronaut? Or what-what
made you become an astronaut?

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:32.770
And I think I could point to three events
in my life that sort of took me to that, to

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:37.090
that, to that point or to this road that I'm
now walking on.

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:43.580
The first, I think I have to give thanks to
my migrant farm working background because

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:48.670
I remember as a kid when we used to go work
in the fields we used to go in the darkness

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.809
of night right before dawn, before the sun
comes up. You drive out to the fields.

00:20:52.809 --> 00:20:58.510
So you go out in country away from light pollution
and my favorite part of the, of the trip was

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:03.910
when we got there I was able to get out, it
was dark and I could look up and no light

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:07.461
pollution from city lights or anything and
you could see the dark sky. And you could

00:21:07.461 --> 00:21:13.530
see the stars and they were, they almost like
in 3D they were so clear. And-and so I just

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:17.960
had that attraction to it. Probably didn't
hurt the fact that Star Trek was on during

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:18.960
that time.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.050
[laughter]

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:22.820
But-but-but-but really that's what attracted
me.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:28.590
And then, and then the next one was when I
was about 10 years old. Unfortunately I'm

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:35.520
old enough to remember the-the tail end of
the Apollo program and I remember Apollo 17

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.460
very clear.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:44.880
We, as you guys are know or oh yeah you guys
are so young you guys wouldn't know, but-but-but

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.570
you guys may have read in the history books,
how's that?

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.870
[laughter]

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:55.900
When there was an Apollo mission and there
was a moon walk they would preempt programming

00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:01.740
on TV and you would have folks like Walter
Cronkite narrate the moon walk.

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:07.860
And of course the very last mission Apollo
17, everybody-everybody would stop and watch

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:12.100
the mission and-and everybody in the U.S.
and the world I imagine. And the Hernandez

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.000
family was no different.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.600
Only difference is the fact that we had an
old black and white TV and I'm not sure if

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.860
you guys have seen pictures of those old black
and white TV's, but they're those big consoles

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:27.430
like a piece of furniture. They have a screen
in the middle and integrated speakers, four

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:31.070
little legs and a big honking knob to change
the channel. That was our TV.

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:37.190
Only difference with ours was that ours was
black and white and-and snowy picture. And

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:42.470
I remember sometimes you'd lose that horizontal
sync, you get that bar in the picture, and

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:46.890
so the only way to fix it is you hit it on
the side and then it would stop. Now that

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:48.230
was our TV.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:54.130
And at that time there wasn't any satellite
TV programming, but we did have cable TV,

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:58.700
but God forbid we have cable 'cause we couldn't
afford it so we have the next best thing.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:04.300
We had what was called rabbit ear antennas
to increase reception on top of the TV.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:09.740
And so of course whenever something important
came on the family wanted a nice clear picture,

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:15.090
right? So guess who they called to adjust
the TV? I was, since I was the youngest one,

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:17.191
right, I was the official channel changer.

00:23:17.191 --> 00:23:22.340
And I know, I know now why this happens but
'cause I'm an electrical engineer, but as

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:26.170
soon as I grabbed the antennae guess what
happened? The picture would improve, right?

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:27.170
[laughter]

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.031
And guess what my Dad would say? "Stay there."

00:23:29.031 --> 00:23:30.031
[laughter]

00:23:30.031 --> 00:23:36.430
So-so here I am in a contortionists mode trying
to watch-watch TV while tryin' to keep Mom

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:40.961
and Dad and my, the rest of my siblings happy
and them watching a good, a good picture,

00:23:40.961 --> 00:23:48.179
right? And-and I also remember, I also remember
whenever we needed to change the channel guess

00:23:48.179 --> 00:23:51.820
who the official channel changer was? It was
yours truly, as well.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:58.440
And I remember one day when-when-when I went
up for the umpteenth time to change the channel

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:05.120
my, I figured I'd say okay I'm gonna say somethin'
very subtle to my Dad 'cause you had to understand

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:10.760
my Dad. You can't, you can't direct him to
do anything or you'll get yourself slapped.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.360
But-but I would say I'm gonna do somethin'
very political and just kinda say it very

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.679
subtle as-as he sent me for the twelfth time
to change the channel that day.

00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:23.720
I said, "Hey Dad you know you know they have
those new TVs now that have remote control

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:28.760
and they're color too." And-and then so I
went quickly, I said I'm gonna go quickly

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.710
and change the channel so he doesn't get mad
at me. So I changed it. And then I went back

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:38.130
and sat down and then he stood up and he looked
at me and he kinda like a little pitiful little

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:39.140
shake in his head --

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.140
[laughter]

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:44.970
He says, "Son", he says, "why do I need a
remote control when I have you?"

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:46.130
[laughter]

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.820
And then he said, "You-you want color?" He
says, "You want color?" He says, "Use your

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.190
imagination that way you can put any color
you want."

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.190
[laughter]

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:54.190
That's that.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:58.230
So he had a practical answer for that. We
kept our TV for the, for the next few years

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.204
until it finally went out. That's when we
got a new one.

00:25:00.204 --> 00:25:07.200
But-but I remember the images, the images
that we saw on TV of the astronauts walking

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.641
on the moon. I remember seeing them so vividly.
It's one-sixth the gravity so when they were

00:25:11.641 --> 00:25:17.170
walking in their space, in their, in their
lunar suits jumping and doing slow motion

00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:21.770
maneuvers it's, it kinda like captivated me.
I sat down in front and watched.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:26.900
Then I would go outside and I would see the
moon up there and I would stare at it for

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.900
a few minutes, come back and watch, watch
'em again on TV. And then I would do that

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.840
about four or five times.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:41.010
And that's when the-the actual idea for me
came to say, "You know that's what I wanna

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.740
be. I wanna be an astronaut."

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:46.700
I'm sure every nine, ten year old kid at that
age wanted to be an astronaut too.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:50.980
And that's the other thing I gotta give credit
to my parents, is I shared that dream with

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:57.470
them and instead of them saying, "Hey you're
shootin' too high. Maybe you oughta just think

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:01.270
about finishing high school going to college,"
they actually nurtured that dream.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:04.360
That's why I think they would have made good
psychologists 'cause they-they fed that dream,

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:09.559
they nurtured it. They said, "Anything's possible
in this country," they said. "Just get yourself

00:26:09.559 --> 00:26:14.340
a good education and work hard. You put those
two ingredients together you can do whatever

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:15.720
you want."

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:21.370
I'm sure knowing-knowing how my Dad is, I'm
sure what he was thinking behind in the back

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:24.040
of his head he was probably saying, "Poor
guy doesn't stand a chance, but let's not

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:25.350
burst his bubble."

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:26.350
[laughter]

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:31.520
But-but no, but they actually, they actually
did nurture-nurture that dream and that's-that's

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.840
when at the same time my education started
to gain traction.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:41.600
So the third part, the third event that sort
of what I call "sealed the deal" for me to

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:46.940
become an astronaut was when I was a senior
in high school. And that was when I heard

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:55.770
over the radio that some guy named Franklin
Chang hyphen Diaz got selected as the first

00:26:55.770 --> 00:27:01.080
Hispanic astronaut. And I said, "Wow." I said,
"Chang," okay I wasn't too crazy about the

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.080
Chang part but --

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.080
[laughter]

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.370
But the Diaz, I could relate to the Diaz.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:06.370
[laughter]

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:10.680
I mean that's like Hernandez. And so I started
reading about him. I started reading about

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:14.720
him and you know what I found out? I found
out that there was many similarities between

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:22.020
him and I. He came from a humble background
from Costa Rica. He had brown skin like me.

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:30.040
He spoke English with an accent like me. Yet
he was a U.S. astronaut.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:35.630
And so I kinda got jealous. Jealous in a good
way 'cause I said, "You know if he was able

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:40.090
to do it, why can't I do it?" And that sort
of empowered me.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:45.090
And that goes back to what you guys are here.
You guys are also role models in your community.

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:51.230
That if folks go out there, young kids go
out there and see you, and you see kids like

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:56.390
you, you empower them to say, "He looks just
like me. He was able to do it. Why can't I

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:57.390
do it?"

00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:58.740
And that, I think that's what's important.

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:06.070
And so that's when I made the personal promise
to myself to-to get selected and work as an

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:07.179
astronaut.

00:28:07.179 --> 00:28:13.470
And so I went to college, Pacific. You guys
heard my-my-my background in my work. I went

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:17.430
Pacific, went to graduate school at Santa
Barbara, and then started working down the

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:22.130
road here at Lawrence Livermore National Lab.
I worked here 14 years at Lawrence Livermore

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:23.130
Lab.

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:29.431
And I started applying to NASA. And-and Tiffany
I applied 12 times. Twelve years in a row.

00:28:29.431 --> 00:28:35.559
So the-the-the other key is perseverance;
it's perseverance. 'Cause I applied the first

00:28:35.559 --> 00:28:41.880
six years, I would just get a thanks, a postcard
saying, "We received your application. Don't

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.270
call us; we'll call you" kind of thing.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:44.510
[laughter]

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:49.429
And-and-and-and so I just started building
my career, my curriculum and started gettin'

00:28:49.429 --> 00:28:56.860
work of becoming a pilot, scuba diver, and
doing work related to the space industry.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:00.170
And that's, six years into the process I got
my first call.

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:04.960
And the selection process is, is actually
pretty simple; gettin' selected is the tough

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.580
part, but the process is pretty simple.

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:13.450
It-it-it's basically there's over 4,000 people
that apply each year and they don't select

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:17.190
a class every year. They'll select it every
two or four years.

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:23.290
And what they do is they review those 4,000
and then after that they'll select about 300

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:27.830
where they'll take a closer look at your application.
If you have technical publications they'll

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:30.730
ask for 'em so they can read 'em. They'll
talk to your boss.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:35.620
After those 300 are reviewed they'll down
select to 100. What I call "the 100 lucky

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:41.890
ones." Because these 100 whenever there's
a selection that year get invited to spend

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:45.170
a week at NASA, the Johnson Space Center.

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:52.190
And there you spend one week where you go
through a series of psychological tests and

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.610
make sure that you're not crazy and obviously
we need some improvement in that process.

00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:57.150
[laughter]

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:05.799
And-and-and also-also they go very detailed
medical exams and I mean very detailed and

00:30:05.799 --> 00:30:10.120
I'm not sure if any, if there's any males
over 40 but if-if you are over 40 you know

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.120
what I'm talking about.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.270
[laughter]

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:18.640
And then, and then, and then, and then it
ends, it ends with a, it ends with a-a series

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:25.559
of interviews with a panel of about 12 to
18 people. A lot of 'em sittin' astronauts.

00:30:25.559 --> 00:30:27.760
And then after that everybody goes home.

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:33.280
And then from there about 20 percent get medically
disqualified, usually eyesight, somethin'

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:37.870
wrong with their ticker, or hearing's not
up to standards that they need.

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:45.480
And so from those 80, they'll probably select
about 40 to do a-a serious medical, I mean

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:49.350
a serious security background check; make
sure you're paying your taxes, you're a good

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:50.350
citizen and all that.

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:55.610
From those 40 then they'll select anywhere
from 10 to 18 astronauts for that particular

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:56.610
class.

00:30:56.610 --> 00:30:58.070
And that's how the process is.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:04.510
So year six was my first year that I got invited.
I was made it to that 100 and to that 80,

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:12.549
to that 40, and then guess what? I didn't
get selected. So that was in '98, right '98.

00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:16.980
So I had to wait another two years. I kept
applying, kept applying.

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:23.610
And then in 2000 again I made it to the 100,
80, 40. This time I didn't tell a lot of people

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:28.690
'cause then I didn't have to explain a lot
as to why I didn't get selected. And it was

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:30.620
a good thing I didn't because I didn't get
selected.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:31.800
[laughter]

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:37.870
And so, and so once again it, after eight
years of applying and two interviews, I came

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:42.290
out empty handed. So I just kept applying.

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:47.860
Four years later I was invited before those
four years after the eighth year I was invited

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:52.840
to come and work at NASA as an engineer. I
worked there and then four years later they

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:58.190
did another selection round and, which is
my twelfth year in the whole process. And

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:00.630
that's when I finally got selected. That was
2004.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:09.040
So-so what happens then is-is your class shows
up from all over the country; they come from

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:16.030
all walks of life. They're researchers, they're
engineers, they're doctors, geologists, from

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:20.440
the military. And they show up as a class
and they start training.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.850
So we train, 'cause obviously we're not, we're
not qualified to for a space, be assigned

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:27.730
to a space mission so we train for two years.

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:34.549
Once you finish the training then you get
a technical assignment and then you get assigned

00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:35.549
to a mission.

00:32:35.549 --> 00:32:41.130
So that's what happened to me. I showed up
at 2004; trained for two years; 2006 had a

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:46.001
technical assignment; and then in 2008 I got
assigned to a mission. And then last year

00:32:46.001 --> 00:32:48.679
was when the mission was fully realized.

00:32:48.679 --> 00:32:55.490
And so-so-so the mission that we got selected,
that I got selected for was STS-128. The actual,

00:32:55.490 --> 00:33:00.070
usually it doesn't match up that well, but
in this particular case it did match up very

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:06.660
well; 128 stands for the hundredth and twenty-eighth
mission of the Space Shuttle Fleet. And it

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.870
was aboard Discovery.

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:15.400
I was the flight engineer because and I think
it the coolest position because I sit right

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:20.800
behind the-the commander and the pilot kind
of like in the middle and I have the best

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:25.049
seat of the house 'cause it's the panoramic
view is what I call it as we take off into

00:33:25.049 --> 00:33:26.410
space.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:30.980
The Mission Specialist Number One is to my
right and then, so that's four of us on the

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:31.980
flight deck.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:37.280
And then on the mid-deck you'll-you'll see
we'll have three astronauts there. Those are

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:41.179
usually our space walkers 'cause they don't
have any responsibilities during our ascent

00:33:41.179 --> 00:33:47.120
or descent of our mission, and so they're
just sittin' there as passengers in the mid-deck.

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:52.070
And then what you're gonna see is you're gonna
see the-the actual launch sequence of our

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:53.070
mission.

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:58.980
We launched after several scrubs, we launched
on August 28th about 11:30 at night; it was

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.429
a night launch.

00:34:00.429 --> 00:34:05.210
And you're gonna see how-how the launch goes,
the sequence goes. You're gonna see the three

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:07.049
engines light up.

00:34:07.049 --> 00:34:12.970
Inside the way it feels is you-you hear the
engines light up, you feel this gentle vibration

00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:16.889
as you're sittin' there, you've been up there
for about three hours so you're ready to go.

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:17.889
And--

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:18.889
[laughter]

00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:21.229
and believe me you're up there for three hours,
right? And one of the things I wanna tell

00:34:21.229 --> 00:34:25.919
you is that you don't wanna screw up because
if you launch you know that in eight and a

00:34:25.919 --> 00:34:30.069
half minutes you're up in space and you can
go to the restroom and activate the restroom

00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:31.149
and go to the restroom up there.

00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:36.690
Whereas if they scrub, you gotta wait another
hour and half be-before they finally extract

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:37.890
you so you can go to the restroom.

00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:38.890
[laughter]

00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:42.470
So-so you're always crossing your fingers,
"I hope we launch. I hope we launch."

00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:43.470
[laughter]

00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:47.589
And-and so, and so the way the launch sequence
goes is-is-is they light up the three rocket,

00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:53.079
the three engines, you feel the vibration,
and then about two seconds later the two solid

00:34:53.079 --> 00:34:54.900
rocket boosters light up.

00:34:54.900 --> 00:35:01.690
The-the noise level goes up in order of magnitude,
the vibration is more violent. Just when you

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:06.569
think the whole thing is gonna fall to one
side and fall over, you feel a push in your

00:35:06.569 --> 00:35:08.720
back and you're off to the races.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:14.450
You're up, you're up accelerating and those
two solid rocket boosters are only, they provide

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:19.300
the thrust, the major thrust at the beginning.
They're only lit up for two and half minutes.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:23.890
In two and half minutes explosive bolts separate
them, parachutes come out on them, and they're

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:26.950
recovered in the ocean by a boat that's waitin'
for them.

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:32.229
The three engines are fed by the-the main
tank, the central tank that the big tank.

00:35:32.229 --> 00:35:38.819
It's actually two little tanks that-that-that
has liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen and

00:35:38.819 --> 00:35:42.920
they're feeding the three engines and they
go on for another six minutes.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:50.720
And then, and-and at that point you're going
17,500 miles an hour; you're up about 280-300

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:55.979
miles up above, and you're going around the
world every 90 minutes.

00:35:55.979 --> 00:36:04.150
And so we were up there 14 days. I, we went,
which meant we went around the world 217 times,

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:08.869
about 5.7 million miles. I wish we had frequent
flies with programs --

00:36:08.869 --> 00:36:09.869
[laughter]

00:36:09.869 --> 00:36:13.660
with the airlines 'cause then there would
be, I would be sittin' pretty.

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:18.390
But-but-but you'll see us. We rendezvoused
with the International Space Station; physically

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:22.619
docked to them, docked with them and then,
and did our work, and then undocked and came

00:36:22.619 --> 00:36:23.619
back home.

00:36:23.619 --> 00:36:31.930
And so we start the video you can see what
 --

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:32.930
[pause]

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:33.930
The first thing you're gonna see is you're
gonna see our mission patch. That's the first

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:39.700
order of business of any new crew. You gotta
have a patch and you gotta design it and of

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:43.259
course everybody's last name is on there and
there was seven of us.

00:36:43.259 --> 00:36:47.410
We had three main objectives and I'll explain
'em as we go along.

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:51.720
But right now the mission director is giving
our commander the go ahead to go and launch.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:37:00.200
If-if the volume can go up.

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:23.805
&gt;&gt;Mission Director:[unintelligible] Mother
Nature is cooperating so it looks like [unintelligible]

00:37:23.805 --> 00:37:24.805
We wish you and your team good luck and Godspeed.

00:37:24.805 --> 00:37:25.805
[pause]

00:37:25.805 --> 00:37:26.805
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Godspeed, NASA, caption
and the crew of Discovery. Thank you everyone

00:37:26.805 --> 00:37:27.805
who helped [unintelligible]. I'm gonna step
up the signs on the International Space Station.

00:37:27.805 --> 00:37:28.805
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: [unintelligible]

00:37:28.805 --> 00:37:29.805
Roger.

00:37:29.805 --> 00:37:30.805
[unintelligible]

00:37:30.805 --> 00:37:31.805
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Discovery, roger. [unintelligible]

00:37:31.805 --> 00:37:32.805
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: This is the mid-deck guys;
the three of 'em.

00:37:32.805 --> 00:37:33.805
[unintelligible]

00:37:33.805 --> 00:37:38.310
That's the three engines lighting up.

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:39.310
[sound of Shuttle taking off]

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:40.310
And the solid rocket boosters.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:41.310
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: [unintelligible] five,
six, seven [unintelligible]

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:42.310
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: This is Discovery all
program.

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:46.160
[sound of Shuttle taking off]

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:52.520
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: [unintelligible] Discovery.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:38:01.609
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernadez: The first four minutes is
like an eticket ride in Disneyland. It's actually

00:38:01.609 --> 00:38:03.200
pretty-pretty neat.

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:08.940
The second four and a half minutes the g-forces
start building up and-and it feels --

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.460
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: [unintelligible] Alright.

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:15.829
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernadez: and it feels like first you
have a newborn baby on-on your chest and that

00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:20.749
baby grows to like a 600 pound gorilla 'cause
you-you have trouble breathing.

00:38:20.749 --> 00:38:23.910
There you see the two solid rocket motors
separating.

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.499
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Assist is just kickin'
off.

00:38:25.499 --> 00:38:28.779
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: The-the exhaustion of the
three engines continuing on.

00:38:28.779 --> 00:38:33.489
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: [unintelligible] Copy,
Jose.

00:38:33.489 --> 00:38:34.489
[pause]

00:38:34.489 --> 00:38:38.210
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: There it is.

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:39.210
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: It's-it's the exhaust --

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:41.710
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: [unintelligible] your
seat if you want to, do it.

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:44.789
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: And right there you saw
the explosive bolts for the separation.

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:47.730
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Alright. Good job.

00:38:47.730 --> 00:38:50.079
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Thanks. [unintelligible]

00:38:50.079 --> 00:38:54.790
I'm waitin' for the twenty second flood decks.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:59.579
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: Next up you're gonna see
is the separation from the external tank.

00:38:59.579 --> 00:39:05.560
The external tank is not, is not recoverable;
it breaks up into pieces as it enters the

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:06.560
atmosphere.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:11.999
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Started it at 56. I
will release it at 16 after.

00:39:11.999 --> 00:39:12.999
[pause]

00:39:12.999 --> 00:39:17.490
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernadez: And then in eight and a half
minutes we reach MECO, which is called main

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:24.170
engine cut off. And there you can see that's
me, that's waving there saying, "Hey, I can't

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:28.349
believe we reached space here." Let me, being
the good engineer and scientist that I am,

00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:33.140
"Let me do a test here." And first thing I
do is I throw somethin' say, "Does this thing

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:34.140
float?"

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.999
[laughter]

00:39:35.999 --> 00:39:37.619
I said, "I guess we are in space."

00:39:37.619 --> 00:39:39.859
[laughter]

00:39:39.859 --> 00:39:45.479
One of our objectives was to take one of our
crew mates, Nicole Stott, up to the International

00:39:45.479 --> 00:39:49.309
Space Station. We were gonna leave her up
there for three months and bring back someone

00:39:49.309 --> 00:39:52.160
who had been up there for three months.

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:56.519
The, once we get up there one of the first
things we do is we open up the payload bay

00:39:56.519 --> 00:40:02.309
doors. We do that because the radiators are
on the inside portion of the payload bay doors;

00:40:02.309 --> 00:40:05.859
they provide the cooling to our electronics
equipment so it's very important we do that

00:40:05.859 --> 00:40:06.859
first.

00:40:06.859 --> 00:40:10.411
And then the folks that were down in the mid-deck;
three folks that were down in the mid-deck

00:40:10.411 --> 00:40:15.210
start cleaning up the mid-deck. They remove
and fold the chairs they were on and start

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:16.210
making room.

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:21.549
There's Danny Olivas, he's from El Paso. And
they activate the galley and they activate

00:40:21.549 --> 00:40:22.901
the restroom, which you see right there.

00:40:22.901 --> 00:40:31.049
And-and-and then I myself start puttin' together
the portable on-board computers. And these

00:40:31.049 --> 00:40:34.029
are the ones that are gonna help up during
the rendezvous with the International Space

00:40:34.029 --> 00:40:35.029
Station.

00:40:35.029 --> 00:40:39.999
Our Commander C.J. Sturckow, he's the last
one to get out of his pressure suit. While

00:40:39.999 --> 00:40:43.700
he does that other folks and I'm puttin' the
computers together; other folks are puttin'

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:48.680
other pieces of equipment together including
the psychoergometer. Remember that there's

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:53.260
zero-g, you're in micro-g environment so we
have to keep our legs muscles strong so we

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.019
exercise every day; there's a protocol.

00:40:56.019 --> 00:41:00.640
Every morning we do the same thing we do at
home with respect to hygiene. We brush our

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:06.450
teeth, we, those of us that need it, we shave.
And-and then we look at what our day's assignment

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:08.920
is for-for that day.

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:14.059
One of, the next day we do what's called an
orbital maneuver system burn, OMS burn, that

00:41:14.059 --> 00:41:18.809
bring us closer to the International Space
Station for our rendezvous.

00:41:18.809 --> 00:41:23.711
There you see Nicole Stott with her binoculars
looking at what's gonna be her home for the

00:41:23.711 --> 00:41:27.660
next three months. That's about 20 miles away
as she was looking at it.

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:33.329
And of course we get closer and closer. When
we get about 600 feet we do a maneuver what's

00:41:33.329 --> 00:41:39.420
called a flip maneuver where the station folks
are taking pictures of our underbelly.

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:44.440
This is the perspective of the station crew
as they see us approaching the-the International

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.440
Space Station.

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:49.660
We stop; we do the maneuver; they take high
resolution pictures and that's to make sure

00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:54.999
we didn't suffer any damage on our thermal
protection system, our belly, during ascent.

00:41:54.999 --> 00:42:00.079
Once we're cleared for that then they give
us the go ahead for Prox Ops, Proximity Operations.

00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:06.079
And this requires a lot of high level crew
resource management as we get in closer and

00:42:06.079 --> 00:42:12.940
closer into the, onto the International Space
Station and basically dock, physically dock

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:13.940
with them.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:14.940
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Maybe about point oh
six.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:15.940
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Here comes a [unintelligible]

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:16.940
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Okay.

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:17.940
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Get it back --

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:18.940
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Yeah. That's okay. Yeah.

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:19.940
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Good, a firm idea of
what it is.

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:20.940
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Exactly Techs warned
us about that.

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:21.940
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Okay.

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.250
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: I think you got it up
to about --

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:29.479
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernadez: During docking our commander
is the one that's in control. The pilot's

00:42:29.479 --> 00:42:37.890
giving him cues and I'm down at the computers
giving them the-the rates which is the, which

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:41.480
is the speed at which we're closing in; the-the
distance â

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.910
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Overlap.

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:47.140
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: and trajectory.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.140
[pause]

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:55.450
And you'll see when we finally bump into the
Station, you'll see us bump right there.

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:56.700
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: [unintelligible] fired.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:43:01.170
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: At this point now we're
waiting for the latches to latch onto the

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:05.979
Station and then we're gonna get some confirming
cues, some lights that tell us that capture

00:43:05.979 --> 00:43:06.979
is confirmed.

00:43:06.979 --> 00:43:07.979
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Alright.

00:43:07.979 --> 00:43:09.619
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Alright. Yeah.

00:43:09.619 --> 00:43:10.619
[astronauts clapping]

00:43:10.619 --> 00:43:12.910
&gt;&gt;various voices: Yea!!!! Alright! Good job!

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:17.829
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: We're happy that we didn't
bounce off of the Station. This allows us

00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:22.440
to open our-our-our door that has access to
the Station.

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:26.839
The Station folks do the same thing at their
end and there's a little a vestibule that

00:43:26.839 --> 00:43:31.660
basically serves as the interface between
us and the International Space Station.

00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:39.200
So-so-so now the crew on the other side, Gennady
Padelka was the commander, Russian. He rings

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:44.500
the door, the-the bell that basically announces
the arrival of a new crew.

00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.910
[sound of bell ringing]

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:51.700
And so there's six of them there and seven
of us. So that's 13 astronauts at once in

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:57.769
space representing five countries. So truly
a international affair there of-of us working

00:43:57.769 --> 00:43:58.769
together.

00:43:58.769 --> 00:44:04.029
You see how happy there, they are of seeing
us. And I can tell you that they're happy

00:44:04.029 --> 00:44:07.750
not because we're such good buds, but these
guys have been up there for about three or

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:12.339
four months eating a bunch of dehydrated food
and they know we've got fresh vegetables and

00:44:12.339 --> 00:44:13.339
fruit --

00:44:13.339 --> 00:44:14.339
[laughter]

00:44:14.339 --> 00:44:16.619
So-so they're saying, "Oh yeah. What kind
of food did you bring?"

00:44:16.619 --> 00:44:18.859
[laughter]

00:44:18.859 --> 00:44:25.950
One of the second objectives, the second objective
of us was to take out the MPLM, Multi-Purpose

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:31.819
Logistics Module which is basically a small
portable lib, portable laboratory. It's more

00:44:31.819 --> 00:44:37.619
like a storage thing than anything where we-we
pick it up out of the payload bay door with

00:44:37.619 --> 00:44:42.700
the robotic arm and then we install it on
one of the ports of the Station. And you can

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:48.849
see Kevin Ford had the honors of doing that.
I had the honors of de-installing it and putting

00:44:48.849 --> 00:44:51.789
it back into the, onto the Shuttle.

00:44:51.789 --> 00:44:57.180
And once we do that it allows our colleagues
to actually open the door from the inside

00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:01.119
of this MPLM and it gives us access to inside
of it.

00:45:01.119 --> 00:45:06.630
You can see us wearing goggles and masks because
for the first time someone's going in there

00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:10.739
in a zero-g environment. So there could be
metal shavings, dust particulates, and it's

00:45:10.739 --> 00:45:14.910
not until the filtering system catches all
that that we're allowed to go in there without

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:16.269
any protection.

00:45:16.269 --> 00:45:20.660
Once we're allowed to go in there we begin
the sequence of-of basically transferring

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:27.180
over seven tons of material from that Multi-Purpose
Logistics Module onto the International Space

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.180
Station.

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:32.690
And then we transfer about one ton of material
back in which includes trash and any equipment

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:36.259
that they no longer need on the Station.

00:45:36.259 --> 00:45:44.450
Nicole here you can see her take a, an experiment
that she started on the Shuttle and transfers

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:48.910
it to the Station because it's her experiment
and she's gonna stay on the Station for the

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:53.140
next three months, so all her experiments
travel with her as well. And so here we are

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:55.049
puttin' that together.

00:45:55.049 --> 00:46:00.499
Here you see us having a meeting. Really orientation
is not an issue 'cause there is no right up

00:46:00.499 --> 00:46:03.920
or down so we basically meet in any orientation.

00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:04.920
[laughter]

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.660
And we're just discussing what we're gonna
to be doing the next day.

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:12.249
And of course the next day is our first space
walk. The first space walk was conducted by

00:46:12.249 --> 00:46:14.520
Danny Olivas and Nicole Stott.

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:18.619
And-and you see Tim Kopra there. He's the
one we traded for. He's the one that came

00:46:18.619 --> 00:46:19.619
home with us.

00:46:19.619 --> 00:46:26.500
But he and I have the dubious honor of making
sure that these guys put on their space suits

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:32.270
correctly because if you, if you see if you
realize the space suit is the only thing that's

00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:35.019
gonna be keeping them alive. That's their
space ship once they do their space walk.

00:46:35.019 --> 00:46:39.980
And we gotta make sure that the-the helmets
are well sealed, the gloves, the boots are

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:43.880
well sealed, the life support system is working
properly, the computers are working properly,

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:48.969
communications working properly, the cameras,
the lights, everything's working before we

00:46:48.969 --> 00:46:50.940
give 'em the go to go outside.

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:54.719
And so we go through all those checks. It's
about a three hour process before they're

00:46:54.719 --> 00:47:01.430
even out the door. And-and so once we're convinced
we get out; they depressurize; it allows 'em

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:04.762
to open up the outside door and-and out they
go.

00:47:04.762 --> 00:47:10.579
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: See the interlock thermal
cover is open. You can egress the airlock.

00:47:10.579 --> 00:47:12.382
Remember to avoid that MMOD [unintelligible].

00:47:12.382 --> 00:47:13.382
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: [unintelligible]

00:47:13.382 --> 00:47:15.960
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: And we do have some cameras
outside where, that we control and we see

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:22.489
this through cameras. You can see Danny coming
out and initiating the space walk. They always

00:47:22.489 --> 00:47:23.759
go out in pairs of two.

00:47:23.759 --> 00:47:28.219
You can see those yellow handles; those are
the handles that astronauts translate in.

00:47:28.219 --> 00:47:32.700
And-and they move from-from-from module to
module with those handles.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:39.059
One of the things that we do is since we don't
have cameras everywhere, we do put cameras

00:47:39.059 --> 00:47:43.869
on their helmets and that way we can see what
they're doing with respect to the work that

00:47:43.869 --> 00:47:44.950
they're doing.

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:47.271
You can see here Danny's taking a picture
of himself right now.

00:47:47.271 --> 00:47:49.130
[laughter]

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:54.309
And-and, but-but it's-it's actually good way
of us keeping track of what work they're doin'.

00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:57.759
And then when they have to move long distances
or we have to take a lot of equipment with

00:47:57.759 --> 00:48:03.141
'em, what we do is we attach 'em to the end
of the robotic arm. And Kevin Ford and I were

00:48:03.141 --> 00:48:07.130
the ones that were operating the arm while
they were conducting their space walks. So

00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:09.039
we would move 'em from place to place.

00:48:09.039 --> 00:48:13.849
And during that process you would stop and
you would see just amazing scenery, but of

00:48:13.849 --> 00:48:17.609
course you gotta continue working as-as we
went.

00:48:17.609 --> 00:48:21.619
And I mentioned that we, you-you go around
the world every 90 minutes; that means you

00:48:21.619 --> 00:48:27.249
have 45 minutes of daylight; 45 minutes of
nighttime. Just because it becomes nighttime

00:48:27.249 --> 00:48:33.239
we don't stop working. We just ask the astronauts
to turn on their helmet lights and as they

00:48:33.239 --> 00:48:36.400
turn on their helmet lights they can continue
working through the night.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:42.070
And-and-and then once daylight shows up again
then they can turn off their-their helmet

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:43.460
lights and they continue their work.

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:49.969
But-but it's certainly a-a long process. It's
about seven hours during a space walk.

00:48:49.969 --> 00:48:56.549
So these guys after-after that's done we let
'em back in and-and what we try to do is we

00:48:56.549 --> 00:49:00.920
try to extract them out of the space suits
for as quickly as we can.

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:06.569
They've been in the space suit for three hours
for prep and then seven hours out there; that's

00:49:06.569 --> 00:49:13.609
10 hours. They haven't eaten anything; they
do have a camel bag of water that they drink.

00:49:13.609 --> 00:49:17.420
And I'm guessing if they did drink it I'm
guessing they gotta go to the restroom. So

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:20.700
we try to get 'em out of there as, as quickly
as we can.

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:24.700
And then we clean up the suits and get 'em
ready for the next space walk 'cause they

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:30.789
conducted a total of three-three space walks.
Between three of the astronauts, Nicole, Danny

00:49:30.789 --> 00:49:37.690
Olivas, and Christer Fuglesang, who's a Swedish
astronaut, they did that.

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:41.900
Now while they're doing their space walks,
other astronauts are doing other things throughout

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:47.030
the mission. And one of the things is we're
transferring that, those seven tons of material.

00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:53.589
Here-here you see is a treadmill. Remember
Colbert wanted the naming rights of a module?

00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:54.900
[laughter]

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:59.859
Well, guess what? NASA wasn't about to give
him a whole module so we did the next best

00:49:59.859 --> 00:50:03.519
thing. We actually christened that the Colbert
Treadmill so --

00:50:03.519 --> 00:50:04.519
[laughter]

00:50:04.519 --> 00:50:07.960
so he got a treadmill named after him. And
there's a little sticker in there that actually

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:09.630
has his picture on there. But --

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:11.619
[laughter]

00:50:11.619 --> 00:50:16.319
but-but-but-but yeah we-we did name it after
him. We installed it and-and-and for the astronauts

00:50:16.319 --> 00:50:19.319
to have an additional piece of equipment to
exercise.

00:50:19.319 --> 00:50:26.729
And then we moved in the mat, the stuff that
belonged to Tim Kopra into the MPLM because

00:50:26.729 --> 00:50:28.900
he was gonna come home with us.

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:35.299
And then after emptying the-the front contents
of the racks we rotate the racks and guess

00:50:35.299 --> 00:50:40.339
what there's a whole bunch of other equipment
on the back side that we have remove.

00:50:40.339 --> 00:50:45.660
And we have to put things in the right order.
There's a big effort in housekeeping on the

00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:50.369
International Space Station. In other words,
whenever they say put this in this compartment,

00:50:50.369 --> 00:50:55.550
it's gotta be there because if you can't find
it, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

00:50:55.550 --> 00:51:01.019
And then we use our feet as hands 'cause obviously
we don't walk on in space so we sort of use

00:51:01.019 --> 00:51:06.910
it in novel ways to transport. Like right
there he's transporting food trays from the

00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:08.829
MPLM to the International Space Station.

00:51:08.829 --> 00:51:13.869
And then once we make some room, we have some
fun. It wouldn't be space if you couldn't

00:51:13.869 --> 00:51:20.180
have fun. And here Nicole and I are just enjoying
the free space. Then I get this bright idea,

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:24.170
I see these bungee cords there and I say,
"Come here, Nicole." And then I push her and

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:26.130
I say, "Let me get this on film."

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:28.079
[laughter]

00:51:28.079 --> 00:51:32.719
Einstein was right; for every action there
is an equal and opposite reaction.

00:51:32.719 --> 00:51:35.219
[laughter]

00:51:35.219 --> 00:51:40.140
And then we're not supposed to play with-with
food, but we got an exception here so that

00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:46.349
we can make our space eyeball. It's a Lifesaver
with water and Nicole, I mean and Tim Kopra

00:51:46.349 --> 00:51:47.349
takes care of it.

00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:48.430
[laughter]

00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:53.579
Okay, no self righteous Mexican would do this
to a tortilla: peanut butter on one side and

00:51:53.579 --> 00:51:55.250
jelly on the other but --

00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:56.250
[laughter]

00:51:56.250 --> 00:52:01.690
but it was Kevin Ford our pilot so we let
him, we let him do it, but actually it tasted

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:03.229
pretty good. I tasted it.

00:52:03.229 --> 00:52:08.219
Our-our Commander Marine gets a haircut every
three days whether he needs it or not.

00:52:08.219 --> 00:52:09.219
[laughter]

00:52:09.219 --> 00:52:14.219
And then you wonder about hygiene. This is
how we take showers and stuff; shampoo our

00:52:14.219 --> 00:52:19.459
hair we just put the shampoo on-on the hair,
get a towel, rub it in, and dry it off, and

00:52:19.459 --> 00:52:20.599
we're good to go.

00:52:20.599 --> 00:52:25.319
When we take showers we just wet the towel
and we do what's called a cowboy shower, just

00:52:25.319 --> 00:52:26.890
wet ourselves and then there.

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:30.839
You need a Ph.D. to see why this thing rotates
back and forth like that, but it's pretty

00:52:30.839 --> 00:52:35.049
interesting. Kevin Ford tried to explain to
me I couldn't get it. So I said, "Well do

00:52:35.049 --> 00:52:38.529
it to me, see if that happens to me." But
unfortunately it didn't work out like that.

00:52:38.529 --> 00:52:41.190
[laughter]

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:44.630
But it was fun, though and nevertheless it
was fun rotating like that. I said, "Let me

00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:50.250
film it on camera just so you guys can appreciate
that perspective." And if you are wondering,

00:52:50.250 --> 00:52:51.250
yes I did get dizzy.

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:53.019
[laughter]

00:52:53.019 --> 00:52:58.740
And then here-here I am at the robotics work
station. Now I'm de-installing the MPLM and

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:01.079
we're gonna install it back into the payload
bay.

00:53:01.079 --> 00:53:08.519
And-and-and then the very last night that
all 13 of us are together we have dinner together

00:53:08.519 --> 00:53:13.519
for the very first time. We usually we had
dinner at different times since we were so

00:53:13.519 --> 00:53:19.989
busy. And of course there's a, it's international
food. We had Mexican food, American, Russian

00:53:19.989 --> 00:53:26.049
food, French food, and it was just a good
feast that we had that day.

00:53:26.049 --> 00:53:31.690
And of course some people like to show off
their food eating skills; other people shouldn't

00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:32.690
show it off.

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:33.849
[laughter]

00:53:33.849 --> 00:53:39.420
The sad thing is he had been up there the
longest.

00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:40.420
[laughter]

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:45.410
There you see us toasting, drinking water
because it's from our urine processing assembly

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:50.220
system. So yes, we do drink our urine and
I promise it tastes just like water.

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:52.079
[laughter]

00:53:52.079 --> 00:53:58.690
There you see Nicole Stott saying good bye
because this is the, this is the last time

00:53:58.690 --> 00:54:05.759
we're gonna see her. She stays on the Station
side; we stay on the, on-on-on the Discovery

00:54:05.759 --> 00:54:11.930
side and we close our doors and this allows
us to initiate the undocking sequence.

00:54:11.930 --> 00:54:14.969
And believe it or not this little button is
the one that does it all.

00:54:14.969 --> 00:54:16.430
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Looks good.

00:54:16.430 --> 00:54:21.599
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernadez: It initiates the sequence
and then it initiates a process that is slow

00:54:21.599 --> 00:54:27.890
as molasses on a cold day where you then start
separating yourself from the International

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:29.119
Space Station.

00:54:29.119 --> 00:54:34.809
And actually the springs on the docking mechanism
once you undo the hooks provide the initial

00:54:34.809 --> 00:54:41.709
push for us to separate. We try not to fire
the jets a lot since we're right next to the

00:54:41.709 --> 00:54:49.049
Station. We don't want the plumes to contaminate
our solar panels. And so we-we just try to

00:54:49.049 --> 00:54:52.289
minimize, use the small jets and minimize
our movement.

00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:57.900
And like I said it takes about an hour or
so too for us to fully come out to a position

00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.459
where we can actually use the normal jets.

00:55:00.459 --> 00:55:06.249
And-and during that time I'm-I'm-I'm staffing
the computers that are giving us all the rendezvous

00:55:06.249 --> 00:55:12.170
information rates, distances, and trajectory
and feeding that information to our-our pilot

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:19.299
who is now at the controls of the Shuttle
and-and-and watching our separation.

00:55:19.299 --> 00:55:25.539
In about-about 20 minutes you'll see us be
about 20-30 feet away and which is about there

00:55:25.539 --> 00:55:32.809
and in about 15-20 more minutes we get a couple
hundred feet away and we get a full view of

00:55:32.809 --> 00:55:34.109
the International Space Station.

00:55:34.109 --> 00:55:39.690
At that point we begin our own circular maneuver
around the International Space Station, because

00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:43.779
now it's our turn to take high resolution
pictures of the whole Station.

00:55:43.779 --> 00:55:48.440
The engineers on the ground are gonna go ahead
and-and look at these pictures; make sure

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:53.651
there's no micro-meteorite orbital debris
hits on any part of the structure of the International

00:55:53.651 --> 00:55:55.150
Space Station.

00:55:55.150 --> 00:55:59.339
And that's the circular trajectory the one
that I'm feeding to Kevin Ford; make sure

00:55:59.339 --> 00:56:05.579
that he's, he is indeed flying a circular
pattern around. At this point he's-he's pretty

00:56:05.579 --> 00:56:10.579
much complete and he's happy as a clam 'cause
that was a big maneuver for him.

00:56:10.579 --> 00:56:16.479
This then allows us to put on the-the pressure
suits because we're ready to come home now

00:56:16.479 --> 00:56:21.901
and-and so we fire the jets; the atmospheric
captures us and all of a sudden you start

00:56:21.901 --> 00:56:23.589
feeling gravity.

00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:28.809
And let me tell you after being 14 days in
zero-g, gravity does suck.

00:56:28.809 --> 00:56:30.319
[laughter]

00:56:30.319 --> 00:56:36.849
There you see the, the-the fact that we went
25 times the speed of sound. We broke the

00:56:36.849 --> 00:56:39.789
mock 25 barrier as we come in.

00:56:39.789 --> 00:56:43.979
The Flight Director giving us last minute
instructions. We were waved off of Kennedy

00:56:43.979 --> 00:56:48.799
Space Center for the second day in a row because
of bad weather. So we ended up landing at

00:56:48.799 --> 00:56:50.539
Edwards Air Force Base.

00:56:50.539 --> 00:56:57.660
And Eric Boe, one of our fellow astronauts,
is the Cap-Com. He's giving us all the winds,

00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:01.769
the weather, the data, the runway number for
us to come in.

00:57:01.769 --> 00:57:03.479
There we are at about 80-90,000 feet.

00:57:03.479 --> 00:57:04.920
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: [unintelligible]

00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:10.549
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: Pretty soon the, the Shuttle
starts behaving like an airplane; the aerodynamic

00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:11.949
surfaces start taking effect.

00:57:11.949 --> 00:57:15.236
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Kevin, forward and control
of the stick at this moment.

00:57:15.236 --> 00:57:19.809
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: And then for about a period
of about 30 seconds our-our pilot takes control,

00:57:19.809 --> 00:57:23.440
but the main control is our commander, he's
the one that actually lands it.

00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:26.289
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Hear a sonic boom.

00:57:26.289 --> 00:57:27.289
[pause]

00:57:27.289 --> 00:57:32.959
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: The late afternoon sunshine
gleaming off its thermal protection heat shield.

00:57:32.959 --> 00:57:33.959
[pause]

00:57:33.959 --> 00:57:39.150
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Three minutes until
touchdown. Rich Sturckow has taken back the

00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:45.349
stick from Kevin Ford. The vortices off the
wing's very obvious. Discovery continuing

00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:52.009
its turn around the heading alignment circle,
aligning with runway 22 at Edwards Airforce

00:57:52.009 --> 00:57:53.009
Base.

00:57:53.009 --> 00:57:54.009
[pause]

00:57:54.009 --> 00:57:55.009
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: This is the --

00:57:55.009 --> 00:57:56.069
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: [unintelligible] landing
gear

00:57:56.069 --> 00:57:58.200
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: [unintelligible]. Thank
you Jose.

00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:03.259
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: This is the perspective
of the, of the pilots using the Heads Up Display,

00:58:03.259 --> 00:58:08.249
HUD display. That's what they're looking at
right now.

00:58:08.249 --> 00:58:14.359
They're making the final turn onto to final
and that green line you see there that is

00:58:14.359 --> 00:58:20.290
the runway. It's highlighted right now, and
it's steep. It looks like we're goin' straight

00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:21.290
into it.

00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:25.480
At this point you're about 10,000 feet, 300
miles an hour is what it says right there.

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:32.380
And you see the runway there. You're coming
in at a pretty steep angle. You do what's

00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:33.500
called a "flare maneuver."

00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:43.172
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Very nice. You did [unintelligible]

00:58:43.172 --> 00:58:44.172
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Yep.

00:58:44.172 --> 00:58:45.172
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: [unintelligible]

00:58:45.172 --> 00:58:46.172
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: You see the speed brakes
are out.

00:58:46.172 --> 00:58:50.719
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Speed brakes right at
50. [unintelligible] Slow lag, down to the

00:58:50.719 --> 00:58:52.949
[unintelligible], 400 [unintelligible] give
us --

00:58:52.949 --> 00:58:55.109
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: Very important not to forget
the gear.

00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:56.109
[laughter]

00:58:56.109 --> 00:58:57.560
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: [unintelligible]

00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:02.460
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: And you can see how C.J.
Sturckow, our commander, lands this. I mean

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:09.349
look at the back wheels they just touch at
the same time. So he's-he's a good Marine

00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:10.349
pilot.

00:59:10.349 --> 00:59:11.349
[pause]

00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:13.859
Look at that.

00:59:13.859 --> 00:59:14.859
[pause]

00:59:14.859 --> 00:59:21.079
He brings the nose down. Once we have a delayed
shoot deploy; once the nose gear comes down

00:59:21.079 --> 00:59:27.160
they deploy the chute to start slowing us
down a bit more. This then allows C.J. to

00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:30.809
put the brake pedals and come to a full stop.

00:59:30.809 --> 00:59:35.709
When he announces, "Full stop," that's when
they stop the stop watch and-and the official

00:59:35.709 --> 00:59:38.160
end of the mission is recorded at that time.

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:40.569
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Houston Discovery wheel
stop.

00:59:40.569 --> 00:59:45.390
&gt;&gt;unidentified voice: Copy. Wheels stop. Welcome
home, Discovery. Congratulations on an extremely

00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:51.019
successful mission, stepping up science to
a new level on the International Space Station.

00:59:51.019 --> 00:59:55.920
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: And let me tell you, four
hours later after that we were in [Boron]

00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:58.849
at Domingo's. I was, I had a beer in my hand
and --

00:59:58.849 --> 01:00:00.839
[laughter]

01:00:00.839 --> 01:00:04.339
and eating carne asada so it was pretty good.

01:00:04.339 --> 01:00:05.339
[laughter]

01:00:05.339 --> 01:00:06.339
It was pretty cool.

01:00:06.339 --> 01:00:11.000
So-so-so that's how, that's sort of like the
summary of a typical mission to the International

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.249
Space Station is.

01:00:13.249 --> 01:00:14.719
[applause]

01:00:14.719 --> 01:00:17.660
And certainly --

01:00:17.660 --> 01:00:19.130
[applause]

01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:25.230
certainly like I said, just to summarize what-what
I've talked about is the fact that it-it was

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:29.910
nice to be able to realize a dream, but it
certainly wasn't something that where I'd

01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:33.930
say, "Hey I did this myself." I had a lot
of help as you could saw from my, the way

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:41.900
I spoke about how I became an astronaut. Anecdotally
I had help from my parents, my teachers, friends,

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:45.039
colleagues, and a little bit of per-perseverance.

01:00:45.039 --> 01:00:50.380
So 12 times is a lot of times to apply and
to want it, but figure if you want it bad

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:55.030
enough you keep doing it and-and it certainly
did, wasn't hurting my career so it wasn't

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:59.900
like I thought I was wasting my time during
the application process.

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:00.900
So thank you very much.

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:04.529
&gt;&gt;Mario: Well thank you. Thank you very much
to Jose --

01:01:04.529 --> 01:01:05.529
[applause]

01:01:05.529 --> 01:01:07.789
for being here today.

01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:08.789
[applause]

01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:12.699
So we do have a lot of questions from Dory
and I'm sure you have questions. To be honest

01:01:12.699 --> 01:01:16.680
he particularly has to fly fairly soon. So
we'll try to keep it short, maybe ask one

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:20.799
or two questions from Dory and maybe one or
at most two live. So if you want to line up

01:01:20.799 --> 01:01:22.150
and keep it short.

01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:27.390
So the first question from someone in Mountainview
called John R., he says, "How do you feel

01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:33.210
about the fact that since the Apollo program
ended we've never gone beyond low-low air

01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:36.670
orbit? Do you think that's sufficient for
a national space program or should we press

01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:40.599
for more manned space exploration, return
to more Mars perhaps?

01:01:40.599 --> 01:01:46.229
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: Yeah, I think I-I think
he's right in a sense that-that we've only

01:01:46.229 --> 01:01:50.729
got three missions left for the Space Shuttle
Fleet and then they're gonna get retired.

01:01:50.729 --> 01:01:56.719
What that does is that frees up resources
for us to invest in-in-in technology that's

01:01:56.719 --> 01:02:02.500
gonna allow us to go beyond lower earth orbit.
It does us no good to just go to the moon

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:06.599
and cool our heels there. We wanna be able
to make sure we can also go all the way to

01:02:06.599 --> 01:02:07.599
Mars.

01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:12.839
For that we need advanced propulsion systems;
we need radiation protection; and-and we also

01:02:12.839 --> 01:02:19.959
need to-to learn how to live long duration
in a zero-g environment away from the protection

01:02:19.959 --> 01:02:25.410
of the earth's magnetic field with respect
to radiation. So-so-so yeah I think we're

01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:26.559
heading that direction.

01:02:26.559 --> 01:02:31.369
&gt;&gt;Mario: So Stacy from Mountainview she says,
"I'm a daughter of a proud Kennedy Space Center

01:02:31.369 --> 01:02:36.069
employee and have seen many Shuttle launches
in my lifetime. I'm saddened by the decision

01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:40.839
to end the Shuttle program. Why don't you
tell us the decision and its im, and its impact

01:02:40.839 --> 01:02:42.349
on Florida as a space coast?

01:02:42.349 --> 01:02:49.209
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: Yeah, I mean it's the equivalent
when we the-the-there's no denial that in

01:02:49.209 --> 01:02:54.029
ending the space program the Shuttle space
program, there's gonna be a shift of talent

01:02:54.029 --> 01:02:55.309
that's needed within NASA.

01:02:55.309 --> 01:03:00.720
In other words, the operations side of maintaining
the Shuttle, prepping it for a launch, and

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:06.589
refurbishing the Shuttle, those tasks aren't
gonna be needed. So there is gonna be some-some

01:03:06.589 --> 01:03:11.099
type of human resources let go with respect
to the fact that that's what's not needed

01:03:11.099 --> 01:03:12.099
now.

01:03:12.099 --> 01:03:16.869
But at the same time the budget of NASA's
actually going up so the work force is not

01:03:16.869 --> 01:03:20.500
really gonna go down, it's just gonna be a
shift of a different type of work force.

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:26.670
And-and it's basically the same thing that
happened between the-the era of the Apollo

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:31.420
and the Space Shuttle Mission. If you see
the history during Apollo when we cancelled

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:36.789
Apollo there was a big drop in the number
of folks needed on the operation side. And

01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:42.079
then when the Shuttle came back when we brought
the Shuttle to life, those people were picked

01:03:42.079 --> 01:03:45.119
up and-and then you had a real vibrant work
force.

01:03:45.119 --> 01:03:49.979
I mean same thing's gonna happen with retiring
the Shuttle. There's gonna be a dip at Kennedy

01:03:49.979 --> 01:03:54.309
Space Center 'cause they're more primary operations
oriented, but when we get the architecture

01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:58.630
defined and built then the work force is gonna
steadily go back up.

01:03:58.630 --> 01:04:04.400
&gt;&gt;Mario: Yeah Jose, well thank you very much
for share all this with us. We are really

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:08.479
happy and it was great seriously. We wanna
give you this --

01:04:08.479 --> 01:04:10.099
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: Oh, thank you very much.

01:04:10.099 --> 01:04:13.489
&gt;&gt;Mario: gift; token of our appreciation.
Thank you very much for being here with Google.

01:04:13.489 --> 01:04:14.489
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: Thank you.

01:04:14.489 --> 01:04:18.741
&gt;&gt;Mario: I think those guys are very happy
with your messages and just wanna let you

01:04:18.741 --> 01:04:23.689
know that we got some T-shirts that it's a
raffle, right?

01:04:23.689 --> 01:04:27.319
&gt;&gt;2Gonzalo Begazo: Yeah, so we're gonna email
the winners. [unintelligible]

01:04:27.319 --> 01:04:28.319
Mario: Yeah.

01:04:28.319 --> 01:04:31.890
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: And just so, just so he
make sure he gives out the right amount I

01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:33.469
think I signed six of 'em alright so --

01:04:33.469 --> 01:04:34.469
[laughter]

01:04:34.469 --> 01:04:35.469
make sure he gives away six.

01:04:35.469 --> 01:04:36.469
[laughter]

01:04:36.469 --> 01:04:37.469
&gt;&gt;Gonzalo Begazo: Yeah, yeah.

01:04:37.469 --> 01:04:38.469
[laughter]

01:04:38.469 --> 01:04:39.469
We're gonna sell one on EBay.

01:04:39.469 --> 01:04:40.469
&gt;&gt;Jose Hernandez: Exactly.

01:04:40.469 --> 01:04:42.680
&gt;&gt;Mario: Well thank you very much; appreciate
it; appreciate it.

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:43.680
[applause]

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:44.680
&gt;&gt;Gonzalo Begazo: Thanks, guys.
