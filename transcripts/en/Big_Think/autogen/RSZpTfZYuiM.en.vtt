00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880
explore and extend themselves and if
 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.920
explore and extend themselves and if
they when they accomplish something

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930
they when they accomplish something
 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.780
they when they accomplish something
cards they could do before then that

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790
cards they could do before then that
 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.030
cards they could do before then that
hard fun comes in and you feel much more

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040
hard fun comes in and you feel much more
 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.210
hard fun comes in and you feel much more
well-rounded as a person and much more

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220
well-rounded as a person and much more
 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.590
well-rounded as a person and much more
much more you know you feel much more

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600
much more you know you feel much more
 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.850
much more you know you feel much more
sent that sense of accomplishment and

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860
sent that sense of accomplishment and
 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.340
sent that sense of accomplishment and
you know really usefulness you know in

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350
you know really usefulness you know in
 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.160
you know really usefulness you know in
in society as large and actually just

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170
in society as large and actually just
 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.450
in society as large and actually just
riffing off of that a bit I think that

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460
riffing off of that a bit I think that
 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.560
riffing off of that a bit I think that
also the other way the games are

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570
also the other way the games are
 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.110
also the other way the games are
changing the way we are as a society is

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120
changing the way we are as a society is
 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.710
changing the way we are as a society is
it games have multi-variant inputs so

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720
it games have multi-variant inputs so
 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.970
it games have multi-variant inputs so
especially simulation games so you've

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980
especially simulation games so you've
 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.100
especially simulation games so you've
got multiple things coming in and you

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110
got multiple things coming in and you
 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.070
got multiple things coming in and you
have the ability to to to make a lot of

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080
have the ability to to to make a lot of
 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.170
have the ability to to to make a lot of
changes so in a sense simulation games

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180
changes so in a sense simulation games
 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.490
changes so in a sense simulation games
are really have the opportunity to

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500
are really have the opportunity to
 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.680
are really have the opportunity to
change the world to really educate us as

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690
change the world to really educate us as
 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.840
change the world to really educate us as
global citizens because what our

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850
global citizens because what our
 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.230
global citizens because what our
simulation games are they are a they

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240
simulation games are they are a they
 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.550
simulation games are they are a they
have multivariate inputs and

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560
have multivariate inputs and
 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.260
have multivariate inputs and
multivariant outputs so when I play

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270
multivariant outputs so when I play
 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.270
multivariant outputs so when I play
simcity I play a city manager and I you

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280
simcity I play a city manager and I you
 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.310
simcity I play a city manager and I you
make decisions you know and I can make

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320
make decisions you know and I can make
 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.540
make decisions you know and I can make
decisions you have related to Godzilla

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550
decisions you have related to Godzilla
 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.160
decisions you have related to Godzilla
or I can make decisions to earthquake or

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170
or I can make decisions to earthquake or
 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.199
or I can make decisions to earthquake or
fire or I can you build it up but when

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209
fire or I can you build it up but when
 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.390
fire or I can you build it up but when
you're done with SimCity you actually

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400
you're done with SimCity you actually
 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.980
you're done with SimCity you actually
know a little bit more about that you

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990
know a little bit more about that you
 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.600
know a little bit more about that you
know a minute more that world and what

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610
know a minute more that world and what
 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.070
know a minute more that world and what
do we need what we really need right now

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080
do we need what we really need right now
 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.449
do we need what we really need right now
are people who can understand

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459
are people who can understand
 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.610
are people who can understand
multi-variant systems to fight things

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620
multi-variant systems to fight things
 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.710
multi-variant systems to fight things
like global warming aids all these

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720
like global warming aids all these
 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.900
like global warming aids all these
problems we've pretty much dealt with a

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910
problems we've pretty much dealt with a
 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.300
problems we've pretty much dealt with a
lot of the low-hanging fruit here and so

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310
lot of the low-hanging fruit here and so
 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.280
lot of the low-hanging fruit here and so
you know i think the games play a really

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290
you know i think the games play a really
 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.199
you know i think the games play a really
serious role really important role in

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209
serious role really important role in
 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.420
serious role really important role in
elevating up our thinking to that next

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430
elevating up our thinking to that next
 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.820
elevating up our thinking to that next
level of play and i think if we can do

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830
level of play and i think if we can do
 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:26.900
level of play and i think if we can do
that the world will definitely be a

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910
that the world will definitely be a
 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.330
that the world will definitely be a
better place
