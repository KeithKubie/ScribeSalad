00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.162
- [Voiceover] Blue food
coloring can be oxidized

00:00:02.162 --> 00:00:05.807
by household bleach, which
contains hypochlorite,

00:00:05.807 --> 00:00:08.304
household bleach will usually
use sodium hypochlorite,

00:00:08.304 --> 00:00:10.463
to form colorless products,

00:00:10.463 --> 00:00:12.598
as represented by the equation above.

00:00:12.598 --> 00:00:13.923
So this is the food coloring,

00:00:13.923 --> 00:00:15.223
reacts with the hypochlorite,

00:00:15.223 --> 00:00:17.141
produces colorless a product.

00:00:17.141 --> 00:00:19.275
A student uses a spectrophotometer

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:22.858
set at a wavelength of 635 nanometers

00:00:22.858 --> 00:00:25.523
to study the absorbance
of the food coloring

00:00:25.523 --> 00:00:28.622
over time during the bleaching process.

00:00:28.622 --> 00:00:30.249
So since we're talking
about blue food coloring,

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:31.549
I'm guessing this is a wavelength

00:00:31.549 --> 00:00:34.519
of light that is blue, since
that's gonna be optimally

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:36.512
absorbed by blue food coloring.

00:00:37.563 --> 00:00:40.548
In the study, bleach is
present in large excess

00:00:40.548 --> 00:00:42.625
so the concentration of hypochlorite

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.708
is essentially constant
through the reaction.

00:00:45.708 --> 00:00:46.708
Alright.

00:00:46.708 --> 00:00:49.727
The student used data from the study

00:00:49.727 --> 00:00:51.504
to generate the graphs below.

00:00:51.504 --> 00:00:52.594
So we're graphing,

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:54.730
see the vertical access we have absorbents

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.193
and you can view absorbents,

00:00:56.193 --> 00:00:59.084
if we have a high concentration
of blue food coloring,

00:00:59.084 --> 00:01:01.093
then we're gonna have a high absorbance,

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:03.705
and if we have a low concentration
of blue food coloring,

00:01:03.705 --> 00:01:05.086
we're gonna have a low absorbance.

00:01:05.086 --> 00:01:06.771
So you can view this as a,

00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:12.397
as a proxy for concentration
of food coloring,

00:01:12.397 --> 00:01:17.397
food coloring, food
coloring concentration.

00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:20.272
And so, here they just plotted absorbance

00:01:20.272 --> 00:01:21.234
relative to time,

00:01:21.234 --> 00:01:22.361
here they have the natural log

00:01:22.361 --> 00:01:23.614
of absorbance relative to time.

00:01:23.614 --> 00:01:28.614
Here, one over absorbance
relative to time.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.010
And so let's look at the questions here.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.494
Based on the graphs above,

00:01:32.494 --> 00:01:34.564
what is the order of the reaction

00:01:34.564 --> 00:01:37.337
with respect to the blue food coloring?

00:01:37.337 --> 00:01:39.694
With the respect to the
blue food blue coloring.

00:01:39.694 --> 00:01:40.480
So let's think of,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.214
I'll do a little super fast primer,

00:01:42.214 --> 00:01:44.453
so if we're talking about a zero,

00:01:44.453 --> 00:01:46.834
if we're talking about
a zero order reaction

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:50.952
that means that the rate
of reaction is constant.

00:01:50.952 --> 00:01:52.923
Rate, constant.

00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:57.655
And it's independent of, the independent

00:01:57.655 --> 00:02:00.755
of the concentration
of blue food coloring.

00:02:00.755 --> 00:02:02.068
Independent

00:02:06.018 --> 00:02:07.838
of the concentration,

00:02:07.838 --> 00:02:09.769
I'll just say of the coloring.

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.471
Concentration of the coloring.

00:02:11.471 --> 00:02:13.107
Is that the case here?

00:02:13.107 --> 00:02:14.536
Well no, the rate isn't constant,

00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:15.778
if we look at just absorbance,

00:02:15.778 --> 00:02:16.732
which is just once again,

00:02:16.732 --> 00:02:19.521
a proxy for our concentration
of food coloring,

00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:20.898
up here our rate is pretty fast,

00:02:20.898 --> 00:02:22.895
we have a steep slope over here

00:02:22.895 --> 00:02:27.040
and then the slope gets
less and less steep

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.387
as more as our concentration

00:02:30.387 --> 00:02:32.021
of food coloring goes down,

00:02:32.021 --> 00:02:33.681
as the reaction proceeds.

00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:36.490
So this is definitely not
a zero order reaction,

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.282
if this was a zero order reaction

00:02:38.282 --> 00:02:39.857
when we just plot absorbance,

00:02:39.857 --> 00:02:40.972
which is once again the proxy

00:02:40.972 --> 00:02:43.547
for concentration of food
coloring versus time,

00:02:43.547 --> 00:02:46.574
we would expect to see
something more of a line.

00:02:46.574 --> 00:02:49.250
So, if you saw something like that,

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.887
then you would say "okay,

00:02:50.887 --> 00:02:53.354
"that looks like a zero order reaction."

00:02:53.354 --> 00:02:55.240
Now when we took the
natural log of absorbance,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.771
which is once again a
proxy for the natural log

00:02:57.771 --> 00:02:59.513
of the concentration of food coloring,

00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:01.880
here we get a clear line,

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.772
here we actually do get a clear line.

00:03:04.772 --> 00:03:05.794
And I'm not gonna go into it,

00:03:05.794 --> 00:03:06.839
it takes a little bit of calculus

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:08.988
and a little bit of basic
differential equations

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:13.654
to realize it, but this is a
give away for a first order,

00:03:13.654 --> 00:03:15.915
for a first order reaction.

00:03:15.915 --> 00:03:17.500
So in a first order of reaction,

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.875
in first order,

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.348
the rate, the rate is proportional,

00:03:25.348 --> 00:03:26.400
proportional,

00:03:28.147 --> 00:03:31.718
is proportional to the concentration,

00:03:32.768 --> 00:03:35.184
concentration, let me just write it,

00:03:35.184 --> 00:03:37.110
is proportional to the concentration

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.061
since we're saying with respect

00:03:38.061 --> 00:03:39.441
to the blue food coloring,

00:03:39.441 --> 00:03:40.663
is proportional to the concentration

00:03:40.663 --> 00:03:42.345
of blue food coloring.

00:03:42.345 --> 00:03:46.541
I'll just write coloring,
coloring for short.

00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:48.256
And I'll throw a little calculus here,

00:03:48.256 --> 00:03:50.140
you could say the rate of reaction,

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.403
which is the rate in change

00:03:51.403 --> 00:03:53.101
of concentration of our coloring,

00:03:54.976 --> 00:03:56.811
with respect to time,

00:03:56.811 --> 00:03:58.889
and if this looks
completely unfamiliar to you

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.119
and you've never taken a calculus class

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:03.679
ignore what I'm about to
say for the next 20 seconds.

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:04.915
This needs to be proportional

00:04:04.915 --> 00:04:08.377
to the concentration of coloring.

00:04:08.377 --> 00:04:12.406
Coloring, alright, COL dot for short.

00:04:12.406 --> 00:04:14.688
And if you saw this, you would see

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:17.507
that the natural log of the
concentration of coloring

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:20.518
with respect to, if you
plot that versus time,

00:04:20.518 --> 00:04:21.947
is you're going to get a line.

00:04:21.947 --> 00:04:23.063
So this is a key,

00:04:23.063 --> 00:04:27.256
this is a key signature of a first order,

00:04:27.256 --> 00:04:28.240
first order reaction.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.401
But you can even see it here,

00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:31.362
up here when the concentration

00:04:31.362 --> 00:04:33.941
of our coloring is high, our rate is high,

00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:35.090
we have a steep slope

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.470
and then when our
concentration becomes lower,

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.722
we also have our slope being lower.

00:04:39.722 --> 00:04:40.988
So you actually don't even need calculus,

00:04:40.988 --> 00:04:42.021
you could look at this one and see

00:04:42.021 --> 00:04:44.205
that something very similar
to that is happening.

00:04:44.205 --> 00:04:46.181
So this is a first order reaction.

00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:47.583
If you're thinking about second order,

00:04:47.583 --> 00:04:48.790
why do they even show us this?

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.590
Well a second order if you
plot one over absorbance

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.248
versus time, or one
over the concentration,

00:04:53.248 --> 00:04:56.098
cause' as we said absorbance is a proxy

00:04:56.098 --> 00:04:58.101
for the concentration
of our food coloring,

00:04:58.101 --> 00:05:00.759
well then this would be a linear plot,

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.090
but as we can see it is not.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.650
But if this linear
plot, then you could say

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.183
"hey maybe this is a second order,"

00:05:05.183 --> 00:05:06.425
but just to answer the question,

00:05:06.425 --> 00:05:07.913
this is a first order reaction

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:11.699
with respect to blue food coloring.

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.459
Alright, let's do part B now.

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:16.529
The reaction is known to be first order

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:18.404
with respect to bleach.

00:05:18.404 --> 00:05:19.561
Alright, so now we're talking about

00:05:19.561 --> 00:05:20.601
the reaction order with respect

00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:22.366
to bleach, not the food coloring.

00:05:22.366 --> 00:05:24.026
In a second experiment,

00:05:24.026 --> 00:05:25.500
the student prepares solutions

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.009
of food coloring and
bleach with concentrations

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.922
that differ from those used
in the first experiment.

00:05:30.922 --> 00:05:31.688
Alright.

00:05:31.688 --> 00:05:33.697
When the solutions are combined,

00:05:33.697 --> 00:05:35.945
the student observes
that the reaction mixture

00:05:35.945 --> 00:05:39.860
reaches an absorbance
near zero too rapidly.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.970
So it's getting to no color too fast.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.529
In order to correct the problem,

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:45.887
the student proposes the following

00:05:45.887 --> 00:05:48.465
three possible modifications
to the experiment.

00:05:48.465 --> 00:05:50.295
So the solution doesn't want,

00:05:51.355 --> 00:05:53.490
the student does not want the solution

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.023
to become colorless that fast,

00:05:56.023 --> 00:05:57.440
so what should they do?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.618
Should they increase the temperature?

00:05:59.618 --> 00:06:00.644
Well increasing the temperature

00:06:00.644 --> 00:06:02.827
is just going to make the
reaction happen even faster,

00:06:02.827 --> 00:06:04.801
the molecules are gonna
bump into each other

00:06:04.801 --> 00:06:07.399
with more energy and more frequently,

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:08.990
and so, that's just gonna make,

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.104
that's gonna get you to
colorless even faster.

00:06:11.104 --> 00:06:12.706
So that's gonna go in
the opposite direction,

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:14.182
so we can rule that out.

00:06:14.182 --> 00:06:16.811
Increasing the concentration
of blue food coloring.

00:06:17.688 --> 00:06:19.661
Well, that makes sense,

00:06:19.661 --> 00:06:20.729
well they say blue food coloring

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:23.168
but I'm assuming it's blue, whatever.

00:06:23.168 --> 00:06:25.002
Because, well if it's
getting clear too fast,

00:06:25.002 --> 00:06:27.149
well, if you add more food coloring

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:30.168
well then it's just gonna,
it's going to have a higher

00:06:30.168 --> 00:06:31.840
absorbance and it's going to take longer

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.943
to get to clear.

00:06:32.943 --> 00:06:34.871
So, this one seems interesting.

00:06:34.871 --> 00:06:35.590
Now what about this,

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.784
increasing the concentration of bleach?

00:06:37.784 --> 00:06:39.839
Well once again the bleach is the thing

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:41.244
that's getting the food,

00:06:41.244 --> 00:06:43.427
is reacting with the food
coloring to make it clear,

00:06:43.427 --> 00:06:44.707
so if you increase its concentration,

00:06:44.707 --> 00:06:46.481
you're gonna get clear even faster

00:06:46.481 --> 00:06:47.780
which is not what the student wants,

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.359
this is the opposite of
what the student wants.

00:06:49.359 --> 00:06:51.484
So once again we would cross that one out.

00:06:51.484 --> 00:06:53.161
And the one that we like is definitely

00:06:53.161 --> 00:06:57.770
increasing the concentration
of the food coloring.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.110
They say circle the one
proposed modification,

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.220
so let me make sure I'm circling it,

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.658
I guess I'm more rectangling
it, but you get the idea.

00:07:04.658 --> 00:07:05.897
Correct the problem and explain

00:07:05.897 --> 00:07:07.641
how that modification increases the time

00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:09.262
for the reaction mixture

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:12.762
to reach an absorbance near zero.

00:07:12.762 --> 00:07:14.344
So I'll write, more coloring,

00:07:15.502 --> 00:07:16.856
more coloring,

00:07:18.476 --> 00:07:21.750
results in

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.850
higher initial absorbance,

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.825
higher initial,

00:07:28.445 --> 00:07:32.067
initial absorbance,

00:07:33.907 --> 00:07:35.132
and thus,

00:07:36.452 --> 00:07:37.532
and thus,

00:07:39.092 --> 00:07:40.242
more time,

00:07:41.582 --> 00:07:43.062
more time,

00:07:44.222 --> 00:07:45.892
for mixture

00:07:48.232 --> 00:07:49.654
to reach,

00:07:49.654 --> 00:07:53.047
to reach near

00:07:53.887 --> 00:07:57.297
zero absorbance.

00:07:57.297 --> 00:08:01.592
Absorbance, the word that I
really have trouble saying.

00:08:01.592 --> 00:08:03.183
Alright, part C.

00:08:03.183 --> 00:08:05.460
In another experiment, a student wishes

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.022
to study the oxidation
of red food coloring,

00:08:09.022 --> 00:08:11.762
just in the spirit of that one
I'll underline it with red,

00:08:11.762 --> 00:08:14.113
of red food coloring with bleach.

00:08:14.113 --> 00:08:15.876
How would the student need to modify

00:08:15.876 --> 00:08:17.766
the original experiment procedure,

00:08:17.766 --> 00:08:19.066
experimental procedure,

00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:20.992
to determine the order of the reaction

00:08:20.992 --> 00:08:24.568
with respect to the red food coloring?

00:08:24.568 --> 00:08:27.537
Well overall, this is a
pretty good experiment,

00:08:27.537 --> 00:08:29.711
they plotted it in three different ways,

00:08:29.711 --> 00:08:33.063
which was, as we saw,
a very good indicator

00:08:33.063 --> 00:08:35.528
of what order of reaction
we were talking about.

00:08:35.528 --> 00:08:37.256
But at the very beginning
of this question,

00:08:38.136 --> 00:08:40.417
I talked a little bit about
this wavelength of light,

00:08:40.417 --> 00:08:41.628
this is blue light,

00:08:41.628 --> 00:08:43.509
and even if you didn't know that off hand,

00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:44.973
you would be able to
say "well we're studying

00:08:44.973 --> 00:08:46.320
"blue food coloring, they probably picked

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.420
"a wavelength of light that
gets absorbed by blue."

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:51.610
But if we now care about red,

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:52.810
well we would probably want to use

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.550
a wavelength of light that is optimally

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:55.874
absorbed by red,

00:08:55.874 --> 00:08:58.033
so a red wavelength of light,

00:08:58.033 --> 00:09:00.448
which will be a lower wavelength of light.

00:09:00.448 --> 00:09:04.541
So, change the wavelength of light,

00:09:05.452 --> 00:09:09.324
change the wavelength

00:09:12.059 --> 00:09:14.340
to be suitable,

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.610
suitable

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:23.018
for absorbance, or absorption

00:09:24.468 --> 00:09:28.239
by red coloring, red coloring.

00:09:28.239 --> 00:09:30.264
Or you could say you could
lower the wavelength of light

00:09:30.264 --> 00:09:31.524
or the wavelength of light

00:09:31.524 --> 00:09:33.177
should be red part of the spectrum

00:09:33.177 --> 00:09:35.923
to match the red food coloring.

00:09:35.923 --> 00:09:38.089
Everything else seems
completely reasonable.
