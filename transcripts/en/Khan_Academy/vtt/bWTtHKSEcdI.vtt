00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.730
Actually, just right after
stopping that video, I

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.770
realized a very simple way
of showing you that RP is

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.930
congruent to TA, a little bit
more of a rigorous definition.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:23.150
If we can show that this
triangle right there, that one

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.990
I drew in purple, and this
triangle right here are

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:33.140
congruent, then we could make
a fairly reasonable argument

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.920
that RP is going to be congruent
to TA, because

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.190
they're essentially the
corresponding sides of the two

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.130
congruent triangles.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.000
This congruent triangles
would be kind of

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.730
flipping each other.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.430
So how can we make
that argument?

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.650
Well, on the purple triangle,
this angle is going to be

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:55.850
equal to this angle on
the yellow triangle.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.640
Actually, we got that from the
fact that this is an isosceles

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.380
trapezoid, so the base angles
are going to be the same.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.730
They told us this is an
isosceles trapezoid, so we

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.480
know that this side, right
there, is going to be

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.110
congruent to this side.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.880
And then finally, they both
share this side right here.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.750
So we could use the argument--
once again, side, angle,

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.770
side-- that the side, angle, and
side are congruent to this

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.160
side, angle, and side.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:37.930
So you could say by SAS,
triangle TRP is congruent to

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.230
triangle TAP.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.870
And if they're congruent, then
all of the corresponding sides

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.790
are equal, so then TA
is congruent to RP.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.140
Once again, you didn't
have to do all that.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.830
It's a multiple choice test. But
I wanted to give you that.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.490
I felt bad I wasn't giving you
a more rigorous definition.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.040
A more rigorous proof.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:14.360
So anyway, problem number 11.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.970
A conditional statement
is shown below.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.530
If a quadrilateral has
perpendicular diagonals, then

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.010
it is a rhombus.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.140
Fair enough.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.100
Which of the following is
a counterexample to the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.460
statement above?

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.120
So they're saying, if it's
perpendicular diagonals, then

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.040
it's a rhombus.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.260
So if we could find something
that has perpendicular

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.190
diagonals that is not a rhombus,
then we have a

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.870
counterexample.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.900
Then this would not be true.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.600
So let's find something with
perpendicular diagonals that

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.670
is not a rhombus.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.310
Well, this one has perpendicular
diagonals.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.180
The diagonals are perpendicular
to each other,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.300
all 90-degree angles.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.000
And this is clearly
not a rhombus.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.650
This is like a kite.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.260
This is not parallel to this and
that is not parallel, so

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.140
this is not a rhombus.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.570
So this is definitely
a counterexample.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.520
This one does have perpendicular
diagonals, but

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.430
it's also a rhombus.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.530
So it's not a counterexample.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.850
It's just an example of what
they're trying to say.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.860
This has perpendicular
diagonals, it's a square, but

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.900
a square is a subset
of rhombuses.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.060
So this is another example.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.240
And, of course, this
one does not have

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.630
perpendicular diagonals.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.900
This is not a right angle.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.250
So A is the counterexample.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.500
Next question.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:36.040
Problem 12.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.035
Which triangles must
be similar?

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.430
Two obtuse triangles.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.340
Well, obtuse just means that
they have two angles, one

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.710
obtuse angle might look like
that where that is greater

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.990
than 90 degrees there,
and the other obtuse

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.880
might be super obtuse.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.120
It might be like that.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.230
And clearly these
aren't similar.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.270
Well, this angle is obviously
larger than that one.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.390
OK, so this is not similar.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.080
Similar means all the
angles are the same.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.020
So it's like congruent, but you
can scale them in size.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.650
That's how I think of them.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.560
Like this triangle.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.300
I'm trying to draw it so it
looks exactly the same.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.600
That triangle.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.270
Well no, but you can imagine
if I cut and

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.790
pasted that, right?

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.020
It would only be similar to
this triangle if I drew

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.820
everything to scale.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.040
Because the sides are different
sizes, but all the

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.680
angles are the same.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.000
That's what similar means.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.630
So let's see.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.440
Two scalene triangles with
congruent bases.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.810
Well no, that's not true.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.330
That's not similar.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.710
Let's say they share
the same base.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.745
One scalene triangle might
look like this.

00:04:50.745 --> 00:04:56.320
It might come out a little bit
and then go down like that.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.580
And the other scalene triangle
has the same base right there.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.850
The sides might be a little
closer to each other.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.650
So clearly, these two things
aren't similar.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.110
This angle is different
than that angle.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.160
All the angles are
different, so

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.870
they're not similar triangles.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.870
So that's not right.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.040
Two right triangles.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.090
Do those have to be similar?

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.650
Well, no.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.440
You could have a right triangle
that looks like this,

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.320
where maybe the two sides
are equal, right?

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.020
That's a 45-45-90 triangle.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:31.370
Or you could have something
like this where you have a

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.100
30-60-90 triangle.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.440
These clearly are not similar.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.660
All the angles are
not the same.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.980
They both have a 90-degree
angle.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.250
So I'm already guessing that D
is our right answer, but let's

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.100
see how it works out.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.925
Two isosceles triangles with
congruent vertex angles.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.610
So I'm assuming when they say
congruent vertex angles, I'm

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.906
assuming they mean all of the
angles are congruent.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.295
So two isosceles triangles.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.690
Let me think about
it a little bit.

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.990
Oh, actually, I think what
they mean is angle in the

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.460
middle when they say
vertex angle.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.760
If that's one of my isosceles
triangles.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.390
And isosceles triangle means
that that side is equal to

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.980
that side and that angle
is equal to that angle.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.380
The vertex angle, I'm guessing,
they mean is this

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.720
angle right there.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.760
So if I had another isosceles
triangle.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.140
Let's say maybe it's a
little bit smaller.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.800
It looks something like that.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.690
And their vertex angles
are the same.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.410
That angle is equal
to this angle.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.770
Well, if that angle is equal to
this angle and we know it's

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.167
isosceles, so if we know it's
isosceles, that is equal to

00:06:56.167 --> 00:06:58.930
that, then that has to be equal
to that, we know that

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.230
all the angles are the same.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.380
How do we know that this angle
is equal to this angle?

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.580
Well, think about it.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.680
Whatever angle this us,
let's call this x.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.650
Let's call this angle
y and this angle y.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:19.340
We know that x plus 2y is equal
to 180, or that 2y is

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:27.170
equal to 180 minus x, Or y is
equal to 90 minus x over 2.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:33.100
Now if this is x, And let's call
these z and z, So we know

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.190
that x plus 2z is
equal to 180.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.160
All the angles in a triangle
have to add up to 180.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.970
Subtract x from both sides,
you get 2z is equal

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.320
to 180 minus x.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.890
Divide by 2, you get z is equal
to 90 minus x over 2.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.960
So z and y are going to
be the same angles.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.230
So all the angles are the same,
so we're dealing with

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:55.170
similar triangles.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:00.230
So choice D was definitely
correct.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:11.340
13.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.930
OK.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.130
Which of the following facts
would be sufficient to prove

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:21.630
that triangles ABC, that's the
big triangle, and triangle

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:24.270
DBE, so that's a small
one, are similar?

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:26.600
So we have to prove that all of
their angles are similar.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.300
I cannot even look at the
choices and I can guess where

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:29.840
this is going.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.740
So we want to prove that
those are similar.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.730
So first of all, they share
the same angle.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:38.340
Angle ABC, this angle, is
the same as angle DBE.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.750
So they share that same angle.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.549
So we got one angle down.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:43.620
Now let's think about it.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.750
If we knew that this angle is
equal to that angle and that

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.220
angle is equal to that
angle, we'd be done.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.240
And the best way to come to
that conclusion is if they

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.340
told us that this and
this are parallel.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:56.670
I'm guessing that's where
they're going.

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.340
Now I might have gone on a
completely wrong tangent.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:01.440
Because it those two are
parallel, then these two lines

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.450
are transversals of
the parallel.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:10.310
So that angle and that angle
would be corresponding angles,

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.750
so they would be congruent, and
then that angle and that

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.240
angle would be corresponding
angles so

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.080
they'd also be congruent.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.240
So if they told us that these
are parallel, we're done.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.860
These are definitely
similar triangles.

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:27.190
And sure enough, choice C, they
tell us that AC and DE

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:27.860
are parallel.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.440
These are parallel, that's
a transversal, this is a

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.110
corresponding angle of that,
so they're congruent.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.370
This is a corresponding angle to
this, congruent, so all of

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:37.360
the angles are congruent.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.185
So we have a similar triangle.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:53.190
Problem 14.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.440
OK.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.940
Parallelogram ABCD
is shown below.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:04.740
Fair enough.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.860
Parallelogram: that
tells us that the

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.870
opposites sides are parallel.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:12.650
That's parallel to that, and
then this is parallel to that.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.680
And all of the choices got
clipped at the bottom, but

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.455
I'll copy them over.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.200
Maybe I'll copy them
above the question.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.570
Well, let me see
what I can do.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.276
I think that's good enough.

00:10:31.276 --> 00:10:33.070
A little unconventional.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:34.080
OK.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.100
Parallelogram is shown below.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.280
They say which pair of triangles
can be established

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:47.160
to be congruent to prove
that angle DAB is

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.410
congruent to angle BCD?

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.020
So DAB is this.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.380
Let me do it in another color.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:02.060
DAB is that angle, is
congruent to BCD.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.470
They want us to show
that those have

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.640
the same angle measure.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.310
OK, and what do we
have to show?

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.120
They say what pair of triangles
can be established

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.250
to be congruent to prove that.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:16.830
OK, if these are both part of
two different congruent

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.440
triangles and they are the
corresponding angles, then we

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.090
know that they're congruent
and we'd be done.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.330
So let's see what they say.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:23.980
Triangle ADC and BCD.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.650
BCD has this angle in it.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.640
BCD does help us because it
has this angle in it, but

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.780
triangle ADC does not have
this angle in it, right?

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.010
Triangle ADC has this the
smaller angle in it.

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:47.560
ADC doesn't involve this whole
thing, so that's not

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.490
going to help us.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:54.610
Triangle AED, once again, does
not involve this larger angle,

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.820
does not involve
the angle DAB.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.850
It only involves the little
smaller angle, so that's not

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:00.250
going to help us.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.060
Triangle DAB.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:02.690
That looks good.

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.260
That has this whole
angle in it.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.700
DAB.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.190
And then BCD.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:15.780
If we showed that that triangle
is congruent to this

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:20.780
triangle right here,
I think we're done.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:25.150
That would be enough to show
that this angle is congruent

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:27.160
to that angle, because they
would be the corresponding

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.210
angles of a congruent
triangle.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:31.010
So I think C is where
we're going to go.

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:32.750
Let's just look at choice D.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.670
DEC.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.420
Once again, triangle DEC.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.050
Let me make this point clear.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:43.420
Triangle DEC does not involve
either of the angles we care.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.610
It clearly does not involve
this angle, and it only

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:47.570
involves part of this angle,
only this part.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:50.120
It doesn't involve this whole
angle, so that's not going to

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.060
help us either.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.470
So the answer is C.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.680
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
