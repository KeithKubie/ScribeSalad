00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:05.739
- [Announcer] Dead Kevin.

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:07.941
(laughing)

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:10.210
- Ah, this is a great birthday.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.544
- Hey man, happy birthday.

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.046
- Yeah, happy birthday, man.

00:00:13.046 --> 00:00:13.947
- Hey, check this out.

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:14.781
Hold on.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.085 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Ever do this?
- Yeah.

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.191
- Happy birthday, Ahmed!

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.559
(laughing)

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:27.394
- How do you that that?

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:28.395
That's awesome.

00:00:28.395 --> 00:00:29.629
I wanna try it.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:33.967
- Oh my god, this is
brilliant! (laughing)

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.469
- I represent the lollipop kids.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.738
(laughing)

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.675
- Ahmed, that's too much.

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:44.110
That's probably too much.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.012
- [Jack] Slow down, Ahmed.

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:46.846
- Ahmed.

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:48.148
- Ahmed, slow down.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.816 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Ahmed, that's enough.
- Slow down.

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:52.152
(loud thud)

00:00:57.924 --> 00:00:59.959 align:start size:75% position:25%
(screaming)
- What happened?

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:00.894 align:start size:72% position:28%
What happened?
- Ahmed!

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:01.861
- Should I call somebody?

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:02.695
Should I call somebody?

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:03.630
- Call 9-1-1!

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.864 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Oh god!
- Call 9-1-1!

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:05.765
- Calling them,
I'm calling them!

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:06.733 align:start size:72% position:28%
(screaming)
I am!

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.068 align:start size:72% position:28%
- He's dying!
- Hello?!

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.602 align:start size:84% position:16%
- This is the worst
birthday ever!

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:10.537
- Hello?!

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:12.572
Hello, yes my friend fell down!

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:14.707
It was his birthday
and he fell down!

00:01:14.707 --> 00:01:16.076
Oh god, there's
blood everywhere!

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.577
Blood out of his head!

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.546
(screaming)

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:20.380
- Why?!

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:22.515
- No, my friend!

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:23.750
Not my dad!

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.286 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Tell them I'm
freaking out right now!

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:27.687
I am freaking out!

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:29.422
- No, I'm 27!

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:31.091
I'm a 27 year old man!

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:32.492
- Jesus Christ!

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.561
- But is this off the record?!

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.029
We were doing helium!

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:38.064
- And tell him he's
like the nicest guy!

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:41.301
- We were doing helium
for my friend's birthday!

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:45.371 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Tell him he's dying!
- I didn't enjoy it at all!

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:49.876
(high-pitched screaming)

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:52.712
(group screaming)

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:06.092
(guitar strumming)

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:10.396 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Hey, huffing helium's
no laughing matter,

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:11.631
as funny as that sketch was.

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.967 align:start size:81% position:19%
It's a dangerous--
- (moans) Ow!
