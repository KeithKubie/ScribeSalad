00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:03.899
My name is Reto Meier and welcome to This
Week in Android Development.

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.759
Last week in Android Development Live, Roman,
Nick and Adam hosted the record breaking premier

them a full UI makeover.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.000
On the Friday's Game Review, Dan Galpin was
joined by returning co host, Ian Ni-Lewis,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.840
for a look at these five games in a no holds
barred game review showdown.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.870
On the App Clinic, Ian and I put timer and
stopwatch apps under the microscope.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.180

Strike Back, an opportunity for developers

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.460
whose apps we pulled apart on the app clinic
and Android Design and Action, to respond

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.900
to our candid feedback and let us know a little
more about the challenges they faced building

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.920
their apps and how they overcame them.
