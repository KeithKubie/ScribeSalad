00:00:06.826 --> 00:00:08.030
What do silk,

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.707
DNA,

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:09.470
wood,

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.298
balloons,

00:00:10.298 --> 00:00:12.930
and Silly Putty all have in common?

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.719
They're polymers.

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.152
Polymers are such a big part of our lives

00:00:17.152 --> 00:00:18.608
that it's virtually impossible

00:00:18.608 --> 00:00:20.832
to imagine a world without them,

00:00:20.832 --> 00:00:22.416
but what the heck are they?

00:00:22.416 --> 00:00:24.226
Polymers are large molecules

00:00:24.226 --> 00:00:26.890
made of small units called monomers

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.773
linked together like the railroad cars from a train.

00:00:29.773 --> 00:00:31.302
Poly means many,

00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:32.800
and mono means one,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.683
and mers or mero means parts.

00:00:35.683 --> 00:00:37.853
Many polymers are made by repeating

00:00:37.853 --> 00:00:40.689
the same small monomer over and over again

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:42.481
while others are made from two monomers

00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:44.404
linked in a pattern.

00:00:44.404 --> 00:00:46.932
All living things are made of polymers.

00:00:46.932 --> 00:00:49.459
Some of the organic molecules in organisms

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:50.788
are small and simple,

00:00:50.788 --> 00:00:53.943
having only one of a few functional groups.

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:57.372
Others, especially those that play structural roles

00:00:57.372 --> 00:00:59.071
or store genetic information,

00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:00.838
are macromolecules.

00:01:00.838 --> 00:01:04.254
In many cases, these macromolecules are polymers.

00:01:04.254 --> 00:01:06.636
For example, complex carbohydrates

00:01:06.636 --> 00:01:08.790
are polymers of simple sugars,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.094
proteins are polymers of amino acids,

00:01:11.094 --> 00:01:13.758
and nucleic acids, DNA and RNA,

00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:15.718
which contain our genetic information,

00:01:15.718 --> 00:01:18.249
are polymers of nucleotides.

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:19.546
Trees and plants are made

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:21.515
of the polymer cellulose.

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:24.485
It's the tough stuff you find in bark and stems.

00:01:24.485 --> 00:01:25.177
Feathers,

00:01:25.177 --> 00:01:25.726
fur,

00:01:25.726 --> 00:01:26.263
hair,

00:01:26.263 --> 00:01:27.136
and fingernails

00:01:27.136 --> 00:01:29.183
are made up of the protein keratin,

00:01:29.183 --> 00:01:30.773
also a polymer.

00:01:30.773 --> 00:01:32.423
It doesn't stop there.

00:01:32.423 --> 00:01:33.923
Did you know that the exoskeletons

00:01:33.923 --> 00:01:36.431
of the largest phylum in the animal kingdom,

00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:37.448
the arthropods,

00:01:37.448 --> 00:01:39.328
are made of the polymer chitin?

00:01:39.928 --> 00:01:41.660
Polymers also form the basis

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.691
for synthetic fibers, rubbers, and plastics.

00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:48.076
All synthetic polymers are derived from petroleum oil

00:01:48.076 --> 00:01:51.276
and manufactured through chemical reactions.

00:01:51.276 --> 00:01:53.442
The two most common types of reactions

00:01:53.442 --> 00:01:54.710
used to make polymers

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.939
are addition reactions

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.143
and condensation reactions.

00:01:58.143 --> 00:01:59.465
In addition reactions,

00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:02.553
monomers simply add together to form the polymer.

00:02:02.553 --> 00:02:04.608
The process starts with a free radical,

00:02:04.608 --> 00:02:07.657
a species with an unpaired electron.

00:02:07.657 --> 00:02:08.961
The free radical attacks

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:11.524
and breaks the bonds to form new bonds.

00:02:11.524 --> 00:02:13.606
This process repeats over and over

00:02:13.606 --> 00:02:15.603
to create a long-chained polymer.

00:02:15.603 --> 00:02:17.272
In condensation reactions,

00:02:17.272 --> 00:02:19.101
a small molecule, such as water,

00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:22.407
is produced with each chain-extending reaction.

00:02:22.407 --> 00:02:23.933
The first synthetic polymers

00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:25.386
were created by accident

00:02:25.386 --> 00:02:28.107
as by-products of various chemical reactions.

00:02:28.107 --> 00:02:29.350
Thinking they were useless,

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.627
chemists mostly discarded them.

00:02:31.627 --> 00:02:33.910
Finally, one named Leo Baekeland

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.794
decided maybe his useless by-product

00:02:35.794 --> 00:02:38.086
wasn't so useless after all.

00:02:38.086 --> 00:02:39.715
His work resulted in a plastic

00:02:39.715 --> 00:02:42.178
that could be permanently squished into a shape

00:02:42.178 --> 00:02:44.521
using pressure and high temperatures.

00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:46.172
Since the name of this plastic,

00:02:46.172 --> 00:02:50.068
polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride,

00:02:50.068 --> 00:02:51.353
wasn't very catchy,

00:02:51.353 --> 00:02:53.594
advertisers called it Bakelite.

00:02:54.502 --> 00:02:56.468
Bakelite was made into telephones,

00:02:56.468 --> 00:02:57.355
children's toys,

00:02:57.355 --> 00:02:59.988
and insulators for electrical devices.

00:02:59.988 --> 00:03:02.104
With its development in 1907,

00:03:02.104 --> 00:03:04.608
the plastics industry exploded.

00:03:04.608 --> 00:03:06.621
One other familiar polymer, Silly Putty,

00:03:06.621 --> 00:03:08.774
was also invented by accident.

00:03:08.774 --> 00:03:09.859
During World War II,

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.601
the United States was in desperate need

00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:14.190
of synthetic rubber to support the military.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.107
A team of chemists at General Electric

00:03:16.107 --> 00:03:17.626
attempted to create one

00:03:17.626 --> 00:03:20.176
but ended up with a gooey, soft putty.

00:03:20.176 --> 00:03:22.192
It wasn't a good rubber substitute,

00:03:22.192 --> 00:03:24.461
but it did have one strange quality:

00:03:24.461 --> 00:03:27.109
it appeared to be extremely bouncy.

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.715
Silly Putty was born!

00:03:28.715 --> 00:03:30.926
Synthetic polymers have changed the world.

00:03:30.926 --> 00:03:32.018
Think about it.

00:03:32.018 --> 00:03:33.859
Could you imagine getting through a single day

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.553
without using plastic?

00:03:35.553 --> 00:03:37.520
But polymers aren't all good.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.858
Styrofoam, for example, is made mainly of styrene,

00:03:40.858 --> 00:03:43.023
which has been identified as a possible carcinogen

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:45.605
by the Environmental Protection Agency.

00:03:45.605 --> 00:03:47.735
As Styrofoam products are being made,

00:03:47.735 --> 00:03:51.025
or as they slowly deteriorate in landfills or the ocean,

00:03:51.025 --> 00:03:52.690
they can release toxic styrene

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.359
into the environment.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.017
In addition, plastics that are created

00:03:56.017 --> 00:03:58.294
by addition polymerization reactions,

00:03:58.294 --> 00:03:59.352
like Styrofoam,

00:03:59.352 --> 00:04:00.210
plastic bags,

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.212
and PVC,

00:04:01.212 --> 00:04:03.416
are built to be durable and food-safe,

00:04:03.416 --> 00:04:04.956
but that means that they don't break down

00:04:04.956 --> 00:04:06.366
in the environment.

00:04:06.366 --> 00:04:08.119
Millions of tons of plastics

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:10.221
are dumped into landfills every year.

00:04:10.221 --> 00:04:12.462
This plastic doesn't biodegrade,

00:04:12.462 --> 00:04:13.524
it just breaks down

00:04:13.524 --> 00:04:15.560
into smaller and smaller pieces,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.729
affecting marine life

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.734
and eventually making their way back to humans.

00:04:19.734 --> 00:04:21.724
Polymers can be soft or hard,

00:04:21.724 --> 00:04:22.937
squishy or solid,

00:04:22.937 --> 00:04:25.042
fragile or strong.

00:04:25.042 --> 00:04:27.326
The huge variation between

00:04:27.326 --> 00:04:28.240
means they can form

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.605
an incredibly diverse array of substances,

00:04:30.605 --> 00:04:31.434
from DNA

00:04:31.434 --> 00:04:33.408
to nylon stockings.

00:04:33.408 --> 00:04:35.024
Polymers are so useful

00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:37.493
that we've grown to depend on them every day.

00:04:37.493 --> 00:04:38.680
But some are littering

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.063
our oceans, cities, and waterways

00:04:41.063 --> 00:04:42.272
with effects on our health

00:04:42.272 --> 00:04:44.555
that we're only beginning to understand.
