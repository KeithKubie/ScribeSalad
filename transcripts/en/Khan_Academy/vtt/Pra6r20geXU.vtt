00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.830
I'm not going to do
a presentation on a

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:04.710
type of integral.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.680
I guess if you have this in
your tool kit-- and actually

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.910
you have it beyond the exam on
this type of integral, and you

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.290
actually keep it and you retain
it, then you, I think, will

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.890
become an integration jock.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.290
But anyway, let me show you
what I'm talking about.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.020
So let's just remember
what the product rule

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.320
of differentiation was.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.990
So let's say I had two
functions, let's say f of x

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.505
times g of x, and I wanted to
take the derivative of this.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.930
f of x times g of x.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.260
Well the chain rule just told
us that this is just the same

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.420
thing as, let's say, the
derivative of the first

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:58.590
function f prime of x times the
second function g of x plus now

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.350
the first function f of x times
the derivative of the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.996
second function.

00:01:05.996 --> 00:01:10.210
And I'll show you where I'm
going with this in a second.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.160
Now, if we were to integrate
both sides of this equation,

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.340
because we're still doing
algebra on some levels,

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.780
anything you do to one side
of the equation, you

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.140
can do to the other.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.160
So if we were to integrate both
sides-- well if you integrate

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.040
this side, you're taking the
integral of a derivative, you

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.430
just get back to what you took
the derivative originally of,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.915
so this just becomes f of x
times g of x, and then we have

00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:39.000
to integrate the right hand
side, well that just becomes--

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.990
and we're doing the indefinite
integral, kind of the

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.360
antiderivative, but we can
use this tool when we do

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.540
definite integrals as well.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:55.960
So that's the integral of f
prime of x g of x dx plus

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:04.840
the integral of f of x
g prime of x d of x.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.580
And now this might seem a
little bit arbitrary, and it is

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.560
a little bit arbitrary, let me
take-- well, I could take

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.290
either of these-- but let me
just take this one and move it

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.200
to this side of the equation.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.010
So I'm going to subtract
this term from both

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.210
sides of this equation.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.120
And so, we could say this-- so
let me change colors, because

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.330
this could get confusing-- this
term right here, we could say

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:43.785
that term f of x g prime of x d
of x is equal to this term--

00:02:43.785 --> 00:02:47.770
let me switch back to the
yellow-- is equal to f of

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:56.260
x g of x minus this term.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.105
Because I put it onto this
side of the equation.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.930
So what did I just do?

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.300
It looks like I just-- well, I
am just essentially playing

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.170
with the product rule
from differentiation.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.020
That's all I did.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.880
And you probably wondering,
well, Sal, this is all nice

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.910
and it looks fancy, but what
good is this going to do me?

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.140
Well, what I essentially just
did is I kind of proved this--

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.950
you could call this a formula,
but I often forget it,

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.450
especially once I haven't done
it a long time, and then I

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.350
actually just reprove it to
myself just by remembering the

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.250
product rule-- but this is
called integration by parts.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.030
And I'll show you
where this is useful.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.130
Let's say we want to take
the indefinite integral

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:58.590
of x cosine of x d of x.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.580
Well, everything we have in our
integration tool kit so far I

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.130
don't think help
us here, right?

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.680
Because we don't have a
function and its derivative, so

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.540
we can't do substitution or--
which is the same thing as the

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.550
reverse chain rule-- this
isn't a simple polynomial.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.550
So if you encounter this when
you're doing integrals, kind of

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.480
the last tool kit-- and this is
pretty sophisticated-- is to

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.770
do integration by parts.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.795
And so how can we use this
for integration by parts?

00:04:24.795 --> 00:04:27.750
Well, integration by parts
tells us that if we have an

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.910
integral where we have a
function and then the

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.480
derivative of another function,
then we could use this formula

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.590
to hopefully simplify it.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.250
So what I'm going to do-- and
you might view this as, well,

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.580
Sal, how did you
know to do this?

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.370
And I'll tell you my thought
process actually after

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.270
I show you what I did.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.400
We always, in math in general,
you always want to simplify.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.800
You always want to move from
something that's complicated

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.440
to something that's simpler.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.800
So in this situation, we could
assume that x is f of x, and we

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.730
could assume that g prime of x
is cosine of x, or we could

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.420
assume the other way around.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.070
The reason why I'm going to
assume that x is f of x, and

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.450
I'm going to assume g prime of
x is cosine of x, is because

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.540
later we want to take the
derivative of f of x.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.400
The derivative of f of x
simplifies things a lot.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.730
And we also want to take the
integral of g prime of x.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.430
We want to take the
antiderivative of g prime of x.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.680
And the antiderivative of
cosine of x is sine of x,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.280
which is just as complicated.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.440
It's not making it any
more complicated.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.510
And actually, try it the other
way around, and you'll see that

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.380
if you took the antiderivative
of x, you would get something

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.390
that's more complicated.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.740
You get x squared over 2.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.020
So that's the intuition, and
let me just solve through it,

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.920
and hopefully it'll make
a little bit more sense.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.540
So if I assume that f of x is
x, and g prime of x is cosine

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.170
of x, then f of x-- this yellow
term, let me write it in

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.695
yellow, just for fun-- so f of
x-- so I'm saying

00:05:58.695 --> 00:06:00.120
that f of x is x.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.300
So that's x.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.580
And let's say g of x is
cosine of x, right?

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.690
I'm sorry, g prime of
x is cosine of x.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.840
So the derivative of g
of x is cosine of x.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.340
So what's g of x?

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.250
It was the antiderivative
of cosine of x.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.350
So that's sine of x.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.310
I hope you understand
what I'm saying.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.230
This can be a little confusing.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.340
Let me write it
separately here.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.120
Actually, well I'm running out
of space, but I'll write it in

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.340
the corner right down here.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.600
See, I'm saying that f of x
is x and I'm saying that

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.300
g of x is sine of x.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.500
And the reason why I knew g of
x is sine of x is because I

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:51.630
said the derivative, I said g
prime of x, is cosine of x.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.360
So you know, if the function--
if the derivative of a function

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.970
is cosine, then we know the
function itself is sine.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.450
That's just something
you memorize.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.880
I haven't proven it to you yet,
but it's usually in the inside

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.920
cover of your calculus book.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.540
But let's just move forward.

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:11.460
And then this is minus
the integral of the

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.750
derivative of f of x.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.045
Well what's the
derivative of f of x?

00:07:14.045 --> 00:07:16.600
Well, we said f of
x is x, right?

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:21.870
So the derivative is
just 1 times g of x.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.926
Well, I already said that
g of x is sine of x.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.430
And I think you would agree
that we've now simplified this

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.340
a good bit, because this is
just the integral of

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.860
sine of x, right?

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:39.290
So this is just equal to x sine
of x-- this is just this first

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.860
term right here-- minus-- and
what's the integral

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.540
of sine of x?

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:49.960
Well, the derivative of-- well,
let me make it even simpler.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.470
Well we can make this a minus,
we can make this a minus sign

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.930
of x and make this a plus.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.010
And now it's really easy.

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.120
What's the antiderivative
of minus sine of x?

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.580
We can ignore this 1.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.800
What's the antiderivative
of minus sine of x?

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.510
Well, yeah, it's
just cosine of x.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:10.810
And we should never
forget the plus c.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:16.010
So we just used the product
rule to derive this formula for

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.240
integration by parts, and in a
lot of calculus books they

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.280
do this u and v and dvd.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.740
This is the same exact thing.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:27.350
I like this more, because
it naturally makes

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.970
more sense to me.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.570
It's easier for me to read,
and I can derive at any time,

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:32.820
just from the product rule.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.500
So I don't have to
necessarily memorize it.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.290
You might want to memorize it
for the exam, because it's

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:38.920
faster for when you
take the AP exam.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.910
But when you do calculus-- it's
been about fifteen years since

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:47.430
I learned it-- and I just
remember integration by parts

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.750
is just really a derivation of
the product rule, and that

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.590
gets me back to the format.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:52.920
I don't even have
to look it up.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.260
And then I can use it.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.930
So that's an introduction
to integration by parts.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:00.890
In the next presentation, I
will do a bunch of examples--

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.330
well, as many as I can fit in
to ten minutes of actually

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:07.930
using integration by parts to
solve fairly fancy integrals.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:09.850
I'll see you in the
next presentation.
