00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:06.549
Hey there, I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash
Course Theater, and today we are hanging with

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:08.920
playwright and poet Bertolt Brecht.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.460
As theatrical modernists go, Brecht is the
lace to Artaud’s leather.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.800
Or is it the other way around?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.230
His plays are hugely literary and staunchly
political—surprise surprise!—but they’re

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.039
also designed to wake up the audience, providing
a more intense and essential vision of reality.

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.660
Feeling alienated yet?

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.590
Lights up!

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.161
INTRO
Bertolt was born in Augsburg, Germany, in

00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:43.520
1898.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.840
He studied medicine, but he also took classes
in theater.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.900
And in 1924...
he apprenticed himself to the director Max

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.170
Reinhardt.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.829
His early works were episodic plays about
macho heroes and fragmenting societies in

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.280
the expressionist style of Ernst Toller or
Georg Kaiser.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.030
In the late 1920s, he began to work with the
theater director Erwin Piscator, who we briefly

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.640
discussed in our episode on expressionism.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.600
One of the first multimedia directors, Piscator
created a theater that was overtly political.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.740
He thought that theater could be a means of
educating the audience.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.380
And boy, did he love scaffolding.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.789
Brecht combined Piscator’s technique with
elements borrowed from cabaret, silent film,

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.600
and Shakespeare’s history plays to create
his own unique style.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.990
In 1928, he had maybe his greatest success
with “The Threepenny Opera,” a tale of

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.420
the criminal underclass, co-written with the
composer Kurt Weill.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.439
This became the runaway hit of Weimar Germany.

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:43.659
Brecht, however, sensed that his politics
weren’t a great fit for Nazi Germany.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.460
He left in 1933, first for Denmark, then Sweden
and Finland, and then the United States.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.810
In exile, he wrote several of his major plays,
“Mother Courage and Her Children,” “The

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.560
Life of Galileo Galilei,” and “The Good
Person of Setzuan,” and he formally articulated

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.569
his theories.

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.179
In 1947, he was summoned before the House
UnAmerican Activities Committee.

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:04.179
He agreed to testify.

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.600
But, while he didn’t name names, he also
didn’t win any popularity contests with

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.630
Hollywood.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.360
So he left the U.S., ultimately resettling
in East Germany.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.290
Back in Germany, he and his wife, Helene Weigel,
created the Berliner Ensemble, a theater company

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.240
that would perform his texts and put his theories
into practice.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.640
Brecht died in 1956.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.360
Brecht is credited with developing the idea
of “epic theater,” although Piscator used

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.760
that term first.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.050
Epic theater is supposed to be the opposite
of dramatic theater and also the opposite

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.370
of Aristotelian theater.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.070
It’s largely achieved using the Verfremdungseffekt
or the V-effekt.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.690
That’s often translated as the “alienation
effect,” or the “distancing effect”;

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.810
a better translation is “the estrangement
effect.”

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.410
Why would you want to estrange or alienate
an audience?

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.110
Like a lot of dudes in the non-realist camp,
Brecht worried that conventional plays were

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.810
too easy to sit through.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.420
You see a psychologically realistic show,
you have all the feels, and then you leave

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.080
the theater mostly worrying about whether
the currywurst stand was still open.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.080
Currywurst is delicious!

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.730
But using theater as mere escape is no way
to topple exploitative capitalism!

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.360
Instead, Brecht tried to create plays that
would force an audience to think critical

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.560
and uncomfortable thoughts about money, power,
and ethics.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.140
“Art,” he wrote, “is not a mirror with
which to reflect reality, but a hammer with

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.330
which to shape it.”

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.020
Yes, this is about waking up an audience.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.020
Just like Artaud!

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.880
But it’s not about working on an audience’s
unconscious and waking them up to myth and

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.640
magic and violence and ritual.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.150
Epic theater is about working on their waking
brains and waking them up to the political

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.800
realities just beyond the door of the playhouse.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.960
The appeal is intellectual, not emotional.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.270
There’s no crying in Dialectical Materialism.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.720
Brecht believed that an estranged audience
would be forced to engage with a play’s

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.130
content actively and intellectually.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.220
Here’s how Brecht put it:
“The dramatic theatre’s spectator says:

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.650
Yes, I have felt like that too—Just like
me—It’s only natural—It’ll never change

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.880
… I weep when they weep, I laugh when they
laugh.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:17.180
The epic theatre’s spectator says: I’d
never have thought it—That's not the way—That’s

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.280
extraordinary, hardly believable—It’s
got to stop … I laugh when they weep, I

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.960
weep when they laugh.”

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.960
How do you do this?

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.070
Well, you know how, in most productions, lights,
sounds, sets, costumes, and songs all work

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.520
together to produce one coherent vision?

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.590
Brecht was all, how bout not?

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.920
He wanted a theater in which the various elements
wouldn’t integrate but actually sort of

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.450
cage fight each other, continuously ejecting
the audience from the theatrical illusion.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.110
DISBELIEF WILL NOT BE SUSPENDED.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.420
A good example is in “The Threepenny Opera,”
when the sweet and virginal Polly Peachum

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.720
steps out to sing the violent revenge ballad
“Pirate Jenny.”

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.750
The audience is supposed to be like, whaaa!?

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.780
Why would she sing that!?

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.400
But often the audience is like, hey!

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.169
This is a Fun song!

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.020
Because mimesis is powerful.

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.150
And estrangement is hard.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.970
Brecht also encouraged a style of acting in
which actors don’t fully embody characters,

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:19.380
but just sort of gesture at them, often with
an actual repeated, symbolic gesture that

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.430
Brecht called the “gestus.”

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.040
Brecht also provided dialogue in which actors
speak about their characters in the third

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.140
person.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.370
He described this model in his essay “The
Street Scene.”

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.100
In the essay, he imagined an eyewitness demonstrating
a traffic accident to some bystanders.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.310
The witness doesn’t try to fully become
the driver or the victim.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.860
Instead, he gestures at those roles, allowing
the bystanders to make up their minds.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.960
“The actor is not Lear,” Brecht wrote.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.900
“He shows Lear.”

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.820
Brecht also cut off interest in story or suspense
by describing what would happen at the beginning

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.190
of a scene or actually writing it out on a
half-curtain.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.170
Because full curtains are too disbelief suspending.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.400
There’s often a narrator and a use of signs
and placards.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.880
He wanted each scene to exist independently
and for the audience to have to work out how

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.020
to put them all together.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.690
He was also big on speaking stage directions
out loud.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.070
Brecht wrote that he wanted theater to feel
like a boxing match.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.570
No one attending a boxing match thinks that
these guys pummeling each other are doing

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.340
it because they’re super mad at each other.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.810
The audience understands that the construct
is artificial.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.440
That said, maybe Brecht didn’t choose the
best metaphor, because in boxing the punches

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.440
are real.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.750
And if you’ve been to a match, you’ll
know that the ringside audience is not especially

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.990
… distanced.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.710
But here’s a funny thing about Brecht’s
plays: yes, they’re episodic and brainy,

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.680
and they keep reminding you that YOU ARE DEFINITELY
WATCHING A PLAY.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.810
But even when they’re directed in a V-effect
style, you usually end up pretty engaged with

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:57.130
the characters and the story, and not necessarily
with the dialectics.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.280
Curse you, entertainment!

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.979
“The Threepenny Opera” was such a runaway
success not because people were so on fire

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:09.540
for Brecht rendering London’s criminal underworld
as an allegory for exploitative labor practices

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.800
in a play-staged-as-such.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.430
It was probably because Kurt Weill wrote some
fire tracks.

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.190
I mean “Mack the Knife.”

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.190
Come on!

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.800
And all that stuff about girls, crimes, and
general skulduggery was pretty fun.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.120
UH HUH SURE A SKULL JOKE
Brecht wrote in a bunch of styles—comedies,

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.580
dramas, biographies, history plays, musicals,
and folk dramas.

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:34.270
His plays cover a huge temporal and geographical
range, too—part of the whole estrangement

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.270
thing.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.270
They’re smart and playful.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.180
They often have really good roles for women,
which isn’t always a given.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.030
And the balance of political dynamics with
narrative pull is usually fascinating.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.639
But there’s one more thing to know about
Brecht.

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:49.820
His own labor practices were maybe exploitative,
too.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.140
He had a whole bunch of co-writers, usually
women he was involved with, and he almost

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.790
never gave them credit for their significant
contributions…

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:01.040
Like mostly writing some of the plays!

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.639
I guess maybe that partly explains his well
written female roles?

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:09.120
Let’s look at “The Good Person of Setzuan,”
first performed in 1943 with songs by Paul

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.380
Dessau added later.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.680
It’s the heartwarming fable of a kindly
prostitute who learns to protect herself from

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:19.620
exploitation by dressing and acting like a
really, really mean dude.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:24.180
It’s full of sweet, sweet Brechtian devices
like talking directly to the audience and

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.440
explaining the action before it happens.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.210
Help us out, ThoughtBubble:
A bunch of gods drop in on Setzuan, looking

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.440
for a really good person.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.219
They have trouble finding one until they come
to the door of the prostitute Shen Teh, who

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:39.420
takes them in even though she’s penniless.

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:43.979
The gods reward Shen Teh with money and tell
her to continue to be good.

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:49.260
She takes the money, buys a tobacco shop,
and tries to be good, but her generosity just

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.790
makes her a target.

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:56.320
She falls for a pilot, Yang Sun, but he steals
her money and leaves her pregnant.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.600
Then Shen Teh has a bright idea.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:04.460
She invents a cousin named Shui Ta, dresses
up as him, and orders all of the freeloaders

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.380
to leave the shop.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:12.370
Turns out, Shui Ta is really good at business,
so good that he turns Shen Teh’s tobacco

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:15.310
shop into a full-on tobacco factory.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:17.350
But this subterfuge is hard on Shen Teh.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:21.170
People hear her crying behind a door when
only Shiu Ta is supposed to be around, and

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.110
they find some of her clothing.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.960
So they try Shui Ta for murder.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.380
Shui Ta convinces the judge to close the courtroom
and reveals all.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:35.410
The gods are present, but they leave Shen
Teh, who cries out that it’s impossible

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.540
to be good AND survive in the real world.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.520
In an epilogue, the responsibility is foisted
onto the audience:

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:49.050
“You should now consider as you go
What sort of measures you would recommend

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.330
To help good people to a happy end.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:59.830
Ladies and gentlemen, in you we trust:
There must be happy endings, must, must, must!”

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.740
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.650
Was that happy?

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:08.540
In having the same actor play both Shen Teh
and Shui Ta, Brecht distances us from strictly

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:13.350
identifying with the character, and the story
creates a dialectical conflict between right

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:16.709
moral action and social survival.

00:10:16.709 --> 00:10:20.170
The gods can’t resolve that - can you?

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.120
Be the change Shen Teh needs to see in the
world.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.860
Maybe Brecht never really achieved his goal
of turning the theater from a place of entertainment

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.760
to a place of education.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.330
His plays are too entertaining!

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:37.610
But his style became a huge influence on modern
and postmodern theater, television, and film.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.130
Or is that just what Mike Rugnetta would say?

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.029
We’ll see you next time, when things are
going to get absurd.

00:10:41.029 --> 00:10:45.529
[[[Yorick flies in, and they have a moment
in which everyone acknowledges that our sidekick

00:10:45.529 --> 00:10:48.140
is a non-verbal skull.]]]

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.140
More absurd.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:52.820
We’ll be exploring the Theater of the Absurd
with Eugene Ionesco, Jean Genet, and Samuel

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.980
Beckett—the whole madcap and deeply-pessimistic-about-the-human-condition
gang.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.600
Until then… curtain.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.230
Which is a device the theater uses to obfuscate
the machinery of stage craft, and maintain

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:07.540
the illusion of the stage as a location subject
to different rules than the so called “real

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:32.720
world”, a division that is ultimately [[the
curtain actually closes]] HEY HEY C’MON
