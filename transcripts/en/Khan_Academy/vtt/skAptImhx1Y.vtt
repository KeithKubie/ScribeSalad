00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.950
- [Voiceover] Erika plans to
purchase seed to plant grass

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.350
in a large field.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.490
She has a map of the region,
and calculates the area

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.790
of the region on paper to
be 180 square centimeters.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.270
The scale on the map shows
that one centimeter is

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.690
equal to 20 feet.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.350
So they're giving us linear
centimeters to linear feet,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.280
not square centimeters to square feet,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.450
so I think we're going to
have to figure that out.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.320
If Erika plans to cover every
400 square feet with one pound

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.530
of seed, approximately
how many pounds of seed

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.250
will she need to cover the entire field?

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.250
So what we want to do
is we want to figure out

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.450
well, how many square feet is the field?

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.050
How many square feet is the field?

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.690
And we know on her map,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.110
her map has, well a map of the field.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.740
On the map it's 180 square centimeters and

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.490
they tell us that one centimeter

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.390
is equal to 20 feet.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.150
But if this is square
centimeters, then we want

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.320
to convert this to square feet.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.050
So if one centimeter is equal to 20 feet,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.620
if we want to figure out the conversion

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.390
from square centimeters to square feet,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.270
we could just square both sides of this.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.220
We could just square both sides of this,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.090
and what will that be?

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.420
One squared is still one, but now we have

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.720
one centimeter squared

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.420
and I could write it like this
just to be clear that I took

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.950
both of them to the second power

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.990
but one squared is just one.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.350
And this is going to be equal,

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.980
20 squared is going to be

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.800
400 square feet.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.950
So one square centimeter
on this map is going to be

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.120
equal to 400 square feet.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.990
So how many square feet does

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.350
180 square centimeters represent?

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.920
So I could write

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.090
180 centimeters squared.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.990
And we know that every centimeter squared

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.390
represents 400 feet.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.840
Or we could say 400 feet squared

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.380
per centimeter squared.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.850
And we want the units to
cancel out so this makes sense.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.620
You have centimeters squared
over centimeters squared.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.210
So the actual field is going to be 180

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.620
times 400 square feet.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.890
And that makes sense.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.960
The region on paper was
180 square centimeters.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.390
Each square centimeter is
equal to 400 square feet

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.650
in reality.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.590
So for each of those square
centimeters, it's going to be

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.420
400 square feet.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.550
So it's 180 times 400.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.080
So this is the area in square
footage of the actual field

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.120
and then they tell us we're
going to use one pound of seed

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.450
for every 400 square feet.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.710
So let's see, the area
of the entire field,

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.280
let me give myself a
little bit more space, is

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.680
and I'm not going to even
multiply it out because

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.810
this 400 is showing up
so this seems useful.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.790
So the area is 400 feet squared.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.020
I just wrote that.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.180
And we're going to use one pound

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.230
one pound of seed,

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.970
pound of seed,

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.790
for every 400 square feet,

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.100
for every 400 square feet.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.710
And if we look at it the units cancel out,

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.020
square feet divided by square feet

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.990
and then we have 400,

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.420
divided by 400.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.350
And we're left with 180
times one pound of seed

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.820
which tells us that we're going to use

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.720
180 pounds,

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.010
180 pounds of seed

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.020
which is that choice right over there.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.690
Now if you're under time pressure on SAT

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.170
although I would be
careful because this one,

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.920
it could be a little bit confusing.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.333
But you might say okay,
there's 180 square centimeters.

00:03:48.333 --> 00:03:50.710
Each of those square
centimeters is 400 feet.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.720
This is actually the key
thing that you have to realize

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.250
that each square centimeter
is not just 20 feet,

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.480
it's 400 feet.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.450
So you're going to have
180 times 400 square feet

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.800
for the entire field.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.850
But then each of those 400 feet,

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.150
each of those 180, 400 square feet,

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.820
you're going to use one pound of seed.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.490
So you're going to use 180 pounds of seed.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.420
So you could have done it
without all of this writing

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.290
but it is helpful to write it so that you

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.600
don't confuse things.
