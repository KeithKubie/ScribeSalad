Okay, so we've taken our bucket all the way up to the top here that took 350 J of work

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and now we need to carry it to 4 m so that we can dump it into the sea.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Now I want to know, how much work do we do in carrying

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
this 5 kg bucket 4 m over to the sea.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now, I have to issue a little disclaimer here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is much trickier problem than it looks like at first.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You'll probably get it wrong and that's okay.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Part of the purpose here is to get you a little bit frustrated because what I'm going to teach you

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
in the solution video is so important that I really want you to remember.
