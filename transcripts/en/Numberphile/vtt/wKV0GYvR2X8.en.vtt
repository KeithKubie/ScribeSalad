00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460
We'll start very slowly, but don't worry we'll speed up in a moment.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:10.120
A strip of paper and I glue the ends into a loop.  A straight loop.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.600
And I cut it along the centre line.  Well, what's going to happen?  Everyone can guess what's going to happen.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.160
In fact everyone knows with total conviction what's going to happen.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.280
It splits into two halves.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.160
Next, we're going to make the famous object Möbius strip.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.000
Now that's one twist - 180 degrees - and glue the ends.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.320
And this is the well-known object which only has one face and so forth.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.240
What's going to happen if we cut this along the centre line?

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.840
And unlike the previous case it does not fall into two pieces.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.400
Now, so far so good.  And people might say I've already done that and so forth, I've seen it in books.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.540
But even professionals mathematicians often don't realize how many twists there are in this resulting object.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:10.400
In this configuration we see all the twists are in the upper half of the strip and the lower half has no twists.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.680
Let's count the number of twists this object has.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.980
In order to do so I'm going to apply the violence and I'm not going to move.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.500
Cutting the lower half and start untwisting the top one.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.360
Still twisted obviously.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.940
Two, three, it's side but still twisted.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.320
Four, and finally it's straight.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.620
That's not what I wanted to show you.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.000
What I wanted to show you is something different.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.560
What we want to do is to glue together those strips.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.320
For example that's straight against straight.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.320
glued at right angles to each other.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.340
and what we're going to do is cut this kind of object

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.580
all the way around the centre line, all the way around the centre line

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.600
Not only straight ones but also with glued Möbius strips.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.100
So there are four possibilities: straight against straight

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.960
Straight against Möbius, and Möbius against Möbius.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.240
And now you're thinking that Tadashi can't count because there are only three cases but actually there are four because when you do Möbius against Möbius

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.080
Those two Möbius strips could be of the same chirality, that is they might be twisted in the same direction

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.000
or they can have opposite chirality, that is they are twisted in opposite cases.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.280
Clearly, maybe they will produce different results so we have to be careful.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:25.940
Straight against straight. Here is a cross and I glue the ends, that's one straight strip for us.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And the other strip

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.000
like so

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.060
By the way a little bit of engineering advice if you want to show this to friends and family it's very tempting

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.960
to make the strips loop and then glue them at right angles, but then it become really difficult actually.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.820
You have to go in there and glue and it's nasty. So it's much better to make a cross and then glue the ends.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.080
By cutting all the way around one centre line and all the way around the other centre line

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.680
somewhere in the middle you have to make a cross cut

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.840
But in order to make the suspense last, I'm going to leave the cross cut until the end.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.600
So here I started cutting one of the loops all the way along the centre line

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.260
And the other loop along the centre line.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.420
Also all the way around but leaving the cross cut until the end.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.320
This is the picture just as we are about to finish cutting. You can see this was one untwisted loop

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.180
cut along the centre line and this was another untwisted loop cut along the centre line

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:32.900
Okay, now, earlier when we had a single untwisted ordinary loop and when we cut it along the centre line

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.500
it just split in two halves, 
the results of which are visible here.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.500
What's going to happen this time?

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.720
Easily, I'm going to cut this, finish cutting it and chopping it, chop, chop.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.100
And what I manage is a flat square!

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.280
Hmm, that's funny. Flat square. What happened?

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.640
Okay. We'll come back to that in a moment. But let's try the next case.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.140
Let's try straight against Möbius

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.880
That's a straight strip. And then the other one I'm going to twist once into a Möbius strip.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.900
And by which I mean twist one and then glue the ends, okay.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.000
This object is generally different from the previous one so when I cut this object along the centre line like this.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
It should produce something, hopefully, different.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.340
Let's try it again. As usual in order to make the suspense last I'm going to leave the cross cut until the end.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.340
And then now the other loop

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.340
Let's cut along the centre line

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.300
Cut, cut, cut. And that's the picture that we have.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.260
As we are about to finish cutting so we can see that this was a straight loop

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.260
which has been cut along the centre line. And that was the Möbius

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.700
twisted, and has been cut along the centre line.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.440
And this, as we say, is different from the previous one

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.340
straight against straight because of this twist.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.680
Now what's going to happen when I cut finish cutting everything?

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.200
Are you ready? Am finally finish cutting and what we've managed is

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.820
again a flat square!

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.800
Well that was disappointing or interestingly disappointing.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.680
Well maybe we are getting a flat square every single time.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.900
Straight against straight: flat square. Straight against Möbius: flat square again.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.640
Let's now do Möbius against Möbius. 
But now we'll do two Möbiuses of opposite chiralities,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.200
that is twisted in opposite ways.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.720
Now if you want to show this off to friends and family you have to remember that this is opposite.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.060
And in order to do so you have to exercise your short term memory.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.420
Here, first let's glue this by twisting this piece

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.540
clockwise, in a right handed screw fashion.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.540
and make a Möbius.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.540
And you have to remember this.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.540
So that's one.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.280
In a moment, when I'm about to close the other one.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.140
Wait what have I just done? Is it clockwise or anti-clockwise?

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.980
What was it?

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:56.380
Well it was clockwise, so this time you have to spin it counter clockwise

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.600
or anti-clockwise if you're looking at it from the other side of the Atlantic.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.540
In a left handed screw fashion and then close the ends.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.740
Glue the ends together and that's the other piece.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.720
Two Möbius strips that have opposite chiralities

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.720
that are glued at right angles to each other

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.700
It's a rather beautiful thing.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.440
And although this is strickly not necessary from the mathematical point of view,

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.220
I'm going to reinforce these pieces from the back because

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.940
that is going to be better for the resulting sculpture later on

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.160
And this is a present for everyone.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.600
I cut all the way around one.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.080
And all the way around the other loop.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.560
Leaving the cross cut until the end as usual.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.660
Are you ready? So nothing up here, nothing up here. And what the image is is a present for all of you.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:43.780
And I finish cutting. I finish cutting and I told you this is applicable, an applied mathematics,

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.200
what the emerges is amazingly,

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.200
a pair of linked hearts!

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:55.280
So you can see, it is an applicable mathematics as you can see and you can apply it in all sorts of contexts.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.280
And I hope you make good use of it.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.460
Now let's understand why we get the flat square.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:10.720
Until now, in a silly attempt at fair tricks, I was leaving the cross cut until the end

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:17.500
A good point of view however, a good way to think about this is to cut one of the pieces completely around.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.500
four and finally it's straight.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.120
So the object had four twists not two.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:30.640
Where do the extra two twists come from? Do you know? As I say, we seemed to have proved, a moment ago,

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.680
that the object should have two twists but it had four twists it comes from the following interesting effect.
