00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:03.469
while most conservative
and liberal pundits

00:00:03.502 --> 00:00:06.506
are at each other's throats
concerning guns,

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:10.343
Fox News host Gretchen Carlson
kind of went off script.

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:12.278 line:0%
There's no doubt
that Omar Mateen

00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:15.715 line:0%
was able to kill so many people
because he was firing an AR-15,

00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:18.351 line:0%
a weapon easier to buy
in the state of Florida

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:19.685 line:0%
than buying a handgun.

00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:23.523 line:0%
I'm also with the majority today
taking a stand.

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:27.226 line:0%
Can't we hold true the sanctity
of the Second Amendment

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.729 line:0%
while still having common sense?

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.631
By the way, Fox News employees,

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:33.199
swing by
Buffalo Wild Wings tonight

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:34.867
for Gretchen Carlson's
farewell party.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.970
(laughter, shouts, whooping)

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:41.007
I'm telling you, there's
no way Fox is keeping her

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.909
-after that, man.
-(laughter)

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:44.610
Good for you, Gretchen.
Good for you.

00:00:44.643 --> 00:00:46.612
And to help Gretchen...
you know, to help Gretchen

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:49.982
land a new job, we got her
the MSNBC starter pact.

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:52.718
-(laughter)
-So, here we go.

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:55.988
-(audience whooping)
-There we go. Very nice.

00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:57.890
-(applause)
-It's all here.

00:00:57.923 --> 00:01:00.793
Uh, the short androgynous
brunette wig,

00:01:00.826 --> 00:01:03.362
black glasses,
and a Ta-Nehisi Coates book.

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:05.631
-Uh... let's see how she'll look
-(laughter)

00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:08.267
for her MSNBC job interview.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.336
Oh! Nice.

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.071
Perfect! I like it!

00:01:12.104 --> 00:01:13.806
I like it a lot.

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:15.508
(laughing):
Very good.

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:17.376
Everyone should have
one of those, I think.

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:18.744
They really should.

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:19.879
(chuckles)

00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:21.614
Meanwhile, senate Democrats

00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:23.683
are tired
of just talking about guns.

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.618
They want action.

00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:27.453 line:0%
NEWSMAN:<i> Led by Connecticut
 senator, Chris Murphy,</i>

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:29.555 line:0%
<i> Democrats commandeering
 the senate floor,</i>

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:32.325 line:0%
<i> trying to force a vote
 to toughen up gun laws.</i>

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:34.961 line:0%
And so I'm gonna remain
on this floor

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:39.265 line:0%
until we get some signal,
some sign...

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:41.334 line:0%
that we can come together...

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:43.236
I tried that line
on Halle Berry.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.838
(laughter)

00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:48.274
Still waiting!

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:52.578
So the Democrats are fighting
for two amendments, right?

00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:54.113
Expanding background checks

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:56.149
and preventing
people on the no-fly list

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:57.884
from being able to buy guns.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:00.653
Now, these are no-brainers,
especially the no-fly list one.

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:02.755
In fact, it's such a no-brainer

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:05.958
that even someone
with barely a brain agrees.

00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:08.327 line:0%
NEWSMAN:<i> Trump signaling
an openness to new restrictions</i>

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.630 line:0%
<i> that would ban people
 on the terrorist watch list</i>

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:13.566 line:0%
<i> or the no-fly list
 from buying guns.</i>

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.169
Yes, guys,
Trump makes a good point.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:18.871
But calm down--
you can hit a piano with a bat

00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:20.973
and still get a couple
of notes, all right?

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:22.441
-(laughter)
-Bam!

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:24.277
Doesn't make you Rachmaninoff.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.379
It does not, all right?

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:30.249
And, by the way,
even the Benghazi Kid agrees.

00:02:30.282 --> 00:02:33.052 line:8%
If you are too dangerous
to get on a plane,

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:35.454 line:0%
you are too dangerous
to buy a gun.

00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:37.990
Well, I don't know,
I don't know.

00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:41.060
'Cause under that logic,
then no mother (bleep) snakes

00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:43.496
can buy
any mother (bleep) guns...

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:44.964
(laughter, whooping)

00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:49.168
...'cause they are not allowed
on any mother (bleep) plane.

00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:52.371
Is that your vision
of America, Hillary?

00:02:52.404 --> 00:02:53.639
Eh!

00:02:53.672 --> 00:02:55.875
All right,
so both sides agree, right?

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:57.777
But, you know,
here's the thing, guys,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.379
here's the thing-- when
both sides agree so quickly

00:03:00.412 --> 00:03:02.715
after being so far apart
on everything,

00:03:02.748 --> 00:03:05.184
that's when I generally
get worried, okay?

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:07.019
So let's really
think this through.

00:03:07.052 --> 00:03:10.389
Because this country has a habit
of making bad decisions

00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:12.558
in the wake
of a national crisis.

00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:14.327
(coughs):
Iraq War.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.628
-(laughter)
-Hmm?

00:03:15.661 --> 00:03:16.896
(coughs):
Patriot Act.

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:18.097
(clears throat)

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.000
(coughing):
Japanese internment camps.

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:23.202
(coughing):
<i> Fuller House.</i>

00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:24.870
(laughter, applause)

00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:26.839
Well...

00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:29.942
Once the Olsen twins weren't in,
Wilmore was out.

00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:31.210
Okay?

00:03:31.243 --> 00:03:33.846
But look, here's the thing,
though, it's easy to say,

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.147
"Well, this person is dangerous,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.016
they shouldn't be allowed
to buy guns,"

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.384
but it isn't that simple, okay?

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:40.886
Anyone can be under
the investigation of the FBI.

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.856
I mean, Martin Luther King was
under investigation of the FBI.

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.225
John Lennon was under
investigation of the FBI.

00:03:46.258 --> 00:03:49.595
Hillary Clinton is currently
under investigation of the FBI.

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:52.932
Right? How embarrassing
would it be to have a president

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:54.634
who's on the no-fly list?

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:55.635
(laughter)

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:57.436
(as Hillary):
Could we do the summit

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.039
at the White House instead? Oh.

00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:03.576
Air Force One is in the shop.
Yeah. All right.

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.378
And because it's the government,
you know,

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.179
there's also the problem
of bureaucratic error.

00:04:07.212 --> 00:04:09.882
For instance-- this is true--
do you know who else

00:04:09.915 --> 00:04:11.417
has been denied entry
to airplanes?

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.553
Air marshals who are supposed
to protect us while flying,

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:18.224
but who also have names too
similar to someone on the list.

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:20.893
Like, Dave ben Laden.

00:04:20.926 --> 00:04:22.361
(laughter)

00:04:22.394 --> 00:04:24.930
But B-E-N Laden. Mm-hmm.

00:04:24.963 --> 00:04:26.599
He's not Laden now.

00:04:26.632 --> 00:04:28.567
He's<i> been</i> Laden.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.803
-(laughter)
-Thank you very much.

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:32.905
See how I did that?
With the "been."

00:04:32.938 --> 00:04:34.807
-(applause)
-He ain't Laden no mo'.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.009
-(whooping, whistling)
-Thank you! Thank you, lady!

00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:38.978
That's what I'm talking about!

00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:40.946
Whistle Lady, too.

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.281
Mm.

00:04:42.314 --> 00:04:44.050
All right?
And Whistle Lady got it, too.

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:45.518
-Thank you, Whistle Lady.
-(laughter)

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:47.887
Okay. Here's my other problem
with this list

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.555
of "potential" bad people.

00:04:49.588 --> 00:04:52.024
Any of us could wind up
on this thing--

00:04:52.057 --> 00:04:55.328
and by "any of us," I mean
mostly black and brown people.

00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:58.864
Do you know what putting
black people on a no-fly list

00:04:58.897 --> 00:05:01.367
would mean
to Southwest Airlines?

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.736
(laughter)

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:06.339
-Decimated, all right?
-(laughter)

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:09.041
And by the way, neither
the San Bernardino shooters

00:05:09.074 --> 00:05:11.277
nor the Orlando shooter
were on the no-fly list.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.879
I'll tell you what, how
about if we put all Americans

00:05:13.912 --> 00:05:16.682
on a no-buying-assault-weapons
list?

00:05:16.715 --> 00:05:20.286
-(whooping, applause) -That's
what I think should be done.

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:21.987
How about that list?

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.056
All right. Okay.

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:26.092 line:0%
So to learn more
about the process

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:28.027 line:0%
by which these lists are made,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.162 line:0%
please welcome
the acting deputy undersecretary

00:05:30.195 --> 00:05:32.665 line:0%
of the Homeland Security's
Bureau of Regulation Management

00:05:32.698 --> 00:05:35.067 line:0%
and Lists, Dirk McDermond.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.403 line:0%
(cheering, applause)

00:05:37.436 --> 00:05:38.838 line:0%
Hi, Larry.

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:40.339 line:0%
Okay, so, yo,

00:05:40.372 --> 00:05:43.509 line:0%
now, I have to say,
I have very serious concerns

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:46.479 line:0%
about these lists--
so how exactly do they work?

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:48.814 line:0%
(sighs): It's a very
complicated system, Larry.

00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:50.983 line:0%
-Mm-hmm. -It involves
covert surveillance,

00:05:51.016 --> 00:05:54.053 line:0%
-Right. -complex equations,
forensic analysis.

00:05:54.086 --> 00:05:55.755
-It's...
-Really?

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:58.023
Man, I'm just messing with you,
man. If somebody looks guilty,

00:05:58.056 --> 00:06:00.593
we just put 'em
on a list. Come on.

00:06:00.626 --> 00:06:02.695
See? I knew it.
But... Look, you-you...

00:06:02.728 --> 00:06:04.797
If you can just
slap someone on a list

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.565
and then take away
a Constitutional right,

00:06:06.598 --> 00:06:08.100
you're depriving them
of due process,

00:06:08.133 --> 00:06:09.635
which means any American
has the potential

00:06:09.668 --> 00:06:11.003
to be on that list, right?

00:06:11.036 --> 00:06:12.872
No, no, no, no, no, no,
of course not.

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:14.640
There is a long list of people

00:06:14.673 --> 00:06:17.109
who will never
be put on a list, okay?

00:06:17.142 --> 00:06:19.311
We call it the "no list" list.

00:06:19.344 --> 00:06:21.947
We got this.
We got this covered.

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.483
But, look,
even the ACLU is concerned

00:06:24.516 --> 00:06:26.919
that a lot of these lists
are just like profiling.

00:06:26.952 --> 00:06:28.988
And you'll have a list
that's full of people

00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:30.756
who look a certain way.

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:33.058
And by "certain way",
I mean people of color.

00:06:33.091 --> 00:06:35.594
-Completely understand
your concern. -Thank you.

00:06:35.627 --> 00:06:38.431
Look, that's why we have
a long list of safeguards

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:40.132
to prevent those things
from happening. We got...

00:06:40.165 --> 00:06:42.134
-That's just another list.
-Yeah, all right.

00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:43.936
How do you keep
all the lists straight?

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:46.038
I'll give you a hint:
it starts with an L

00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:48.407
and it rhymes with "cyst".

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.944
-List.
-Boom, you got it.

00:06:51.977 --> 00:06:54.313
All right, I'm still concerned.
Here's the other thing--

00:06:54.346 --> 00:06:55.981
how can people
even get off this list?

00:06:56.014 --> 00:06:57.516
-That's another problem.
-Oh, you see, Larry,

00:06:57.549 --> 00:06:59.618
that's very simple.
You just have to get on

00:06:59.651 --> 00:07:02.721
the "take me off the list" list.

00:07:02.754 --> 00:07:05.191
-How do they do that? -Well,
right now you can't do it,

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:07.059
'cause currently there's
a bit of a waiting list.

00:07:07.092 --> 00:07:10.362
But still, you know, you can...

00:07:10.395 --> 00:07:11.831
Is there anything
someone can do?

00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:13.299
Can they at least call?

00:07:13.332 --> 00:07:14.934
No, we're actually unlisted.

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:17.570
Of course you are, right. Okay.

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:19.572
So, you don't think there's
anything wrong with this?

00:07:19.605 --> 00:07:21.774
I mean, you're not even worried
about people's civil liberties.

00:07:21.807 --> 00:07:23.442
As a black man,
I'm sure... I'm sure

00:07:23.475 --> 00:07:25.311
I'm already probably,
like, on seven lists.

00:07:25.344 --> 00:07:27.646
-(coughs) 13.
-What?

00:07:27.679 --> 00:07:29.915
No, no, I... No, look,
listen, I got to run.

00:07:29.948 --> 00:07:32.618
I'm sorry, I-I'm working, like,
over at Buzzfeed at night.

00:07:32.651 --> 00:07:34.887
You know? I'm, uh,
working on some lists for them.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.956
Yeah, like, right now
I got this one, you go,

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:39.692
-29 Reasons My Cat Can't Even.
So cool. -Okay, all right.

00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:41.961
Whatever.
Dirk McDermond, everybody.

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:43.162
We'll be right back.

00:07:43.195 --> 00:07:45.131
