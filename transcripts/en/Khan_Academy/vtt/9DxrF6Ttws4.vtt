00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.670
Let's do some examples
of solving equations.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.110
And you're going to see the
equations in this video,

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.320
they're not going to require a
lot of steps, but I really

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.970
want to focus on what's actually
happening on the

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.020
equation, and why it makes sense
to do the steps that

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.910
we're doing.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.495
So this first equation here,
we have x-- I'll rewrite it

00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:22.890
--x plus 11 is equal to 7.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.280
So that's telling us-- And I
have this little dot here, let

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.510
me eliminate, let me
clear that dot.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.950
Don't want you to think I have
some type of a decimal there.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:32.820
There you go.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.200
So back to the problem.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.130
So what is this saying?

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.950
This is saying, some number
plus 11 is equal to 7.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.840
And you may already be able
to do this in your head.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.730
You know, what do I have to
add to 11 to get to 7?

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.650
So it's going to have
to be some type

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.375
of a negative number.

00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:49.780
But we're going to learn how
to do this systematically.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.860
So what we want to do is, when
we solve an equation, it

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.885
should be of the form,
when we're all done,

00:00:54.885 --> 00:00:56.890
x is equal to something.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.950
And that's going to
be our answer.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.840
We'll know what number satisfies
this equation.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.470
Now, to get there, what we want
to do is to just have

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.460
this x on the left-hand
side of the equation.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.000
We don't want this 11 there.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.150
We want to get rid of this 11
somehow, on the left-hand side

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.220
of this equation.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.570
Now to do that, we can't just
get rid of it only on the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.310
left-hand side.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.950
You might want to just say, hey,
let me subtract 11 from

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.640
the left-hand side
of the equation.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.130
But this is an equation.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.310
Anything you do to one side of
the equation, you have to do

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.110
to the other side
of the equation.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.850
If x plus 11 is equal to
7, x plus 11 minus 11

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.230
won't equal 7 anymore.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.820
You'll have to also subtract
11 from the 7.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.230
Now they're equal.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.950
Remember, I want to really
emphasize this.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.300
I want you to really
think about what

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.840
this equality means.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.810
Equation, it comes from the
notion of equality.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.670
This is equal to this.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.640
These two things are equivalent
quantities.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.050
Now, in order for this equal to
hold true, anything I do to

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.470
this, if I'm subtracting 11 from
this quantity, in order

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.480
for the equality to hold true,
I also have to subtract 11

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.530
from this quantity right here.
x plus 7 and 7 are equal.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.940
So they're still going to be
equal after I subtract 11.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.830
Now let's focus on the
left-hand side.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.360
Negative 11 plus x plus 11,
negative 11 plus 11, they're

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.480
going to cancel out, right?

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.910
11 minus 11 is 0.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.270
So you're going to be with left
with just an x is equal

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.446
to 7 minus 11.

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:29.910
Now what's 7 minus 11?

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.810
You can draw a number line
out, if you like.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:39.030
If we draw a number line right
here-- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.880
7 is there.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.550
And if you subtract 11 from
that, you go back 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.460
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.790
8, 9, 10, 11.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.320
That takes you to negative 4.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.370
7 minus 11 is negative 4.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.560
That's our first equation.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.120
Now we have 7 times some
number-- this is the new

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.570
problem --7 times some number
x is equal to 21.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.860
This is going to be a different
x than this one

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.750
right here.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.560
So how, once again, do we get
it in the form of x is equal

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.120
to something?

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.770
Remember, we've got x is
equal to something.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.460
How do we get into that form?

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.000
Let me rewrite the problem.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.020
7 times something
is equal to 21.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.250
Well, I could think
of it two ways.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.360
If I divide 7 times
x by 7, what am I

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.250
going to be left with?

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.920
If I divide that by 7, what am
I going to be left with?

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.780
7 times something divided by
7, that's just going to be

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.470
that something.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.090
That's just going to
end up with an x.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.620
But if I do it on the left-hand
side of the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.500
equation, I have
to do it on the

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.340
right-hand side of the equation.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.280
Remember, 7x is equal to 21.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.130
It's the same thing as 21.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.190
In order for this to be equal to
that when I divide by 7 on

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.020
the left, I also have to divide
by 7 on the right.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.020
And when I do that, 7 times x
divided by 7-- that's just

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.250
going to be x --and then 21
divided by 7 is equal to 3.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.710
So the solution to this equation
is x is equal to 3.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.900
And you can verify it.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.880
Take 3, plug it into
that equation.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.130
7 times 3 is indeed 21.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.329
Same thing over here.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.120
Take x is equal to negative 4.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.550
Negative 4 plus 11 is the
same thing as 11 minus

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.180
4, is indeed 7.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.090
Let's do this one here.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.700
This one looks a little bit
more difficult, but you're

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.700
going to see, it's
not too bad.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:38.020
So we have 5x over 12
is equal to 2/3.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.290
Now, how do you isolate
the x over here?

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.960
What can we multiply or divide
by to isolate it?

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.220
Well, what if we were to
multiply both sides of this

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.850
equation by 12 over 5?

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.230
What's going to happen?

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:57.520
So if I multiply the left-hand
side by 12 over 5-- And

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.630
remember, anything I do to one
side of an equation, I have to

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.550
do to the other side
of an equation.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.140
So if I multiply the left side
by 12 over 5, I have to

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.320
multiply the right side by 12
over 5 in order for that

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.200
equality to hold true.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.470
But why would I pick
12 over 5?

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.990
Because I wanted to pick a
number that cancels perfectly

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.000
with the 5 over 12.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.180
Right?

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.340
I have a 5 over 12 here.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.820
12 over 5 times 5 over 12, the
12's cancel out, the 5's

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.390
cancel out, and you're
left with just an x.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:30.260
So you get x is equal to
2/3 times 12 over 5.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.910
You can divide the 12
by 3 and get a 4.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.120
You can divide the 3
by 3 and get a 1.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.160
So you get 2 times 4 is
equal to 8 over 1

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.620
times 5, which is 5.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.940
So x is equal to 8/5.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.590
Now you might say, hey, Sal,
over here you divided by 7,

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.130
here you're multiplying by the
inverse of the coefficient.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.390
When do I know what to do?

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.080
And the answer is, you
can do either.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.790
I could have done this exact
same problem that way.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.100
I started with 7x
is equal to 21.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.630
Instead of dividing by 7, I
could have said, let me

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.910
multiply by the inverse of 7.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.800
So I could have multiplied by
the inverse of 7 on both sides

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.870
of the equation.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.020
This is equivalent
to dividing by 7.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.930
You can verify it.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.640
When you multiply by 1/7, that's
the exact same thing as

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.130
dividing by 7.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.580
So if you work this out,
these would cancel out.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.750
This is 1/7 times 7/1.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.940
The 7's cancel out.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.890
You get x is equal to 21 over
7, which is equal to 3.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:33.950
Likewise, over here,
I have 5x over 12.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.150
Let me write it this way.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:41.360
I could write it as, 5 over
12x is equal to 2/3.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.650
This is the exact
same problem.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.990
I'm just separating the
x out a little bit.

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.890
5/12 times x is 5x over 12.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.490
Now here, I could just say, let
me divide both sides by

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.940
the coefficient 5 over 12.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:07:00.520
So I could have just divided
by 5 over 12.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.550
But what does it mean to
divide by 5 over 12?

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.070
That's the same thing as
multiplying by 12 over 5.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.725
Dividing by a fraction is the
same thing as multiplying by

00:07:10.725 --> 00:07:11.500
its inverse.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.140
So this and this, we're doing
the exact same thing.

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.750
Whether you divide by the
coefficient, like we did over

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.320
here, or whether you multiply
by the inverse of the

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.350
coefficient, you're doing the
exact same operation.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:27.760
Now let's do some of these other
problems. And this is

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.990
really just to show you that the
variable isn't always x.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.180
We can solve for q.

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:32.610
We can solve for z.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:33.740
We can solve for s.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.100
We can solve for anything.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.710
So let's solve these
down here.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:42.790
So we have-- and I'll rewrite
it --you have q minus 13 is

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.540
equal to negative 13.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.380
So once again, we want
to isolate the q.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.300
We want it to be, q is
equal to something.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.880
Then we will have solved
our problem.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.220
So how can we isolate the q?

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.590
How can we get rid of this 13?

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.315
What if we add 13 to both
sides of this equation?

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.110
And I'm adding 13, because if
I add 13 to negative 13, or

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.680
minus 13 right here,
I'm going to get 0.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.910
So the left-hand side of this
equation is going to become q,

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:13.900
and then what is the right-hand
side, right?

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.720
That and that will cancel out.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.480
And the right-hand
side, negative 13

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.590
plus 13, is just 0.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.775
So our solution is,
q is equal to 0.

00:08:21.775 --> 00:08:23.230
And we can check it.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:28.100
0 minus 13 is indeed
negative 13.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.120
So it works.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.810
Actually I forgot to check
this one over here.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:31.380
Let's check it.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.500
The fun thing about
algebra, you can

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.919
always check your answer.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.600
We got x is equal to
8/5 over here.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.010
Let's check our answer.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:44.880
5 over 12 times x times 8
over 5 is equal to what?

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.910
5's cancel out.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.990
You can divide the 8
by 4 and get a 2.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.130
You could divide the 12
by 4 and get a 3.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.990
It equals 2/3.

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.200
So we can verify.

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:53.950
That's the neat thing.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.600
Once you get your answer, you
can always make sure, if you

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.500
have enough time, that you
got the right answer.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.180
Let's do these last two.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:11.330
We have z plus 1.1 is
equal to 3.0001.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.810
Once again, we want to get
rid of this 1.1 on

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:14.840
the left-hand side.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.370
The best way to do that that I
can think of is subtracting

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.970
1.1 from both sides, or adding
negative 1.1, however

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:22.750
you want to do it.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:25.290
If I do it on the left, I've
got to do it on the right.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.205
Otherwise the equality won't
still hold true.

00:09:27.205 --> 00:09:30.880
If this is equal to this, in
order for the two sides to be

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.530
equal, anything I do
to the left, I have

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.070
to do to the right.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.630
So let's see.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:39.390
If I subtract 1.1 from z plus
1.1, those two cancel out, and

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:50.960
I'm left with just a z is equal
to 3.0001 minus 1.1.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.852
So here we're going
to do a little bit

00:09:51.852 --> 00:09:53.500
of subtracting decimals.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.590
That's probably the hardest
part of this problem.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:10:00.030
So 3.0001 minus 1.1.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.320
You want to align
the decimals.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.570
Minus 1.1.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:06.510
Just like that.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.890
And we can even add some 0's
there, just to make it clear.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:13.260
And let's do our subtraction.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.730
1 minus 0 is 1.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.360
0 minus 0 is 0.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.460
0 minus 0 is 0.

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:21.180
Uh oh, we don't have-- We
can't do 0 minus 1.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.470
We can regroup, or
we can borrow.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:28.840
So this will become a 10,
which is really a 1.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.090
And we're going to take
a 1 from here, so this

00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:33.120
becomes a 2, right?

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.970
We borrowed from the 3, we
regrouped the numbers.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.260
We took the whole 1 and put it
in the tenths place, so it

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.840
becomes 10/10.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.660
So 10 minus 1 is 9.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.100
We have our decimal space.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.460
And then 2 minus 1 is 1.

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:53.380
So our answer is z is
equal to 1.9001.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.220
And we can verify that.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.470
What's z plus 1.1?

00:11:00.365 --> 00:11:01.980
Let's add it up.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:08.090
You get a 1, 00, 9.1 is 10, 1
plus 1 plus 1 is 3, we have

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.870
our decimal sign, and
we got 3.0001.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.770
That's a good review of
subtracting decimals.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:15.290
All right.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:16.390
And we have this last problem.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.920
21s is equal to 3.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.890
Like we said, we could do
this two ways, which are

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.530
essentially the same way.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.750
21 times some number
is equal to 3.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.670
Well, what happens if
we multiply both

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:33.550
sides by 1 over 21?

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.050
By the inverse of
the coefficient.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.050
The coefficient is just the
number that sits out in front

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.450
of the variable, that's
multiplying the variable.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:44.990
Well, 1 over 21 times 21 is just
1, so we get s is equal

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:48.000
to 3 over 21.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.830
And 3 over 21 is the same
thing as 1 over 7.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.180
And we can verify that.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.540
What is 21 times 1 over 7?

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.360
It's equal to 21 over 7.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.370
21 divided by 7.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.000
Which is 3.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.940
And just to really hit the point
home, I could have done

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.520
this problem-- Instead of
multiplying by 1 over 21--

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.240
let's see, 21s is equal to 3
--I could've, instead of

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.640
multiplying by 1 over 21, a
completely equivalent thing to

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:18.000
do would have been to just
divide both sides by 21.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.290
So these would cancel out.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:26.590
You'd get s is equal to 3
over 21, which is 1/7.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.840
Anyway, hopefully you found
those examples useful.
