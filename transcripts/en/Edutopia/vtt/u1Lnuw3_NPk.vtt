00:00:08.076 --> 00:00:08.976
&gt;&gt;Chris: One of the
things that I spend a lot

00:00:08.976 --> 00:00:12.536
of time thinking about is scaling up.

00:00:12.536 --> 00:00:16.146
We know that scaling up an education
is much more difficult than it is

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:18.746
in business where it's pretty easy

00:00:18.746 --> 00:00:22.376
to have every McDonalds fry
French fries in the same way.

00:00:22.926 --> 00:00:26.446
It's very difficult even
for a successful teacher

00:00:26.446 --> 00:00:31.326
to move her innovation down the
hall, let alone into another school

00:00:31.326 --> 00:00:34.496
or another district
halfway across the country.

00:00:35.236 --> 00:00:40.376
So I've developed a five dimensional
framework for thinking about scale

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:46.106
and by paying attention to each of
the dimensions we can make good ideas

00:00:46.106 --> 00:00:50.606
in education, easier to adapt
and transfer to other settings.

00:00:51.296 --> 00:00:54.956
One of the dimensions is depth
and that just deals with the fact

00:00:54.956 --> 00:00:59.536
that to be worth scaling, something
needs to be powerful to be attractive

00:00:59.536 --> 00:01:03.506
to other people, something needs to
show evidence that it's succeeded

00:01:04.026 --> 00:01:08.596
and so people who pay attention to
depth make their innovation more

00:01:08.596 --> 00:01:10.406
and more desirable over time.

00:01:11.406 --> 00:01:14.316
A second dimension deals with spread

00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:19.716
and spread involves making
the innovation easier

00:01:20.086 --> 00:01:22.096
and cheaper to adapt.

00:01:22.786 --> 00:01:27.926
So sometimes we build a Cadillac
version that works wonderfully

00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:31.486
but it costs a lot and then we
ask could we build something

00:01:31.486 --> 00:01:35.466
that was 70 percent as powerful
but at 30 percent of the cost,

00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:37.476
that's really what spread is about.

00:01:38.176 --> 00:01:41.156
Sustainability deals with the idea

00:01:41.156 --> 00:01:44.456
that you don't always have all the
conditions for success that you want.

00:01:44.996 --> 00:01:47.486
Perhaps you have a
technology based innovation

00:01:47.486 --> 00:01:50.036
but the technology only
works some of the time.

00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:53.156
Perhaps you have an innovation
for science class but some

00:01:53.156 --> 00:01:56.956
of the science teachers don't really
have much background in science.

00:01:57.436 --> 00:02:00.776
Looks like some of the conditions
for success might be marginal.

00:02:01.436 --> 00:02:05.126
Sustainability says let's go
build things that can work

00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:09.926
under adverse conditions, hybrids if
you will that are customized to one

00:02:09.926 --> 00:02:15.006
or another tough problem that
full innovation confronts

00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:17.976
and those hybrids may
not work as well

00:02:18.466 --> 00:02:21.666
as when everything is
perfect for innovating.

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:24.306
But they work well
enough to be worth doing,

00:02:24.516 --> 00:02:26.906
so sustainability is
another dimension.

00:02:27.986 --> 00:02:30.686
Shift is a dimension
that's very important

00:02:30.686 --> 00:02:32.136
because it involves the people

00:02:32.136 --> 00:02:34.976
that are doing the innovation
taking ownership of it.

00:02:35.336 --> 00:02:39.526
Now they're not doing your
innovation, they have taken charge

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:43.316
of their innovation, they've made it
theirs, they're more likely to stay

00:02:43.316 --> 00:02:45.746
with it, it's more likely
to work where they are

00:02:45.746 --> 00:02:49.076
because they understand
what works in their setting.

00:02:49.076 --> 00:02:54.596
And then evolution the final
dimension deals with shift

00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:58.116
and when people do make a shift
and they own the innovation

00:02:58.116 --> 00:03:02.606
and they change it, how do you as the
designer of the innovation respond

00:03:02.656 --> 00:03:05.106
to that, do you see it as
an opportunity to think

00:03:05.106 --> 00:03:06.726
about the whole thing differently?

00:03:07.076 --> 00:03:10.346
Maybe to evolve in a direction
that you weren't expecting.

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:14.386
So we've tried applying
this framework to a number

00:03:14.386 --> 00:03:16.666
of different projects
across education

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:18.686
that were really quite
different from one another.

00:03:18.986 --> 00:03:22.706
Teacher professional development
projects, kids building games,

00:03:23.416 --> 00:03:26.716
school districts doing one
to one initiatives and so on

00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:29.366
and the dimensions have
held up pretty well.

00:03:30.106 --> 00:03:33.596
There's a lots of reasons
why people aren't able

00:03:33.596 --> 00:03:38.406
to scale things successfully and the
reasons, the traps that people fall

00:03:38.406 --> 00:03:41.656
into also tend to map
onto this five dimensions.

00:03:42.236 --> 00:03:46.216
On the dimension of depth, people
try to make something perfect,

00:03:46.216 --> 00:03:49.276
so they keep trying to make it
more and more and more powerful,

00:03:49.276 --> 00:03:52.826
oh we can add this, we can add
that, it's not ready to scale yet

00:03:53.426 --> 00:03:56.406
and so it never scales because
it's a black hole to try

00:03:56.406 --> 00:03:58.576
to keep improving something
indefinitely.

00:03:59.466 --> 00:04:03.866
On the dimension of sustainability
where you're hybridizing something

00:04:03.866 --> 00:04:09.626
to make it work under adverse
conditions sometimes you worry

00:04:09.626 --> 00:04:14.836
because you feel as if you can't
make it work under some conditions

00:04:14.986 --> 00:04:18.266
that it's an innovation
that doesn't work

00:04:18.266 --> 00:04:21.446
if the teacher doesn't understand
the content or it really doesn't work

00:04:21.446 --> 00:04:24.926
if you don't have the technology
working a hundred percent of the time

00:04:25.396 --> 00:04:29.236
and it's okay, it's okay to build an
innovation that only works sometimes

00:04:29.276 --> 00:04:33.056
in some places because it's still
going to be very powerful there.

00:04:33.796 --> 00:04:37.946
Under the dimension of spread
people who worked really hard

00:04:37.946 --> 00:04:41.476
to make something that's powerful
worry about making a light version

00:04:41.476 --> 00:04:43.946
of it, it seems like
a perversion somehow

00:04:43.946 --> 00:04:46.236
to make something that's
less powerful.

00:04:46.906 --> 00:04:50.596
But if it's less powerful and it
reaches ten times as many people

00:04:50.596 --> 00:04:54.696
as the more powerful version you're
actually having a bigger impact,

00:04:54.916 --> 00:04:57.936
even though you may feel as
if you're not doing as well.

00:04:58.946 --> 00:05:03.796
Shift, well people who've developed
something think of it as theirs,

00:05:03.796 --> 00:05:05.516
they like having their brand on it,

00:05:05.686 --> 00:05:08.486
they like it being just the
way that they developed it.

00:05:08.956 --> 00:05:13.466
The idea that other people take it
and own it and change it, modify it,

00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:16.926
oh it feels like I don't
know, somebody stealing this.

00:05:17.306 --> 00:05:21.436
But in fact if you really want
something to scale you have to let go

00:05:21.436 --> 00:05:23.946
of it and you have to let
other people in on it.

00:05:24.756 --> 00:05:28.256
And evolution is hard because
once you've worked on something

00:05:28.296 --> 00:05:32.626
for a long time you have a kind of
tunnel vision connected with it.

00:05:32.876 --> 00:05:36.036
Other people change it in ways
that you weren't expecting.

00:05:36.576 --> 00:05:39.706
You have to become flexible
mentally and go back and try

00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:41.286
to see it with fresh eyes.

00:05:41.916 --> 00:05:46.656
Making the familiar strange is one of
the creativity strategies and that's

00:05:46.656 --> 00:05:48.406
at the heart of that particular trap.

00:05:49.326 --> 00:05:53.526
So all of those traps in the sense
are emotional more than intellectual

00:05:54.126 --> 00:05:58.026
and combined they do block a
lot of things from scaling.

00:05:59.276 --> 00:06:00.856
My colleagues and I are working

00:06:00.856 --> 00:06:04.806
to develop virtual performance
assessments, we know that paper

00:06:04.806 --> 00:06:08.226
and pencil item based tests
while they're reliable,

00:06:08.226 --> 00:06:09.246
while they're practical,

00:06:09.246 --> 00:06:11.616
while they're inexpensive
are not very valid,

00:06:12.226 --> 00:06:15.486
they don't really measure a lot
of the things that we care most

00:06:15.486 --> 00:06:18.876
about students learning
21st century skills,

00:06:18.876 --> 00:06:22.136
higher order thinking, collaboration.

00:06:22.596 --> 00:06:28.786
So we need some kind of measures
that help us accurately determine

00:06:28.786 --> 00:06:30.546
where we're succeeding
and where we're not

00:06:31.456 --> 00:06:35.626
and what we're doing is using
the Alice in Wonderland interface

00:06:35.706 --> 00:06:39.066
that underlies things like
Second Life or World of Warcraft,

00:06:39.516 --> 00:06:42.446
where you become a digital
person in a virtual world.

00:06:43.146 --> 00:06:47.886
To build assessments where the
student is confronted over an hour

00:06:47.886 --> 00:06:50.666
and hour and a half with a
really interesting challenge.

00:06:51.296 --> 00:06:54.636
The first of these that we're
building, you appear on a bay

00:06:54.636 --> 00:06:58.776
in Alaska where the kelp are
dying and we try to figure

00:06:58.776 --> 00:07:01.756
out what you know and don't
know about the scientific method

00:07:02.236 --> 00:07:06.566
by how you respond in terms of going
around the bay, collecting evidence,

00:07:06.566 --> 00:07:09.286
making inferences,
performing an experiment.

00:07:09.826 --> 00:07:14.196
It's a much richer problem than one
can pose on a paper and pencil test

00:07:14.876 --> 00:07:17.856
and we also collect much
more detailed information

00:07:17.856 --> 00:07:23.536
than just making them multiple choice
selection because we're storing

00:07:23.656 --> 00:07:28.346
at the back end all the movements
and the actions and the statements

00:07:28.346 --> 00:07:33.096
and the data collection that the
person is doing and then mapping

00:07:33.096 --> 00:07:37.246
that against an elaborate
definition of what the sub skills are

00:07:37.246 --> 00:07:39.226
that constitute science inquiry.

00:07:40.686 --> 00:07:47.126
It's not easy to aggregate too
much information into those kinds

00:07:47.126 --> 00:07:48.726
of judgments about skills.

00:07:49.256 --> 00:07:52.166
So it's too early to say
whether we're really going

00:07:52.236 --> 00:07:53.196
to succeed in that.

00:07:53.836 --> 00:07:57.516
But I think we're looking in the
right dark alley rather than trying

00:07:57.516 --> 00:08:00.376
to look under the street
light of the item based tests

00:08:00.376 --> 00:08:03.506
which are never going to be valid,
no matter how much effort we put

00:08:03.506 --> 00:08:06.466
into them, they're just too
simplistic and impoverished.

00:08:07.166 --> 00:08:10.516
So whether it's our group or whether
it's some other group I believe

00:08:10.516 --> 00:08:13.596
that in the next five years
there will be a big breakthrough

00:08:13.686 --> 00:08:18.886
in assessment and when that happens
for the first time we're going

00:08:18.886 --> 00:08:21.896
to have a really powerful
way of measuring which kinds

00:08:21.896 --> 00:08:26.276
of pedagogy are most effective
in teaching 21st century skills

00:08:26.276 --> 00:08:30.426
and sophisticated educational
outcomes and I'm very excited

00:08:30.426 --> 00:08:34.286
about that because I think it's going
to clearly show that active learning,

00:08:34.286 --> 00:08:38.156
project based learning, collaborative
learning, a lot of the things

00:08:38.156 --> 00:08:41.286
that we've known were powerful
but couldn't prove were powerful.

00:08:41.986 --> 00:08:44.156
We're finally going to
have a microscope I hope

00:08:44.356 --> 00:08:45.326
that lets us see that.

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:48.776
