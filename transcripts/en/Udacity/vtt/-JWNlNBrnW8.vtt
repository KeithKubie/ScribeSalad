00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:06.850
$10 divided by 2 sounds like a much
better deal than $2 divided into 10.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.354
$10 divided by 2 gives $5 per person,
but

00:00:10.354 --> 00:00:14.486
$2 divided by 10 gives
just $0.20 per person.

00:00:14.486 --> 00:00:16.320
So order definitely matters for

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.000
division, which means division does
not follow the commutative property.
