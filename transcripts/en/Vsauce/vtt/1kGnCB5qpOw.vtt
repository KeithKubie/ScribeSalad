00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:04.450
Dang it. This is too real. I want something I could do

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.690
online now guys. DONG.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.960
Let's start things off with a Tetris

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.500
Overload. 'Muse13NJ' showed me this first person

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.620
Tetris.
When you turn a piece, so does your perspective.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.680
It's fun, but 'Dixavd' would rather
prank you with Portal Tetris.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.190
Ah, you know, this isn't going to end well.
Or, really,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.480
in debt all.
'LeatbouldersTV' brought us Tetris

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.230
Laps, where just like Mario Tetris you
arrange blocks to make the level

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.270
more navigable. Now, as you play, you unlock each next level.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.450
But you could just cheat like 'BloodsailAdmiralTdk'

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.660
who showed off ArcadePreHacks.com, where you can find flash games you like to play

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.060
except all the levels are already
unlocked right off the bat. 'MrDeagleking'

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.100
blew my mind

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.239
with browser pong.
Why play with moving dots and

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.170
fixed part of your window, when you can play with windows.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.570
But now, let's toogle like 'tanos1998.'

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.070
This search engine takes a word you give it and makes a picture of that word

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.729
using the word itself.
For science,

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.040
check out the periodic table of videos
where the University of Nottingham gives

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.830
you a video

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.869
with info and experiments for every element.

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.060
Not enough about you?
'AliRex27' recommended

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.360
a site that takes your name and displays it as

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.320
elements. 'Vince8745' brought us this simple beauty
of a game called

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.229
'And Everything Started to Fall.'
In this game you climb through your life

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.780
to survive.
And as you survive you actually grow up -

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.280
first to child, then a teenager, and so on.
Wo...wait.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.409
How quickly can you type the alphabet?
'Thecheatlord999' showed me this guy

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.829
whose work is awesome. His planetarium
lets you pick a region of the world,

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.119
click through time and then check out
where the Moon will be,

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.490
what phase it'll be in, you can even mouse over a star to get its information.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.799
And if you own 3D glasses like these,
check out his

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.390
anaglyph drawing tool, where you can draw
pictures on the screen itself

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.659
and then navigate around in
three-dimensional space.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.779
On the manly side is 'JakeGordonTV's' message

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:13.090
about balls dropping. This chrome
experiment lets you draw lines to bounce

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.059
falling balls

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:18.319
right inside your browser.
Finally, trip out with 'misterturtle1998's' suggestion

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.669
for

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:24.559
this game that scares me.
But that's not all.

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:28.090
On Friday I'm gonna have a brand new
episode of Vsauce Leanback.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.870
It's going to be a really fun one.
But right now, go check out Kevin's little piece of

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.349
investigative journalism

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.620
about everything you need to know about jetpacks.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.520
It's awesome, subscribe to our channels.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.660
And as always,

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:41.009
thanks for watching.
