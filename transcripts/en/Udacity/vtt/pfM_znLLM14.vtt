00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.760
2.6 is on the right side of the line

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.939
which means it's closer
to 3 than it is to 2.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:12.070
So if we wanted to round 2.6
to the nearest whole number,

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.924
it would round to 3.

00:00:13.924 --> 00:00:18.618
In general, when we want to round
to the nearest whole number,

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:23.150
we round up when the number after
the decimal is 5 or bigger.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.015
When the first number after
the decimal is 4 or smaller,

00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:29.519
just leave the whole number as it is.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.843
Now, you try.

00:00:30.843 --> 00:00:35.350
Round 3.4 and
1.5 to the nearest whole number.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.010
