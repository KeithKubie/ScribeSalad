DON DODGE: Hi, I'm Don Dodge
and this is Google, "Root

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.790
Access." Today I have a special
guest, Alex Moore,

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.140
founder of Baydin, an email
productivity company.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.230
Welcome, Alex.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.830
ALEX MOORE: Thank you, Don.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.040
Great to be here.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.300
DON DODGE: So what is Baydin?

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.600
What do you do?

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.030
ALEX MOORE: So we built a suite
of productivity tools

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.970
that help the most heavy email
users manage a lot of

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.130
messages, schedule things from
inside their email, and just

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.820
basically keep on top
of their email.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.935
DON DODGE: So how did you come
up with this idea for Baydin

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:37.480
and why did you think it
was a problem that

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.610
needed to be solved?

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.580
ALEX MOORE: So it came
out of personal pain.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.810
Before this I was an electrical
engineer working on

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.370
HDTV parts.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.290
And as I matured in my career
little bit and started to ask

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.720
to run a couple projects, I
realized that I was spending a

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.720
lot more time in front of
my email than I was my

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.900
oscilloscope.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.490
And so I figured someone needed
to do something about

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.570
that and make it a little bit
easier to stay on top of it.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.970
DON DODGE: So what were the key
pain points that you said,

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.709
oh, this is the answer.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.000
I've got to solve it this way.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.110
ALEX MOORE: The biggest problem
for me was just trying

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.640
to keep everything in my head.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.370
So every time I'd need to get a
project from somebody or I'd

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.640
need to follow up with somebody,
I had to try to keep

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.050
all that in my brain.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.870
And so I kept a million messages
in my inbox, lost

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.810
track of all of them.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.736
And it just didn't
work very well.

00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:26.630
DON DODGE: Hmm.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.720
So you've talked about hockey
stick growth and how most

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.710
companies don't have hockey
stick growth.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.720
What has been your experience?

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.180
ALEX MOORE: Yeah, when I was
starting beta and I heard that

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.960
the companies either
had linear growth

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.750
or exponential growth.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.160
And what we found from our own
company, and most of the

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.540
companies that friends have
started, is that you end up

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.380
somewhere in the middle.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.360
You end up with growth that's
polynomial rather than one

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.440
user invites five, invites five
more, invites five more.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.540
So you end up with something
where it's not linear growth

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.910
but it's also not that hockey
stick growth that only social

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.300
gaming apps actually
really get.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.070
DON DODGE: And were there
any pivots in your

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.720
journey with Baydin?

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.530
ALEX MOORE: Definitely.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.070
We started out trying to do
a crazy automatic semantic

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.880
search, basically a
science project.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.590
So we pivoted ever to much
simpler stuff that was a lot

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.120
easier to explain and
a lot easier to

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.490
wrap your head around.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.860
DON DODGE: So how do
you know when to

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.570
pivot or when to persevere?

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.820
ALEX MOORE: It's a
good question.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.330
I think that's one of those
things where it's just more a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.230
matter of how your intuition
tells you to go than it is

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.470
something you can measure.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.480
For us, it was pretty clear
that we needed to pivot

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.990
because nobody could understand
what we were doing.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.300
We talked to people, we'd say,
oh, here's what we're doing,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.830
and they'd say, huh?

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.640
And no matter how we tried
message it, I think it was

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.730
just too out there, too
science projecty.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.500
DON DODGE: So let's talk
about messaging.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.340
The channels that you used to
get your message out, and how

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.220
do you choose which channel is
working or test messaging

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.800
across channels.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.860
ALEX MOORE: For figuring out
which ones to try, for us it's

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.040
been really counter intuitive,
things that we thought would

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.390
work really well haven't.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.250
Things that we didn't think had
a chance, but we had an

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.090
intern who tried some stuff
and it worked great.

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.050
So I think it's less
about selecting

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.480
good initial channels.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.620
I think there are examples of
just about every channel

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.420
working reasonably well as it
is knowing when you spent

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.150
enough effort on a channel and
knowing when to move on.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.030
DON DODGE: So how do you know if
it's the message that's not

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.680
working or if it's the channel
that's not working?

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.360
ALEX MOORE: Well when we try to
test the channel, we always

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.030
try different messaging
inside that channel.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.480
So we never try, for example,
if we're running an ad, we

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.000
never try one variant to the ad
and then throw up our hands

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.400
and say, oh, that didn't work.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.340
We try 20 or 30 or 50 or 100.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.840
For us what we typically do is
spend a month looking at a

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.140
channel in depth.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.280
So we set up an ad campaign, we
look at it the next day, we

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.350
add more ads, we look at it the
next day and adjust toward

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.170
the ones that are
working better.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.880
DON DODGE: So what are examples
of channels that

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.990
you're referring to here?

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.790
ALEX MOORE: Sure.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.490
So some channels that have
worked really well for us are

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.390
app stores like the Chrome Web
Store and the Google Play

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.050
Store recently.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.280
Emailing our own customers,
just sending them regular

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.710
emails and keeping
them in the loop.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:31.890
Content marketing.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.800
So for example, we put
together a couple of

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.160
infographics that they
did pretty well.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.940
And then lately we've been
working on SEO landing pages

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.100
to try to pick up people who
are looking for things like

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.560
what we do.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.560
DON DODGE: So say
more about SEO.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.580
That's been successful
for you?

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.160
ALEX MOORE: It has.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.690
Yeah, SEO is beautiful for us,
because it's been a channel

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.930
that started out kind of small
and has grown over time.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.675
So at this point those landing
pages account for about 20% of

00:05:01.675 --> 00:05:02.730
our traffic.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:08.480
But they started out, it was
just a handful of hits a day.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:10.490
DON DODGE: You mentioned the
Chrome Web Store as one of

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.480
your channels.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.280
Tell us about that.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.770
What was your experience
there?

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.400
ALEX MOORE: Yeah.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.440
So we were one of the earlier
companies, one of the early

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.600
products to get into the Chrome
Web Store back in, I

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.580
think, 2011.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.810
And we added our extension
to the web

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.870
store and got it featured.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.120
So it was one of the things that
came up when you went to

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.375
the Chrome Web Store.

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:35.860
And we found that delivered us
some really high quality

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.530
traffic, because the people
going to the Chrome Web Store

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.540
are looking to find a solution
to a problem they have.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.460
And they're looking to
install something to

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.720
help them with something.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.800
And so when they found us,
they tended to stick.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.110
And it's been really good going
forward, even after

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.500
being featured.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.450
We continue to get traffic from
there even to this day.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.060
DON DODGE: Are there tricks or
approaches to like the Chrome

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.560
Web Store in the copy or the
way that you present the

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.830
product that work?

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.860
ALEX MOORE: Yeah, things that
worked that helped us a lot,

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.560
adding testimonials to the
product helped a lot.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.630
And then even more important,
the Chrome Web Store is just,

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.420
it's a set of tiles.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.030
So when you go there, you just
see a whole screen full of

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.490
little tiny tiles.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.770
And so getting something on
there that explains what your

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.260
product does, some kind of
compelling three or four word

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.260
hook made a big difference
for us.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.450
If you just put your product
name and logo, no one knows

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.680
what that is.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.540
DON DODGE: Interesting.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.050
Well, this is all we have
time for today.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.070
Alex, I'd like to invite you
back again to go deeper on

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.980
this, because it's quite
fascinating.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.230
So in another show we'll
go deeper with Alex.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.930
We have a special offer for
viewers of Google "Root

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.950

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.760
to use Google Cloud.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.610
The information on how
to get that will

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.450
appear on your screen.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.430
So thank you very much, and
we'll see you next time.
