00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:10.070
SPEAKER: Please join me
in welcoming Mr. Shankar

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.580
Mahadevan.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.995
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.961 --> 00:00:17.342
Thank you.

00:00:17.342 --> 00:00:21.036
You did brave the Bay Area
traffic and did get in here.

00:00:21.036 --> 00:00:22.480
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN:
Yes, it's fine.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.300
Nothing to beat
the Mumbai traffic.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:28.045 --> 00:00:30.200
SPEAKER: But Shankar, let
me begin by welcoming you

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.155
in my mother tongue,
something which

00:00:32.155 --> 00:00:33.280
you will be very familiar--

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.069
[NON-ENGLISH]

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:36.193
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN:
[NON-ENGLISH] to all the people.

00:00:36.193 --> 00:00:39.051
[NON-ENGLISH], good afternoon.

00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:41.300
SPEAKER: I should have guessed
you can't speak in most

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.000
languages now from India.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.740
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN: Well,
[? I don't ?] [? speak. ?] I

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.690
actually sing.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.500
Singing is easier.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.320
SPEAKER: Easier-- actually,
that's a good beginning.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.560
You are a regular
to the Bay Area,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.490
but this time you are
here for a special cause.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.070
Tell us a little bit
more about AIM for Seva

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.360
and your purpose of this visit.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.870
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN:
Well, normally when

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.830
we come to the United
States, we come and perform

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.330
Bollywood music,
which is the most,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.870
I think, popular form
of music which is there.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.030
But this time,
it's really special

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.400
when I met the people who are
involved with AIM for Seva.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.110
And I met [? Shrini, ?]
[? Shrini ?] and his entire

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.340
team.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.630
And I went through
Swami [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.240
preachings, his speeches.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.520
And I think the kind of
work that they are doing

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.730
is phenomenal.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.150
I think [? Shrini ?]
will be explaining later

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.970
about what exactly, in detail.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.960
But the kind of work that
they're doing is with children.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.660
They take children right from a
very, very low economic strata

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.160
in life.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.868
And they take them
all the way, give them

00:01:53.868 --> 00:01:57.980
education, give them
a residence, I mean,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.780
make their future actually.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.990
So I wanted to bring this show
called "Krishna Sabrang," which

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.540
is music of our
country, India, through

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.170
our beloved lord Krishna.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.070
Because Krishna is omnipresent
all over the country.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.000
And when he's omnipresent,
there are so many cultures,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.470
so many languages, so many
genres of music in India.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.810
So if I can feature
all those in one

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.840
show and having a
common theme of Krishna.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.690
So somehow [INAUDIBLE]
and Krishna Sabrang,

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.650
it was almost like doing
musical [? seva. ?]

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.210
And coming to the US and singing
popular music, film music,

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.570
is a no-brainer, actually.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.910
I wanted the people
over here to also listen

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.530
to other forms of music, which
are there in our country, which

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.100
is like classical
music, [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.004
and all kinds of stuff.

00:02:54.004 --> 00:02:55.170
So we put the show together.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.150
And I'm very excited that
both my sons are there.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.870
They're singing with me,
Siddharth and Shivam.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.380
And we have the wonderful
[? Ankita ?] [? Juji, ?] who is

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.170
[INAUDIBLE] senior disciple.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.320
And it's a very
interesting show.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.640
And I hope that people enjoy it.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.860
They've been enjoying
our tour all as well.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.870
And I'm sure that they're
going to enjoy it here too.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.910
SPEAKER: In fact, three
lucky Googlers today

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.580
are submitting raffles.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.780
So hopefully they will have
a lucky entrance to the show

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.280
later.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.321
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN: But
what an honor coming here.

00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:29.967
I mean--

00:03:29.967 --> 00:03:31.050
SPEAKER: An honor is ours.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.591
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN:
Thank you, people.

00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:34.960
Thank you for
getting us over here.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:35.913
It's really--

00:03:35.913 --> 00:03:39.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.750
It's like visiting
a friend, Google.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.190
Because I think
sometimes one or two days

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.720
you don't meet your family.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.570
But there's not a single
day when you don't

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.808
visit with Google, is there?

00:03:49.808 --> 00:03:51.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.550
So it's like coming to
your best friend's house,

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.137
and to a place where
you come in, you

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:00.470
realize that this is the place
that's changed the world.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.920
So thank you, thank you
once again, thank you.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.350
SPEAKER: I'd love to get a
little bit more about, you--

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.840
and I spoke about
this during lunch--

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.770
about music being a passion
versus a profession.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.520
Your introduction to music
happened at a very young age.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.339
At the age of five, you
learned to play instruments.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:21.110
You've had a very strong
grounding in classical music

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.730
before you ventured out,
explored many other areas.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.640
Tell us a bit more about
why is music so important?

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.850
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN: Oh,
my god, I think just

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:39.240
to be able to appreciate
music, and enjoy music,

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.370
is, I think, one of the greatest
blessings that you can have.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.880
And above that, if you are in
a position to perform music,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.695
and if you're in a position
to entertain people

00:04:52.695 --> 00:04:53.570
through your medium--

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.290
I think the whole idea of
music is communication.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.060
It's a great form
of communication.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:06.394
And I think you can
make people laugh.

00:05:06.394 --> 00:05:07.310
You can make them cry.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.260
You can make them feel inspired.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.124
You can just make a person
who is probably the biggest

00:05:16.124 --> 00:05:18.040
director in a company
just get up on the seat,

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.599
and dance, and just forget
about himself, and let go.

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:22.890
And that is the power of music.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:26.480
And if you possess
that power, I think

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.860
God blesses you with that.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.650
Very few people get the
blessing that, hey, you

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.210
are born to entertain people.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.990
So you can communicate and
give joy, and enjoy something

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.840
that we take for granted.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.854
If you're able to
give joy to somebody,

00:05:40.854 --> 00:05:43.020
I think that is the greatest
blessing that you have.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.190
And I think we
musicians, every day

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.860
we thank God, that, thank
God I am a musician.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.230
And I'm able to give
happiness to people,

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.960
which is something which I
believe in very strongly.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.030
I was an engineer.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.650
I am an engineer, I can say.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.150
I did my engineering from--

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.410
a lot of my engineering
classmates are here this area.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.874
I mean, San Jose, Palo
Alto, maybe even in Fremont.

00:06:09.874 --> 00:06:11.540
In fact, tomorrow I'm
having a breakfast

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.460
meeting with all my
engineering buddies.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.650
And I did my engineering.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:20.390
Though it was fantastic,
and it prepared

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:25.820
me to do a lot of stuff in
life, music was my passion.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.220
It was deep within me.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.890
And constantly I
had this feeling

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:36.740
that I'm here in this
planet to communicate music

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.990
to the people.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.650
It used to always come to me
again and again and again.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.640
And of course, then, you're
moving at a great pace.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.030
You're with your friends.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.014
And you're doing your
schooling, engineering.

00:06:49.014 --> 00:06:51.180
You finish your course and
looking for a [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.210
interview, all that.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.150
All that is happening.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.400
But at some stage
you have to stop back

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.020
and kind of do a little bit
of internal thinking, and say,

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.430
hey, is this what
you want to do?

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.250
Or you want to--

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.320
there may be like millions
of other engineers

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.990
who are 10,000 times
better than you.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.640
Do you want to do something
that you really want to do?

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.290
And there were people around me.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.090
My wife, Sangeeta, is here.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.470
I was going around with her
at that time, in my college.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.360
And these are the people
who really stood by me

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.310
and said that--

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.080
And she did a very important
statement she made,

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.130
which really changed
things around.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:35.120
She said that there may
be a million engineers.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.797
But I feel that there will be
only one Shankar Mahadevan.

00:07:37.797 --> 00:07:38.380
She said that.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.662
And I don't know how much
of that is true, but--

00:07:42.662 --> 00:07:44.162
[LAUGHS]

00:07:44.162 --> 00:07:45.620
SPEAKER: You're
definitely somebody

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.630
whose voice is recognized not
only in the hearts of people,

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.640
but you're not only
popularized in India,

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.820
but you exist in our hearts.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:54.570
So the statement--

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:58.442
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN: Thank
you, God is more than kind.

00:07:58.442 --> 00:07:59.900
SPEAKER: A question
actually coming

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.090
in from a Googler
and a YouTuber.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.330
We are all about--

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.560
we are in a generation
where things go viral.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.856
We're all about trying to make
things as popular as we are.

00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:11.480
Facebook is about trying to get
as many thousand likes, million

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.430
likes.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.890
Your music, "Breathless," is
one of the most viral videos

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.600
on YouTube.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.060
Tell us a little bit
about music going viral.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.270
Is there a science to
making music going viral?

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.669
How do you?

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:27.710
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN: If that
would have been there,

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:28.962
there was a formula.

00:08:28.962 --> 00:08:30.670
We always think, we
should have a formula

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.360
when we are creating the song.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.470
While creating there should be
a red light or a green light.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.799
So when you're creating, ding!

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.190
The green light goes, oh, this
song is going to be a hit.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.762
If that would have
been possible,

00:08:41.762 --> 00:08:43.220
we would have been
rich and famous.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.320
You know what I mean?

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.810
There's no formula to that.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:53.090
You have to-- see,
that is the risk

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.610
that you take when you
create path-breaking stuff.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.880
I mean, I'm just saying path
breaking because path breaking,

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.650
meaning something
that doesn't exist.

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.110
You always want to
go beyond barriers.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:07.400
You want to go beyond what you
have done, a benchmark that you

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.060
have created for yourself.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.730
So when you're
trying to do that,

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.820
that is as risky as anything.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.490
Either it can be
super successful,

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.170
or you can just fall
flat on your face.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.990
So there is no formula
to doing a viral video.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:26.660
Because if you try to use
a formula, which means

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.090
a formula is something
that already exists.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.130
And you will always
be number two.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.510
You'll be always compared to--

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:35.210
if I made another "Breathless,"
they will always compare that

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:38.200
to-- oh, at least 50% of the
people over here will say,

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.710
[INAUDIBLE],, this
is not like that.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.700
Well, the first one,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.720
This is all very
good, but that one?

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.350
So you'll never, you'll
never reach that thing.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.260
So I think the
only way you can do

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:57.680
it is try to create
something that doesn't exist.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.090
I'm talking musically.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:00.320
I don't know anything else.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.200
So musically, try
to create stuff

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.550
that doesn't exist, try to
break your own benchmark,

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:12.450
try to create new
forms, new sounds, new,

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:15.410
something that even people may
not digest at the beginning.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:20.680
When "Breathless" came out
so many videos were playing.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.640
The indie pop thing was in.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:26.910
The only thing I wanted was,
within the first five seconds,

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.630
your reaction should be,
what is this guy doing?

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.340
That's all.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:34.050
If you got that emotion,
that's more than enough.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.090
Then you, at least
you can capture

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.770
the curiosity of people.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:44.220
And I think you have to do it
passionately and do it full on.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:48.090
And maybe then, your song,
your video, your piece of music

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.182
may get viral.

00:10:49.182 --> 00:10:50.390
But there's no formula to it.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.040
I don't think so.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.850
You all know better.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:52.808
What are you asking me?

00:10:52.808 --> 00:10:53.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.019
SPEAKER: We thought we might
learn something from you.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.430
Actually asking
you a question, you

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:03.990
have been a part of one of the
most successful musical trios

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:08.190
that India has seen
with Ehsaan and Loy.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:09.850
Tell us a little
bit more about that,

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.150
because it's an industry
where styles of music

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.770
can be so variable.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.510
Egos are fragile.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:17.070
How did you form
that partnership?

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.832
And what made it so successful?

00:11:19.832 --> 00:11:21.290
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN:
This is actually

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:22.581
a very interesting partnership.

00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:25.190
And we, ourselves, are
very amazed at the way

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.670
we have sustained, because
we have completed 21

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:30.040
years of composing this year.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:30.623
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:11:30.623 --> 00:11:32.762
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.470
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN: We
started off 21 years back.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:43.960
And we three are completely
different individuals,

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.650
characteristics-wise and
musical preferences-wise,

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:51.950
temperament-wise,
choices, whatever.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.330
The way we are, we are
three different individuals.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.230
We have nothing in common.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.230
But that is the beauty.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:02.990
When you look at
a piece of music,

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:06.070
it's like a melody is created.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.780
And you're looking
at that melody

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.920
from three different angles,
using three different cameras.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.960
So what I see, he doesn't see.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:15.580
And what he sees,
he doesn't see.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:20.120
So it's three angles to
the same piece of music.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.020
And we interpret it our own way.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:28.330
And we don't use the
conventional, tried and tested

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.150
kind of stuff.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:32.750
I'll give us one example.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:36.552
I'd like to bring
Soumil, my nephew to--

00:12:36.552 --> 00:12:38.240
It's OK if I sing
a few lines, huh?

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.315
SPEAKER: Oh yeah, I think so.

00:12:40.315 --> 00:12:42.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.630
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN: I
think, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.240
Can we have a
little more of my--

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.230
where is this, it's all over.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.140
Is it the speakers?

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.531
Can you turn me up slightly
for the singing part?

00:12:58.531 --> 00:13:01.030
SPEAKER: If you step forward
you might hear yourself better.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.510
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN: Oh, is it?

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:02.301
OK, then it's fine.

00:13:02.301 --> 00:13:03.300
OK, I trust you.

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.440
SPEAKER: Sorry.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:10.330
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN: So
like we did this song

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.550
for one of our first films.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.938
Not the first film,
called "Dil Chahta Hai."

00:13:14.938 --> 00:13:16.396
Have you all seen
"Dil Chahta Hai"?

00:13:16.396 --> 00:13:19.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:23.630
So the creation of the music for
this film was very interesting.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:27.590
We planned out of 10 days
[INAUDIBLE] to Kandla,

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:30.260
where Ritesh Sidhwani,
the director, he

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:31.250
had a bungalow there.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.580
And we wanted to stay 10 days
and create music over there.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:42.140
So Ehsaan, Loy, me, [INAUDIBLE]
all of us, we drove to Kandla.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:47.730
And we finished the
compositions, with the lyrics,

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.610
in three and a half days.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.470
The entire score was over.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.880
And we didn't know what to
do, and are in Kandla for--

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.324
we have another six days.

00:13:56.324 --> 00:13:58.490
We chilled out for a day
and we just came back home.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:59.695
So the music of "Dil
Chahta Hai" was created in

00:13:59.695 --> 00:14:00.861
like over three and a half--

00:14:00.861 --> 00:14:03.150
I mean, of course the
composition, not the recording.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:07.320
So the first thing
that came about

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.919
was a bass line, which goes--

00:14:11.919 --> 00:14:13.851
[PIANO PLAYING]

00:14:13.851 --> 00:14:16.266
[SNAPPING]

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.380
So this was the
bass line that came.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:23.806
And this was not supposed to
be the situation for the "Dil

00:14:23.806 --> 00:14:25.624
Chahta Hai" title song at all.

00:14:25.624 --> 00:14:27.040
It was just a bass
line that came.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.800
And we wanted to use this song
for the Johnny Q [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.600
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.350
This song.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.180
But then I was having a shower.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:45.500
And suddenly this bass
line just, just play again.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.925
[PIANO PLAYING]

00:14:47.925 --> 00:14:49.800
So these four
notes, it just fits

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.560
into the title of the film.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.020
So I just literally came
out running and said--

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.140
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:09.930
So what triggers what?

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.170
It's a crazy in music.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:14.530
So this bass line said, oh,
my god, these four syllables

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:17.020
come in as the title
song of "Dil Chahta Hai."

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.110
So I just came in and said,
can we fit in "Dil Chahta Hai"?

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:21.670
And [INAUDIBLE] readily agreed.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:24.790
And then of course he wrote
the song around the thing.

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.990
And we have many such instances.

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:33.460
So this trial is very exciting
because we respect each other

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.300
as individuals,
even after 21 years.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:42.070
No egos, I think the ego is the
worst thing for a team to have.

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.100
I think, you all know better.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:50.312
For a team to exist, coexist
for a long period of time, ego

00:15:50.312 --> 00:15:52.270
is something that you
just leave in your house.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:53.997
Because at the end
of the day, you're

00:15:53.997 --> 00:15:55.330
playing with an abstract medium.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.150
My melody, your melody,
his melody, everything

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.550
is valid because
we're all musicians.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.795
And what I say is also right.

00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:02.920
What you say is also right.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.810
What she says is also right.

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:10.810
But I think eventually you
have to come to a consensus

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.840
based on what the
melody is telling you.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.792
It gives out a feeling.

00:16:16.792 --> 00:16:18.250
It gives out a
feeling in that room

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.080
that, yes, this is the melody.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.140
And we will go with it.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:22.960
And when you respect
that, I think

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.210
then everything falls in place.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:29.260
And your music, I think it
will work for your music

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:30.512
more than anything else.

00:16:30.512 --> 00:16:32.470
SPEAKER: Are there any
more interesting stories

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.550
with [? yourselves ?]
and more music for us?

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:35.675
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN: Oh yeah.

00:16:35.675 --> 00:16:37.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.640
So many, I mean.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:44.030
We were in [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:48.610
We'd set up our instruments
in this Taj [? Hotel ?] called

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:49.270
[INAUDIBLE].

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:53.260
And we were working on
the music for a film.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:57.210
Loy, and the director
of film, and we were all

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.480
sitting and having breakfast
in one German bakery,

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.990
early morning, 7 o'clock.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.240
People ask, where do you
get these melodies from?

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.180
How does it happen?

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.990
How do you get this, how
do you get these tunes?

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:12.660
Trust me, that's
what I'm saying.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.150
I mean, really, if
you say that you

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.550
are in control of
your music, I think

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:21.270
that is the biggest false
statement that you're making.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:24.030
Because you really don't know
where this music comes from.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:25.290
That is what they say.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.420
It is really divinity.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:31.540
So then suddenly this tune
started ringing in Loy's mind.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.770
And we all ran to the
sitting room where

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:37.320
we had set up our instruments.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.940
And play now.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:43.440
[PIANO PLAYING]

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.420
That's Soumil Shringarpure.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.382
Let's hear it for him.

00:17:52.382 --> 00:17:55.050
[APPLAUSE]

[PIANO MUSIC CONTINUES]

00:18:01.031 --> 00:18:03.415
How many of you know this song?

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:05.857
So let's all sing
together, come on.

00:18:05.857 --> 00:18:09.350
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:19:09.702 --> 00:19:11.686
Everybody.

00:19:11.686 --> 00:19:14.662
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:17.470
Outstanding.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.828
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.985
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.980
I must say,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:55.290
I'm not joking,
really, outstanding.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.140
SPEAKER: We've seen a
few talks at Google.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.320
But we've never seen where
you could create a chorus out

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.565
of a bunch of engineers.

00:20:01.565 --> 00:20:02.940
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN:
You know what?

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:04.695
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:06.680
I've realized one thing.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:11.570
Probably if you make people
over here individually sing,

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:13.620
they probably may go
out of [? suit. ?]

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:17.609
They may wander into
their own scale.

00:20:17.609 --> 00:20:18.650
But I realized one thing.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:22.160
When people sing in
a group, it somehow,

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.900
it just becomes into
one [INAUDIBLE]..

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.086
I don't know how that is.

00:20:25.086 --> 00:20:26.210
That is the magic of music.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:27.626
SPEAKER: You know
Shankar, there's

00:20:27.626 --> 00:20:28.970
something called humility too.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.900
And I know you are
downplaying this.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.470
But the fact that music
just occurs to you,

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.260
that when you sing, that people
just seem to fall in place,

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.100
there's something about you--

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:39.433
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN: Well, I
was pointing the mic at them.

00:20:39.433 --> 00:20:41.690
So they were singing actually.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.660
SPEAKER: But that talks so much
about you as a person, too.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.840
I mean, we see you all the
time, [? to ?] the point

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.110
that we were saying.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:52.410
We see personalities,
which are larger than life.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:56.290
In movies, we see them
on screen all the time.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.450
A little known fact about you
is, you've been an actor, too.

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:01.130
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN:
Oh one film, yeah.

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:08.930
SPEAKER: You host a music show
today, which actually leads me

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:12.320
to the next question,
you explained so well

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.930
that you followed your heart.

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:16.494
And you had your wife with
you to explain to you, saying

00:21:16.494 --> 00:21:18.160
that there could be
a million engineers,

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.540
but there could be
one Shankar Mahadevan.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:23.750
But tell us a little
bit about music

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.040
as a passion and a profession.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.456
There are so many
people today who

00:21:26.456 --> 00:21:29.500
are aspiring musicians,
who come out there,

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.190
and who perhaps look
at this as to how

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.580
do I make it into a profession.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:34.121
What is your word
of advice for them?

00:21:37.382 --> 00:21:38.840
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN:
Firstly, I think

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.180
there are two ways of doing it.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:45.230
I would say that what is
it that you want to do?

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:46.810
What is your ultimate aim?

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:52.280
Do you want to just
become a popular singer,

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:57.560
and become a YouTube sensation,
or something like that?

00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:00.530
Or do you want to study music?

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:06.130
And as a result of which,
your music can become popular.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:07.660
So what is it that
you wanted to do?

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.610
Both are valid, actually.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:15.730
Because the path that I
took was a difficult path.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:19.870
Because I studied
Indian classical music.

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:24.380
My foundation, the grammar
of, the language of my music

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:28.280
is classical music,
Carnatic classical music

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.900
is what I studied.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:34.310
And I used that as a medium, and
all other forms of music that I

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.020
do, whether I'm
doing film music,

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.960
whether I'm doing fusion music,
whether I'm doing popular

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.310
music, [INAUDIBLE] music, or
[INAUDIBLE] music in south

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:44.180
India--

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:47.960
they're all derivatives
of classical music,

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.300
is what I believe.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.850
But the other way
is, I mean, you

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:57.270
can become a one hit wonder, or
maybe a two, three hit wonder.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:01.790
And you still can make
the same amount of money.

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:05.495
You can still have the same
amount of hits on YouTube,

00:23:05.495 --> 00:23:11.330
or social media, still
be flying first class,

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:14.450
and traveling, and doing
your shows and all.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:18.860
But it's totally up to you.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.414
So if you want to approach
the popular route,

00:23:22.414 --> 00:23:23.330
you still can do that.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:29.370
But one thing is, you'll always
be unsure of what you're doing.

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:35.430
You'll not be technically
proficient as to what

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:38.470
your song is all about, what
is the skill that you use.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:41.520
Is it a C major, E minor,
D-- ah, I don't know.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.730
[? You'll see. ?]
What beat it is,

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:47.100
what are the chords
that are playing behind?

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.770
Do you want to know that, or
you don't want to know that?

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:52.380
I mean, end goal
can be the same.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:55.620
But how you want to approach
it, what kind of a musician,

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:59.150
in depth, do you want
depth in your music or no?

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:01.220
Is what you have to decide.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.540
And I think, personally,
being a musician--

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.290
I mean, for example, if you
want to become a journalist,

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:10.140
if your language
is really good, you

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.360
can write a beautiful article.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.950
And I believe in that.

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:17.520
So if your grammar of
the language of music

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:22.040
is very strong, you
are very confident.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.850
And you know what you are doing.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:25.850
You know your direction.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:27.410
You know 100%.

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:29.690
Yes, I have gone a little flat.

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:31.240
I've gone a little sharp.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.640
[INAUDIBLE] Everybody feels it
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],, you know?

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.840
But you don't realize.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.860
When you learn you
understand, oh, I'm going off.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:39.960
This chord is not working.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.390
This chord is working.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:42.950
This rhythm cycle I can do.

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:44.060
It's interesting.

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.520
So you become a
student of music.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.620
And you remain a
student of music

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.760
for the rest of your
life, which I feel I am.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.940
I am a student of music,
which I am going to remain

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:54.940
till the end of my life.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.990
I'm learning all the time.

00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:00.140
I think, [NON-ENGLISH]
That is, that is a fun.

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:03.010
It's like learning any art form.

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:08.250
And our classical music, Indian
classical music, is so great.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:13.100
It's the greatest form of
music in the world, I feel.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:19.930
If you learn that, you get
certain musical powers--

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:25.570
musical powers, which you can
use to fly in any form of music

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:26.510
that you want to do.

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:31.210
So I feel that it's better
you learn music properly,

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:34.130
understand music, do a
deep dive [? yeah. ?]

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:36.650
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] do
a deep dive, no, why not?

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:39.760
Learn properly and
enjoy the whole process,

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:43.310
and be a student for the rest
of your life, is my advice.

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:46.690
SPEAKER: So Shankar, you
sing in so many styles.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:50.500
You have learned music from
various parts of India.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:55.240
What is the kind of music
that you love to listen to?

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.990
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN:
If you see my phone,

00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:00.310
or if you see the kind of
music that I listen to,

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:01.780
it's very varied.

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:08.230
I tend to learn from
every form of music,

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:13.840
whether it is Carnatic classical
music, whether it is Hindustani

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.320
classical music, or
whether it is Pink Floyd,

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.010
or whether it is Ed
Sheeran, whatever.

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:23.290
I listen to every
single form of music.

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:28.130
And I think the best thing is
to take the positive aspect

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:30.840
of every form of music.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:35.880
And if you're a composer, you
can use it to your advantage.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.330
For example, "Breathless"
that you've listen to,

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:43.880
it's a classical [? raga. ?]
It's a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:46.632
It's a form of
improvisation that you do.

00:26:46.632 --> 00:26:47.340
Can you give me--

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.602
[PIANO PLAYING]

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.111
So if you take the
[INAUDIBLE],, for example,

00:26:58.111 --> 00:27:02.286
in the South Indian
style, Carnatic classical,

00:27:02.286 --> 00:27:03.660
and there's
Hindustani classical,

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:07.550
there are two forms of music,
Carnatic and Hindustani The

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:08.620
notes are the same.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:13.242
It's the way you deliver it is
the style in which you sing it.

00:27:13.242 --> 00:27:15.200
So if you're singing
Carnatic classical it is--

00:27:18.074 --> 00:27:20.948
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:27:26.042 --> 00:27:27.750
There are seven notes
in this [? raga. ?]

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:29.290
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:27:34.769 --> 00:27:36.560
So if you're singing
in the Carnatic style,

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.934
this is the way
that you sing it.

00:27:37.934 --> 00:27:40.970
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:00.457
The same thing if you
do it in Hindustani.

00:28:00.457 --> 00:28:02.790
The way you sing it, there's
a little more [INAUDIBLE],,

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:07.270
as in, a little more
[INAUDIBLE],, a little more,

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:11.134
what can I say, you dwell
on the notes a little more.

00:28:11.134 --> 00:28:12.050
That's how Hindustani.

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:15.026
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:33.300
OK, so you see the
style difference.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.058
And then there are--

00:28:35.058 --> 00:28:35.558
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:35.558 --> 00:28:37.240
Oh no, that's OK.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.690
There are these notes--

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.500
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:48.320
So you can play
with these notes,

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.620
where you can-- if you're
a classical musician,

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:55.970
you can improvise, and you
can create various imageries

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:58.520
using these notes.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.120
If you want to depict moving
forward, you can say--

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.260
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:04.810
You want to go a little forward.

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:06.590
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:07.270
Come back.

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:09.116
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:29:09.116 --> 00:29:10.250
If you want to jump--

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:11.910
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:12.410
Jump back.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:14.660
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:29:15.522 --> 00:29:16.355
Jump back and forth.

00:29:16.355 --> 00:29:17.830
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:29:19.994 --> 00:29:23.270
So you can literally
visualize music.

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:26.500
If somebody tells you, OK,
here is this playground,

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:30.440
and go to the middle of the
playground and just go crazy.

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:34.460
Just run around with music,
with these notes of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:36.690
So this is how it'll be.

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:39.690
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:30:05.712 --> 00:30:08.435
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:11.157 --> 00:30:14.970
So while going through
a process like this,

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:16.900
I just give a meter
to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.750
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:30:22.596 --> 00:30:24.470
I just sort of
[? rewrite ?] on this.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:25.760
And then he wrote--

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.796
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.378
And then it went on and on.

00:30:36.378 --> 00:30:37.666
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:37.666 --> 00:30:39.055
SPEAKER: We can go on.

00:30:39.055 --> 00:30:41.370
[LAUGHS]

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:45.700
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN:
[NON-ENGLISH SINGING]

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:43.304
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:43.304 --> 00:32:45.042
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:32:45.042 --> 00:32:46.250
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN: Thank you.

00:32:49.687 --> 00:32:51.290
See in Hindi, there is a saying.

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:53.331
I don't know whether you
know this kind of thing.

00:32:53.331 --> 00:32:55.940
It's called
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]..

00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:01.260
This is a song, which is
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] many years

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:01.830
back.

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:05.000
So nobody feels satisfied
until I sing this song.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:05.583
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:07.475
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN: So
that's why I sang it.

00:33:07.475 --> 00:33:10.037
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:10.037 --> 00:33:12.120
SPEAKER: Before I stand
between you and the music,

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.180
I have a couple of more
questions regarding

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.490
causes that you care
for, your proud for.

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:19.330
The last time you
visited Google,

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:21.780
you spoke about the
Shankar Mahadevan Academy.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.990
Love to hear about where
is it, what are your aims,

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:26.760
what are your dreams for it?

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:30.900
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN: See, I feel
very insignificant while I

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:35.580
address an audience that is
working in Google, oh my god.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.478
Because--

00:33:37.478 --> 00:33:39.186
SPEAKER: It's like us
singing before you.

00:33:39.186 --> 00:33:40.266
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:40.266 --> 00:33:41.790
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN: Is that it?

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:42.720
Yeah.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:48.480
But the whole idea
was to give back what

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.900
I have learned over the years.

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:53.410
And ideally, as I was
telling you earlier,

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:58.560
imparting people with the
power of music is great.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:02.040
Not everybody need not
become the greatest singers

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.030
in this planet.

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:06.060
But I think just being
able to learn music,

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:11.820
just being able to enjoy music,
is a great, great feeling.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:15.540
Initially I thought that just
like how other great maestros

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.400
have done, you don't
take a piece of land

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.400
and construct an
academy which can

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.449
teach Indian classical music.

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:26.460
But then that little
bit of engineering thing

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.280
that was there in me,
me and my partner, who

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:34.769
used to stay right here in Palo
Alto, [INAUDIBLE],, both of us,

00:34:34.769 --> 00:34:36.330
we put this Academy together.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:38.670
It's called the
shankarmahadevanacademy.com.

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:40.290
It's an online academy.

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:42.030
We started off with
about 15 students

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:46.530
because I did not see any other
academy of this nature, what

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.909
we had in mind.

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:51.060
So there was no reference point.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.790
So we all did it, trial
and error, trial and error.

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:59.370
We formed the curriculum,
created online music books

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:00.480
called OM books.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.830
We call them OM books.

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:03.510
So you can study
from those OM books,

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:05.490
plus there are online classes.

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:08.150
Everything that an
academy gives you,

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:10.830
a physical, brick and
mortar academy gives you,

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:14.030
we give it online,
except for the building.

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:19.890
And after six years, we are
teaching in 72 countries

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:21.933
right now, teaching
Indian classical music.

00:35:21.933 --> 00:35:24.274
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:25.335 --> 00:35:29.670
I hope that Google here
also tries to help us out,

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:31.440
till it becomes
bigger and bigger.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:32.610
So--

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:34.095
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:35:34.095 --> 00:35:35.720
AUDIENCE: It's number
one [INAUDIBLE]..

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:36.450
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN:
Yeah, I think you

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:38.720
go, Google search,
you go and search,

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.290
learn music online, Shankar
Mahadevan Academy, number one.

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:45.200
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.419
SPEAKER: You figured
out SEO all by yourself.

00:35:47.419 --> 00:35:48.960
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN:
No, it's actually,

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:52.230
it's my partner, [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:55.230
He's also a technical kind
of wizard, kind of a guy.

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:59.160
And see, we as artists,
we dream a lot.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.792
We want to do this.

00:36:00.792 --> 00:36:01.750
We want to create this.

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:04.950
You want to-- but if there
are people with you who

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:07.620
take it to the next level,
and implement it, and make it

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:10.810
happen, that's when it
becomes a success story.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:13.590
So [INAUDIBLE] is the
one who has really

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:15.000
made it a success story for me.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.560
And it's so lovely that
when I go and meet--

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:24.660
every city I go, every
country I go, students--

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:27.412
for tomorrow's concert, I
think a whole lot of my academy

00:36:27.412 --> 00:36:29.870
students are also going to
come, along with the [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:30.420
children.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.580
And they're going to
sing [INAUDIBLE] with me.

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:34.500
So it's such a lovely feeling.

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.732
It's great.

00:36:35.732 --> 00:36:37.940
SPEAKER: Actually it's
perfect time to actually bring

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:39.450
AIM for Seva back in here.

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:41.340
We would love to hear
more about the program.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:42.910
Can I have the--

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:44.580
SRINI RAMAN: My
name is Srini Raman.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.630
I'm the Chief Operating
Officer AIM for Seva.

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:49.830
But basically I'm also
a mechanical engineer--

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:52.442
from Detroit, helping in
the automotive industry,

00:36:52.442 --> 00:36:54.900
but the automotive industry
now shifting to the West Coast.

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:57.520
And Google is going
to play a major role.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:00.500
But I had a calling
two years ago

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:05.160
when [INAUDIBLE],, a
founder of AIM for Seva

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.480
gently touched my shoulder
and said, I need you.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.830
To do want?

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:14.070
To lead AIM for Seva USA.

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:17.080
And my answer was
very spontaneous.

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:20.460
And I said, there are
a million engineers,

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:22.860
but there can be
somebody who can

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.870
play the role of
a small squirrel,

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:28.500
like how that helped
[? Sriama ?] build the bridge,

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:33.050
and the bridge of connecting
the people who don't have

00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:35.070
and the people who have.

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:38.640
So I told myself [? if ?]
I can play that role,

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.490
and this is what
I feel satisfied

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:44.130
at the end of the day,
just like how Shankar said.

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:47.250
And he had the calling
to dedicate himself

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:52.050
for the music, I'm standing
in front of you dedicating my,

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:54.060
whatever little
skill that I have,

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.310
in bringing these
people together.

00:37:56.310 --> 00:38:00.000
Because AIM for Seva is
a people's [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.070
It is like [INAUDIBLE]
freedom movement, [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:07.860
had a vision of Seva
movement, what does it mean?

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.780
Each one of us, in
whatever way we can,

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:13.980
should care for the
people who don't have.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:16.790
So having said
that, AIM for Seva

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:21.030
started when a [? tribal ?]
woman named [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:23.990
met Swamiji in 2000.

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:27.580
And she said her children
dropped out of the school.

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:31.440
Reason being, far away,
the home is far away

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:36.010
from school, and dysfunctional
home, and poverty.

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.330
So she gave an idea.

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:40.035
[? willing ?] to
start [INAUDIBLE],,

00:38:40.035 --> 00:38:43.680
the hostel where
her children can

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:48.850
stay very close to an
existing government school.

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:52.320
And they stay until
they finish high school.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.810
Swamji thought this is a
very pragmatic solution

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:59.260
for a very practical
problem that this woman has.

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.860
And that's how AIM for Seva
was founded in the year 2000.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:08.200
And thanks to [INAUDIBLE],,
we have now over 100 hostels

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.595
across 16 states of India.

00:39:11.595 --> 00:39:12.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:16.860
It's a small
beginning, we call it.

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:19.149
There are 600
districts in India.

00:39:19.149 --> 00:39:20.190
So we need to build that.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:25.680
There are 14,000 children that
have graduated high school.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.510
And our success rate is 90%.

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:30.330
So the children stay with us.

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:33.900
And they stay for about
seven to 10 years.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:36.820
And we take care of them
like our own children.

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:38.010
We give a house.

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:38.940
They give food.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:40.760
They get school supplies.

00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.540
We teach some values.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.810
And we make sure that they
graduate from high school.

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:47.870
And if they are
doing well in school,

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:49.530
we take them to college.

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:51.130
And guess what?

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:55.530
Two students from a tiny
village in [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:59.430
finished college, and they
have a job offer at [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:01.170
Consultancy Services India.

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:02.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:06.640
This is all happening
in the 15 years.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.440
We believe that every
child deserves education.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:15.220
And let's hear from one of
the children, her life story.

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:18.160
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:27.960

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.970
SPEAKER: Shankar, If I may
have you back on stage.

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:14.580
I would like to conclude
my part and get out

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:18.870
of the way between
Shankar and the magic.

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:22.580
We always say that it's
magical to witness genius

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:25.200
when it's combined with
passion and humility.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.440
I think we got to see that
over the last one hour.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.870
SHANKAR MAHADEVAN: OK, I can
just ask them a few requests.

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:31.703
Then I can sing for a
few lines of the songs

00:44:31.703 --> 00:44:33.380
that they want to hear, simple.
