kinda seemed like a missed opportunity

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:33.150
kinda seemed like a missed opportunity
 

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:35.180
kinda seemed like a missed opportunity
to be but maybe I'm missing some a there

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:35.190
to be but maybe I'm missing some a there
 

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.350

this this is a perfectly serviceable

00:20:43.399 --> 00:20:43.409
this this is a perfectly serviceable
 

00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:48.200
this this is a perfectly serviceable
movie I objectively it's like the best

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:48.210
movie I objectively it's like the best
 

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:49.730
movie I objectively it's like the best
one because there is like the most depth

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:49.740
one because there is like the most depth
 

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.470
one because there is like the most depth
and character to it but but it's all

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480
and character to it but but it's all
 

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.850
and character to it but but it's all
depth and character I've seen before I

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:52.860
depth and character I've seen before I
 

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.320
depth and character I've seen before I
personally like the first one a little

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:54.330
personally like the first one a little
 

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:56.180
personally like the first one a little
more because there was actual kind of

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:56.190
more because there was actual kind of
 

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.610
more because there was actual kind of
new stuff I haven't seen with the action

00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:58.620
new stuff I haven't seen with the action
 

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:02.120
new stuff I haven't seen with the action
and with some of the comedy and it's one

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:02.130
and with some of the comedy and it's one
 

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:03.860
and with some of the comedy and it's one
of those things where I just sort of I

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:03.870
of those things where I just sort of I
 

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:05.510
of those things where I just sort of I

too much emotion or cry or anything like
 

00:21:23.309 --> 00:21:24.590
too much emotion or cry or anything like
that because again I kind of know the

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600
that because again I kind of know the
 

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.810
that because again I kind of know the
formula where with the other one I know

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:26.820
formula where with the other one I know
 

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.760
formula where with the other one I know
the formula but at least it's good

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:28.770
the formula but at least it's good
 

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.440
the formula but at least it's good
action and it's funny and it gets my

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:30.450
action and it's funny and it gets my
 

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.529
action and it's funny and it gets my
adrenaline up so um it's so for me

00:21:33.529 --> 00:21:33.539
adrenaline up so um it's so for me
 

00:21:33.539 --> 00:21:35.210
adrenaline up so um it's so for me

personally I still like the first one
 

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.640
personally I still like the first one
the most and then this one second and

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:37.650
the most and then this one second and
 

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.549
the most and then this one second and
the rest are just a rehash of the first

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559
the rest are just a rehash of the first
 

00:21:40.559 --> 00:21:42.470
the rest are just a rehash of the first

slow climb I don't know and it's it's
not surprising to see why like I said I

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:01.500
not surprising to see why like I said I
 

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.870
not surprising to see why like I said I

good where and I I figured out why in
 

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:45.120
good where and I I figured out why in
the other movies even though I like the
