00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.119
- Since last September
Patricia has been working

00:00:04.119 --> 00:00:07.259
at the convenience store down the road.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.203
So we have to think about
what they've underlined

00:00:09.203 --> 00:00:10.880
right over here, this has been working.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.806
Do we want to go with that?

00:00:11.806 --> 00:00:13.739
And the first choice is always exactly

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:14.818
as they wrote it right over here.

00:00:14.818 --> 00:00:15.843
So they wrote, has been working.

00:00:15.843 --> 00:00:17.617
They wrote has been working over there.

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:19.720
So do we want to go
with it as it's written,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.360
which is always going
to be the first choice,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.139
or do we think one of these other choices

00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:25.639
is going to make more sense?

00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:28.059
So since last September
Patricia has been working

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:30.600
at the convenience store down the road.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.027
Well, has been working
actually looks pretty good,

00:00:33.027 --> 00:00:35.339
looks pretty good, because
we're not talking about

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:37.419
something that just
happened in the past tense.

00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:40.463
So if this is last, so this
is a timeline right over here,

00:00:40.463 --> 00:00:41.903
and if this is last September,

00:00:41.903 --> 00:00:43.602
she starts working last September,

00:00:43.602 --> 00:00:47.739
but then she keeps
working since, since then.

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.499
So we want something that is both,

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:53.219
that starts in the past
but then keeps going

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.039
on through the future.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.199
And so, that's what has
been working does for us.

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.359
Now let's think about the other choices

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.578
and see why they don't quite do that.

00:01:01.578 --> 00:01:05.343
So if we used works, works
is the present tense.

00:01:05.343 --> 00:01:08.351
That would mean that she's
only doing it right now.

00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:09.779
It doesn't mean that she's been doing it

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:11.243
starting at some period in the past

00:01:11.243 --> 00:01:14.359
and continuing to do it all
the way through right now.

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:15.588
So if we said since last September

00:01:15.588 --> 00:01:17.843
Patrica works at the
convenience store down the road,

00:01:17.843 --> 00:01:20.539
then we essentially have
the verb tense wrong,

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.198
because this is starting
in the past and continuing,

00:01:23.198 --> 00:01:25.642
while this is just the present.

00:01:26.612 --> 00:01:29.143
Since last September Patricia is working

00:01:29.143 --> 00:01:30.764
at the convenience store down the road.

00:01:30.764 --> 00:01:34.344
So once again, this one is
talking about the present,

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:37.084
while we want something
that starts in the past

00:01:37.084 --> 00:01:39.690
and then continues through the present.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.704
So this one is only the present.

00:01:41.704 --> 00:01:44.611
Since last September
Patricia will be working.

00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:46.713
Well this is now occurring in the future,

00:01:46.713 --> 00:01:48.424
and that's not what since last September

00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:50.229
is trying to talk about.

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.964
Since last September, we
want to go to the past

00:01:51.964 --> 00:01:53.144
into the present.

00:01:53.144 --> 00:01:56.864
So we will throw out that.

00:01:56.864 --> 00:01:59.162
Will be working kind of implies that,

00:01:59.162 --> 00:02:02.165
well, we're really
talking about the future.

00:02:02.165 --> 00:02:04.540
And since last September Patricia worked.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.964
So this is strictly the past.

00:02:06.964 --> 00:02:09.024
It's not really talking about the past

00:02:09.024 --> 00:02:11.004
and continuing through the present.

00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:13.524
So since last September Patricia worked.

00:02:13.524 --> 00:02:14.780
That's kind of like, hey, she had worked,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.904
and maybe she's not working anymore,

00:02:16.904 --> 00:02:18.824
but we want to convey that
she started working then,

00:02:18.824 --> 00:02:20.084
and she's continuing to work.

00:02:20.084 --> 00:02:24.064
So has been working seems
to make the most sense.
