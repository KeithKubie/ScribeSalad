00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.880
In the last video, we used a
set of parametric equations to

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.240
describe the position of a car
as it fell off of a cliff, and

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.660
the equations were x as a
function of t was-- and I will

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.480
write that-- x as a function of
t was equal to 10, I believe.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.180
I did this a couple of
hours ago, so I think

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.670
that's what I said.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.570
10 plus 5t.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:30.360
And y as a function of t was
equal to 50 minus 5t squared.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.790
And the graph looks
something like this.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.950
Let me redraw it.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.200
It never hurts.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.180
That was the y-axis.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.470
That's the x-axis.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.480
And we saw that at t equals 0,
and we could try t equals 0

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.690
here, and we'll get the
point 10 comma 50.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.300
So the point 10 comma
50 was right there.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.990
That was at t equal to 0,
and then we plotted a few

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.880
points in the last video.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.010
I think t equals 1 was there.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.510
t equals 2 was, like, there,
and t equal 3 looked something

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.910
like that, and this was the
path of the actual car as

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.600
it hurtled to the ground.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.130
But this parametric equation
actually doesn't just describe

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.470
this part of the curve.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.120
It describes a curve that goes
in both directions forever.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.190
So it describes a curve that
does something like this.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.900
If you actually plot t equals
minus 1, what do you get here?

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.920
You get minus 5.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.140
So 10 minus 5 is 5.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.290
If you put a minus 1 here,
this becomes a plus 1.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.260
So minus 1, so you get 5, 45.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.510
So you get that
point right there.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.280
And if you did minus 2, you're
going to get a point that

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.330
looks something like that.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.690
And minus 3, you're
going to get a point

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.630
something like that.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.280
So the whole curve described by
this parametric equation will

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.340
look something like this.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.140
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.500
It looks something like this.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.990
And the direction as x
increases-- sorry, as

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.260
t increases, looks
like this, right?

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:11.920
This is t is equal to minus 3,
minus 2, minus 1, 0, 1, 2,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.510
and so forth and so on.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.480
So, in the last example, our
path was actually just a subset

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.400
of the path described by
this parametric equation.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.840
And I'm saying all of this
because sometimes it's useful

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.180
to just bound your parametric
equation and say this is a path

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.410
only for certain values of t.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.870
And in our example, it was when
we leave this point, which is

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.490
at t equals 0, all the way
to when we hit the ground.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.780
So if we want to know those
boundaries, well, we know the

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.470
first boundary is t equals 0,
so this in the last example,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.600
for when we actually talked
about a car careening off of a

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.410
cliff, it was between 0, so t
is greater than or

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.850
equal to zero.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.940
And then we have to figure
out what t-value makes

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.940
us hit the ground?

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.670
Or when does y equal 0?

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.980
Because when y equals 0-- y is
our altitude, so when y equals

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.100
0, we've hit the ground.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.590
So if we say what t-value
makes y equal 0?

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.090
We just say 0 equals
50 minus 5t squared.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.290
So let's do that.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.220
0 is equal to 50
minus 5t squared.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.930
I just took this and set y
equal to 0 because that's

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.570
when we're going to
be hitting the floor.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.440
Add 5t squared to both sides.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.340
You get 5t squared
is equal to 50.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.500
Divide both sides by 5. t
squared is equal to 10.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.070
t is equal to the
square root of 3.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.110
And you can actually say plus
or minus square root of 3

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.770
because this is-- we hit the
ground right at t is equal to

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.660
square root of-- oh, sorry.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.010
t is equal to
square root of 10.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.470
t is equal to
square root of 10.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.975
My brain did 3 because I
immediately said, oh, square

00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:48.300
root of 10, that's 3 point
something, something.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.850
So this is t equals square root
of 10, which is approximately

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.800
equal to 3 point--
I don't know.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.580
I don't know what it is.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.770
I should probably get my
calculator going, but that's

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:59.780
not important for this.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.700
And if we actually took the
positive and negative square

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.720
root, this would be t is
equal to the negative

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.530
square root of 10.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.930
Out here there's a negative
sign right there, and if you

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.500
could go backwards in time,
you would have kind of

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.490
hit the ground there.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.420
But remember, in our
example, we weren't

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.510
going backwards in time.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.440
If we went backwards in time at
t minus 1, we were actually on

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.780
a plateau, and then there would
have been a different set of

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.110
parametric equations that would
have described the car when it

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.220
was just driving
on the plateau.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.840
So if we really want to
describe the path of the car,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.710
we should have bounded it and
said that between time is equal

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.460
to 0 and time being less than
the square root of 10,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.990
this would have been our
parametric equations.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.580
Fair enough.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.000
Now, the next thing that's
interesting is, you know, we

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.215
took these parametric
equations, and we generalized

00:04:49.215 --> 00:04:51.270
it, and we just said what
it would look like if

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.110
we didn't bound it.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.490
If this wasn't the case, then
the parametric equation would

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.860
just keep going like that, and
it would have this kind

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.780
of direction, right?

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.420
It would move in
that direction.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.020
But can we express the set of
parametric equations as just a

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.180
normal equation where y is
expressed as a function of x,

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.490
or x is expressed as
a function of y?

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.930
And let's try.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.010
So the easiest thing to do is
let's just rewrite them, just

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.120
so we clean up our board.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:30.760
So if you have x is equal to 10
plus 5t and y is equal to 50

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:38.020
minus 5t squared, if we want to
write this system as just an

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.460
equation with just y and x,
what we can do is we could just

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.810
solve for t in terms of either
x or y and then substitute

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.860
back into the other equation.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.630
So the easier one to solve is
this top equation because

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:50.570
it's a linear equation.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:51.820
This is a little
more complicated.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.720
We'll have, you know, t is
equal to the square root of y,

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.350
and it becomes a lot more
complicated, so let's

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.680
just use this.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.680
So if we want to solve
for t, let's subtract

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.960
10 from both sides.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.700
You get x minus 10
is equal to 5t.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.400
Divide both sides by 5.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.650
You get x over 5
minus 2, right?

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.240
10 divided by 5 is equal to t.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.860
And now, we can take
this and substitute it.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.190
This is t, right?

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.720
So we can take this and
substitute it back here

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.700
for t because we say
this is equal to t.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:33.710
So our equation becomes y is
equal to 50 minus 5 times x

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:39.230
minus x over 5 minus 2 squared.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:40.260
Now, let's simplify this.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.750
This is equal to--
let's switch colors.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:50.780
50 minus 5 times x squared
over 25 minus-- let's see,

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:58.310
2/5, so it's 4/5x plus 4.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.870
And then if you multiply--
and this is a y out here.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.970
So you get y is equal to 50.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.610
And let's see, minus 5 times--
minus 5 over 25 is minus 1/5,

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.820
so minus x squared over 5.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:17.020
Minus 5 times minus
4/5, that's plus 4x.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.490
And then minus 5
times 4 is minus 20.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.250
We're almost there.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:28.740
We can add the 50 to the
negative 20, and we get y--

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:34.430
that's too dark-- y is equal
to minus x squared over

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.440
5 plus 4x plus 30.

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.250
And we're done.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.630
We just, I guess we could
say, simplified this set of

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:49.340
parametric equations to this
one equation, where y

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.670
is a function of x.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.690
And so you might be saying,
Sal, why didn't we just

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.200
always have it this way?

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.170
This is so much more simple,
and we can just graph this, and

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.460
you know how to deal with it,
and it's just one equation

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.470
with just y and x.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.550
We don't have this
third variable t.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.180
And that might be OK if
you just want to know

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.140
the shape of the path.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.900
So if you took this equation,
and if I told you to graph it,

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.700
you would indeed get a
parabola, kind of a

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:18.320
downward-opening parabola that
looks something like that.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.730
But when you go from these two
equations to this one equation,

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.520
you lose information.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.470
If I told you that this
describes the path of an

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.650
object, some object, it
doesn't have to be the car.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.510
We've progressed beyond that.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:33.630
It describes a path
of some object.

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:37.970
Just with this equation alone,
you don't know if the object

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.500
is-- is the object
going this way?

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.830
Is it going like that?

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:43.850
Or is the object going
in the other direction

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:44.580
like our car did.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.790
Is the object going that way?

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.600
We don't know because we
don't know how it moves

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.140
according to time.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.920
Likewise, if I told you this
was the path of the object and

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.610
then I asked you where is the
object after 5 seconds,

00:08:58.610 --> 00:08:59.670
you don't know.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.890
Because this just tells you
what the shape-- where x is

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.580
relative to y or where
y is relative to x.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.040
It doesn't tell you where you
are after 5 seconds, so we've

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.890
lost all of that information.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:12.500
We've lost information that
this is t equals 0, this is t

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.520
equals 1, this is t equals 2,
this is t equals 3, this is t

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.880
equals the square root of 10.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.350
And that's why parametric
equations are useful.

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:23.840
But anyway, I wanted to do this
example mainly to show you that

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.850
you can express the same shape
this way and also to show you

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:32.820
how to express a parametric
equation in terms of a y and an

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.230
x, but also for you to
appreciate that the parametric

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:39.210
equation is useful and that it
does contain information

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.430
that this just single
equation won't contain.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.020
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
