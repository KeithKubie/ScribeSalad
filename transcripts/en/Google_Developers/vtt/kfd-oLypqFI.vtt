00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.470
MIKE KARNS: "Hamilton" is
one of the most talked about

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.440
and best loved musicals,
with shows on Broadway,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.120
in London, and
around the country.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.920
We wanted something
to make the show more

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.320
accessible for our fans.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.970
So we wanted to develop an
app to meet the needs of fans

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.970
as we started to
expand the brand.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.400
We turned to Posse, a
New-York-based development firm

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.370
to help us develop
the Hamilton app.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.250
DAVID DEREMER:
"Hamilton's" Flutter app

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.083
launched in the App
Store and the Play Store

00:00:25.083 --> 00:00:27.270
three months after we wrote
our first line of code.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.500
And we accomplished a ton.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.140
Fans can enter a daily lottery
for a shot at $10 tickets,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.390
buy merchandise through
an e-commerce experience,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.040
take selfie photos
with the Ham Cam,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.570
and get daily news and updates.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.680
JESSICA WAGNER: We knew
that this app needed

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.930
to be rock solid, both
in terms of performance

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.480
and visual fidelity,
and really represent

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.640
the amazing experience
that the "Hamilton" show

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.810
itself provides.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.724
And ultimately, that's why
we decided to use Flutter.

00:00:48.724 --> 00:00:50.640
MARTIN AGUINIS: Flutter
is a mobile UI toolkit

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.830
that allows developers
and designers to craft

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.100
beautiful native experiences
on iOS and Android,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.207
and is entirely free
and open source.

00:00:58.207 --> 00:01:00.540
DAVID DEREMER: We have very
high expectations of quality

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.860
for the apps that we build.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.290
We expect pixel-perfect results.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.830
And we need them to be
very high performance.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.600
Flutter gave us a lot of
opportunities that previously

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.250
weren't available to us.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.819
The fact that it's
a single code base

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:14.610
drastically improved
our ability to deliver

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.090
a consistent experience
across platforms.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.170
Its hot reload
gives us an ability

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.670
to build more
features in less time.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.169
ALBERT LARDIZABAL: It allowed
me to make changes really fast

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:25.560
and iterate through
the UI without having

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.240
to stop or restart the app.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.310
Coming from an iOS and
Android background,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.726
it's something that I've been
waiting for for a long time.

00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:33.770
The Flutter developer
community is very active.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.150
Drop-in packages helped
us maximize productivity.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.505
It helped us integrate elements
like Firebase and Cloud.

00:01:38.505 --> 00:01:39.360
DAVID DEREMER: At
the end of the day,

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.940
we're just really happy
that we found Flutter

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.190
so that we can build these
beautiful native interfaces

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.630
for both iOS and Android
from a single code base.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.160
JESSICA WAGNER: We were given
a really tight timeline,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.118
and we turned the app
around faster than I ever

00:01:49.118 --> 00:01:50.267
could have imagined.

00:01:50.267 --> 00:01:52.350
We were able to make changes
right up to the night

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.590
before we went live and really
feel confident about them.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.810
In fact, we pushed an
entirely new feature

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.940
to the App Store the
day before we launched.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.160
DAVID DEREMER: And since launch,
Flutter's efficiency and speed

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.750
has helped us to
build new features,

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.420
such as the recent trivia game.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.879
We're really excited because
as the show continues to grow,

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:10.461
we're going to be able to keep
pace with a ton of new features

00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:12.360
that's going to make
the app even better.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.776
JESSICA WAGNER: We couldn't
be more thrilled with Flutter.

00:02:14.776 --> 00:02:17.580
It has enabled us to use one
code base to deliver a truly

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.310
high-quality app that
"Hamilton" fans have absolutely

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.144
fallen in love with.

00:02:21.144 --> 00:02:23.768
MIKE KARNS: We're thrilled with
what Posse was able to deliver.

00:02:23.768 --> 00:02:25.350
The entire brand
of "Hamilton" is

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.819
about delivering on an
experience for fans.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.360
They're thrilled about the new
feature set we're rolling out.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.693
And we're really excited to
see where the app goes next.

00:02:32.693 --> 00:02:35.630
