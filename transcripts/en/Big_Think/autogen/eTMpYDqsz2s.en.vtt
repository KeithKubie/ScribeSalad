once we start thinking about the role
 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.959
once we start thinking about the role
that parents and children play in human

very apparent is that that role was very

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929
very apparent is that that role was very
 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.499
very apparent is that that role was very
different from the prevailing role in

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509
different from the prevailing role in

our current culture there's something
 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.000
our current culture there's something
called parenting and that very word that

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010
called parenting and that very word that
 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.170

you look at the Google Ngram it soars up

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029
you look at the Google Ngram it soars up
 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.160
you look at the Google Ngram it soars up
in the 1970s and that word comes with a

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170
in the 1970s and that word comes with a
 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.650
in the 1970s and that word comes with a
picture and that picture is that what

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660
picture and that picture is that what
 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.709

to come out a particular way so your job

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329
to come out a particular way so your job
 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.720
to come out a particular way so your job
as a caregiver is to do a bunch of

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
as a caregiver is to do a bunch of
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.670
as a caregiver is to do a bunch of
things acquire a bunch of expertise that

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680
things acquire a bunch of expertise that
 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.310
things acquire a bunch of expertise that
will lead to a particular kind of child

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320
will lead to a particular kind of child
 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.709
will lead to a particular kind of child
which will lead to a particular kind of

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719
which will lead to a particular kind of
 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.479
which will lead to a particular kind of
a ttle and then somehow if you just get

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489
a ttle and then somehow if you just get
 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.279
a ttle and then somehow if you just get
the right expertise you can create a

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289
the right expertise you can create a
 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.260
the right expertise you can create a
better child who will create a better at

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
better child who will create a better at
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.330
better child who will create a better at
all now exactly what that better means

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340
all now exactly what that better means
 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.700
all now exactly what that better means
is a little unclear I think parents sort

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710
is a little unclear I think parents sort
 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.229
is a little unclear I think parents sort
of whisper under their breath better

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239
of whisper under their breath better
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.600
of whisper under their breath better
like better than the kid next door but

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610
like better than the kid next door but
 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.179
like better than the kid next door but
anyway there's some picture which i

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189
anyway there's some picture which i
 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.480
anyway there's some picture which i
think of as the carpenter picture of

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490
think of as the carpenter picture of
 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.469
think of as the carpenter picture of
caregiving which is that you're going to

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
caregiving which is that you're going to
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.450
caregiving which is that you're going to
shape this child into a particular kind

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
shape this child into a particular kind
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.219
shape this child into a particular kind
of battle and that picture which goes

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229
of battle and that picture which goes
 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.469
of battle and that picture which goes
with that word parenting really is very

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479
with that word parenting really is very
 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.390
with that word parenting really is very
recent it really only developed at the

recent it really only developed at the
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.910
recent it really only developed at the
end of the it really only developed at

end of the it really only developed at
 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.580
end of the it really only developed at
the end of the 20th century so that

the end of the 20th century so that
 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.410

picture is the picture that's become

picture is the picture that's become
 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.780
picture is the picture that's become
prominent in our discussions about

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790
prominent in our discussions about
 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.210
prominent in our discussions about
caregiving but it's very very different

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220
caregiving but it's very very different
 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.590
caregiving but it's very very different
from the picture that comes from

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
from the picture that comes from
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.390
from the picture that comes from
thinking about caregiving it in in an

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400
thinking about caregiving it in in an
 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.399
thinking about caregiving it in in an
evolutionary context and it's also very

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409
evolutionary context and it's also very
 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.870
evolutionary context and it's also very
different from the picture that comes

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880
different from the picture that comes
 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.420
different from the picture that comes
from the studies that we've done in my

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430
from the studies that we've done in my
 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.760
from the studies that we've done in my
lab and others about how children

lab and others about how children
 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.639
lab and others about how children
actually learn another way of thinking

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649
actually learn another way of thinking
 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.280
actually learn another way of thinking
about what caregiving is about is that

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290
about what caregiving is about is that
 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.800
about what caregiving is about is that
rather than having a bunch of procedures

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810
rather than having a bunch of procedures
 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.719
rather than having a bunch of procedures
that let us shape a child to come out a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729
that let us shape a child to come out a
 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.359
that let us shape a child to come out a
particular way what we do when we're

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369
particular way what we do when we're
 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.999
particular way what we do when we're
taking care of children is to provide a

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
taking care of children is to provide a
 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.050
taking care of children is to provide a
kind of nurturing context an environment

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060
kind of nurturing context an environment
 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.359
kind of nurturing context an environment
in which lots of variability lots of

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369
in which lots of variability lots of
 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.969
in which lots of variability lots of
different things can happen now if

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979
different things can happen now if

different things can happen now if
you're a gardener the way I am one of

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140
you're a gardener the way I am one of
 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.720
you're a gardener the way I am one of
the things you know is a gardener is

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730
the things you know is a gardener is
 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.220
the things you know is a gardener is
that nothing ever works out the way that

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230
that nothing ever works out the way that
 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.010
that nothing ever works out the way that
you originally planned and terrible

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020
you originally planned and terrible
 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.820
you originally planned and terrible
things happen

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830
things happen
 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.740
things happen
and also marvelous things happen in a

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750
and also marvelous things happen in a
 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.300
and also marvelous things happen in a
garden that weren't the things that you

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310
garden that weren't the things that you
 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.100
garden that weren't the things that you
were originally thinking about but

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110
were originally thinking about but
 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.570
were originally thinking about but
there's actually a deeper reason for

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580
there's actually a deeper reason for
 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.250
there's actually a deeper reason for
that and the deeper reason for that is

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260
that and the deeper reason for that is
 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.010
that and the deeper reason for that is
that being a gardener is to create a

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020
that being a gardener is to create a
 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.320
that being a gardener is to create a
kind of ecosystem what you really want

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330
kind of ecosystem what you really want
 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.320
kind of ecosystem what you really want
to do is create a system with enough

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330
to do is create a system with enough
 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.050
to do is create a system with enough
variability and possibility flexibility

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060
variability and possibility flexibility
 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.910
variability and possibility flexibility
robustness so that when the weather

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920
robustness so that when the weather
 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.580
robustness so that when the weather
changes or the season changes the garden

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590
changes or the season changes the garden

as a whole will be able to adjust to

as a whole will be able to adjust to
 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.870
as a whole will be able to adjust to
that kind of change and when you think

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880
that kind of change and when you think
 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.550
that kind of change and when you think
about the evolutionary function of

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560
about the evolutionary function of
 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.620
about the evolutionary function of
childhood that's really what childhood

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630
childhood that's really what childhood
 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.740
childhood that's really what childhood
is about what childhood is about is

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750
is about what childhood is about is
 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.840
is about what childhood is about is
providing a period of exploration of

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850
providing a period of exploration of
 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.210
providing a period of exploration of
possibility for human beings so that we

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220
possibility for human beings so that we
 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.880
possibility for human beings so that we
can change in the light of changes in

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890
can change in the light of changes in
 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.710
can change in the light of changes in
our environment childhood is about

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720
our environment childhood is about
 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.360
our environment childhood is about
change and caregiving is about providing

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370
change and caregiving is about providing
 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.730
change and caregiving is about providing
safe protected nurturing stable

safe protected nurturing stable
environment in which that kind of

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630
environment in which that kind of
 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.140
environment in which that kind of
exploration can take place that's a very

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150
exploration can take place that's a very
 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.660
exploration can take place that's a very
different picture than the parenting

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670
different picture than the parenting
 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.540
different picture than the parenting
carpentry kind of picture another kind

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550
carpentry kind of picture another kind
 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.150
carpentry kind of picture another kind
of metaphor that you could use is you

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160
of metaphor that you could use is you
 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.300
of metaphor that you could use is you
know think about a monoculture like you

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310
know think about a monoculture like you
 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.740
know think about a monoculture like you
know one of those giant farms where all

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750
know one of those giant farms where all
 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.540
know one of those giant farms where all
they do is grow the same kind of potato

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550
they do is grow the same kind of potato
 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.699
they do is grow the same kind of potato
in a way the parenting picture is saying

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709
in a way the parenting picture is saying
 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.710
in a way the parenting picture is saying
that we should think about caregiving

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720
that we should think about caregiving
 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.390
that we should think about caregiving
taking care of children as being kind of

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400
taking care of children as being kind of
 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.930
taking care of children as being kind of
like creating the very best potato and

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940
like creating the very best potato and
 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.120
like creating the very best potato and
we know that that's not a good formula

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130
we know that that's not a good formula
 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.340
we know that that's not a good formula
for robustness we know that that's not a

the way that we learned how to take care
 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.740
the way that we learned how to take care

thing that I do think for sure is that

generation of children will come out the

generation of children will come out the

in the mean time this there's a lot of

in the mean time this there's a lot of
 

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:47.450
in the mean time this there's a lot of
unnecessary stress and misery that's

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:47.460
unnecessary stress and misery that's
 

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.010
unnecessary stress and misery that's
happening both for parents and for

happening both for parents and for

we think and it seems to me plausible

00:08:55.579 --> 00:08:55.589
we think and it seems to me plausible
 

00:08:55.589 --> 00:08:57.950
we think and it seems to me plausible
that some features of children

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:57.960
that some features of children
 

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:03.030
that some features of children
are related to this particular kind of

so it seems as if at least in Chaddock

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:09.100
so it seems as if at least in Chaddock
 

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.500

totally I don't think we have any data

totally I don't think we have any data
 

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.090
totally I don't think we have any data
about this but at least downing totally

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:12.100
about this but at least downing totally
 

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.520
about this but at least downing totally
it seems that we have this strange thing

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:14.530
it seems that we have this strange thing
 

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.140
it seems that we have this strange thing
with children who are very privileged

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:16.150
with children who are very privileged
 

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.730
with children who are very privileged
have been very well taken care of and

that something bad is going to happen to

and that's the kind of combination you

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:24.190
and that's the kind of combination you
 

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:28.410
and that's the kind of combination you
might expect from this kind of a very

don't think we have very clear evidence

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:33.880
don't think we have very clear evidence
 

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.870
don't think we have very clear evidence
for those relationships but at least it

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880
for those relationships but at least it
 

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.760
for those relationships but at least it
seems anecdotally plausible that that

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:38.770
seems anecdotally plausible that that
 

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.260
seems anecdotally plausible that that
might happen but I don't think that's

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:40.270
might happen but I don't think that's
 

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:41.520
might happen but I don't think that's
the biggest problem I think the biggest

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:41.530
the biggest problem I think the biggest
 

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.200
the biggest problem I think the biggest
problem is that life is being made

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:43.210
problem is that life is being made
 

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.120
problem is that life is being made

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.130
miserable for parents and for children
 

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:49.290
miserable for parents and for children
in ways that are just not necessary
