like others but there's no reason to
think for me for me there's no reason to

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370
think for me for me there's no reason to
 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.070
think for me for me there's no reason to
think there's something beyond the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080
think there's something beyond the
 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.859

physical brain and I say this because

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869
physical brain and I say this because
 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.750
physical brain and I say this because
the experience I had with people as they

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760
the experience I had with people as they
 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.380
the experience I had with people as they
grow old their consciousness their

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390
grow old their consciousness their
 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.230
grow old their consciousness their
awareness changes and I'm talking about

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
awareness changes and I'm talking about
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.789

abilities the most reasonable
 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.710
abilities the most reasonable
explanation for that for me is the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720
explanation for that for me is the
 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.499
explanation for that for me is the
chemical brain is all you get the nature

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509

furthermore would this brain that you

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110
furthermore would this brain that you
 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.560
furthermore would this brain that you
produce be just like Bill Nye I think

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570
produce be just like Bill Nye I think
 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.800
produce be just like Bill Nye I think
the answer is clearly no because the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
the answer is clearly no because the
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.870
the answer is clearly no because the
Bill Nye you have here is based on all

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880
Bill Nye you have here is based on all
 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.640
Bill Nye you have here is based on all
these life experiences which could only

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650
these life experiences which could only
 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.760
these life experiences which could only
happen during the time I have been alive

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770
happen during the time I have been alive
 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.359
happen during the time I have been alive
in other words I I remember Nixon

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369
in other words I I remember Nixon
 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.580
in other words I I remember Nixon
resigning I remember the moon landing

I remember 9/11 but this new brain you

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290
I remember 9/11 but this new brain you

he has only played with a 165 gram disk
 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.179
he has only played with a 165 gram disk
so his experience is just going to be

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189
so his experience is just going to be
 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.910
so his experience is just going to be
totally different if you see what I'm

question I'd like all of us to think
 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.840
question I'd like all of us to think
about the nature of consciousness and

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850
about the nature of consciousness and
 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.100
about the nature of consciousness and
this has all kinds of implications about

this has all kinds of implications about
 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.230
this has all kinds of implications about
how you treat other people and how you
