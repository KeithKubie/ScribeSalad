00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.775
- [Voiceover] So these are two
pictures of the same figure.

00:00:02.775 --> 00:00:06.374
This is a front view of the object,

00:00:06.374 --> 00:00:09.810
and this is the back view of the object.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.490
And if a unit cube looks like this,

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.673
what I want to do is I want
to figure out the volume

00:00:15.673 --> 00:00:18.749
of this figure in terms of unit cubes,

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.572
or in terms of cubic units.

00:00:20.572 --> 00:00:22.058
I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:22.058 --> 00:00:26.189
and think of it on your own
before we try it together.

00:00:26.248 --> 00:00:28.048
All right, well, there's
a bunch of ways that

00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:29.429
we could tackle this,

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.287
all of them kind of breaking this

00:00:31.287 --> 00:00:32.947
figure up in different ways.

00:00:32.947 --> 00:00:37.853
One way we could do it, we
could break it up into this.

00:00:37.853 --> 00:00:41.213
I guess we could call
it a rectangular prism.

00:00:41.213 --> 00:00:43.426
So, if you could see through there,

00:00:43.426 --> 00:00:46.467
it would be like this, so
this piece right over here,

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:48.673
this piece right over here.

00:00:48.673 --> 00:00:51.250
And I'll redraw it here,
so you can visualize it.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.884
So, if I were to redraw
it, it looks like this.

00:00:54.884 --> 00:00:58.111
It looks like this.

00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:01.687
And what are its dimensions?

00:01:01.687 --> 00:01:05.483
Well, its four units wide.

00:01:05.483 --> 00:01:08.025
It's two units high.

00:01:08.025 --> 00:01:10.347
And then it's four
units, we could say long,

00:01:10.347 --> 00:01:12.448
or four units deep.

00:01:12.448 --> 00:01:13.922
So just like that.

00:01:13.922 --> 00:01:16.372
So what's the volume of this yellow part?

00:01:16.372 --> 00:01:17.893
Well, the volume is just you multiply

00:01:17.893 --> 00:01:20.563
these three dimensions,
the length times the width,

00:01:20.563 --> 00:01:22.165
times the height.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:24.680
So the volume is going to be our length

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.151
times our width times our height.

00:01:28.151 --> 00:01:33.151
Four times four is 16 times two is 32.

00:01:33.572 --> 00:01:34.397
But we're not done.

00:01:34.397 --> 00:01:36.800
That's just the volume
of this yellow part.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.458
We still have to take into
consideration the volume

00:01:39.458 --> 00:01:40.932
of this piece right over here that

00:01:40.932 --> 00:01:44.611
we haven't figured out yet,
this piece right over there.

00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:46.478
Now, this one might just jump out at you.

00:01:46.478 --> 00:01:48.579
You could just count the unit cubes,

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.181
but I'll redraw it here,

00:01:50.181 --> 00:01:52.700
just to show you what's going on.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.732
All right. So it looks like this.

00:01:54.732 --> 00:01:56.257
It looks like this.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.352
And what are its dimensions?

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:02.080
Well, it's two wide, two high,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.692
and we could say one deep or one long.

00:02:04.692 --> 00:02:07.699
So its volume is going to be equal to

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:12.699
your length times your
width times your height,

00:02:14.374 --> 00:02:15.616
which is equal to four.

00:02:15.616 --> 00:02:16.453
And you just see that.

00:02:16.453 --> 00:02:20.318
There's one, two, three, four
unit cubes in this object.

00:02:20.318 --> 00:02:22.965
So the total volume is going to be

00:02:22.965 --> 00:02:27.965
32 plus 32 plus four is equal to 36.

00:02:29.884 --> 00:02:31.939
Now, of course, there's
other ways to tackle it.

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.343
You could just say, hey,
let's figure out the

00:02:33.343 --> 00:02:35.828
volume of the blue layer
and then just double it

00:02:35.828 --> 00:02:37.546
because that red layer has the same

00:02:37.546 --> 00:02:39.403
volume as the blue layer.

00:02:39.403 --> 00:02:41.173
And the blue layer, you
could, say, well, look,

00:02:41.173 --> 00:02:42.171
it's only one deep.

00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:44.830
So we just have to
count the cubes up here,

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.966
and then we'll know how
many unit cubes fit into it.

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:49.882
So you literally could
just count one, two...

00:02:49.882 --> 00:02:51.843
Let me do it a color you can actually see.

00:02:51.843 --> 00:02:54.896
You just have to go one,
two, three, four, five,

00:02:54.896 --> 00:02:57.858
six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11,

00:02:57.858 --> 00:03:01.716
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

00:03:01.716 --> 00:03:05.240
So you see there are 18
cubes in the blue layer,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.024
and there are going to be
another 18 in the red layer,

00:03:09.024 --> 00:03:12.844
plus 18, that also gets
you to 36 unit cubes,

00:03:12.844 --> 00:03:16.318
or a volume of 36 cubic units.
