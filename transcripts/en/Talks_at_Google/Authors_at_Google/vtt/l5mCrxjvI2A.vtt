00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.450
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.950
Thank you all for joining us.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.380
This talk is brought
on by Talktopia.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.430
If you want to join us, head
over to go slash talktopia.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.530
We are joined today
by Eric Barker.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.990
He wrote this excellent
book that I've used

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.300
like 10,000 post-it notes on.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.010
I probably killed
a lot of trees.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.719
My apologies.

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:29.010
ERIC BARKER: It says less
about the quality of the book

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.230
and more about your OCD--

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.090
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, pretty much.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.350
ERIC BARKER: --than
anything else.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.890
SPEAKER 1: So the book's called
"Barking Up the Wrong Tree."

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.650
The book is about success,
common myths that we have,

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.320
and what things we can
make ourselves better.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.210
So I wanted to start
with the first question--

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.576
after researching
this book on success,

00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:49.200
what are things that
you found yourself

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.600
doing differently after it?

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.240
ERIC BARKER: Writing
the sixth chapter

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.780
was on work, life balance.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.699
I had been working
so hard on the book

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.490
that I was literally
looking at this going,

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.330
I'm violating like every one
of the things I'm recommending.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.350
I was not balanced.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.110
So for me, that was
really critical was

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.570
to be able to sit
there and kind of say--

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.700
to take on a really
ambitious project.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.420
And then I had to really
kind of algorithmically like

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.160
go through the things
I was talking about

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.020
and start to incorporate
them more myself.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.780
Because I found myself
getting so intense about this

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.110
that my life really
stopped having balance.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.010
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.600
Now in the first
chapter you talked

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.560
about filtered and
unfiltered leaders.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.020
Can you go into
that a little bit?

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.200
ERIC BARKER: Yeah.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.400
This was really interesting.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.860
This was work done by Gautam
Mukunda at Harvard Business

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.830
School.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.500
I connected strongly with
it because I'd been writing

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.080
about research on leadership.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.030
And I noticed this
total discrepancy

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.520
where half the
research was saying

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.542
that leaders are essential.

00:01:51.542 --> 00:01:52.250
They're critical.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.440
They pull people together.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.687
They give people a mission and a
meaning and drive them forward.

00:01:56.687 --> 00:01:58.520
And the other half was
saying that if you've

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.550
got a bunch of real A players,
they'll self-organize.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.282
You don't need some
figureheads taking the credit.

00:02:04.282 --> 00:02:05.740
And it was totally
a contradiction.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.800
And I was scratching my head.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.508
And then I came across
Gautam's research.

00:02:08.508 --> 00:02:10.449
And what he saw was
that there are actually

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.190
two different kinds of leaders.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.380
There's filtered leaders
and unfiltered leaders.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.220
And basically, do leaders
make a difference?

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.149
Do they not?

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:21.190
Well, when you're talking
about filtered leaders,

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.880
you are talking
about people who are

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.760
going through a vetted system,
like in a typical hierarchical

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.470
corporation.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.980
Those people are heavily vetted.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.454
So by the time anybody is in
the running for CEO of GE,

00:02:31.454 --> 00:02:33.370
they've been so thoroughly
vetted that they're

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.411
almost indistinguishable.

00:02:34.411 --> 00:02:37.360
They would make the same
decisions as anybody else.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.620
So their decisions
don't have huge impact.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.657
Because if you pick one
person or the other,

00:02:41.657 --> 00:02:42.490
it's the same thing.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.948
Versus unfiltered
leaders-- so when

00:02:43.948 --> 00:02:46.180
you're talking about
entrepreneurs, when you're

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.130
talking about if the
president steps down,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.664
the vice president, who
was not chosen, comes up.

00:02:50.664 --> 00:02:52.080
Those people are
less predictable.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.440
They weren't filtered the
same way through the system.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.310
So you can't expect them
to make the same decisions.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.410
So they aren't predictable.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.950
And they create big change.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.990
Change is a value-neutral word.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.240
Sometimes those changes are
bad, but sometimes you've

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.390
got unfiltered leaders,
like Abraham Lincoln, who

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.580
was a perfect storm that
resulted in him being elected.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.100
He ended slavery.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.770
So unfiltered leaders
create big changes.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.790
Filtered leaders not so much.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.370
But they each have their place.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.020
When you need a company or
organization to keep going,

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.000
they're doing well,
prefer a filtered leader.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.211
And if you need changes, you
want an unfiltered leader.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.710
SPEAKER 1: And you
talk about ponds,

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.715
like finding the right
pond for a leader.

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:36.340
ERIC BARKER: What I
saw through looking

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.810
at all the research on success
and talking to actually Gautam

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.050
about this was that the
things that are really

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.210
critical in terms of
success in any arena

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.150
is first knowing yourself,
knowing your signature

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.730
strengths.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.100
What are you good at?

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.190
What are you uniquely good at?

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.690
Because the more
time you spend--

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.402
this is research you see from
the University of Pennsylvania

00:03:58.402 --> 00:04:00.860
in terms of when people exercise
their signature strengths,

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.660
they are happier,
they're more successful.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.560
They feel more respected when
they do things they're good at.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.530
And then aligning yourself--
picking the right pond.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.780
In other words, what's
a place that respects

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.420
and values what you do?

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.250
Because you can be
great at something,

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.440
but if you're not
in a place that

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.600
really respects and
rewards that, you're going

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.350
have a tough time.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.440
So it's aligning knowing thy
self, picking the right pond.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.180
When those two are
in alignment, you're

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.150
in a really good position to be
successful in whatever you do.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.210
SPEAKER 1: That ties into
knowing when to quit.

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.470
Can you go into that?

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.220
ERIC BARKER: Yeah.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.011
That's something that's
really interesting.

00:04:35.011 --> 00:04:37.540
Because grit is kind of having
its time in the sun now,

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.689
and everybody's talking
about being gritty.

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:41.230
And the truth is,
we all quit things.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.188
We have to quit things.

00:04:42.188 --> 00:04:44.470
Otherwise, I'd still be
playing with action figures

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.270
and playing t-ball.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.429
We all quit things.

00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:47.470
You need to move forward.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.450
So it's more of an issue
of what do you quit?

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.010
When do you quit?

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.310
And there was some really
interesting research

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.500
by Gabriele Oettingen
at NYU, where

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.040
she talked about this funny
little word called "WOOP."

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:07.000
And it's an acronym for when the
issue-- you want to first wish,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.580
then it's the issue of
what's the outcome you want,

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.850
the obstacle, and then the plan.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:12.820
Those are four steps.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.440
Because we all like to dream.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.800
But the truth is research
shows when we dream we actually

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.350
sap our energy, because our
brains aren't good at telling

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.730
fiction from reality.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.650
That's why movies are exciting.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.770
So when we dream we
can actually sap energy

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.230
if we don't go to the next
step, which is first is wish.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.110
Second is to really think,
what's the outcome you want?

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.110
What is the crystal clear
thing you want to achieve?

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.376
And then-- once you wish--

00:05:36.376 --> 00:05:38.500
outcome, then you have to
think about the obstacle.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.670
That's the tough part.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.930
What's in the way?

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.600
What is stopping you from
getting what you want?

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.100
And then the fourth
part is a plan.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.100
How are you going to
overcome that obstacle?

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.046
When people walk
through that then

00:05:51.046 --> 00:05:52.420
you're really in
a good position.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.400
That's what's called in academia
implementation intentions.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.630
You're really in a good
position to move forward.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.540
But the secondary effect
is really fascinating.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.670
When people go through
this WOOP exercise,

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.010
if they feel energized,
if they feel better

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.430
about their goals, that
generally indicates,

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.430
the research shows,
that they're realistic.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.110
That this is something
they could do.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.150
And if they feel
de-energized, the goal

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.020
is probably unrealistic.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.530
So using that WOOP exercise
can really help people

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.320
decide when to use
grit and when to quit.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.692
Because they'll look at
their dreams, their wishes,

00:06:25.692 --> 00:06:26.650
they walk through this.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.441
They can see if they
have an adequate plan,

00:06:28.441 --> 00:06:29.560
if that goal's reachable.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.240
And then they can
make the decision

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.870
whether to quit on that
or to at least come up

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.746
with a different method
to try and get there.

00:06:36.746 --> 00:06:38.495
SPEAKER 1: And it's
protection from people

00:06:38.495 --> 00:06:40.750
who seem to be geared towards
more positive thinking.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.420
Where it adds a little bit
of pessimism so they can--

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.620
ERIC BARKER: You always
have to think about,

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:45.730
what are the challenges?

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.920
Because otherwise, it stays
merely a dream versus saying,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.060
what's in the way?

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.350
Why don't I have this?

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.530
And then you can start to create
an action plan to get there.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.300
SPEAKER 1: Gotcha.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.510
Can you talk about the student
who went to, I think it was,

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.434
Brown University or
Princeton and decided

00:07:03.434 --> 00:07:05.600
I want to become the baddest
person in Kung Fu ever?

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.933
ERIC BARKER: This is Matt Polly.

00:07:06.933 --> 00:07:08.710
Matt was at Princeton.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.940
And he dropped out of
Princeton because he decided

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.420
he wanted to master Kung Fu.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.360
And he moved to China.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.310
He studied at the
Shaolin temple.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.710
And it was crazy.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.200
His parents went nuts.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.090
He didn't fit in.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.570
But this was a dream of his.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.370
And at the end, he
realized he wasn't

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.078
going to be the baddest
man in the world.

00:07:32.078 --> 00:07:35.140
So he quit his
dream at that point.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.640
He realized he was
never going to be

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.620
the toughest guy on the planet.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:43.690
But that crazy experience,
that chance he took

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.760
ended up launching
a writing career.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.140
And now he's a very
successful author.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.970
SPEAKER 1: Got you.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:51.710
You had a quote in there--

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.910
trying to find it now--
like 10,000 post-it notes.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.530
But it was about when he
went to the final bout

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.660
and he was seeing the master.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.184
Do you remember that full quote?

00:08:01.184 --> 00:08:03.600
ERIC BARKER: I'm not sure which
part you're talking about.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.900
SPEAKER 1: He was with his
friend and his friend--

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.410
so it goes, they were studying
who the master is and wanted

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:11.700
to see the master fight.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.230
So they saw the master fight.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.120
And the master was
fighting someone,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.780
and he literally almost
tore this guy's head off.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.370
And he turns to his friend
and he's, well, you know--

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.120
ERIC BARKER: Well,
that was the guy that--

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.320
oh, the guy who was
leading the tournament.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.570
This was the tournament
that Matt was fighting in.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.720
And Matt's watching
the guy who he's

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.429
going to have to fight next.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:37.130
And he sees this guy
destroy his opponent.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:43.980
And they have to take the
opponent out on a stretcher.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.570
And Matt's friend
tries to calm Matt

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:47.820
down and make him feel better.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.820
And says, don't worry,
they will not take you out

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:51.690
on a stretcher.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.110
Matt says, oh, that feels good.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.443
He's like, yeah, you're too
tall for Chinese stretchers.

00:08:55.443 --> 00:08:57.370
They'll just leave
you on the tarmac.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.220
So he's like, this is
not a good situation.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.812
SPEAKER 1: Oh, boy.

00:09:01.812 --> 00:09:05.580
Can you talk about the
impact of networks?

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.910
Because some of us think if
we put our heads down and work

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.250
really, really hard and
are good that somehow

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.842
our work will sell
itself and it will be OK.

00:09:14.842 --> 00:09:16.800
ERIC BARKER: The research
is pretty consistent.

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.540
Networks are really powerful.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.760
Being connected makes
a big difference.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.670
And I looked at a wide
range of research,

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.060
even extending out
to drug dealers.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.630
Drug dealers with bigger
networks are more successful

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.940
and are less likely
to be incarcerated.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.610
Networks matter
everywhere, in terms

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.480
of getting hired, in terms of--

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.720
there was even a study
done, I believe, at IBM

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.930
where employees
with bigger networks

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:49.470
actually ended up creating
more value for the company.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.316
So basically, if you looked
at the individual employee

00:09:52.316 --> 00:09:53.940
and you calculated
how many people they

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:57.420
had in their Rolodex,
their contact

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.670
list on their smartphone,
you can actually

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:02.340
quantify how much
more value that person

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.750
was worth to the company.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.940
So networks, from top to
bottom, from getting hired,

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.030
getting promoted across
the board are valuable.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.480
And so in the book, I go into
what the research shows can

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.970
help people increase the
size of their network

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.500
because it makes a difference.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.660
SPEAKER 1: Got you.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.890
Are there any quick
tips for either

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.870
promoting yourself or
building a network?

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.160
ERIC BARKER: Absolutely.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.949
The simplest and easiest
thing, because networking,

00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:27.240
it's kind of like a dirty word.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.620
It like feels sleazy.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:31.290
Like nobody likes it because
it feels very transactional.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.187
And the simplest thing,
from the research,

00:10:33.187 --> 00:10:35.520
that people can do to increase
the size of their network

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.300
is to reconnect
with old friends.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.030
You have tons of people,
friends on Facebook,

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:45.810
in your smartphone, LinkedIn
contacts, who you just haven't

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.310
talked to in maybe years.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.220
And reconnecting with
people, now it's not sleazy.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:50.940
It's not scary.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.110
You already know
these people, you're

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.193
already friends with them.

00:10:53.193 --> 00:10:55.620
So reconnecting with people
is a really great way

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.900
to increase your network size.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.450
And you don't have to have any
awkwardness or any sleaziness

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:02.550
because they're people
you already know.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:07.100
A second thing that's
pretty simple is when--

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.900
I think this was
research by Brian Uzzi

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.360
and Sharon Dunlap-- was that
there are super connectors.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.636
If you look through
your contact list,

00:11:15.636 --> 00:11:17.760
you're going to find that
a disproportionate number

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.440
of people were introduced to
you by a handful of people.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.740
We all have that one
friend who introduced us

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.420
to so many other friends.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.400
Those people are your
super connectors.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.544
So if you want to
build your network,

00:11:28.544 --> 00:11:30.210
and you only have
limited time, you only

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:31.751
have limited resources,
then you want

00:11:31.751 --> 00:11:33.420
to give a
disproportionate attention

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.800
to those super connectors.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.991
And ask them, hey, I'm looking
for a new job, who should I

00:11:37.991 --> 00:11:38.490
talk to?

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.080
Hey, I'm looking
to make new friends

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.160
in a new city I move to.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.450
Who should I talk to?

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.870
Those super connectors
are the hubs of networks.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.910
And that's where
you're going to get

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.077
the most bang for your buck.

00:11:49.077 --> 00:11:50.868
SPEAKER 1: You mentioned
a guy named Panda.

00:11:50.868 --> 00:11:51.840
His nickname is Panda.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.860
ERIC BARKER: Yeah.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:54.600
Adam Rifkin.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.640
"Fortune" magazine,
I think it was 2012,

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.250
called him the most networked
guy in Silicon Valley.

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:04.290
Adam Rifkin, who's a great
guy, is a shy introvert.

00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:07.710
But he is great at
connecting people,

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.350
and he's a really,
really nice guy.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.180
He just believes in--

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:16.980
one of the tips that comes from
Adam is the five minute favor.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.140
Where he just thinks,
what can I do for somebody

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.670
to help them out
that will only take

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:21.990
like five minutes of my time?

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.932
Whether it's offering them a
resource, linked to something

00:12:25.932 --> 00:12:28.140
they might be interested
in, or connecting two people

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.580
who are in the same arena.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.310
Just doing little things
like that because he

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:34.006
has a gargantuan network.

00:12:34.006 --> 00:12:36.630
And you'd think that that would
take an enormous amount of time

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:37.500
to maintain.

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.090
But it's actually
relatively simple

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.430
when he's thinking about
just little things he can

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.760
do to provide value to others.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:49.344
And it's created this
enormous incredible network.

00:12:49.344 --> 00:12:50.760
SPEAKER 1: And I
think when people

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.436
are starting their network, a
lot of it is the fear failure.

00:12:53.436 --> 00:12:54.810
They have to say
the right thing,

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.580
the right person
to impress them.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.800
And then if they mess
up in the connection,

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.594
then they have this
negative self-talk.

00:13:00.594 --> 00:13:02.260
So you were talking
about the importance

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.730
of positive self-talk and the
correlation between success

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.610
rates and BUD/S
Navy SEAL training.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.010
Can you go into that?

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:11.790
ERIC BARKER: We all say
approximately 300 to 1,000

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.970
words to ourselves every minute.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:16.620
And those can be positive.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.617
Those can be negative.

00:13:17.617 --> 00:13:19.200
Now, we're not getting
into the secret

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.390
here, where it's
like what you say

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.090
to yourself is going
to magically create

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:25.840
money, or success, or whatever.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.230
But, in terms of the
things you say to yourself,

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.560
the Navy, basically
after 9/11, the Navy

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.110
wanted to increase the
number of Navy SEALs.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:39.200
But if you reduce the threshold
for the difficulty of BUD/S,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.780
the vetting program, then the
SEALs aren't going to be good.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.280
So they were
thinking, how can we

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.740
help people get through it
without lowering standards?

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.820
And one of the four
things that they realized

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.971
was positive self-talk.

00:13:52.971 --> 00:13:54.720
Because that story
you're telling yourself

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.060
in your head becomes a
self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.750
And there's tons of
research, much of it

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:03.240
done by Martin Seligman, in
terms of the power of optimism.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.970
Where just when we
believe we can, it makes

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.810
sense to continue.

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:09.090
It's pretty intuitive.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:12.510
When you feel like things
aren't going to work out,

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.770
why would you persist?

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.930
When you think things are
going to work out then

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.010
it makes sense.

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.750
So when your
self-talk is positive,

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:23.040
when you see positive things
in your life as personal,

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.139
you're responsible for
them, they're permanent,

00:14:25.139 --> 00:14:26.430
they're going to keep on going.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.240
And that they are
pervasive-- they're

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.750
affecting a big
area of your life.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.000
You're more likely to persist.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.440
You're more likely to go on.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.270
And that was one
of the key things

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.670
that helped recruits get
through Navy SEAL training.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:36.930
SPEAKER 1: Gotcha.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.910
And didn't you also talk
about the importance

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.370
of that positive self-talk
for your own mental health

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:42.540
and well-being?

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.027
Because I think one
thing I hear about is

00:14:45.027 --> 00:14:46.860
people want to network,
but they always say,

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.750
well, I have no value to give.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.290
Why should I be doing this?

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.840
But then if you look
at Oprah, for instance,

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.430
she's born in a single family,
single parent household,

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:57.190
came from poverty.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.430
But she always looked
at herself differently,

00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:02.680
which allowed her
to get over this.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.680
ERIC BARKER: There's a
strong connection, again,

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:09.000
that same research between
resilience and grit

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.470
and optimism.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:14.250
Is that people who have
that positive self-talk that

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.615
say that good things
are personal, permanent,

00:15:17.615 --> 00:15:18.300
and pervasive.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.390
And the bad things are not
personal, permanent and

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:21.300
pervasive.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.750
They are more likely to
persist, to show resilience

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:28.390
in the face of difficulty
and to keep going.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:31.260
So if you're trying to achieve
a goal, whatever it is,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.120
having that perspective
will be will

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.680
be beneficial in terms
of keeping going.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.180
SPEAKER 1: And then there's
some people who are so confident

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:43.914
they kind of create like
self-delusion about--

00:15:43.914 --> 00:15:45.330
ERIC BARKER:
Confidence is tricky,

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.810
because the whole confidence
paradigm is very tricky.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:53.730
Because confidence, as a whole,
the benefits of confidence

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:57.170
are that it feels good,
feels good to be powerful.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:59.760
It has enormous
influence on others.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.550
There's research showing that
people will choose confidence

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:03.714
over expertise.

00:16:03.714 --> 00:16:05.130
They will actually
choose a person

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.440
who is more confident
with a worse track

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.110
record than the person with
a better track record who

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.820
comes across as less confident.

00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:16.380
But confidence can also lead to
hubris, narcissism, delusion.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.570
And lower confidence
helps us learn.

00:16:19.570 --> 00:16:21.262
We're open to new ideas.

00:16:21.262 --> 00:16:23.220
But it doesn't feel good,
and it doesn't create

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.570
a good impression on others.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:26.685
So what you see is that
the whole confidence

00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:27.810
paradigm is kind of tricky.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:30.235
Because confidence is
often either delusional or

00:16:30.235 --> 00:16:30.735
contingent.

00:16:30.735 --> 00:16:33.180
It's delusional because
we tell ourselves

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.487
these outsized lies
about who we are.

00:16:36.487 --> 00:16:38.820
And eventually, there's going
to be a market correction.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.860
Reality is going to
hit you in the face

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.780
and show you where
you really stand.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.430
So it can be delusional
or can be contingent.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.670
Where, basically, you
wake up feeling like I

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.730
need to slay a dragon every day
in order to have self-worth.

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:52.620
And you're on this
treadmill of I

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.904
have to keep performing in
order to have self-esteem.

00:16:55.904 --> 00:16:57.570
SPEAKER 1: So you're
never really happy?

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:57.900
ERIC BARKER: Yeah.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.899
And so you're on this
roller coaster of emotions

00:16:59.899 --> 00:17:02.640
where how you do in
life is constantly

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.990
affecting how you feel.

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.660
And the anxiety of
knowing everything you do

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:09.630
is going to affect how
you feel about yourself.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.427
As opposed to taking, as
I talk about in the book,

00:17:12.427 --> 00:17:14.010
the perspective
self-compassion, which

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:15.210
originally comes from Buddhism.

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.190
But now, Kristin Neff,
at University of Texas,

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.880
has been showing that the
self-compassion of attitude,

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.450
taking a realistic view--

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:24.359
but rather than having an
unrealistic view of how awesome

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:27.569
I am, taking the view that I'm
going to see the world the way

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:31.410
it is and I'm going to forgive
myself when I screw up.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:34.770
The research basically
shows that that perspective

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.510
gives all the benefits
of self-confidence

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:40.950
without the downsides of
narcissism, or hubris,

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:44.504
or seeing the world
in an unrealistic way.

00:17:44.504 --> 00:17:45.170
SPEAKER 1: True.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.090
It keeps you grounded.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.194
You talked about the ghost army.

00:17:49.194 --> 00:17:51.360
Can you go into that and
how it plays into the book?

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:51.660
ERIC BARKER: Yeah.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.220
Basically, in
World War II, there

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:57.420
was a whole unit that was
dedicated toward deception.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.370
Where, basically,
their goal was--

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:04.750
you're talking about less than
1,000 men whose job it was to--

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:08.590
these were artists and
guys who might not have fit

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.330
in other areas of the military.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.450
And their job was to be less
than 1,000 men who appeared

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.450
to be 10,000 or more soldiers.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:18.340
So they could
actually fill in gaps

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.170
in the line in World War II.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:23.860
And there was a unit that had
huge speakers that would play

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.870
the sounds of tanks coming.

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:29.230
They had 95-pound
inflatable tanks,

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.090
which occasionally
they'd use a rope

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:35.140
to keep the barrel of the tank
up because it would deflate.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:38.770
But from the sky, enemy
planes, recon planes

00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.860
would see what looks like
tanks from a quarter mile away.

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.510
They'd hear the sound of tanks.

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:45.550
And they even had
radio operators

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:49.450
who would be making fake
signals to sound like there

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:51.160
was a huge division there.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.310
And I talk about
this in the context

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:58.990
of when we are presenting
ourselves to others--

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:02.200
is it good to try and deceive?

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.000
This was effective
in World War II.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.320
But deceiving others
as to who you are

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.210
can be an effective
short-term strategy,

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.090
but it's usually not a very
effective long-term strategy.

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:14.886
SPEAKER 1: Especially if people
can read that this person is

00:19:14.886 --> 00:19:15.510
not the real deal.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.593
ERIC BARKER: Eventually,
you develop a reputation.

00:19:17.593 --> 00:19:21.050
Eventually, people
do see who you are.

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:23.627
And in terms of the
issue of ethics--

00:19:23.627 --> 00:19:25.210
so in the book, when
I talk about when

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.370
nice guys finish last.

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:31.750
That whole idea-- often
it's split into the issue

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:33.880
of short term versus long term.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:37.329
And a lot of
negative, bad traits

00:19:37.329 --> 00:19:38.870
are very effective
in the short term,

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:41.510
but they're not effective
in the long term.

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:44.230
So if you look at
narcissists, narcissists

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:47.890
do better in job interviews,
they do better on first dates.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:51.820
But what you see is after
a few weeks on the job,

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.890
narcissists are regarded
as untrustworthy.

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:57.320
After a few months, the
relationship partners

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.890
of narcissists report being
enormously dissatisfied.

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:04.780
It works very well up front,
not so well in the long term.

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.410
And across the
board, you see this

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:07.660
with a lot of negative traits.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.910
Short-term effectiveness,
long term not so much.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:13.434
If you're a used car dealer,
it might be a fantastic choice.

00:20:13.434 --> 00:20:15.100
But if you're working
in an organization

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.516
that you plan on being for a
number of years, probably not

00:20:17.516 --> 00:20:19.150
a good idea.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.370
SPEAKER 1: And going
back to World War II,

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:24.380
I was thinking about
unfiltered, filtered leaders.

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:28.060
Where would you
put Patton in that?

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.370
ERIC BARKER: I don't know
enough about my history

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.110
to talk about Patton.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.610
Sorry.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:33.480
SPEAKER 1: Gotcha.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.810
And I was thinking,
I was going to say

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:40.350
unfiltered because just the
way that he talked to people.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:44.500
And his troops respected him
but the upper brass hated him.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.770
And the German generals
used to call him that cowboy

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:50.710
American general who was crazy.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:52.610
But he seemed to be
that perfect general

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:55.420
we needed for that
situation, which was wartime.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.070
But then once the
peace happened,

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.624
it's like, where do you
put that unfiltered person

00:20:59.624 --> 00:21:01.540
in a filtered organization
that's so top down,

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:02.680
like the military?

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.138
ERIC BARKER: One
thing that you see

00:21:04.138 --> 00:21:05.770
that is critical
in terms of success

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:10.090
is the issue of people
usually discount context.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:12.550
People's first reaction
is, I'm successful,

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:15.410
I've been successful, I will
continue to be successful.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:18.260
And that's rarely the case.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:20.920
If you look at research
by Boris Groysberg,

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.540
at Harvard Business
School, you see

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.830
that when top stock market
analysts would leave one firm

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:32.260
and go to another firm, they
wouldn't stay top stock market

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:32.980
analysts.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:35.560
But if they brought
their team with them,

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.930
they usually stayed at
that high performing level.

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:39.580
Because again,
that context, that

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.542
shorthand that we develop with
others, that understanding,

00:21:42.542 --> 00:21:43.500
that's really critical.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:44.590
And that's when I
talk about the idea

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.320
of knowing yourself but then
also picking the right pond.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.500
That issue of your
skill set is great.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:53.260
But you can be the greatest
guitarist in the world--

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:56.660
if you work at an
accounting firm,

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.750
that's not very valuable there.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:03.080
So it's the skills you have,
and it's where are they?

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.320
Are those valuable
and respected there?

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.940
And it's aligning those two.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.101
So people have to
think about context.

00:22:09.101 --> 00:22:10.600
The other element
of context is when

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.310
you're talking about
the issue of ethics.

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:16.210
Where peer pressure influences
all of us not just teenagers.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.940
So if you're going
to a company--

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.391
Bob Sutton, who's a
professor at Stanford,

00:22:21.391 --> 00:22:23.890
when I talked to him he had a
great quote that I loved where

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.560
he said, whenever you
interview at a company,

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.692
look around at the
people who work there.

00:22:28.692 --> 00:22:30.400
Because you're going
to become like them,

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.440
they're not going
to become like you.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.430
And if that's not lined up, if
that's not who you want to be,

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.015
then you better really
make another choice.

00:22:39.015 --> 00:22:39.890
SPEAKER 1: It's true.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.930
Now there's timing
time to context, too.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:43.900
If you're a wonder kid--

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.815
could be possibly a
great software engineer,

00:22:45.815 --> 00:22:49.027
but you were born in
the 1940s or '30s.

00:22:49.027 --> 00:22:50.860
ERIC BARKER: I think
Malcolm Gladwell talked

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.830
about that in "Outliers,"
is that issue of timing.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:57.200
And also, where is
the organization

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.440
you're looking at working for?

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.060
They might need something
different at a different time.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.070
If a company is doing
fantastic, again, they

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:08.670
might need a filtered leader to
just keep it stable and steady.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:12.870
If you're in an
industry in decline,

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.780
what they're doing currently
obviously is not working.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:17.070
So they need to mix it up.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.090
They need an unfiltered leader.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:22.300
Because if you're headed
towards the ground anyway,

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.510
you might as well take
a change, take a risk,

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:27.930
and be able to pull out of
it versus just continuing

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:28.870
what isn't working.

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.626
SPEAKER 1: Gotcha.

00:23:30.626 --> 00:23:32.250
You mentioned a person
in San Francisco

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:37.770
called the Emperor Norton,
the defender of Mexico.

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:40.100
I've never heard of
this person ever before.

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.356
Can you talk about
that a little bit?

00:23:42.356 --> 00:23:46.680
ERIC BARKER: This was a guy in
San Francisco who became San

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.970
Francisco's unofficial mascot.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:54.900
Where he basically said that he
was the Emperor of the United

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:55.830
States.

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:59.760
And the people of San Francisco
at the time bought into it.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.360
And he would just walk
around, kind of declared.

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.320
The police all sort of
doffed their hats to him.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.240
He would get free
meals at restaurants.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.570
And he just was extremely
confident in there

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:13.710
but utterly deluded.

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.300
And I use that
story to illustrate

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.580
the issue of confidence.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:20.155
We talk about confidence
like it's this panacea.

00:24:20.155 --> 00:24:21.280
You got to have confidence.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:22.470
You can't be lack of confidence.

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:23.910
And there are downsides
to confidence.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:25.743
When you take confidence
out to the extreme,

00:24:25.743 --> 00:24:26.790
it can be delusional.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.740
It can lead to
narcissism or hubris.

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.960
You know confidence isn't
the answer to everything.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:36.047
And I use that to illustrate
when confidence goes too far.

00:24:36.047 --> 00:24:38.130
SPEAKER 1: And didn't he
write letters to Congress

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:39.480
saying I'm disbanding Congress?

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.688
ERIC BARKER: He made decrees.

00:24:40.688 --> 00:24:41.640
He made decrees.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.090
Some of which actually
worked out well.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.710
He was way ahead in
terms of diversity.

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:49.420
And he said there
should be a Bay Bridge

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.670
before there was a Bay Bridge.

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:53.100
And he had he had some really
good ideas, some of which

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:54.407
eventually got enacted.

00:24:54.407 --> 00:24:56.490
SPEAKER 1: I guess there
was a race riot happening

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.810
in San Francisco between
the white populace

00:24:58.810 --> 00:24:59.970
and the Chinese-Americans.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:03.360
He got in between it and
talked everyone down.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.250
ERIC BARKER: He was
involved in a lot,

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:07.940
although he didn't have
any real authority, some

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.660
of his predictions came true.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.860
SPEAKER 1: Fantastic.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:14.340
I'm going to go to some
audience questions now.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:17.070
Nassim Taleb wrote,
success isn't being on top

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.920
of a hierarchy.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.340
It's standing outside
of all hierarchies.

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:21.820
Given the focus on
promotion within

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.730
many corporate
environments, how do you

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:25.335
feel about this viewpoint?

00:25:29.707 --> 00:25:31.790
ERIC BARKER: I think it
depends on personal goals.

00:25:31.790 --> 00:25:36.290
I think most people are going to
work inside of an organization.

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:40.970
And it depends on what are
your skills, if your skills are

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:42.300
drawing people together.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.260
We're seeing increasingly people
are able to work on their own.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.180
They're able to do
their own thing.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.760
But most people are going
to work for organizations.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.790
And so I don't think
that's the only way.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:55.280
SPEAKER 1: Gotcha.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.420
Can talk about Tim
Kreider's stabaversary.

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.612
ERIC BARKER: Yeah.

00:26:01.612 --> 00:26:04.520
Tim Kreider, a
cartoonist, and when

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.100
he was on vacation in Greece
he was actually stabbed

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.720
in the neck and almost died.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.860
He described it as there's
a difference of about one

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:16.460
millimeter between him
going home in coach

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.640
and him going home
in the cargo hold.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:24.200
And the thing was, when he
came home, for the next year,

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:29.000
he was basically incapable
of being sad or disappointed

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.300
because he was just so
thrilled to be alive.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.280
He was so happy
because everything was

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.160
compared to I could be dead.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.370
But after a year, things
started to frustrate him again.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.619
He started to get sad again.

00:26:42.619 --> 00:26:43.910
You can't sustain that forever.

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:46.550
So he started celebrating
his stabaversary,

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:50.660
the day when he got stabbed,
to kind of remind him, hey, I'm

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.040
lucky to be here.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.499
Hey, this is really great
that I have any opportunity.

00:26:54.499 --> 00:26:55.790
Bad things are going to happen.

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.998
I'm not going to be thrilled
about them all the time.

00:26:57.998 --> 00:26:59.900
But I'm lucky to be here at all.

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:02.090
And that's something
we can all learn

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:04.360
from in terms of happiness.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.622
SPEAKER 1: That's
a really good idea.

00:27:06.622 --> 00:27:08.330
Hopefully, not to get
stabbed to do that.

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:09.280
ERIC BARKER: No.

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.321
You could skip that part.

00:27:12.526 --> 00:27:14.900
SPEAKER 1: So how do we go
about finding the right ponds?

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.454
I think a lot of
introspection, or you

00:27:16.454 --> 00:27:18.120
need to go out there
and get experience.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.630
What would be the best way?

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.730
ERIC BARKER: The best
thing, first and foremost,

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:26.810
is to let other people
do the work for you.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:29.430
Hey, going out there, we
can each only do so much.

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:31.520
But you can read online
and then pass that.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.410
You can talk to people.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:34.970
But first, getting
to know yourself,

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:36.230
getting to know your
signature strengths.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:38.036
It's like, what am I
consistently good at?

00:27:38.036 --> 00:27:39.410
And the research
shows a good way

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:42.440
to go about that is actually
to ask people around you.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:46.200
Because when people ask
themselves, what am I good at?

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.780
They're actually
quite bad at it.

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.270
People are not
always good at that.

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:51.728
But when you ask your friends,
when you ask your coworkers,

00:27:51.728 --> 00:27:54.740
preferably, if you
could do it anonymously,

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.920
if you can have them
kind of submit to it.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.414
Have a friend filter them
for you so it's anonymous.

00:28:00.414 --> 00:28:02.330
You can get some much
more objective feedback.

00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:03.913
And it turns out
that people around us

00:28:03.913 --> 00:28:07.847
often know our strengths and our
weaknesses better than we do.

00:28:07.847 --> 00:28:09.680
And then something that
Gautam Mukunda talks

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.640
about called intensifiers,
which are qualities that,

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:17.000
at the mean, are not
necessarily positive,

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.890
but in the right context can be.

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.639
So in other words, you might
be somebody who's stubborn.

00:28:21.639 --> 00:28:23.180
Well, in interpersonal
relationships,

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.600
stubbornness is a negative.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.470
If you're an entrepreneur,
stubbornness is persistence.

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:29.769
So those qualities are
dependent on context.

00:28:29.769 --> 00:28:31.310
Knowing what your
signature strengths

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.610
are, knowing what your
intensifiers are--

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:36.740
if you don't have that,
then looking at environments

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.190
isn't going to be very helpful.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:39.370
You need to say,
what am I good at?

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:40.078
What am I bad at?

00:28:40.078 --> 00:28:44.830
And what qualities do I have
that, dependent on context,

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.640
might be positives or negatives?

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.490
And then you can start
to look at what interests

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:51.770
you, what is aligned
with your skill set.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.270
You can do a lot
of research online.

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.370
But in the end, you
want to get to a point

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:56.760
where you're talking to people.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.404
Because in the end,
it's going to be

00:28:58.404 --> 00:29:00.320
hard to get an honest
answer about the culture

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.160
of an organization.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.870
Going back to that
Bob Sutton quote on

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:04.070
"you're going to become
like those people,

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.570
they're not going
to become like you."

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:07.611
You need to talk to people
who have worked there,

00:29:07.611 --> 00:29:11.510
who are working there to
get an idea of if that's

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:14.336
going to be a good fit, if
that is the right pond for you.

00:29:14.336 --> 00:29:16.460
SPEAKER 1: What I usually
tell new college grads is

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:20.510
when you are looking to
learn about a new career is

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:22.424
to go talk to someone
who is working at NASA.

00:29:22.424 --> 00:29:24.340
What are the three best
things about this job?

00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.775
And then what are the three
things that need improvement

00:29:25.775 --> 00:29:26.775
and that you don't like?

00:29:26.775 --> 00:29:29.040
So you can kind of hear
an even keeled take

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.690
on what's going on
in the organization.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:34.820
I have Glenn Gould in here.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.470
So can you tell us
about Glenn Gould?

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:37.220
ERIC BARKER: Yeah.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:41.030
Glenn Gould was considered
one of the greatest

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:44.420
pianists of the 20th century.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:49.100
But he's a very strange
guy, a very, very odd guy.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.130
And had a lot of crazy quirks.

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.857
He would always wear gloves,
sometimes multiple pairs

00:29:54.857 --> 00:29:55.565
at the same time.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:03.350
He had this crazy chair that he
used at every performance that

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:04.945
was like sloped and low.

00:30:04.945 --> 00:30:06.320
You can actually
hear it creaking

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.310
on the recordings of it.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:11.510
But this was a guy who
was so odd and so strange,

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:15.701
but there's so many environments
he never would have fit in.

00:30:15.701 --> 00:30:16.950
He never would have been fine.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:20.960
But finding his thing,
playing the piano,

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.480
and finding the
right environment,

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:27.080
he's achieved the
highest level that you

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.010
can in terms of celebrity.

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:31.700
He was mentioned
in "The Simpsons."

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:32.570
So that's it.

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:33.800
That's the highest level.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:34.880
He's done that.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.963
He's considered one of the
greatest pianists ever.

00:30:36.963 --> 00:30:38.250
But he's this oddball.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:41.540
But he found the right
environment for him.

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.490
And that's what makes
all the difference.

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:45.031
A lot of people have
a lot of skills.

00:30:45.031 --> 00:30:47.780
But if it's not aligned,
it's not going to work.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.910
SPEAKER 1: One thing
I see a lot is people

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:53.387
who are just fantastic
in their line of work,

00:30:53.387 --> 00:30:54.845
but they want to
try something new.

00:30:54.845 --> 00:30:58.360
But they're afraid of getting
started, because it's not

00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.570
going to be perfect.

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:00.470
And I think in
your book you talk

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:02.420
about it's more about the
quantity of production,

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:03.920
less about just producing
one great thing.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.060
Can you talk more about that?

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:06.601
ERIC BARKER: You
see across the board

00:31:06.601 --> 00:31:10.860
that very often quantity
produces quality.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:13.370
The research on
patent applications--

00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:15.350
the people who submit
more patent applications

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:17.090
end up getting more patents.

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:20.000
When you look at
scientific research,

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.220
the researchers who
produce the most papers

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:26.000
usually end up with the
handful that are great.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.094
So people who are
more prolific--

00:31:29.094 --> 00:31:31.010
ceteris paribus-- people
who are more prolific

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:33.050
end up producing
more great stuff.

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:35.840
So you have to take chances.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.930
You have to give
things a shot and just

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:42.680
do more to get out there.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.420
Sometimes there's
a cost to that.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:47.750
But if there isn't, if you
can just put in the hours,

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:48.350
more work.

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:50.960
And that, of course, leads to
the work-life balance problem,

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:55.850
where doing more
does produce results.

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:58.460
So you have to
know when to stop.

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.610
Because-- ceteris paribus--

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:04.340
more work, more results.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.120
You also want to have a
personal life as well.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.296
SPEAKER 1: How do you find
that balance yourself?

00:32:10.296 --> 00:32:12.170
ERIC BARKER: That's one
that I struggle with.

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:16.520
But in the end, as I
talk about in the book,

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:19.021
the issue is, in the
modern era, we talk

00:32:19.021 --> 00:32:20.270
about work-life balance a lot.

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:21.832
Nobody did 40, 50 years ago.

00:32:21.832 --> 00:32:23.540
And that's because
the world has changed.

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:27.650
Because now you have your
smartphone in your pocket 24/7.

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:31.290
You can't say, oh, I left
those papers at the office.

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:34.070
I'll get them for you
tomorrow at 9:00 AM.

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:36.050
No, they're available
currently in the cloud.

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:37.758
You can check your
email wherever you go.

00:32:37.758 --> 00:32:40.040
You always have
the option to work.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.070
Before, the doors of the
office closed at 5:00 PM.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:44.060
Now they don't.

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:47.690
So basically, the onus
has shifted to us where

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:49.760
we need to make a decision.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.500
And that's what's critical.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:55.490
So for everyone, the
idea of this go, go, go,

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:57.770
success as determined
outside yourself

00:32:57.770 --> 00:32:59.780
is going to be
inherently problematic.

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.610
You need a personal
definition of success,

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:02.990
where you're saying, I'm
going to work this hard.

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:04.823
And if that means I
don't get the promotion,

00:33:04.823 --> 00:33:05.870
I'm OK with that.

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:08.480
Or I want that
promotion, and if that

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.420
means I spend less time with
my family, I'm OK with that.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.330
But the decision has to be
based on a personal definition

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:14.840
of success.

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.980
What you want.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.260
Because the world is not
going to decide for you.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.297
The world is going
to say, keep going,

00:33:20.297 --> 00:33:21.380
keep going until you drop.

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.100
SPEAKER 1: And this
goes into your point

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.351
of choosing your problems.

00:33:23.351 --> 00:33:24.100
ERIC BARKER: Yeah.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.840
It's choosing the
problems you want to have,

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.645
where it's am I more
comfortable sacrificing

00:33:30.645 --> 00:33:31.760
a bit of my social life?

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.950
Am I more comfortable not
getting that promotion at work?

00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:39.940
But the research that was done--

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.930
I think it was Stevenson
and Nash at Harvard

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:42.720
did some research.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.300
And the people who
had gotten closest

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:47.210
to some approximation
of work-life balance

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:50.040
had four metrics that
they value their life by.

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.510
And that was happiness,
achievement, significance,

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:54.500
and legacy.

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.990
Because the problem that
most people do is they

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:58.730
use a single metric.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:01.630
And often that single
metric is money.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:03.380
Because it's a number,
and it's made easy.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.657
Make that go up.

00:34:04.657 --> 00:34:06.740
But then you end up
sacrificing happiness, health,

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:08.610
relationships, all
these other things.

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:11.510
So you need this
balance of the four.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:13.330
Happiness-- do you
enjoy what you're doing?

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:15.413
Achievement-- are you
getting ahead in your goals?

00:34:15.413 --> 00:34:19.100
Significance-- is what you're
doing positively affecting

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.717
those around you that you love?

00:34:20.717 --> 00:34:23.300
And legacy-- to some degree, are
you making the world a better

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:23.980
place?

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.449
And people who, if you look
at your schedule and you say,

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:29.210
I'm making a little deposit in
each one of those four buckets

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:31.580
every week, every
month, that's where

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.110
people start to find a balance.

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:36.440
Because the problem is when they
use that collapsing one metric,

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:37.880
you miss stuff.

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.460
Or if people try and use
a sequencing strategy,

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:43.400
where when I'm this I'm just
going to focus on my career.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.290
And then I'm just
going to focus on that.

00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:47.120
And life doesn't
work out like that.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.618
It's like relationships.

00:34:48.618 --> 00:34:50.659
You can't ignore your kids
for the first 10 years

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:52.250
and then make up for it.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:53.150
That doesn't work.

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:56.110
So people need to balance
happiness, achievement,

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:57.180
significance, and legacy.

00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:58.490
SPEAKER 1: It's nice
having those four metrics,

00:34:58.490 --> 00:34:59.900
because you can see
when you're putting too

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.100
much time in a certain bucket.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:01.850
ERIC BARKER: Yeah.

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.490
This one's getting way
too much on happiness,

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:06.020
and you just got fired.

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.180
Or way too much of
achievement and you're

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:09.500
really kind of miserable.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.800
Or you're working hard.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.940
You might be happy, but is that
benefiting those around you?

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.912
There are things we need to
try and find a balance for.

00:35:19.912 --> 00:35:21.870
Each person's balance is
going to be different.

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:26.030
But over time, you can start
to see what works for you.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:29.230
SPEAKER 1: I had a mentor who
marched with Dr. Martin Luther

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:30.370
King when he was little.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:35.750
And then he got into
IBM, and his mentor

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:36.684
was African-American.

00:35:36.684 --> 00:35:37.600
He's African-American.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:42.670
And his mentor had a door closed
on him because he's black.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:46.240
And he talked to my
mentor and told him

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.780
what to do to pursue his
career and go forward.

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.885
But my mentor focused so much
just on that career metric

00:35:52.885 --> 00:35:55.210
that so long as this
company was happy with him

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:56.140
everything is OK.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:59.110
But then when you come home,
the family is not there,

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:01.360
and he's missed out on some
of the most important life

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.070
experiences just because
he's focused on one thing.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.370
So it's very easy to focus
on something external

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:07.625
because it's easily definable.

00:36:07.625 --> 00:36:12.160
But trying to define what an
ideal inner balance or family

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.827
life is is a little bit more
subject to interpretation.

00:36:14.827 --> 00:36:15.660
ERIC BARKER: Oh, no.

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:17.799
In the book I tell the
story of Ted Williams,

00:36:17.799 --> 00:36:19.840
one of the greatest baseball
players of all time.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:24.700
He was just so
focused on hitting,

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.190
so focused on
success in baseball,

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:29.950
that he wasn't present for
the birth of any of his three

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:30.850
children.

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:34.600
When his daughter asked him,
dad, tell me about yourself,

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.820
he said, read my biography.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:41.030
And he realized he
just wasn't there.

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:42.160
And he wasn't very happy.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.570
And he got divorced three times.

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:48.430
And he paid huge
prices for his success.

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:52.240
And I think that's
something that at first it

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:56.020
seems like he would be this
great legendary baseball

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:56.990
player at Cooperstown.

00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:59.380
But in the end, is
that going to lead

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.600
to a happy, well-rounded life?

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:06.550
Consistently you see that
many, many high achievers

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:09.070
make a Faustian bargain of
sorts, where they completely

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:12.126
sacrifice their personal
life and personal happiness

00:37:12.126 --> 00:37:12.625
for success.

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:20.770
And again, if more work
produces more results,

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:22.930
then you have to
make the choice.

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:24.100
Where am I going to stop?

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.410
Because it won't
be decided for you.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:28.890
SPEAKER 1: It's so
hard to get out on top.

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:31.060
So many people want to
continually ride that high

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:32.776
and relive their past dreams.

00:37:32.776 --> 00:37:34.900
And then once you get that
Super Bowl championship,

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.608
or what you're looking
for it's like, OK,

00:37:36.608 --> 00:37:38.834
that's another thing off
the list I cross out.

00:37:38.834 --> 00:37:40.750
But now it has not much
meaning in the present

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:41.794
or in the future.

00:37:41.794 --> 00:37:42.460
ERIC BARKER: No.

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:46.290
So it's critical to have
that personal definition,

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:48.095
where this is enough for me.

00:37:48.095 --> 00:37:49.345
SPEAKER 1: We have a question.

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:53.830
Ellen asks, you
mention in your book

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:56.170
that overconfidence can
be incredibly damaging

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:57.544
to an organization.

00:37:57.544 --> 00:37:58.960
What are some
tactics to recognize

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:04.644
this in ourselves and ways
to change it if it's present?

00:38:04.644 --> 00:38:06.310
ERIC BARKER: The issue
of overconfidence

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:07.101
is really critical.

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.370
I think Malcolm Gladwell
talked about this in a lecture

00:38:12.370 --> 00:38:14.380
he gave.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:18.100
Underconfidence is the
sins of the amateur.

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.240
Overconfidence is the
sin of the expert.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.870
So the real danger comes
from overconfidence,

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:27.190
because we trust experts
with a lot of power.

00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:31.330
So overconfidence is what
produces a housing crisis

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:33.760
or a stock market
collapse, because it's

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:36.970
the people who have the
authority, who have the power.

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:40.390
That's what they usually
make the mistake of.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:42.250
One of the best things
in terms of limiting

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:45.792
that on a personal basis is--

00:38:45.792 --> 00:38:47.500
A, making sure you
have people around you

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.791
that you're still listening to.

00:38:48.791 --> 00:38:53.170
Even Machiavelli, who is not
lauded very highly in ethics

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:55.510
circles, said that
a great leader

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:58.660
has to have people around him
who will be honest with him,

00:38:58.660 --> 00:38:59.830
who he can trust.

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:03.910
Because otherwise you're
going to spin out of control.

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:05.950
You need people who
will be honest with you.

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:07.690
But past that,
something you can do--

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:09.610
Peter Drucker, one of
the leading management

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:11.080
experts of the
20th century, he'll

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.300
talk about the
feedback analysis.

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.940
Where basically when
you're making predictions,

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:18.100
write them down when
you're trying things.

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:21.160
And then see how effective
your predictions were.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.860
See when you say this
project is going to go well--

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.220
I'm not sure about this one.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:28.300
And then you can start to
get an idea over time--

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.850
how accurate am I?

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:33.850
Because that's the problem
with too much confidence

00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:36.070
is the issue of delusion,
where you're not

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:37.760
in touch with reality anymore.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.730
As I mentioned in the
book, the old saying,

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:43.390
there's no such thing as a
pretty good alligator wrestler.

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:45.160
You are or you aren't.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.370
And that's where
overconfidence gets you killed.

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:50.680
But there's usually not such
an obvious corrective mechanism

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:54.111
as there is in alligator
wrestling in day-to-day life.

00:39:54.111 --> 00:39:56.360
SPEAKER 1: I like that idea
of tracking your thoughts.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:58.741
So here's a challenge
to the audience.

00:39:58.741 --> 00:40:01.240
Any time you're going into a
situation where it's ambiguous,

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:04.290
you don't know what's going to
happen, open up a spreadsheet

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:07.275
and write what you think
is going to happen.

00:40:07.275 --> 00:40:09.775
Or write in the situation what
you think is going to happen.

00:40:09.775 --> 00:40:12.040
And after the situation
happens, write down

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.080
exactly what happened.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.329
And then go back to that list.

00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:16.127
And you can kind of
see where your thoughts

00:40:16.127 --> 00:40:16.960
are gearing towards.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.150
So my thoughts
sometimes would gear

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.790
towards more pessimism
for certain meetings,

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:23.674
or more optimism
at other meetings.

00:40:23.674 --> 00:40:25.840
And then when you get back
in the situation of being

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.790
ambiguous, you can
go, oh, wait a minute,

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:29.950
my mind tends to go
in this default mode.

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:32.160
Maybe there's something
else I'm missing here.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.660
So that you can catch yourself
when you get yourself locked

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:34.744
in those thought patterns.

00:40:34.744 --> 00:40:36.160
ERIC BARKER: And
you'll be shocked

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.690
to see how much you
rewrite history.

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:40.840
When you go back and see what
you wrote you'll be like,

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:44.740
that's not the story
I've been telling myself.

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:49.720
Memory is not this perfect hard
drive recording everything.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:51.580
It's constantly being rewritten.

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:53.989
And you will be shocked
at what you wrote then

00:40:53.989 --> 00:40:55.030
and what you believe now.

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:56.710
So it's actually a
really useful exercise.

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:58.570
SPEAKER 1: I had my
old journals from 2008.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:40:59.230
And I was reading them.

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.688
I'm like, I don't
know who the hell

00:41:00.688 --> 00:41:02.259
this guy is but I hate him.

00:41:02.259 --> 00:41:04.300
Compared to then, I was
reading the current ones.

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.200
Like, oh, that's me.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.480
But to see your thoughts evolved
over time, you're like, OK,

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.080
you can see the improvement
in what you're skewed towards.

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:16.750
So I have someone asking, how
to be a super connector myself?

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:19.480
How can someone go about
becoming a super connector?

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.490
ERIC BARKER: The
critical thing there is--

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:25.750
I think it was Ben Casnocha
had some really good advice.

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:32.080
Basically is budgeting time
and money for networking

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.730
is taking an amount of time.

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:36.980
Because if you say
I'm going to devote

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.920
this many hours
towards it, make it

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.547
a skill, something you
practice like anything else.

00:41:41.547 --> 00:41:43.630
I am always going to be
looking for introductions.

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:47.920
And I am going to
designate this many hours.

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:50.710
Every Sunday lunch is going
to be with somebody new.

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:52.360
And I am going to
put aside x amount

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.870
of money for Sunday lunch.

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:55.690
Or how many coffees?

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:59.260
I am going to have a coffee or
drinks with somebody two nights

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:00.310
a week.

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:02.560
Budget it, make it a
part of your schedule,

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.240
and start to put that together.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.102
And then past that,
it's always a matter

00:42:07.102 --> 00:42:08.560
of every time you
meet somebody see

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.750
who they can introduce you to.

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:12.790
Who else should I talk to?

00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:14.290
Who else should I meet?

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:18.520
And then to create a more
powerful network all around

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:20.542
is start mixing and matching.

00:42:20.542 --> 00:42:22.750
Start introducing new people
you've met to the people

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:23.950
you knew before.

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:27.910
And the opportunities will
start to multiply like a fission

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:28.540
reactor.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.730
It's just going to
start to expand.

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:33.850
But the first critical thing
is just like anything else--

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:36.430
give it dedicated
time, dedicated budget,

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:37.282
and be consistent.

00:42:37.282 --> 00:42:38.240
SPEAKER 1: Makes sense.

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:39.948
And there's two other
points you had too.

00:42:39.948 --> 00:42:42.211
One was saying thank you
and having that gratitude.

00:42:42.211 --> 00:42:43.710
Because the gratitude,
we look at it

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:45.970
as one way of making
someone else feel better.

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:47.790
But then, I think, some of the
studies you had in the book

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:49.630
said that there's always
biological benefits

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:51.166
to the person saying thanks.

00:42:51.166 --> 00:42:52.790
ERIC BARKER: Gratitude
works both ways.

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:53.890
The best thing about--

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:56.200
when I'm talking
about happiness,

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:59.500
what's great about gratitude
is it makes two people happy.

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.630
Thanking someone else
makes them feel good.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:08.460
But also, taking the time
to be grateful for things

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:09.690
keeps that top of mind.

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:11.490
What is most advertising
trying to do?

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:13.740
They're trying to make their
products or their company

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:14.440
top of mind.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.780
That's why you see so
many ads over and over

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.905
and over again just so that
when you think of soda,

00:43:17.905 --> 00:43:20.040
you think of Pepsi
or you think of Coke.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.460
They want to stay top of mind.

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:24.000
Well, one of the most powerful
and replicated happiness

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.851
studies is writing
down three good things

00:43:25.851 --> 00:43:28.350
that happened to you that day
before you go to bed at night.

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:29.310
Why?

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:32.700
Because it makes them
more top of mind.

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:34.560
Tons of good things
happen to you every day.

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:36.910
Tons of bad things
happen to you every day.

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:38.880
So you can only
focus on so much.

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.914
You only have so much
bandwidth in your head.

00:43:40.914 --> 00:43:42.330
So what's going
to be top of mind?

00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:44.190
What are you going
to remember that day?

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:45.670
What are you going to
remember from that day?

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:47.700
And if you take the time
with those three things,

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:48.825
you're going to be happier.

00:43:48.825 --> 00:43:53.754
So gratitude, Shawn Achor,
one thing he recommends,

00:43:53.754 --> 00:43:55.170
is the first thing
you do when you

00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:56.628
get in the office
every day is just

00:43:56.628 --> 00:43:58.140
sit down and write
a thank you email

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.250
or send a thank you
text to someone else.

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:01.350
It'll make them feel good.

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:02.550
It'll make you feel good.

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:04.730
And how you feel in the
morning, the research shows,

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:06.470
affects the rest of your day.

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:08.880
It's a very simple
happiness exercise

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.610
and critical for
connecting with people.

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:13.840
Showing them that they
are valuable to you.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.090
SPEAKER 1: I have a calendar
reminder for every Friday

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:17.470
to send out a thank
you to somebody.

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:18.115
ERIC BARKER: Absolutely.

00:44:18.115 --> 00:44:19.906
SPEAKER 1: And another
point you brought up

00:44:19.906 --> 00:44:21.079
is doing your homework.

00:44:21.079 --> 00:44:22.620
After someone gives
you an assignment

00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:24.510
for connecting with
them, actually coming

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:26.290
back full circle
and saying, hey, you

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:27.330
told me to do this and whatnot.

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:28.413
ERIC BARKER: Following up.

00:44:28.413 --> 00:44:29.790
That's critical with mentors.

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:32.474
Because there's nothing that's
going to irritate mentors

00:44:32.474 --> 00:44:34.140
more than when they
give you good advice

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:36.090
and you don't actually
follow through with it.

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:39.720
So listening to
what a mentor says,

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.540
it also allows you to stay
in touch with the mentor.

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:44.634
Because if the mentor is
actually really valuable,

00:44:44.634 --> 00:44:46.050
they're probably
going to be busy.

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:47.670
You hope they're
going to be busy.

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:49.170
They've got a lot
of stuff going on.

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:51.377
So they give you advice,
you go, you follow through

00:44:51.377 --> 00:44:51.960
on the advice.

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.550
You get the result,
you come back.

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:55.883
Now you can say, hey, I
followed through on your advice,

00:44:55.883 --> 00:44:56.850
here are the results.

00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:58.660
I'm thinking about
what I should do next.

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:00.220
I've put some thought into it.

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:01.262
Here's two possibilities.

00:45:01.262 --> 00:45:02.844
If you have a chance,
I'd love to hear

00:45:02.844 --> 00:45:05.280
what you think would be a
best and next step for me.

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.260
That's a great way to
keep a relationship

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:09.210
with a mentor going.

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:12.655
And it's flattering to them that
somebody is taking their advice

00:45:12.655 --> 00:45:14.280
and actually following
through with it.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.180
It sounds simple.

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:16.260
It sounds stupid.

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:19.810
But the truth is so
many people just don't.

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:22.890
They'll bother a busy
person, ask him a question,

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:23.940
and then not do it.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:26.760
If you did and you document
it, you got positive results.

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.670
And then you're asking their
advice, that's the thing.

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:32.370
And if you're somebody
who does their homework--

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:35.820
So many people, so many
busy, successful people,

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.950
it's like they get people
clamoring for their time,

00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:39.199
but they don't follow through.

00:45:39.199 --> 00:45:40.851
Those people didn't
do their homework.

00:45:40.851 --> 00:45:42.600
You don't need to ask
the head-- if you're

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:43.620
looking for
investment advice, you

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.960
don't need to contact
the CEO of Goldman Sachs.

00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.550
There's easier ways to do it.

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:49.070
So you want to make sure you're
asking the right questions.

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:50.111
Did you do your homework?

00:45:50.111 --> 00:45:52.800
Is this the person you have
to talk to to get the answer?

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:56.750
If you've done that much work,
you're going to impress people.

00:45:56.750 --> 00:46:00.450
You're going to stand out
above the other 99.9% of people

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:01.800
who reach out to them.

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:03.606
So following through,
doing your homework,

00:46:03.606 --> 00:46:04.980
it really makes
a difference when

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:06.440
you're trying to
make relationships

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:08.305
with potential mentors.

00:46:08.305 --> 00:46:09.930
SPEAKER 1: And then,
also, these people

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:12.450
have busy family lives
with their careers.

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:15.340
If someone comes up
to you and says, hey,

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:17.230
can you be my mentor?

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:19.740
Well, I'm thinking of a
terribly long time commitment

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.300
that person does not have.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.130
So I always looked
at it as friendships.

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:26.265
It's like maybe I can
research as much as

00:46:26.265 --> 00:46:27.890
possible of this
person on the internet

00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:28.889
without being a stalker.

00:46:28.889 --> 00:46:30.630
But going on their
blog, learning.

00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:32.310
And then if I have a question
that can't be answered,

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:34.020
make sure it's something that
can be answered within five

00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:36.850
minutes and doesn't require them
to write their life story out.

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:37.060
ERIC BARKER: No.

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.518
And what you see
in the research is

00:46:38.518 --> 00:46:40.140
that the best
mentor relationships

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.580
become like friendships.

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.995
But asking that, will
you be my mentor?

00:46:43.995 --> 00:46:45.370
It's kind of like
asking somebody

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:47.940
to marry you on the first date.

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.830
That's a huge
commitment to somebody

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:51.900
who just emailed me and
asked me a question.

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:55.020
And they had like six
spelling errors in the email.

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:59.252
Versus asking questions,
showing you did the work,

00:46:59.252 --> 00:47:00.960
showing that you're
somebody who's smart,

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.600
and showing them that
they are the right person

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:04.890
to ask that question to.

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:07.560
But there is no other way.

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.090
I want to be this level of Jedi.

00:47:09.090 --> 00:47:11.450
I got to talk to Yoda.

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:12.990
They're the perfect
person for this.

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:13.790
That's respectful.

00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:15.440
You're respecting their time.

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.384
You are not putting
all the effort on them.

00:47:17.384 --> 00:47:19.800
This is not something that can
be answered with one Google

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.550
search.

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:24.000
It's like this is something
that shows them that you

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.856
are an A player like they are.

00:47:25.856 --> 00:47:27.480
You're trying to get
to the next level,

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:29.188
and they are the right
person to talk to.

00:47:29.188 --> 00:47:30.940
And that's how you
get a good mentor.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:31.420
SPEAKER 1: That's true.

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.836
And then, also,
the introductions,

00:47:32.836 --> 00:47:34.530
the double opt-in introduction.

00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:36.399
First, I would go to Eric.

00:47:36.399 --> 00:47:38.440
Because, let's say, I want
Eric to talk to Brian.

00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.690
And then Brian's good for Eric.

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:41.920
First, I'll go to Eric, ask if
he's OK with the introduction.

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.760
Then I'll go back to
Brian, explain to him

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.310
why it's beneficial
to meet Eric.

00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:46.920
And if he agrees, I'll
introduce them both.

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:48.878
Because I'm sure you get
a lot of introductions

00:47:48.878 --> 00:47:50.400
where it's like--

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.469
ERIC BARKER: Hey, here's
somebody you really

00:47:52.469 --> 00:47:53.760
have no interest in talking to.

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.057
Why don't you guys chat?

00:47:55.057 --> 00:47:55.971
No.

00:47:55.971 --> 00:47:56.820
How about we don't.

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:02.760
SPEAKER 1: So for my last online
question, this is from Lisa.

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.197
She says, there's a lot of
information in your book

00:48:05.197 --> 00:48:07.030
and a lot of information
to learn and retain

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:08.180
to day-to-day life.

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:13.070
In your opinion, how should
we retain all this information

00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:16.400
and how much of it?

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.520
ERIC BARKER: I don't
think that everybody needs

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.010
to learn everything in there.

00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:24.500
I think there's areas
we're they're strong.

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.295
There's areas
where they're weak.

00:48:26.295 --> 00:48:28.730
Some people might be
in a great situation

00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:32.660
in terms of the nice
guys finish last issue.

00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:34.360
They might be
surrounded by other--

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:35.735
in Adam Grant's
terminology, they

00:48:35.735 --> 00:48:37.360
might be surrounded
about other givers.

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.450
Might be a good place.

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:39.770
That might not be something
they're worried about.

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:40.700
But they might
have a big problem

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.080
with the work-life
balance issue.

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:46.250
Or somebody might be
really great at networking,

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:48.350
but they might have a
real confidence issue.

00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:51.830
Focus on the stuff that is going
to benefit them individually.

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:53.030
Like what goals do you have?

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:54.710
What serves those goals?

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:57.290
Don't try and do everything.

00:48:57.290 --> 00:49:00.380
Pick one thing, get that
right, and then move on

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.360
to what is of
secondary interest.

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:06.290
So there's no need
to exhaustively go

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:08.510
through every piece
of advice in there.

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:09.510
SPEAKER 1: Excellent.

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:13.670
Do we have you
in-audience questions?

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:17.090
We're going to get
you a mic real quick.

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:20.700
AUDIENCE: I also wrote a book
on the science of success.

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:26.210
And I was completely
shocked, because I

00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:28.610
had read hundreds
of books talking

00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:32.300
about positive mental attitude,
mostly written by armchair

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:35.090
plagiarists quoting
each other, and doing

00:49:35.090 --> 00:49:37.340
a lot of scientific research.

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:39.140
But the scientific
research was always

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:43.279
with slightly above
average people.

00:49:43.279 --> 00:49:45.820
Because you can't go out and
get the number one in the world.

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:46.850
It's really hard.

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:49.750
Say, hey, I'm going to follow
you around with videotape.

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:51.410
But I did that.

00:49:51.410 --> 00:49:54.910
And I was blown away
that in sales, at least,

00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:58.070
the number one in corporate
jets and the number one life

00:49:58.070 --> 00:50:00.210
insurance sales
person in the world

00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:04.730
were the most negative people
I've ever met in my life.

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:08.660
They beat up on
themselves verbally.

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:14.000
And then I contrasted that with
homeless people, who would say,

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.920
I'm happy, I'm always happy.

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:18.620
I'm living in this cardboard
box, but I'm happy.

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:23.540
So I was completely shocked
because this defied everything

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:25.320
I've been reading everywhere.

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.020
And I was expecting
to hear more of that

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:31.610
here, because you said
that everything that's

00:50:31.610 --> 00:50:36.510
contrary to what you
normally hear in science.

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:39.367
And so what these
people would do--

00:50:39.367 --> 00:50:40.950
and they're number
one in their field.

00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:43.000
One of them is number
one in life insurance.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.590
He'd sell $4.5 million
selling two days a week.

00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:48.980
So he'd meet the Million Dollar
Round Table every two days.

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.800
Credible, worldwide number one.

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:55.130
He would beat up on
himself verbally.

00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:58.310
He would tell himself
negative things.

00:50:58.310 --> 00:50:59.900
I'm doing terrible today.

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:03.530
I need to push myself harder.

00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:05.630
Harvey, you did a terrible job.

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:07.160
Why are you doing this?

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.350
And he'd beat up on him so.

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:11.810
So it was completely the
opposite of everything

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:15.360
I ever heard in all of
the literature out there.

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:18.510
But these were the number
one people in their field.

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:20.480
Any comments?

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.702
ERIC BARKER: There are
exceptions to every rule.

00:51:22.702 --> 00:51:24.160
There are exceptions
to every rule.

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:26.750
AUDIENCE: Here's
another question.

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:29.930
How many of the success
books out there actually are

00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:33.380
able to get the number
one person in the world

00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:36.950
and follow them around with
cameras, and videotape, et

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:39.420
cetera?

00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:44.090
Scientific studies, if you
look at them, other than Xerox

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:46.190
professional selling
skills, which

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:50.360
studied slightly above average
people, but not the very best.

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:52.812
None of them, at least
in the field of sales,

00:51:52.812 --> 00:51:55.370
had actually gone out and
followed around number one

00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:56.100
people.

00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:57.820
None of them because
they can't get them.

00:51:57.820 --> 00:51:59.900
They're impossible.

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:05.380
So I think a lot of what is
reported in success literature

00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:08.650
is the average people or
the slightly above average.

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:13.240
And it's a lot of researchers
quoting each other and others'

00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:13.960
research.

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:19.200
And quoting and doing
research of groups

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:25.220
that are below average,
or medium, or mediocre,

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:26.830
but not the very best.

00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:29.950
How many actually go out and
study number one in the world?

00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:33.650
ERIC BARKER: There are
a number of studies

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:36.020
that looked at some of the
top people in the world.

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:39.880
But it depends
specifically on what's

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:43.130
your question in terms of
their attitude, in terms of--

00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:44.620
again, there's success.

00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:46.240
There's also happiness.

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.650
Those can be very different.

00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:51.730
And attitudes do vary
based on profession.

00:52:51.730 --> 00:52:57.460
So being optimistic produces
persistence, produces grit.

00:52:57.460 --> 00:53:00.220
That doesn't necessarily
mean-- again,

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.530
if it's in an industry
that is doomed,

00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:06.230
persistence is not going
to result in success.

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:09.430
So I think it has to be
very specific on what

00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:10.730
you are studying.

00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:14.110
If you look at attorneys,
attorneys usually

00:53:14.110 --> 00:53:18.040
score far higher on
pessimism and negativity

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:19.390
than most other people.

00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:23.110
It is because it is a
beneficial quality in law.

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:25.630
Because you need, when
you're doing a contract,

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:28.750
to consider everything that
could go wrong and make sure

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:30.550
your client is covered for that.

00:53:30.550 --> 00:53:32.980
So pessimism is a benefit.

00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:35.260
And if you score
higher in pessimism,

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:38.210
you score higher on the
LSAT across the board.

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:42.220
So entrepreneurs,
as well, negativity

00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:43.512
can be a benefit in the sense--

00:53:43.512 --> 00:53:45.344
AUDIENCE: Otherwise you
don't push yourself.

00:53:45.344 --> 00:53:46.380
ERIC BARKER: Yeah.

00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:49.930
So the qualities vary in
terms of what the role is.

00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:52.819
But also, you also have be
very specific about what

00:53:52.819 --> 00:53:53.610
you're looking for.

00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:54.730
Are you talking
about persistence?

00:53:54.730 --> 00:53:56.810
Or are you talking
about financial success?

00:53:56.810 --> 00:53:58.840
Or are you talking about
personal happiness?

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.850
So what you're looking at--

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:02.300
those can vary dramatically.

00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:04.960
So it depends on how
specific the study is

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.950
and what they're measuring.

00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:10.990
SPEAKER 1: Do we have
any other questions?

00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:13.440
Alice, I think we have one
more and then we'll wrap up.

00:54:17.984 --> 00:54:19.650
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for your talk today.

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:22.860
So a quick question I have
is, when people usually

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.854
talk about connecting
people or networking--

00:54:25.854 --> 00:54:27.270
actually, you
should know the idea

00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:29.400
that comes to my
mind is why don't we

00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:34.470
just do self-improvement
other than networking?

00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:37.554
Maybe for myself, I seldom
go to networking events.

00:54:37.554 --> 00:54:38.970
Actually, I never
think about just

00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:40.500
trying to connect with people.

00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:42.450
I'm thinking about when
I was back in school

00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:43.560
I really loved what I was doing.

00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:44.790
I was a mechanical engineer.

00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:48.190
I just enjoy when I was
dealing with mechanical stuff.

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:49.980
And then I think
that's actually maybe

00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:51.592
why I actually get
you more and more

00:54:51.592 --> 00:54:52.800
familiar with what I'm doing.

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.508
And maybe sometimes
showing better skills

00:54:54.508 --> 00:54:56.370
than the peer
students around me.

00:54:56.370 --> 00:54:59.442
And actually why I'm
hired here at Google.

00:54:59.442 --> 00:55:00.150
Maybe that's why.

00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:03.450
But compared with
my peer friends,

00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:06.034
maybe they're always
trying to get connected

00:55:06.034 --> 00:55:06.950
with people in Google.

00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:08.408
But actually they
cannot come here.

00:55:08.408 --> 00:55:10.540
But for me, I'm just
focusing on myself,

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:12.900
focusing on what I
think I should be doing.

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:14.380
But actually I come here.

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:17.110
And I know a lot
of Google people

00:55:17.110 --> 00:55:19.300
without thinking about
networking with people.

00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:22.380
So how would you
think about that when

00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:26.390
we're comparing self-improvement
and connecting networking,

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:27.940
I would say?

00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:29.550
ERIC BARKER: In
the book I do talk

00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:31.530
about those two distinctions.

00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:37.480
Where what you see is that
extroverts score much higher

00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:40.350
in a number of success
metrics because

00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:41.910
of networking abilities.

00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:45.360
On the flip side,
introverts very often

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:47.520
excel in terms of
individual performance.

00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.940
In fact, there's one
study, the jargon

00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:54.450
was something like extroversion
is inversely correlated

00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:56.007
with individual performance.

00:55:56.007 --> 00:55:57.840
Or basically, the more
extroverted you were,

00:55:57.840 --> 00:55:59.506
the worse you were at your job.

00:55:59.506 --> 00:56:02.130
If you're spending a lot of time
hanging out with your friends,

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:05.940
you're probably not spending
those 10,000 hours of practice.

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:08.580
So both are very valuable.

00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:12.720
But on average, having that
network, just because you

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:16.170
have those skills, making sure
that the right people know

00:56:16.170 --> 00:56:19.590
you have those skills can
make a huge difference.

00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:21.870
How does that resume get
in front of the person

00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:24.570
when there's 1,000
other resumes?

00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:28.140
Or when you're talking about
a much more informal system,

00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:32.220
like Hollywood, where there's
not an HR department to become

00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:33.510
a director of a movie.

00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:36.810
It's all made based on
individual discretion.

00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:40.530
Networking is essential, because
there is no formal system

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:43.650
by which to submit your resume.

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:47.800
So that level of visibility
makes a big difference.

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:50.910
And let's face
it, how often when

00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:54.922
you buy something, if you
aren't sure which laptop to get,

00:56:54.922 --> 00:56:56.630
you're probably going
to ask your friend.

00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:58.380
Your friend's going
to say, get this one.

00:56:58.380 --> 00:56:59.830
And you might go with it.

00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:01.970
Same thing happens
with hiring decisions.

00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:03.360
Big stack of resumes.

00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:05.735
All are pretty good.

00:57:05.735 --> 00:57:06.610
Who do you recommend?

00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:08.970
Well, I know that one guy
who-- and you're probably

00:57:08.970 --> 00:57:10.050
going to go with them.

00:57:10.050 --> 00:57:11.910
And that happens all the time.

00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:14.010
So it's a balance
between the two.

00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:17.460
If you are more introverted, you
don't enjoy networking as much.

00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:19.119
It's like focus on
building skills.

00:57:19.119 --> 00:57:20.910
But that doesn't mean
that networking still

00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:21.870
doesn't have its value.

00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:24.570
And on the other hand,
hey, networks are great.

00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:27.194
But if you're not
good at your job,

00:57:27.194 --> 00:57:28.860
that's going to be
found out eventually,

00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:30.600
and you may not have
that job very long.

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.820
So there is a
balance of the two.

00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:37.800
I don't think you can really
get to the highest levels

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:40.440
without either an
enormous amount of luck

00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:42.776
or a balance between both.

00:57:42.776 --> 00:57:43.650
SPEAKER 1: Excellent.

00:57:43.650 --> 00:57:45.610
Thank you very much
for joining us.

00:57:45.610 --> 00:57:47.531
Let's give Eric a
round of applause.

00:57:47.531 --> 00:57:48.030
Thank you.

00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:49.405
ERIC BARKER: Thank
you very much.

00:57:49.405 --> 00:57:53.180
