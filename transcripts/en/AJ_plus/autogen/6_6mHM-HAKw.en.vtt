00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.170
 ah 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:27.420
 I have always liked to transmit 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:27.420
 Emotions has practically everything 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:36.070
 it's a day in a marginalized community 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.460
 and suddenly you have to go back because 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.010
 there is a crocodile that is trapped in 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.520
 a house 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.510
 that same day in the night 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.510
 an executed 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.180
 anyone can kill you for writing 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.180
 something or to take a picture 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:04.190
 really know that veracruz is the state 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.190
 more dangerous for journalism 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.730
 in veracruz we live in a state of 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.670
 simulation where it seems that there is no 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:50.480
 violence does not want to give a face 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:54.490
 other than mexico even 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.490
 However, it is quite the opposite 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.189
 they had the unit 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.390
 I'm Felix Marquez photojournalist in the 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.480
 state of veracruz in mexico 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.519
 I am 27 years old 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.620
 When I started the race, the 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.299
 boom of violence in veracruz and 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:27.000
 I started covering confrontations 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:27.000
 shot dead and shootings and so on 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.400
 that is to say what I say 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.190
 was not 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.450
 he does not appear shit 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.060
 it's clear that a militarization 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.120
 from the moment he is dismissed 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.180
 a police force to enter 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.870
 federal patrol is a military 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.870
 militarization completely 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.790
 authority is exceeded 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.770
 completely for the crime 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.430
 common and organized crime 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.430
 many times 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:36.620
 we all have identified that we are going to 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.189
 take justice the authority has not 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.189
 done nothing 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:49.090
 they do not have a large number registered 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.829
 of groups that are organizing 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.829
 even in the colonies of the port of 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:57.379
 veracruz to fight the 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:00.319
 delinquents of the common forum that are the 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.530
 that in a certain way affect the 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.780
 population 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.470
 in authority does not want to acknowledge that 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.819
 exists in these groups I do not know why not 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.130
 they like to talk about the subject of 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:17.160
 Self-defense, however, our work 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.160
 is to register it is to evidence what 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.680
 a statement came from the secretary of 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.880
 public safety where he said that I 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.880
 I should be a prisoner 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.159
 unfortunately 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.590
 I have covered most murders 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:54.289
 to journalists 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:57.319
 the same case repeats a house 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:05:01.909
 half finished with a sheet roof 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:06.639
 with a floor of sand in the middle of a coffin 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:10.849
 the coffin of a journalist that with the 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:13.689
 minimum wage that we have tried 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:13.689
 to move forward his family 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:39.440
 I'm not this because Sanchez son of 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:45.230
 moisés sanchez journalist murdered in 2 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:46.910
 January 2015 in the east from very 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.529
 young 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.349
 you 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:53.919
 was interested in the question of 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:56.340
 social activism because of the question of 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:58.230
 report 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.330
 produces all the tools that 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.900
 had at his command and one of them was the 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.900
 Newspaper 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.660
 here 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:13.069
 next movie 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:20.899
 the union is born from the roots of moisés sanchez 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:23.089
 to spread stories that do not 

00:06:20.899 --> 00:06:26.240
 spread in the media 

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:28.159
 co-opted by the system is the 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.800
 journalism that should exist and the 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:33.639
 ideal journalism is journalism 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.039
 attached to the people 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:38.060
 It is a medium that we are using 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:40.190
 as a flag 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.090
 but that nobody of us studied 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:46.360
 journalism to cover 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.840
 the deaths of their peers the idea of 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.110
 this 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.389
 to make a series is to take up the 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.940
 objects of journalists who have 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:58.699
 been killed revive a bit of the 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:02.870
 essence of who was everyone to look for 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:04.600
 the objects and that represent who was 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.770
 for example in this case moisés sánchez 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.260
 help there we have a speaker that 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.150
 They usually used to have a little one 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.680
 that we already have it yet which is the one 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.830
 then he was taking to the rally was 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.830
 A) Yes 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:24.130
 Little what my father did was 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.820
 just that receiving the acts 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:30.210
 of corruption of the police 

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:32.150
 he was exposing the 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:35.610
 Authorities in Medellín de Bravo 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:39.380
 they were doing their job well 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:41.330
 some characters in politics 

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.139
 in the municipality in the state do not 

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.610
 looked like 

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:48.629
 who had already warned him that 

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:52.110
 mayor he thought to give a scare moses 

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:53.680
 was kidnapped at night in front of 

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:57.520
 his family 

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:59.740
 was murdered today the mayor says his 

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.820
 lawyer who is no longer in Veracruz 

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:06.390
 he has already left the state 

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:09.180
 and if there are many many anomalies in this 

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:10.460
 investigation are the same anomalies 

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:13.289
 what's in all the investigations 

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:15.119
 against journalists 

00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:17.240
 where they do not investigate and they do not do their 

00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:17.240
 work 

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:24.560
 after the fact happened we 

00:08:21.169 --> 00:08:27.590
 they put security and if you decide to close or 

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:30.639
 not that they are the ones that 

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:34.570
 they did nothing they knew my father and 

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:34.570
 it is precisely those that amount 

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:42.130
 yes 

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.800
 assumes that others should be locked 

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:47.459
 people and us 

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.459
 but that's how it works 

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:54.260
 criminals go free and we 

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.260
 we have to be locked 

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.840
 Many people 

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:07.510
 he works to live and in truth we 

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.510
 it seems that we are working to die 

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:15.970
 they already told you they're going to kill because 

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:20.700
 you keep publishing and he always told me 

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:22.590
 is that you can not live with fear 

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.070
 If you live with fear you are never going to 

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.070
 change the things 

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:33.270
 and his family has been very active to 

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:35.540
 demand justice in this case and punish 

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.540
 the guilty 

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.660
 the truth 

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:49.209
 I know that it gives me that they are going to kill me 

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.680
 it is more than obvious 

00:09:49.209 --> 00:09:52.839
 but 

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.920
 the other option is to stay quiet and 

00:09:52.839 --> 00:09:55.920
 that this is repeated 

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.589
 the fight that we have is behind 

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.860
 of the cameras is behind the pens 

00:10:06.589 --> 00:10:11.810
 is informing the truth and the 

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.170
 society that are really our 

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.170
 bosses
