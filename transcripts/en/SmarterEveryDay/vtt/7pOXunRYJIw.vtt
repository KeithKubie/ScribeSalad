00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
I have been wanting to make this video

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:02.900
for years.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.200
A see-through suppressor with a high speed camera

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.700
COME ON!

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:06.600
This is awesome!

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.100
The problem is I didn't

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.620
have access to licenses or the equipment necessary to make it.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.400
All that changed when I met Steve.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.420
Hey it's me Dustin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.520
I'm with Steve and Steve makes suppressors, right?

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.020
That right.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.320
What's the name of the company?

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.820
Soteria

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.340
Soteria

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.200
Suppressors

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.600
(Here to fire off suppression)

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.540
Okay this is something we've been wantin' to do

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.220
FOREVER

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.420
This is a Good old Boy Alabama deal i've contacted steve he's contacted me he likes the high-speed camera i like the concept

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.860
Of See-through Suppressors so we worked out a Little Deal Here when you Say all right so what are we gonna do

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.009
We're gonna fire our suppressors with

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.038
Using a cast Acrylic as a Casing we Can Actually See What transpires

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.340
Inside the suppressor once you know the Round leaves the barrel and

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.780
The Compressed gases behind It you know come on a barrel Create pressure wave in the ignition of The gases?

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.960
We get to see what Actually

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.689
As the bullet comes Out from the end as It Expands

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:15.030
So you Got this this Expansion coming Over Here towards Your microphone right right so what i i wouldn't Expect This pressure field to be

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.379
Symmetric or even Spherical it'S gonna be it's gonna be like a Lobe Correct a

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.909
reverse mushroom and You can See that if we Take The Muzzle brake off of It and you can Actually See

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.909
When the When the Round Exits the barrel Within on course you can See that reverse mushroom Cloud oh?

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.970
That's awesome The moment we've Been Waiting for

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.629
There we Go this is ptfc seal

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.079
Steve Would like to say something

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.020
I can Say full disclosure here we've never fired the 308 with a cast acrylic suppressor before

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.580
I think it's gonna break i do

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.720
so

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.339
But My guess is if It Does Fail That we're gonna get a Failure right Here near the thread on the back?

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.799
or the front and That's because of the

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:09.238
Stress Concentration What Kind of Thread did You use is a Sharp-toothed Thread This truncated Thread It'S a fine Thread

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.289
Hopefully It won't but if It if It does we're gonna Get some Great High speed Hints the Lexan

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.380
There we Go

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.760
I think it broke Where i thought it Would

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.349
Yeah My engineering professor Didn't lie to me

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.380
Have You ever Seen that? I've never seen that

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.020
I've never seen anybody do that before

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.020
I've never seen ANYBODY do that before!

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.320
Munford People What's Mumford People Mumford usa Mumford Alabama Mumford Us i don't understand the reference

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.940
We'd be recnecks.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.570
But we Design and Stuff The fact that It came off had to do with Axial stress like iF once It pressurized That Tube

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.880
It's pulling the Whole

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.420
Can And Those Threads Just Couldn't Handle That Right Right

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.540
Okay so the one we're about to do is something you Actually sell That's right and you've Never Seen It like This? Never have

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.679
Cool so this is a .223 and the idea here is to?

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:35.200
Contain The Gasses in the back and Then Stop It from exiting with that Diamond Pattern in the front

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.039
so if you think about What the suppressor is doing there's two Stages to it the first one is the

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.990
Capture of The gases on the inside of is Expansion volume and Then There's This Restriction to flow

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.740
To keep Those Gases Inside the can so you don't let them flow out

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.410
There's This Really Cool Thing That happens when you Spend a Lot of time Designing Things

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.230
Eventually You start to see things and you Just Kind of have a Gut Feel like engineering Judgment on this next suppressor

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.029
Steve had that Gut Feel right before we Pulled the trigger he can Hear him yell out it's pretty fun

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.290
he didn't want to shoot This i

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.710
Convinced Him to do it Because It Was the prettiest one in my Mind i thought i could see more of the gases what steve?

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.149
Didn't tell me is that This Was one of the first conceptual designs Sotiria made back before They'd done much Research

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.950
He also didn't tell me that he had no Intentions of Shooting This one so he made it out of Thinner

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:13.759
Acrylic As a Display Piece it's got like This claw Built into it and that Claw Kind of Looks like it's going to

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.650
Grab Some of That gas and not Let It Go so I'm Pretty pumped about that You Ready

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.740
Ready to fire!

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.260
Why didn't you tell me! I did it i said full disclosure and you went on with the test anyway

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.900
I said it was my favorite

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.960
Because This ones Got claws it's my favorite design and you Knew it was gonna

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.140
How did you know it was gonna fail in all seriousness?

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.800
Well It Was a Smaller Diameter

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.000
On that .308 It Works Well on the .223 but on the .308 we Need more capacity

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.240
That's a 30

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.310
That's 35 millimeter

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.940
Suppressor It Needs to be like 41 millimeter

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.089
This Is a Developmental test so let's see what we can Learn

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.960
Instead of Using a segmented Baffle System This Type of suppressor Uses a Monocore Design so it can Be Easily Cleaned in the field

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.279
We fired Another Round Through The monocle Without containment so we could see exactly

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:43.510
What was happening as you can See these flat parts are flexing Out from the inside and They're pushing on the inside of the sleeve

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:50.230
Causing a Localized stress Concentration This is Called destructive testing and it's my favorite Part of engineering

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.760
Steve obviously Knew this was going to break if we Used a metal can and this Wouldn't

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.710
Have Shattered But What he did is he weakened one part of The system so that We Could See how strong the other

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.590
Components were won't you figure that out you can figure out

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.199
How to tweak your design and you can make a Really strong

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:12.100
Overall Product Without Making It Too Bulky This is Really Smart and it's something That engineers do all The time and it's one of My

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:18.969
favorite Things in engineering ok That Was everything i thought It Would Be It was Rad i've Got a super cool

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:20.979
That's right so we Learned Someday That we're gonna try other Things Based on it what do you think i believe it

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.250
awesome Man Thanks science Keeps Moving dude it'S gonna be Good

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.840
Awesome I'm Destin getting Smarter Every day have a good one
