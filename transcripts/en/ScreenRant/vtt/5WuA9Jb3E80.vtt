00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.740
When you think of Disney and its characters,
the first things that spring to mind are generally

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.570
happy thoughts - pretty much all of Disney's
properties are aimed at children, after all.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.480
But there's actually an extremely dark side
to the company that describes its theme parks

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.619
as "the happiest places on Earth".

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.590
If you look closely at some of the most well-known
characters in Disney stories, you'll actually

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.470
see that there are some very troubled individuals
who are in desperate need of seeing a shrink.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.280
From manic depressives and schizophrenics,
to xenophobes and compulsive liars, this video

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.030
will take a look at a variety of characters
with such issues.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.860
Here are ten Disney characters with serious
mental disorders.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.899
Pinocchio
Pinocchio is the name of the wooden puppet

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.440
boy in the movie of the same name.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.680
He is brought to life by a fairy and told
that he could become a real boy if he is brave,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.300
truthful and unselfish.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.730
Unfortunately, this proves to be difficult
for Pinocchio, as he's actually a compulsive

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.510
pathological liar.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.930
It's kind of his thing and, of course, his
nose famously grows whenever he tells a lie

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.240
- but he just can't help himself and it keeps
growing and growing, even when his "conscience",

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.020
Jiminy Cricket, is telling him to speak the
truth.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.990
Peter Pan
Peter Pan is the only character on this list

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.800
who has a condition that has gone on to be
named after him - that condition is, of course,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.130
Peter Pan syndrome.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.520
The protagonist of his self-titled story,
he's the boy who never grows up and is, therefore,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.170
very socially immature.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.220
He wants to continue enjoying the care-free
pleasures of childhood, even though he's actually

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.220
an adult.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.869
To Peter, time means nothing.

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.960
His life, in his mind at least, is all about
fun, whimsy and adventure - but this isn't

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.210
always a good thing, as he can be impractical
and conceited at times, which can lead to

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.200
him getting himself into dangerous situations.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.569
Eeyore
There's a legitimate argument that every character

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.660
in Hundred Acre Wood - even Winnie-the-Pooh
himself - suffers from some kind of mental

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.110
disorder; Tigger has Attention Deficit Disorder
and Piglet has terrible anxiety, for example.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.700
But we don't want to fill a video with them,
so we'll stick to the most obvious example.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.929
Eeyore the donkey lives his life in a state
of constant pessimism.

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.750
He is quite literally unable to appreciate
life's smallest and most basic pleasures due

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.450
to his crippling depression.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.610
You only have to hear his miserable voice
to appreciate how depressed the poor guy is

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.310
- although he doesn't really speak that often,
as his depression keeps him quiet a lot of

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.310
the time.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.050
The Evil Queen
The Evil Queen from Snow White and the Seven

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.190
Dwarfs displays textbook narcissism - a personality
disorder that is characterized by exaggerated

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.130
feelings of self-importance, an excessive
need for admiration, extreme vanity and selfishness,

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.470
and a total lack of empathy for others.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.810
Her narcissism is most clearly evident in
the famous scene in which she asks her magic

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.440
mirror who the fairest one of all is.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.120
Expecting the answer to be herself, when she
doesn't get the answer she wants, her jealousy

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.550
of Snow White's superior beauty leads her
to become murderous, which would also suggests

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.340
that she is something of a psychopath.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.400
Basically, the lady has issues!

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.260
Ariel
The main character of Disney's classic The

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.760
Little Mermaid, Ariel, actually suffers from
a number of serious mental disorders.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.350
First of all, she's a chronic kleptomaniac
and hoarder.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.080
Being obsessed with the human world, Ariel
spends a lot of time acquiring - or should

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.310
we say stealing - objects used by humans,
and she has a huge collection of them that

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.450
she simply refuses to get rid of.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.430
But her biggest issue is her severe body dysmorphia.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.060
Ariel believes her mermaid body is defective
and needs to be "fixed".

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.300
As a result, she undergoes a mystical form
of cosmetic surgery to have her lower body

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.600
transformed from the tail of a fish into the
legs of a human.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.760
The poor girl really does have a lot of problems!

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.180
King Triton
King Triton is Ariel's father in The Little

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.180
Mermaid.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.280
The ruler of Atlantica has severe Xenophobia
and calls humans “barbarians” and “dangerous”

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.200
- he even has genocidal thoughts about us
Homo sapiens.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.730
Come on, Triton, we're not that bad!

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.900
The powerful trident-wielding monarch also
has some serious anger-management problems

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.000
and is prone to extremely violent outbursts
- such as the time he callously destroyed

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.890
the human artefacts that Ariel had "acquired"
as a way of trying to get through to her.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.940
His aggressive actions and prejudice attitude
towards humans ended up putting a huge strain

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.630
on his relationship with his daughter, which
is never a good thing.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.270
Scar
Scar is an evil lion and the main antagonist

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.440
of The Lion King movie.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.780
He is the brother of Mufasa and the uncle
of Simba - and he suffers from more than one

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.020
fairly serious mental condition.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.250
First and foremost, he's a complete sociopath;
he killed his own brother and attempted to

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.470
kill his nephew, and at the same time he also
possesses that unsettling creepy charm associated

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:52.620
with so many real-life killers.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.470
But he also has a dangerously narcissistic
personality disorder, in the sense that he

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.990
expects people to treat him as their superior,
will stop at nothing in his aggressive quest

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.280
to gain power, and doesn't care about the
devastation his actions cause in the process.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.470
Cruella de Ville
Simply put, Cruella de Ville is a psycopath.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.470
The villain of One Hundred and One Dalmatians
takes pleasure in being cruel to animals - which

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.840
is a classic early indicator in diagnosing
psychopaths.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.780
In the real world, countless people who have
gone on to become serial killers started out

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.190
harming animals - giving themselves a taste
of the power it made them feel - before moving

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.320
onto killing their fellow humans.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.350
Cruella de Ville has absolutely no empathy
for the puppies she wants to kill in order

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:39.870
to make the perfect fur coat - and the fact
that her reason for wanting to kill innocent

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.690
animals is for the sake of making an item
of clothing only further emphasises how psychopathic

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.430
she is.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.980
Captain Hook
The villain of the classic tale of Peter Pan,

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.110
Captain Hook famously has a hook for hand,
after his real hand was chopped off by Pan

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.320
and fed to a crocodile.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.640
As a result, Hook suffers from post-traumatic
stress disorder - a condition that is made

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.290
worse by the fact that the crocodile that
ate his hand constantly follows him around,

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.040
after having got a taste for the pirate's
blood.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.460
What heightens the condition further is the
fact that the crocodile has an alarm clock

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.570
in its belly, so its presence is always accompanied
by a ticking sound.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.840
Is it any wonder that Hook acts how he does?

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.310
His anger, his obsessive thirst for vengeance
on Pan and his constant state of jumpiness

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.800
is caused by a horrific event that persistently
haunts him.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.420
Elsa
Elsa - one of the main characters in the hugely

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.680
successful Disney movie Frozen - was born
with the magical ability to produce and manipulate

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.770
ice and snow.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.940
Her early inability to control her powers
resulted in some terrible events - such as

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.639
nearly killing her own sister.

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:47.840
As a result, Elsa developed disorders like
paranoia and agoraphobia.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.020
The paranoia rendered her terrified of using
her powers for fear of causing more incidents

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.479
like the one in which she injured her sister,
and the agoraphobia caused her to shut herself

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:57.800
away from society in order to ensure she didn't
hurt anybody else.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.090
Of course, after ultimately learning that
love was the key to controlling her powers,

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:07.080
she got over her issues, but she certainly
had them for a long time.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:11.120
Thanks for watching our list of 10 Disney
characters with serious mental disorders.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.419
Can you think of any others?
