00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.050
&gt;&gt; Gregory Lukow: Good
morning, everybody.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.120
[ Inaudible Conversations ]

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.420
Good morning.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.720
I have been given instructions

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.790
by Josh Shepperd to
split the difference.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.320
We're not starting at 8:30 so that
we can let as many of you gather

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.660
in this room as possible.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.790
But he said, "Do start at 8:45."

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.210
So I am saluting Josh
Shepperd and starting.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.510
Good morning.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.810
My name is Gregory Lukow.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.320
I am Chief of the Library

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.750
of Congress's National
Audio-Visual Conservation Center,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.710
headquartered at the Library's
Packard Campus in Culpepper,

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.030
Virginia, about 75
miles southwest of here,

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.510
and still encompassing all the
activities, traditional activities,

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.350
of the Library's Motion
Picture and Broadcasting

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.300
and Recorded South Division.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.970
Welcome to the Montpelier
Room of the Madison Building.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.840
There's a connection there.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.690
In fact, if you go down into
the lobby you'll see a statue

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.970
in a hallway of James Madison

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.130
which is the federal
government's official recognition

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.990
of our fourth President,
as is this building.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.980
So, welcome to the
Library of Congress.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.910
You're actually going
to get two welcomes

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.090
for the price of one this morning.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.570
My colleague, Eugene Flanagan,
will be talking about all

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.880
of the national planning
and coordination activities

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.290
that the Library does on behalf

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.310
of preservation activities,
including radio.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.460
And I'll be focusing a little
bit more on the internal work

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.660
that the Library does in the
domain that he'll be talking

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.590
about here today and tomorrow.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.220
The National Audio-Visual
Conservation Center if part

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.130
of the Library Services Unit
of the Library of Congress.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.680
It's the largest unit in
the Library of Congress.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.800
About 1500 people, which provides
all the National Library services

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.100
of the Library of Congress.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.750
We're -- the Preservation Center

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.080
in Culpepper's probably
the largest single division

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.550
of the 50-some divisions
within Library Services

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.900
within the Library of Congress.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.670
And we're one of the few here that
works in all three of the ways

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.270
in which any archive, library,
or museum can structure itself.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.860
We collect by format.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.880
We serve by function,
not only acquisition

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.510
and cataloging, but
also preservation.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.980
And we collect and provide
access and focus on subject.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.710
In this case, the history of radio,
its creators, its industries.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.190
That's all what we do
at the Packard Campus.

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.020
We acquire, we catalog and
describe, we store, we preserve,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.860
we have three preservational
laboratories in Culpepper --

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.530
one for film, one for
video, and one for audio.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.570
And we serve to our
research patrons here

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.050
through a range of
access initiatives.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.820
This is the 10th anniversary
of the NAVCC.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.640
That's our acronym for National
Audio-Visual Conservation Center.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.730
So we've been at that
for about 10 years.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.190
We are also written
into the legislation

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.520
that authorized the National
Film Preservation Board

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.170
and the National Recording
Preservation Board.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.270
The NAVCC is part of
that law that --

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.880
written in as to help implement
the national plans that the Library

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.430
of Congress has published in
the last couple of decades

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.400
for recorded sound collections

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.470
and for our nation's
moving image heritage.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.660
The collections of the
Library of Congress itself,

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.960
the audio-visual collections,

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.100
we have some 3.6 million audio
collections, sound recordings,

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.360 position:56%
including many hundreds of thousands
of radio, hours, and items.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.960
We collect commercial, public,
and government-produced materials

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.140
from national networks to local
stations, programming of news,

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.370
dramatic programming,
music, sports, talk radio.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.840
In fact, talk radio, actually,

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.210
embodies one of our
more recent initiatives.

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.230
Another law that we have that --

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.660
that the Library of Congress has
is called the American Television

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.010
and Radio Archive Act.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.740
It was part of the
Copyright Act of 1976.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.980
It mandates that the
Library of Congress establish

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.430
and grow an American
television and radio archive.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.810
We've recently expanded the
regulations governing that act

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.060
to include a unique
authority to be able

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:56.020
to capture unpublished audio-visual
transmissions from any format,

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.870
from any venue, whether satellite,
cable, off-air, off-Internet,

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.830
satellite radio, FM radio.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:10.700
And a number of years ago we began
capturing political talk radio,

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.200 position:56%
talk radio in general with a special
focus on political talk radio.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.000
That's an activity still on-going.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.530
You can see what we've been
capturing over the years

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.060
in our Recorded Sound
Research Center website.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.140
So we constantly have radio on our
minds as we continue to acquire

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.540
and preserve our audio-visual
collections.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.720
Our newest major activity
you're going to be hearing more

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.870
about throughout the
Congress, this conference,

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.250
and this afternoon
especially, is our collaboration

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.350
with WGBH Educational
Foundation up in Boston.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.030
I guess we're going
into our third year now

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.850
of having assumed the
responsibilities

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.760
for managing the ongoing
preservation development

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.340
of the American Archive of
Public Broadcasting, AAPB,

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.950
an initiative established
by the Corporation

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.870
for Public Broadcasting
a number of years ago.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.460
And about three years
ago WGBH and the Library

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.740
of Congress assumed
responsibility for continuing that.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.050
To date we have ingested into our
Data Center, our Digital Archive

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:28.940 position:56%
at the Packard Campus, over 71 radio
collections from around the country,

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.760
with numerous more in the
pipeline being developed

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.430
through grant initiatives

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.610
and negotiated agreements
with radio stations.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.450
This broad initiative to
capture publicly-funded media

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:48.570
in the United States is off to a
great success, and I hope that many

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:54.950
of you will be attending this
afternoon's 2 p.m. 50th anniversary

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.780
celebration of public
broadcasting in this country.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.380
You're going to see an
all-star cast of dignitaries

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.960
in this room later this afternoon.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:11.240
So you'll be seeing a lot of other
Library of Congress staff here

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.410
and tomorrow on various panels that
can fill you in on more details.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.340
I want to conclude just by
giving some thank you's.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.450
I consulted with Josh
Shepperd earlier.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:26.210
And we do have a number of people
that I would like to thank now,

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.060
not only on behalf of the
Library, but also the leadership

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:35.760
of the National Radio
Preservation Taskforce,

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.340
including all of the Radio
Preservation Taskforce --

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.520
conference directors, project
directors, caucus chairs,

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.720
and all of you participants,
the Association

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.350
for Recorded Sound
Collections, CLIR,

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.490
the International Communication
Association,

00:07:54.490 --> 00:08:00.100
National Communication Association,
NPR, the Maryland Institute

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.630
for Technology and the Humanities,

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.250
the Woodrow Wilson
International Center for Scholars,

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:11.240
the National Council on
Public History, Nemnon,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.290
and the National Recording
Preservation Foundation,

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:19.580
and a number of individuals,
Michelle Helms,

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.770
a Conference Director, Sam
Berlofski [assumed spelling],

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:27.880
Stephanie Sapienza,
Trevor Munoz, Ross Johnson,

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.010
Pietra Beerstacker [assumed

Shaun Vancoeur [assumed spelling],
Wendy Shay, and a special shoutout

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.990
to Christine Ehrick, the
Communications Director

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.220
for the Taskforce for the article

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.150
in the <i>Washington Post</i>
that appeared yesterday

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.120
on this gathering, and radio
preservation in general.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.880
And, of course, the Library
needs to thank Josh Shepperd

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:10.380
for his tireless efforts in
developing the taskforce.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.130
And, of course, I know he wishes
he could be here today as well,

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.080
the Founder of the
taskforce, Chris Sterling,

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.700
who I'm sure extends his warm
welcomes to all of you as well.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.420
It is an amazing network of a
couple of hundred institutions

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:29.520
that have come together to create
this digital humanities empire

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:34.790
of creators and archivists and
academics who are working together

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:38.220
to focus on radio history
and preservation.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.420
I commend you all,
and I welcome you all.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.220
Thank you very much.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:49.070
[ Applause ]

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.610
You'll introduce yourself,
but I would be remiss

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:51.940
if I didn't just contribute

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:57.360 position:56%
to introducing Eugene Flanagan who's
a Director of National Programs

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.060
in the National and
International Outreach Unit

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.360
of the Library of Congress.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.160
Eugene.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:10.140
[ Applause ]

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.560
&gt;&gt; Eugene Flanagan: Good morning.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.700
Actually, if those of you
politely sitting at the back,

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.210
if you'd like to grab a
seat, now is a good time.

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:21.680
Won't force you, but there's plenty
of seats here and to the side.

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.560
So, thank you, Greg.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.860
As he says, I'm Director
of National Programs.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.140
And it's my great good
fortune that some

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:33.830
of those include the National
Recording Preservation Board

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:38.220
and the National Recording Registry
and their film counterparts.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.350
We had the meeting of
the Film Board yesterday,

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:47.370
and we also had a terrific event
promoting the work of the Board

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:51.190
and the Registry when there was a
conversation between the Librarian

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:55.160
of Congress and the Director,
Christopher Noland, last night.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.120
And I'm hoping we sort of
mirror that to help support

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.600
and promote the Recording
Board and Registry.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.860
And the Board meeting's
coming up in December,

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.000
and the Register being
announced in March.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.120
And so we were working to see what
we can do along similar lines.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.740
The Library's delighted to
welcome so many institutions

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:20.130
as Greg mentioned, 200, and
individuals that are registered,

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:24.160
300, to participate over
the next couple of days.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:28.280
Yesterday we saw forums,
panels, and workshops take place

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.700
at the Woodrow Wilson, and National
Public Radio, and the University

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.790
of Maryland, and here, now,
at the Library of Congress.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:39.060
Or as the online conference
schedule describes the Library,

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.100
the big boxy building
with pillars [laughter].

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:47.370
But it obviously helps because
most of you are here today.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.930
So given the depth and breadth
of participation, it should come

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:53.780
as no surprise that this Radio
Preservation Project is one,

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:56.620
and maybe the largest
digital humanities

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.790
in media initiatives in
the discipline today.

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:03.530
And for those of us in cultural
institutions, big boxy buildings

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:07.090
with pillars, are used to
marking progress in decades.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.840
This has come to pass in
relatively short order

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:13.760
that I find very impressive
and commend everybody involved.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.590
In 2013, just to give you a sense
of the pace, under the auspices

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.160
of the National Recording
Preservation Board,

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.460
the Library released the Library

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.150
of Congress National
Recording Preservation Plan,

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.700
a comprehensive blueprint
and call to arms

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.800
to save America's recorded sound
heritage for future generations.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.990
The report drew from
findings that many recordings

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.770
of radio broadcasts
were untraceable,

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:38.010
and numerous transcription
discs of national

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.830
and local broadcasts
had been destroyed.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.910
And that little was known
of what still existed,

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:46.540
where it was stored,
and in what condition.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:52.260
A year later, a key
recommendation was

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.120
to implement the Radio
Preservation Task Force.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.600
And this was formed in 2014
to spearhead the effort

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.740
to identify challenges and
develop strategies to collect

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:06.210
and preserve American radio
broadcasts and content.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:11.160
And in 2016 the Taskforce convened
its first National Conference.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.510
Subsequent collaboration
in the years

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:16.390
since has seen several
projects launched,

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.720
including the Public Memory
Project, a national project

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.020
to preserve the history of public
media, a national project to study

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:27.150 position:56%
and preserve Cold War communications
history, a beta program

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.540
for publicly accessible
bigdata search engine

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.930
to locate archival collections,
and aggregating information

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.530
about hundreds or archival
collections across the country.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:42.660
And here we are today in late 2017
at the Second Annual Conference,

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.950
ready to fire up the
engines for the year ahead.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.850
So why is this pace, this
sense of urgency important?

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:52.270
It's important because the task
at hand, to quote the title

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:57.830
of an <i>Atlantic </i>article, is <i>Saving
Historic Radio Before It's Too Late</i>

00:13:57.830 --> 00:14:01.530
M, a sentiment that was
repeated in, as Greg says,

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.250
the <i>Post </i>article yesterday.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.160
We know that radio, like
film, has played a vital role

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.680
in the last hundred
years of our history.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.310
From the mid-1920s until the '50s,

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.500
radio was the nation's
preeminent source

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.350
of entertainment and
news information.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:22.080
And today, despite the multiplicity
of generations, options, devices,

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.990
and platforms, there are still
more than 14,000 radio stations

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.850
in the United States, and radio's
still a major source of information

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:33.420
that 93% of us listen
to, even millennials.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.420
I was surprised -- 91%.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:40.430
Radio is an irreplaceable part
from a sociocultural heritage,

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:43.970
a key part of a social
memory, an ubiquitous,

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:47.670
if perhaps underappreciated,
force in our daily lives.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:53.010
As you all know much better than I
do, and I appreciate your patience,

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:57.060
radio preservation
presents unique challenges.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.620
The magnitude of the material
produced, it's a femoral nature,

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.520
the deregulation and
consolidation of radio stations,

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:06.490
the lack of technology to
preserve early broadcasts,

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:09.680
general institutional
neglect, emerging formats,

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.260
and underrepresentation
of diverse [inaudible],

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:16.050
are all contributing factors in
the crisis facing the preservation

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:17.610
of America's radio heritage.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:22.740 position:56%
So much was never captured, and
much that was has since disappeared.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:28.040
Our preservation consciousness
has, of course,

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.060
been raised in recent
decades, and many libraries

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.620
and archives have acquired
collections

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.420
of radio broadcasting recordings.

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.940
But there has been
few systematic efforts

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.740
to collect commercial radio
broadcasting and to document

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.370
and preserve the entire
range of extant broadcasts

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.330
in private and public collections.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.450
For the latter, happily, of course,

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:49.410
there is now the American
Archive of Public Broadcasting.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:51.720
But that still leaves the
vast expanse of commercial

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.390
and independent nonprofit
radio that is found

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.760
in both the national
and local levels.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.820
This essential work
remains to be done.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.220
And this is why we're here today.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:06.270
The Taskforce and it's three-day
conference is the first national

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:10.140 position:56%
attempt by mass media historians
and archivists to assess the history

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.650
and record of radio
in the United States.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:18.730
And for that, and I second Greg
in this, I applaud Chris Sterling

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.600
and Josh Shepperd, the Taskforce,
the Conference Committee,

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.470
and all of you here today who are
participating over the next couple

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:29.710
of days at the 22-odd sessions.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.510
Thank you very much
and the best of luck.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:39.810
[ Applause ]

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:41.490
&gt;&gt; Gregory Lukow: I
should probably --

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.540
this is where you get
up and disperse.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.860
I should probably give you
a little guidance for that.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.910 position:56%
There are four sessions that follow.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:50.930
One of them stays in this
room, so if you're here, stay.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:55.700
Dining Room A and Dining Room C
are just right on the other side

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.370 position:56%
of this wall, just a few steps away.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.630
And the Mumford, which is where
the other session's being held,

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:06.370
is the big room right behind
where you registered this morning,

00:17:06.370 --> 00:17:09.550
where the registration
desk was off the elevators.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.550
So here, to there, and the Mumford,

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:14.070
that's where the four
sessions are meeting.

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:16.380
Good luck.

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:20.590
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: And this panel is
entitled "Indigenous First Nations,

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:23.350
Looking at Media Archives
in General,"

00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:26.630
coming from our tribal communities.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:27.930
And since we're getting
a late start,

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.860
I just want to also just
mention that we're going

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.790
to keep the presentations a little
tight with some room, hopefully,

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.170 position:56%
to leave for some of your questions.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:39.890
This panel wraps up around 10:45.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.070
My name is Jenni Monet.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:44.210
I'm a Tribal citizen of
the Pueblo of Laguna,

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:46.470
which is a Tribal Nation
in New Mexico.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:50.100
I'm an indigenous journalist
and I'm so honored to be here

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:56.410
at this awesome conference where we
get to talk and nerd out on a topic

00:17:56.410 --> 00:18:00.180
that I really love which
is indigenous media.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:04.620 position:56%
Allow me to introduce the panelists,
and then I'm going to assist them

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.070
in working around all of the
files that we have here today.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.160
Starting from my left,
we have Lina Ortega.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.300
She's a Tribal Citizen of the Sac
and Fox Nation out of Oklahoma,

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.410
and is speaking to us
from work that she does

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.490
with the University of Oklahoma.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:24.840
To her left is Melissa Begay

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.730
who is here representing
<i>Native Public Media </i>.

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.150
Loris Taylor was originally
intended to be here.

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.540
And Melissa works very
closely with Loris,

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.250
and I know that she will
bring in the same remarks

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.970
that Loris would have today

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:42.890
about <i>Native Public
Media and Tribal Radio </i>.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.020
To Melissa's left is Michael Pon

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:48.800
with the Smithsonian Museum
as the American Indian.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.490
I'm looking forward to your
remarks as well, Michael.

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.440
Thank you for being here.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.060
To Michael's left is
Simon Moya-Smith,

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:03.440 position:56%
an independent journalist and
soon-to-be author of his first book.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:08.140
Simon also is going to be
speaking to us from his recent work

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.240
of <i>Indian Country Today</i>
which actually shuttered

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.010
in early September.

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:15.130
And so, be very interesting
to hear what you have to say

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:18.320
about the archives happening
from <i>Indian Country Today </i>.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:24.790
And then, finally, last but not
least, we have our discussant,

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:30.180
Amalia Cordova, who comes to us
from the Smithsonian Folk Life.

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.380
And she's really going
to bring context

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.470
to the greater indigenous worldview

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:37.200
of how these narratives
are shaped and formed.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.980
So, without further ado, I just
want to get started with some

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.860
of the conversation here today.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:45.870
And Melissa, if you would like to
come up here, I can certainly help

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:49.840
with navigating any of
the presentations here.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.620
Please.

&gt;&gt; Melissa Begay: Thank you.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.700
Just [inaudible].

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.000
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Yeah.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.800
&gt;&gt; Melissa Begay: Okay.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:11.370
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:12.670
Good morning.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.880
My name is Melissa Begay
as you heard Jenni mention.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.010
I am with <i>Native Public Media </i>.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:20.150
I'm a member of the
Navajo Nation in Arizona.

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:25.940 position:56%
And I'm here today filling in for
Loris Taylor as Jenni had mentioned.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:29.000
She was unable to be with us today.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.300
The presentation today is going
to focus on endangered collections

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.770
and the need for expanded academic
study on the cultural history

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.140
of radio and, in general,

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:44.000
the history of media
serving Indian Country.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.160
Not much has been compiled
or collected.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.750
But what we do know are bits and
pieces of an incredible story.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:55.670
It is generally perceived the
Indigenous people's cultures

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:59.710
and traditions are kept alive
through oral traditions,

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.690
generation to generations
for thousands of years.

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:04.070
When you think about
it, that's a lot

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:07.380
of information to retain
and to share.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:11.140
However, not all nations
use oral traditions.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:16.290 position:56%
Some nations use birchbark to
capture their writing and there were

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:21.250
and are other examples of written
language used by indigenous people.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:27.350
Between 1809 and 1821, Sequoyah,
also known as George Guess,

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:30.990
created the Cherokee syllabary.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:34.510
Sequoyah, a Cherokee
silversmith, simply just wanted

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:40.330
to write his own name like other
silversmith want to sign his work.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.090
He first tried picture
graphs but found

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:46.830
that this would have
required thousands of symbols.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:51.190
He designed a symbol for each
syllable in the Cherokee language.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:55.530
The Cherokee symbol, or the
Cherokee syllabary, whether written

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:59.300
in Cherokee language came
into being in the late 1810s.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:03.390
And in 1828, the Cherokee Nation
adopted the Cherokee syllabary.

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:07.970
And in 1911, the Smithsonian
preserved the language.

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.190
<i>The Cherokee Phoenix </i>was the
first Native American newspaper,

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:20.010
the first issue published
in English and Cherokee,

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:27.260
using the Cherokee syllabary,
in February 21, 1980-28.

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:31.410
Elias Boudinot was the first
Editor of <i>The Cherokee Phoenix </i>.

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:34.160
He named <i>The Cherokee
Phoenix </i>as a symbol of renewal

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:39.910
for the mythical bird that rose
to life from the ashes of fire.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.340 position:56%
The Nation founded the paper to
gather support and help keep members

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.250
of the Cherokee Nation
united, informed.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:50.300
It was also a platform to
discuss political decisions

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.310
that would eventually result
in the Trail of Tears.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.840
It was a part of a movement

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.130
to help the Cherokee Nation
create self-governing institutions

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:00.430
in the new capital of Echota.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:09.300
Other tribal nations beside
the Cherokee also started

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.600
to print newspapers.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.750
They include the Cherokee,
Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Creek,

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:18.460
and were influenced by tribal
leaders, and gave an official voice

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.870
to the elders and leadership.

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.990 position:56%
Most newspapers were tribally owned,

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:26.960
and few owned by individual
tribal members.

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:32.110
In 1935, the second Native
American paper, <i>The Shawnee Sun </i>,

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:35.360
was published both in
English and Shawnee,

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.740
also using the English alphabet.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.970
It was suspended in 1838
and resumed in 1841.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:52.130
By 1858, there was a
<i>Chickasaw and Choctaw Herald </i>,

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:57.310
and by the 1840s tribes were
investing in official papers.

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:00.840
Both tribal papers and
native writers were active

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.030
through the 1850s.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:06.240
However, as the political
situation of tribes shifted to that

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.340
of assimilation or allotment,

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:12.060
publishing had weakened
and declined.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.350
To this day, tribal officials

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:18.470
or the tribal government usually
control tribal newspapers.

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:21.460
And as you see on this slide, a
little bit history and timeline

00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:24.970
of the newspapers starting
from Sequoyah to the 2000s.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:36.240
It's also important to mention
Myrta Eddleman was the first Native

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:40.960
American woman to own
a mainstream newspaper.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.300
In 1898, Myrta launched the
<i>Twin Territories </i>which focused

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.970
on Tribal Indian Territory
in Oklahoma.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:59.960
Myrta's sister, Ora Eddleman, later
became Reed, served as the Editor

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.290
and Chief Writer for
<i>Twin Territories </i>.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:08.210
Between 1900 and 1940, publishers
and editors supported assimilation,

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:09.930
control most public -- I'm sorry.

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:11.230
I'm going to repeat that.

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:14.160
Between 1900 and 1940,
publishers and editors

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.330
who supported assimilation
controlled most publications.

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:22.860
A number of tribal publications
were started during this period.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:29.520
A few of them are, <i>The
California Indian News </i>, 1935;

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.870
<i>The Winnebago Chieftain</i>
, 1905, in Nebraska;

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:38.190
<i>The Claremore State
Herald </i>, 1905, in Oklahoma;

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:43.970
<i>The Rossville Reporter</i>
, 1913, in Kansas.

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.360
Now moving on to Native radio.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.490
KYUK was the first
Tribal radio station.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:02.640
It went on air in 1971,
followed by KDKB

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:07.010
in Pinehill, New Mexico in 1972.

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:11.320
Forty-six years later,
in 2017, that has grown

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:16.320
to approximately 59 tribal radio
stations across Indian Country.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.770
Native radio is a powerful network
of individuals and organizations

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:23.700
that support and encourage
one another.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.790
Radio stations are
often owned and operated

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:31.470
by Native American Indigenous
groups, many on tribal lands

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:34.970
in tribal communities, and
also a few in urban areas.

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.990
Radio programs in series
are developed

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:45.460
by Native producers focused
on Native issues and cultures.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.680
Native [inaudible] is
significant to both Native

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:51.330
and non-Native audiences
for a number of reasons.

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.210
It gives indigenous
communities a powerful voice

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.330 position:56%
that reinforces a sense of community

00:26:56.330 --> 00:26:58.930
through the lens of
their own language.

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:01.890
It can provide news from
the Native point of view,

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:07.680
and health programs focusing on
local issues and local needs.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:11.610
It can broadcast music and culture
programs that support traditional

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:13.970
and nontraditional Native artists.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:22.280
In 2013, Peggy Berryhill, a 42-year
veteran radio producer stated,

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.050
"We love Native radio."

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.270
Announcers sound like us.

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.600
We hear the latest music.

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.220
We hear the latest news.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.330
He hear our language.

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:39.970
And we hear emergency
information that can save lives.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:48.980
Native people through the world
had little if any opportunity

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.940
to hear their language
over the radio.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:56.360
Majority of cultures
dominated the airwaves,

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.110
and most Nations saw little value

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:01.380
in supporting indigenous
cultures in any form.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:05.410
It is through tribal radio tribal
members can hear their language

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:08.570
and possibly rescue
it from extinction.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.420
Since radio was an oral medium,

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:15.020
it appeared to be ideally
situated for this purpose.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:20.140
In 2012, 21 stations broadcasted
in their tribal language.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:24.180
A year later, that grew to 36
radio stations broadcasting

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:25.790
in their tribal language.

00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:29.550
And you see a few examples
on the screen there.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:34.270
Native radio strengthens
the retention of native

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.880
and indigenous languages.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:41.170
It supports arts and
cultural initiatives.

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:44.330
It airs discussions of current
affairs from perspective

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:49.970
of indigenous people, and continues
to bridge the cultural divide.

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:57.840
Moving from native radio, I want

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:02.120
to now highlight some Native
Americans mainstream media.

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.870
Native American journalists --

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:10.390 position:56%
Tanna Beebe, a member of the Cowlitz
tribes of Washington State --

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:12.650
sorry if I pronounced that wrong --

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.550
was one of the first
Native American hired

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:17.080
by a nonnative-owned TV station,

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:21.940
KIRO TV in Seattle
in the early 1970s.

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:30.400 position:56%
Hattie Kauffman, a Nez Perce tribal
member, started her broadcast career

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.830
on college radio at the
University of Minnesota.

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:36.720
In 1987, she worked
for <i>Good Morning,</i>

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.300
<i>America </i>as a special correspondent
and substitute news anchor,

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:46.700
then joined <i>CBS This Morning</i>
in 1990, where she also served

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:51.690
as a special correspondent
and substitute anchor.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:56.330
We have Mary Kim Titla, a member
of the San Carlos Apache Tribe,

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:59.240
who became the first Native
American television journalist

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.970
in Arizona in 1987.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:10.210
She worked for KBOA in Tucson
and KPNX in Phoenix, Arizona.

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:13.180
These pioneers Native
television journalists led the way

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.950 position:56%
for many others such as Andy
Harvey, Charlie Etsitty, and others.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.900
And then we have our
television station, FNX,

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:37.890
First Nation Experience,
airing in 2011,

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:43.380
the Cheyenne Arapaho television
station in 2012, in Oklahoma.

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:49.500 position:56%
And then just recently, in 2014, the
Gila River Broadcasting Corporation,

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.970
the Gila Rivera Indian
Community in Arizona.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.140 position:56%
We also have tribal web-based media.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:04.400
Indian Country Today Media
Network launched in 2001,

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.660
and is a news Aggregator.

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:12.150
RezKast, a Native video and
music-sharing site, created in 2005

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:15.640
by the Coeur d'Alene
Tribal IT Department.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.980
According to RezKast
website, this is a place

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:23.360
where they can create
their own tribal shows,

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:26.200
report on their own
tribal programming

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.340
and their own native content.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.110
It is their hope and their intent

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:34.100
that tribal people will use
technology's greatest strengths

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.210
to preserve the greatest truths.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:41.070 position:56%
And then we have indiancountrytv.com
which streams news

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.940
from Indian Country
and Indian Country TV.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.870
And then the Chickasaw TV.

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:54.620 position:56%
Chickasaw Nation TV is a
high-definition online video network

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:58.550
owned by the Chickasaw Nation,
focusing on tribal history,

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:02.550
traditions, arts, cultural,
and services.

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:06.520
The website consists of nine
channels -- government, commerce,

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:10.870
news, history and culture,
arts and humanities.

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:14.240
The website currently
contains hundreds

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.080
of short videos covering
Chickasaw government programs

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.970
and services, events and issues.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:30.280
This map displays Native
America media today.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.100
In yellow are the radio
stations across Indian Country.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.350
Purple are podcasts.

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:39.950
Red are weekly podcasts.

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:43.070
Blue represents newspapers
across Indian Country.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.820
And then green represents blogs

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:48.930
by Native Americans
across Indian Country.

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:53.120
We know that new technology
are changing native radio

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.580
and media in radical ways.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:33:00.090
Broadband Internet provides
opportunity for online streaming,

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:03.440
satellite radio, and
distribution of programs.

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:10.580
Also, low-cost digital technology
such as tablets, cell phones,

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:14.720
and other devices have broadened
access to tribal media as well.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.400
So good things are happening.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:19.130
The good things are going
on in Indian Country.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.670
There is a small collection
of native media

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:26.950
and Native Public Media
encourages academia to be more open

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:30.350
to collecting and archiving
tribal media.

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:33.200
Again, thank you so much

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:38.800
for inviting Native
Public Media here today.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.080
Again, my name is Melissa Begay.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.880
Thank you.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:49.030
[ Applause ]

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:50.330
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Thank you, Melissa.

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:55.300 position:56%
And what an appropriate introduction
to this panel discussion, I think.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.700
I really appreciate that overview.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.350
Lina, would you like to go next?

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:01.650
&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa Begay: Sure.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:02.950
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Okay.

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:04.250
That would be great.

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:06.320
I was going to put this up here.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.290
And would you feel
comfortable being at the podium?

00:34:09.290 --> 00:34:10.590
&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa Begay: Yes.

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:12.200
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Okay.

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:16.160
Great. Now, again, let me
know if I can assist you

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.480
with any navigation
in getting your files.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:22.780
Let me just line this up here.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:31.200 position:56%
Okay. And now yours is not this one.

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:35.030
This is yours.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:36.720
&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa Begay: Okay.

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:42.500
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: And I believe we
downloaded it as well, correct?

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:43.800
&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa Begay: Yes.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.100
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Okay.

00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.400
Here it is.

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.700
There's that.

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:54.310
Now, to access your audio
files, Escape -- sorry.

00:34:54.310 --> 00:35:01.550

down, I'm going to pull up iTunes.

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:04.150
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Okay?

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:05.450
Does that sound okay?

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:06.750
&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa Begay: Yeah.

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:08.050
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Great.

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:10.350
I'm going to bring that
down and bring your --

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:15.550
There you are.

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:16.850 position:56%
Okay. Thank you for that transition.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:18.150
&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa Begay: Okay.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:19.450
All right.

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:21.510
Thank you.

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:24.040
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.200
I'm really thrilled to be here
today to talk about the <i>Indians</i>

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.780
<i>for Indians Hour Radio Program </i>.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:34.840
It started on April 1 in
1941, and it was broadcast

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:40.290
from the WNAD AM Station
right on the campus

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:42.400
of the University of Oklahoma.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.580
And from the very beginning
it was a very popular show.

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:51.210 position:56%
It was the creation of Don Whistler,
who was a Sac and Fox Indian,

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:55.950
and he was also Chief of
the Tribe at that time.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:36:00.420
He had been educated
in Sac and Fox Country.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.600
He grew up in Sac and Fox Country.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:06.210 position:56%
And then as a young man he
attended the University of Oklahoma.

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:11.250
And then he also went to the
University of Pennsylvania

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:14.960
and worked in the museum
as a curator and also

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.630
as a lecturer and performer.

00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:20.180
And so these are a couple
of photographs of him

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:22.150
from when he was a young man.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:25.160
And on the right, you see
him wearing a headdress

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:28.680
which is not what Sac
and Fox warriors

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.400
or chiefs traditionally wear.

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.490
But he would wear it
during his performances.

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:37.610
And he would -- whenever he
was lecturing to Boy Scouts

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:43.110
and other groups in Pennsylvania,
he performed dances and songs

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:46.100
from other tribes, not
just the Sac and Fox.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:50.520
This photograph is
from later in life.

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.960
And he's talking to one of
the anthropologists on campus

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.340
at our Natural History Museum.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:00.340
And I think this photograph
is from about the same time

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:04.280
that he would have started the
<i>Indians for Indians Hour </i>.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.920
And he was also its host

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:12.630
for its first 10 years,
from 1941 through 1951.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:16.290
And he invited Native Americans
from all over the state.

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:20.680
He had a wide network evidently
-- in Central Oklahoma,

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:24.480
in Western Oklahoma, and some
getting into the eastern part

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:28.370 position:56%
of the state, but maybe not so
much, because there are a few tribes

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:32.970
that really aren't well
represented in the radio show.

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:36.330
It was broadcast on
Tuesday afternoons

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.730
for half an hour at l o'clock.

00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:43.660
But it was called <i>Indians
for Indians Hour </i>popularly.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.860
So that's just the weekly schedule.

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:50.170
This is a program schedule
from 1948.

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:52.820
This one is also from 1948,

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:55.710
and it talks about the
popularity of the show.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:58.600
It says, "More and more
Indians are finding <i>Indians</i>

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.460
<i>for Indians </i>to be one
of their favorite series.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:06.040
The programs include real
Indian music, songs, and dances,

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.700
presented by representatives of
tribes from all over the state.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:12.820
Don Whistler arranges for the
appearance of these groups and is

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.030
in complete charge of the series."

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:16.330
And he was.

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:19.590
He was very explicit that
this program was being put

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:23.420
on by Indian people, and
it was for Indian people,

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:27.050
and he never waivered from that.

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:33.140 position:56%
However, once he did invite someone,
sometimes -- usually it was groups,

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:38.720
sometimes individuals, he
let them take it from there.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.020
He would introduce them.

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.760
He could make some comments.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:47.090
And then he would let them
do whatever they wanted to,

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:49.420
sing whatever they wanted to.

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:53.120
There was also a lot of --

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:56.570
the program mostly was
performances and music.

00:38:56.570 --> 00:39:00.070
And I'll get into details
in that a little bit later.

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:03.400
But also it was spoken, too.

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.860
There were speeches,
there were prayers.

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:10.240
And so he let, once
people were there,

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.200
he let them do what they wanted.

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.250
The only thing is he
didn't want anyone getting

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:17.470
into political discussions.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:20.830
Indian Country politics
can get kind of --

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:25.770
always has, probably always will,
can get kind of heated sometimes.

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:29.570 position:56%
That was not the format of the show.

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:32.790
The Western History
Collections at OU is one

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:34.810
of the special collections
in the Library.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:37.720
And we also house the
University Archives.

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:41.090
So that's where some of this
material is coming from.

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:44.130
We're fortunate to
have Whistler's logbook

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:48.000
that he created for
planning his show.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.240
And this is a couple
of pages from it.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.550
And the arrangement of the
book is kind of interesting.

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:58.700
He would put paper in this
binder and then, as time went on,

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:00.430
he would add to the top of it.

00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:04.680
And so this first page
from the first programs

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:09.880
in 1941 is actually at
the end of the book.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.440
So we have his first
show, April 1st.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.310
And then the second
show on April 8th.

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:21.260
You probably can't see it, but it
says, "Yellow Fish [inaudible]."

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:27.100
And this is one -- I actually
don't know if Yellow Fish sang

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.490
on this program, but he did talk.

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:34.800
This is one of the recordings
that -- it no longer exists.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:40.840
Not every program was recorded,
or the recordings were saved,

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:43.820
and then I think there were
some that were recorded,

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:46.740
and they've been lost over time.

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:49.830
So, anyway, Yellow
Fish had participated

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:51.880
in the Battle of Adobe Walls.

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:56.620
So this is 1941 and I believe
he's in his 70s at this time.

00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:00.850
And that battle was, I
believe, in 1874 in Texas.

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:05.390
And it was kind of the last
stand, if you want to put it

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:07.240
that way, for the Comanche.

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.660
And so he's -- he was there.

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.760
He was a teenager when
this was going on.

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:15.810
And so that's what he's talking
about during this episode.

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:20.970
So it's tragic that that
recording doesn't exist.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:29.100
The content of the show, as
I said, it mostly was music.

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:30.960
But it was a variety of music.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:33.900
It was powwow music, so
it included war dances,

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:36.720
what we now refer to
as intertribal songs.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:42.310
It had round dances, war
mother songs, 49 songs.

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:46.000
It also had religious
music of different kinds.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.050
Some of it would be Christians
singing Christian hymns.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:53.020
But it was different denominations

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.660
from churches from
all over the state.

00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:59.110
And so some of these hymns would
be from more the Eastern Tribes,

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:02.450
like the Creek or the Seminoles.

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:04.830
And then you would also have more

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:07.930
of the Western Tribes
in Oklahoma represented.

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:12.030
Rainy Mountain Church in
Kiowa Country is one example.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:17.800
And so these groups would be
-- they would come and perform.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.140
There would also be
stomp dance music.

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:23.690
And then also ceremonial
music, you know,

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:28.210 position:56%
traditional tribal ceremonial music,
which is a little surprising to me.

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:31.540
Some of the songs, for
example, are sun dance songs

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:34.360
from the Cheyenne or
the Arapaho Tribes.

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:38.570
And it astonishes me that
they actually performed

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:40.230
that on live radio.

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:42.470
And we still have these recordings.

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:46.370
So that's something that I'd really
like to talk to the tribe about,

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:50.280
you know, what do you
think of this now?

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.900
As far as some of the
spoken content goes,

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:55.860
some of it is -- talks
about history.

00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:59.370
There's a lot of it
in a tribal language,

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:03.070
and so we don't necessarily
know what they're saying.

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:08.300
And there's a lot of
tributes to veterans.

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:11.590
And school groups would
often come and perform, too.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:16.760
And so sometimes we have students
talking or they're singing.

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:20.640
It's like Whistler gave them an
opportunity for both the elders

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.590
to perform and to participate
in the show,

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:27.950
and then also for the young
people to do that as well,

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:33.520
and kind of show their elders
that they're carrying things on.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:36.460
So I'd like to go ahead and
play a few clips for you.

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:40.880
I'm not certain this is going to
work correctly, but let me see.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.700
Yeah, I did Escape.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.510
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Just
get it there faster.

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:50.170
&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa Begay: Okay.

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:52.440
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Here's the iTunes.

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:53.740
&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa
Begay: Okay, thank you.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:55.040
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Okay?

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.340
You're welcome.

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.640
And then just click on [inaudible].

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:00.060
&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa Begay: Okay.

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:04.120
This first one I'm going to
play is Whistler himself.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:07.140
And so I'd like for
you to hear his voice.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.600
And he normally didn't
venture into politics,

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.950
but he does have some
commentary here.

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:15.020
We're not going to hear it all
just because of the length,

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:19.950
but he's talking about the
NCAI, urging Indian people

00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:22.410
to write their congressmen
about a proposed bill that was

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:24.710
in the House at that time.

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.340
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Wait --

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:42.630
&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa Begay: Okay.

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:47.510
&gt;&gt; <i>Indians for Indians</i>
with Don Whistler.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:52.070
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:44:52.070 --> 00:44:55.290
&gt;&gt; This is the 353rd
program of the <i>Indian</i>

00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:56.780
<i>for Indians Hour </i>,
[inaudible] speaking.

00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:00.920
Before we start on this
program which is going

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.450
to be a continuous
affair [inaudible],

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:07.450
make one little announcement here.

00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:11.410 position:56%
It seems that someone is always
introducing bills in Congress asking

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:16.680
for things for Indians
without ever taking the trouble

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:21.460
to ask the Indians whether
they want it or not.

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:25.990
And then some [inaudible] American
Indians just written me a letter

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:32.860
saying that there is now in
the print a bill, HR 4725.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:40.070
That's HR 4725, that confers
jurisdiction on the several states

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:41.370
over offenses committed by

00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:43.380
or against Indians on
Indian Reservations.

Indians think that they could --

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:46.330
&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa Begay: Okay.

00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:47.630
I'm sorry to cut it off, but it
goes on for a little bit longer.

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:49.430

show off by saying --

[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.330
And he's saying hello,
friends [foreign words].

00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:57.190
That was his clan name.

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:59.730
It is I speaking.

00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:03.440
And so that's what
that translates to.

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:09.510
Anther one -- this next clip
is one of the early broadcasts.

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:15.780
It's from 1943 and the speaker
is Tsatoke who is Kiowa.

00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:19.350
At this time in 1942
he's 96 years old.

00:46:19.350 --> 00:46:22.460
And he lives to be 107 years old.

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:25.790
His name is Hunting Horse in Kiowa.

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:29.210
And you can only imagine
what he must have seen

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:33.460
in his long lifetime during
a period of enormous change.

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:36.970
So here's a clip of
him speaking in Kiowa.

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:00.870
Yeah.

[ Singing in Foreign Language ]

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:32.570 position:56%
He's singing several types of
songs, and he doesn't start speaking

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:34.180
until a little bit later.

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:38.210 position:56%
I apologize, but the way that I made
the clips doesn't really transfer

00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:40.710
onto another person's computer.

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:42.340
I can fast-forward
it, but, of course,

00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:46.110
it's going to cause some
squealing in the meantime.

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:48.830
Do you think I should try
that or just leave it?

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:50.130
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Actually,
if you move the cursor.

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:52.170
Do you know that way
where the timecode is?

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:53.470
&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa Begay: Yes.

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:54.770
It's about 13.

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:58.620
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: There's 12:42, 13.

00:47:58.620 --> 00:47:59.920
&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa Begay: Okay.

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.220
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Let's try that.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:03.520
&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa Begay: Okay.

[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:39.280
I'm sorry.

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:42.890
I probably cut him off in
the middle of his sentence,

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:46.500
but as you can hear, he
has a very strong voice.

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:49.170
He's speaking in a
very animated way.

00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:52.100
And he speaks for several minutes.

00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:57.920
Some of these speeches are
combinations of just talking

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:01.820
about a certain topic, and
sometimes they'll go into a prayer.

00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:11.060
So I think this clip is -- I would
like to know what he's saying.

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.380
Really, it's a simple
matter of finding out.

00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:15.900
The Kiowa language
is taught on campus,

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:18.200
and so we have Kiowa instructors.

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:21.610
The campus's tribal
liaison is Kiowa,

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:26.430
and so he speaks the language.

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:32.520
And so the Library -- I'll talk
about this a little bit more,

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:36.530
but one of our things that we
need to do is to draw in some

of our colleagues from across campus

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:43.650

of these episodes, so.

The next one --

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:51.440
I'll just do one more.

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:54.210
And, again, I'm going to
have to advance it some.

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:58.510
I think I see how to do it now.

&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa Begay: Okay.

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:19.210
I'm going to pause
it just for a moment.

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:22.090
Thank you for bearing with me.

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:26.420
As I said, school groups
sometimes participated.

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:31.190
The Pawnee Indian School was a
frequent group that would come

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:33.580
and visit and perform on the show.

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:35.150
Sometimes they would sing.

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:37.040
In this particular clip,

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:40.920
the students are very
earnestly reading an essay

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:44.010
that they had written for school,
where the general team has --

00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:48.210
or general theme has to do with
advancement under education.

So this particular boy is
named Thomas Rough Face.

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:53.960

I am a member of the Ponca Tribe.

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:06.480
Indians today live in a world

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:11.360
where old conditions are
changing, rapidly changing.

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:15.430
Yeah, school conditions are
changing to new, modern ways.

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:17.850
Indians do not live
in tents and teepees

00:51:17.850 --> 00:51:21.480
out by themselves as
they used to do.

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:24.510
But they are living in
modern homes and must live

00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:27.070
and work under modern conditions.

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:31.280
Indians today, even our
stores, condition [inaudible]

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.580
on very large and good farms.

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:35.630
They earn their own money.

00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:39.010
Today you see Indians driving
around in very good cars,

00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:42.360
going into colleges,
and working in offices.

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:45.270
Indians get good jobs
and earn good money,

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:47.570
but do we know how to spend it?

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:53.400
&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa
Begay: So he goes on to talk

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:59.200
about how Indian people are
learning to use banks and also

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:02.970
in agriculture, learning
about erosion and so forth.

00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:06.450
This clip is from 1948, you know,

00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:10.230
some years after the Great
Depression and the dust storms

00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:11.890
in that part of the country.

00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:16.630
So, anyway, I just
wanted you to hear some

00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:18.940
of the participants' own voices,

00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:22.940
and get an idea the variety
that's in this radio program.

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:27.440
I'm going to go back
to the slideshow now.

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:29.890
How do I -- hit play?

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:31.190
Do I hit play?

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:32.490
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Yes, right there.

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:33.790
&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa Begay: Okay.

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:35.090
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Thank you.

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:36.390
&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa
Begay: All right.

00:52:36.390 --> 00:52:38.690
Thank you.

00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:44.980
The one clip that I didn't
play is Solomon Kent.

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:47.310
It's also from 1948.

00:52:47.310 --> 00:52:49.840
And he speaks about
honoring veterans,

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:54.260
and this is something that's very
important to Native Americans.

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:57.240
It's a frequent topic in the show.

00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:03.050
And I find his pattern of
speech very interesting

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:05.030
because it's repetitive.

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:11.290
It takes him like four
minutes to say

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:15.680
that around Memorial Day people
are remembering their loved ones

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:19.590
who have passed on, especially
soldiers who have served

00:53:19.590 --> 00:53:22.420
and given their life for their
country and for their families.

00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:25.190
And it's very moving.

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:28.930
I grew up hearing people
speak like this.

00:53:28.930 --> 00:53:30.230
I still do.

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:35.510
But, you know, working where
I do and in daily life,

00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:38.500
you don't hear people speak
like that quite so much.

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:43.970 position:56%
And so it's just interesting to
hear that type of pattern of speech.

00:53:48.110 --> 00:53:51.830
This is just a photograph
that was taken of the show.

00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:54.560
I'm assuming that it
happens around Christmas

00:53:54.560 --> 00:54:01.190 position:56%
because I think the design that's on
the lady's book is a Christmas tree.

00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:04.960
Unfortunately, in our files,
this couple is not identified,

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:09.850
and we don't have the date
of when the photo was taken.

00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:11.620
The show was extremely popular.

00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:12.920
It was from the beginning.

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.820
And it continued to be popular.

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:19.870
This article is from the
student newspaper in 1953.

00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:26.730
And then, unfortunately,
Whistler passed away in 1951.

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:29.270
And when he died, he was
still host of the show

00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:31.310 position:56%
and he was still Chief of the tribe.

00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:34.780
And so I'm assuming that
he passed away suddenly.

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:37.650
But the show continued
even after his death.

00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:40.680
It was sponsored by the Sequoyah
Club, which is the Indian Club

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:45.180
on campus, and its staff
sponsor was Boyce Timmons.

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:47.510
And they carried on
through the 1950s

00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:51.240
and the '60s and into
the early '70s.

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:55.330
The show had become kind of an
institution to Indian people

00:54:55.330 --> 00:54:57.920
across the state, I think.

00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:01.510
There are files of all these
requests that people had written

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:04.620
in for announcements that
they wanted on the show.

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:07.220
And sometimes people
would write in requesting

00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:08.650
to be placed on the schedule.

00:55:08.650 --> 00:55:10.750
They did this regularly.

00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:13.010
And so these are just
a few examples.

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:19.610
One of these is the Sequoyah Indian
Club announcing their homecoming

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:25.890
dance, the Native American Church,
the actual state organization,

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:28.380
announcing their annual meeting.

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:32.430
The signal evidently reached into
Kansas because we have a letter

00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:35.700
from the Wichita Intertribal
Club announcing a dance.

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:39.080
And then there's also other
correspondence that students

00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.030
from Haskell would write in.

00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:44.430
And also there were student
groups that would come

00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:46.870 position:56%
from Wichita to perform on the show.

00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:50.540
And then we have a whole lot
of these handwritten postcards

00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:55.220
where someone is just
announcing a birthday celebration.

00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:58.750 position:56%
They're going to play a hand game to
celebrate this young man's birthday.

00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:00.860
And this is more of the same.

00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:02.390
We even have an official --

00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:07.480
we have a government memo
wanting the open house

00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:12.040
for a new Indian Health
Service Unit to be announced.

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:15.670
The announcing a Veterans
Day celebration.

00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:18.940
And so Hominy, this
would be the Osage Tribe.

00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:22.830
And the Kiowa Gourd Clan
announcing one of their events.

00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:26.770
And they have their own beautiful,
very elegant-looking stationery.

00:56:26.770 --> 00:56:33.600
So it was just fascinating to
me to see the variety of forms

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:35.780
that people used to
request announcements.

00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:38.660
We have telegrams, too.

00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:44.850 position:56%
These particular requests all date
from the early '60s -- 1960 and '61.

00:56:44.850 --> 00:56:47.090
So the show's still very vital.

00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:55.030
This next one -- this is kind
of changing gears a little bit.

00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:58.590
It was from that same file, so I
assume it's from the early '60s.

00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:02.170
And it says, "It is a
matter of policy for WNAD

00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:05.680
to erase all tapes unless
specifically requested."

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:10.440
And so I think this explains why
we don't have recordings fro all

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:11.970
the episodes.

00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:14.220
OU has the most complete set.

00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:16.720
It's a very unique holding.

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:22.020
The Library of Congress has a
couple of reel-to-reel tapes

00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:25.110
that we do not have from 1943.

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:31.080
And they also have a copy
of reel-to-reels of the 1941

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:34.100
through 1951 shows that they made,

00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:39.150
because OU had sent the original
acetate disk here to be copied,

00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:42.650
and then they sent back
archival-quality copies

00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:44.800
on reel-to-reel.

00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:49.930
Unfortunately, it is not known
what happened to the acetate disk.

00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:54.680
Our records say that they were
retained by LOC for preservation.

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:57.860
And their records say that
they're returned to OU.

00:57:57.860 --> 00:58:00.170
And so I'm not blaming anyone.

00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:03.690
This has happened -- this has
been the case for a long time.

00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:07.580
But it's just a mystery what
happened to those original disks.

00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:09.410
And then as time went on,

00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:12.700
the originals are recorded
on reel-to-reels.

00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:16.430
But we don't have all of them.

00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:18.690
You know, if you think about
it being a weekly show,

00:58:18.690 --> 00:58:21.060
there should be, you
know, many reels.

00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:24.770
But for the decade of the
'50s we only have about 30.

00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:27.330
It's the same situation
for the 1960s.

00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:31.020
And then we only have seven
or eight from the early 1970s.

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:35.210
And those tend to just be
the annual anniversary shows.

00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:38.440
But we also have about 30
that are labelled "unknown."

00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:42.080
And so, clearly, we need
to find out when they're

00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:45.940
from and what the content is.

00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:48.840
In the process of preparing
a grant proposal

00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:54.240
to have the reels digitized, I took
some photographs to send to some

00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:55.880
of the vendors, because I'm wanting

00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:59.510
to outsource the digitization
of this collection.

00:58:59.510 --> 00:59:04.650
I do not -- neither I nor my staff
have the expertise to do this.

00:59:04.650 --> 00:59:08.760
And so these are just a
couple of the photographs

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:10.540
that I had to send to them.

00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:14.590
And so their remarks were,
"The tape is coming unwound."

00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:16.430
"It's not fixed."

00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:18.710
"This is a preservation concern."

00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:21.440
On the right you can see the boxes.

00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:23.150
They're still in their
original boxes.

00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:26.520
We haven't rehoused them.

00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:32.050
We provide access to the
shows through cassette tapes.

00:59:32.050 --> 00:59:36.060
Copies were made to cassettes
in the late 1980s I believe.

00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:39.540
And that is what we use when
people come into our Reading Room

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:41.830
and request to listen to them.

00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:44.930
And they also -- that's what we use

00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:49.690
to digitize things just
on a one-off basis.

00:59:49.690 --> 00:59:55.090
This last slide just shows our
description, how much it can vary.

00:59:55.090 --> 00:59:57.280
And this is one of
the access problems

00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:59.690
that we experience
with this program.

00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:02.040
On the left we have one
that's very detailed.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.870
It lists all the performers.

01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:08.000
On the right it says,
"Singers, undated.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.960
Unidentified music and
dances on tape 128."

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:16.180
So it is true that we can
listen to the cassette tapes

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:18.070
and get all this information.

01:00:18.070 --> 01:00:20.210
But it needs to be
done systematically.

01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:22.900
And also, I have a concern that
the cassette tapes are close

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:25.520
to 30 years old, and
they going to break.

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:29.360
Also I have noticed the cassette
tapes are not always a faithful

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.970
reproduction of the reels.

01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:36.080
There's like one episode
will just be broken, right?

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:39.130
It will stop suddenly and
another one will start.

01:00:39.130 --> 01:00:42.620
So it's interrupted, so.

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:48.740
If you're interested in seeing the
inventory list, please contact me.

01:00:48.740 --> 01:00:50.670
I'd be happy to hear from you.

01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:56.380
And moving forward, like I said,
I'm trying to apply to CLIR,

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:59.640
to the Council on Library
and Information Resources,

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:03.850
to their Recordings at Risk Grant
Program, to have it digitized.

01:01:03.850 --> 01:01:06.320 position:56%
And also to get better descriptions.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.390
And we're also going to
feature the show in an exhibit

01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:12.900
in the Main Library next year,
and we're hoping that as part

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:17.290 position:56%
of that we'll be able to draw on
more members of the campus community

01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:20.900
and the state community to get
better descriptions for the show,

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:26.550 position:56%
and do a better job of preserving,
you know, this very unique treasure.

01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:29.510
So, thank you so much
for your attention.

01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:34.640
[ Applause ]

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.940
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Thank you, Lina,

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:40.350
for bring up some very interesting
dialog to this conversation.

01:01:40.350 --> 01:01:43.180
Michael, would you like to go next?

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:44.480
&gt;&gt; Michael Pahn: Sure.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:45.780
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Great.

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:47.080
You don't have to step up here.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.380
Whatever you'd like.

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:50.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Pahn: Oh, well, in that
case, I'll just stay right here.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.660
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Okay.

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:52.960
&gt;&gt; Michael Pahn: I'm Michael Pahn.

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.260
I'm the Head Archivist
at the National Museum

01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:55.940
of the American Indian,
and I was very gratified

01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:58.550
when I was asked to
be on this panel.

01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:00.100
Is this --

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.660
&gt;&gt; Simon Moya-Smith:
You've got to [inaudible].

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:03.460
&gt;&gt; Michael Pahn: Sorry.

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:07.870
I was gratified to be asked to be
on this panel, but I also was kind

01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:09.170
of confronted with the reality,

01:02:09.170 --> 01:02:14.550
which is that NMAI doesn't have
a lot of radio in our archive,

01:02:14.550 --> 01:02:17.640
which is kind of a
blind spot for us.

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:21.100
So I'm going to tell you a little
bit about the National Museum

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:23.730
of the American Indian Archive
and some radio programming

01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:28.640
that we have done as a museum, and
then talk about why I think we need

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:32.270
to turn our attention towards
collecting radio programming.

01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:35.920
So the National Museum of the
American Indian became part

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:39.990
of the Smithsonian in 1990,
but the actual origins

01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:42.350
of the institution date
back far longer than that.

01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:45.280
George Gustav Heye,
who founded the museum,

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:51.800
began collecting Native American
material culture in the late 1890s,

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.620
and almost from the
beginning conceived

01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:58.800
of his collection as a museum.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:03.020
And then did actually
open a museum in 1916.

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:11.390
And his concept, as was sort of
the fashion of the day, I guess,

01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:15.520
was that Native Americans
were a dying people.

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:25.360
They were going to be assimilated
into mainstream culture.

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:29.580
All evidence of their
heritage would be obliterated,

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:33.230
and it was up to wealthy
white people like him

01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:37.400
to collect the evidence
of their heritage

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.820
and make it available
to other white scholars.

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:43.120
And for decades, that's
how they proceeded.

01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:47.990
I think that one of the really
fascinating and maybe untold,

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:52.010
or undertold parts of the
story of the National Museum

01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:53.960
of the American Indian
is that transformation

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:57.400
from being an institution
largely for white people

01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:01.610
by white people intended
for, you know,

01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:08.060
sort of a colonialist audience, to
being an institution run largely

01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:14.360
by Native People, who conceives of
our audience and our constituency

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:17.040
as being the Native People
of the Western Hemisphere,

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:24.070
that we are an institution
dedicated to documenting the lives

01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:29.740
of the Native People of the Western
Hemisphere and largely in support

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:31.450
of revitalizing those cultures,

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:37.390
of making cultural heritage
available to community members.

01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:41.820
So we very much think of
ourselves as the stewards

01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:46.380
of the cultural heritage
of the Western Hemisphere.

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:52.220
When George Gustav Heye began
the museum, and for many,

01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:57.810
many years after that, they
were really focused on this kind

01:04:57.810 --> 01:05:03.890 position:56%
of unrealistic idea that there was
sort of a perfect moment in the past

01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:07.700
that truly represented what Native
People's lives were really like,

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:11.040
and that they were going to
collect and document that stuff.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:17.690
And so, for a long time, archival
materials were not really part

01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:21.880
of the picture because they were
looking for archeological materials

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:26.240
or some sort of ethnographic
materials that met a kind

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:32.270
of standard that they
as curators set.

01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:35.630
So our collections, our archival
collections, are not nearly

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:41.930
as robust or as historical as
our material culture collections.

01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:45.920
And we also have the benefit of
being part of the Smithsonian

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:48.240
which has the National
Anthropological Archive

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:52.570 position:56%
which dates back to, you know, their
collections date back to the 1860s.

01:05:52.570 --> 01:05:55.130
So we don't try to collect
anthropological records.

01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:59.030
So in terms of the archives in
the Museum of the American Indian,

01:05:59.030 --> 01:06:03.720
we've kind of been
triangulating towards a niche.

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:08.510
And that niche is that we
document the contemporary lives

01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:11.050
of the Native People of
the Western Hemisphere,

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:19.800
and seek to demonstrate the
connections that people make,

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:23.460
and the context that they're
contemporary lives have

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:24.760
with their traditions.

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:30.710
And so we do this by collecting
the personal papers of artists

01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:34.760
and writers and leaders
and activists,

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.970
and the organizational records

01:06:36.970 --> 01:06:41.520
of Native American Civil
Rights Organizations

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:44.320
such as the National Congress
of the American Indian.

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:48.600
We have about 50 years
worth of their papers.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:55.460
So what I'm kind of
driving at is that we seek

01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:59.460
to contextualize people's
contemporary lives

01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:04.720
and how the traditions that
they have been raised in

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:08.130
and the continuity of
Native culture informs those

01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:09.550
contemporary experiences.

01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:15.070
Well, radio is a really
great medium for that.

01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:18.100
It's interesting that I
learned about the <i>Indians</i>

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:21.020
<i>for Indians Hour </i>because
one of our staff people,

01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:22.320
a man named Ed Shoopman
[assumed spelling],

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:26.740
who runs our National
Education Initiative,

01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:29.370
used to work at the Library
of Congress in the 1970s,

01:07:29.370 --> 01:07:33.060
and I believe that he's the person
who might have been responsible

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:38.870
for having the Library of Congress
preserve those acetate recordings,

01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:42.680
because he told me about going to
Oklahoma and hearing the <i>Indians</i>

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:49.600
<i>for Indians Hour </i>, and -- I mean,
what a perfect example of how --

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:52.680
if people throughout the world,

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:54.060
and the Western Hemisphere's
no different,

01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:59.790
they've always used the technology
and the mediums at their disposal.

01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:01.450
This gets to what you
were talking about,

01:08:01.450 --> 01:08:04.970
about newspapers and broadcasting.

01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:12.390
So we do have collections
of media producers.

01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:14.130
We have, for instance, the records

01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:18.800 position:56%
of a really fabulous Native American
filmmaker and documentarian,

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:25.870 position:56%
Phil Lucas, who made really
terrific programs in the late 1970s.

01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:30.300
He made a series of television
programs about the portrayal

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:33.540
of Indians in Hollywood
and on television, and if,

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:37.730
when you watch this, images on
Indians -- when you watch it today,

01:08:37.730 --> 01:08:42.910
it is exactly as current
and informative

01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:44.360
as it was when it was made.

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:48.790
I mean, which is kind of a sad
statement about the progress

01:08:48.790 --> 01:08:53.620
that mainstream media has made
in representing Native People.

01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:57.210
But he did a really great job
of making a fantastic series

01:08:57.210 --> 01:08:59.120
of documentaries about that.

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:04.410
The Museum of the American Indian
has made, as far as I am aware of,

01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:07.560
only one foray into radio
production ourselves.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.430
And it was in the late 1990s.

01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:12.380
I believe they were
published in 2001.

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.910
It's a series called <i>Living
Voices </i>, and it was produced

01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:19.210
by two long-time staff
people, Elizabeth Weatherford,

01:09:19.210 --> 01:09:23.710
who just recently retired, but
for over 30 years ran our Film

01:09:23.710 --> 01:09:29.390 position:56%
and Video Public Program., and
Keevin Lewis, who also just retired.

01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:37.440
But Keevin ran a really great
program, bring Native artists

01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:43.320
into work with collections which
is just a really special thing

01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:44.620
about NMAI.

01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:47.740
It's one of the more gratifying
things about working there.

01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:53.350
So <i>Living Voices </i>was 40
Dort profiles of Native people

01:09:53.350 --> 01:09:57.160
and leaders, contemporary leaders.

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:58.800
It's kind of assembled
from more than,

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.250
I think, 100 separate interviews.

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:05.920
And in addition to the 40
episodes that are in English,

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:09.160
20 of them were also in Spanish,

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.810
because as I mentioned
several times,

01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:14.320
we are a hemispheric organization.

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:19.180
We represent and collect --

01:10:19.180 --> 01:10:21.860
people, Native people of the
entire Western Hemisphere,

01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:23.210
including Hawaii.

01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:26.690
We don't actually collect Hawaiian
materials, but we do programming

01:10:26.690 --> 01:10:30.180
about Hawaiian, Native
Hawaiian people.

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:36.920
So that program, <i>Living Voices</i>
, is freely available online.

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:38.220
You can listen to it.

01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:41.110
You can buy CDs or
DV -- no, not DVDs.

01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:43.310
Just CDs of it.

01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:45.240
But the original recordings

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:48.190
and the production
materials are also available.

01:10:48.190 --> 01:10:54.040
I mean, obviously, these
are in-depth interviews

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.340
that were edited down.

01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:57.860
That's sort of the nature
of media production.

01:10:57.860 --> 01:11:02.030
So we are aware, as an institution,

01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:04.840
of the value of broadcasting,
of the value of radio.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:08.380
It isn't an area that
we have collected

01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:10.000
with a great deal of focus.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.130
But I ask all of you,
as participants

01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:17.270
in the Radio Preservation
Taskforce and people who think

01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:20.270
about this all the time, to please
think of the National Museum

01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:24.650
of the American Indian as a
repository for radio programming.

01:11:24.650 --> 01:11:29.470
We are fortunate to
have a really fabulous,

01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:33.630 position:56%
incredible collections facility, the
Cultural Resources Center located

01:11:33.630 --> 01:11:36.740
in Suitland, Maryland,
about seven miles from here.

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:38.300
That's where the archive is based.

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:43.540
And we have the infrastructure
of the Smithsonian to help us

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:44.970
with our preservation concerns.

01:11:44.970 --> 01:11:49.300
So please think and
help me learn more

01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:53.520
about indigenous radio programming
and collecting opportunities.

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:58.260
So, I'm here, and if you'd like to
contact me, I have business card,

01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:01.640
and would love to hear from
you and speak with you,

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.900
and learn about the
potential collaborations

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:07.730
or collections that
may be out there.

01:12:07.730 --> 01:12:09.530
Thank you.

01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:18.550
Simon, would you like to
make some remarks next?

01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:19.850
&gt;&gt; Simon Moya-Smith: [Inaudible].

01:12:19.850 --> 01:12:24.000
Sorry, I'm usually on my
third cappuccino by now,

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:32.210
so I only had a small black
coffee, so this is painful.

01:12:32.210 --> 01:12:34.010
Oh.

01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:41.250
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

01:12:41.250 --> 01:12:42.570
My name is Simon Moya-Smith.

01:12:42.570 --> 01:12:45.650
I'm a reporter, I think.

01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:49.110
And I'm not objective.

01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:50.430
I give my opinion.

01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:52.770
I bring the Native lens, you know.

01:12:52.770 --> 01:12:56.080
I mean, that's the thing, is I --
somebody once asked me if I was a,

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.740
you know, so you cover
Indian Country.

01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:59.040
You just cover Native news.

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:03.420
Like, no. I'm a Native reporter and
I bring the Native lens to news.

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:07.360
And, you know -- by the way, happy
Native American Heritage Month.

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.740
It is. This is Native
American Heritage Month.

01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:17.010
This is the time where we get to
recognize us and our resilience,

01:13:17.010 --> 01:13:20.490
that we survived the
Founding Fathers.

01:13:20.490 --> 01:13:23.210
We survived westward expansion.

01:13:23.210 --> 01:13:26.630
We survived boarding
schools, massacres,

01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:29.110
murders, rapes, all of it.

01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:31.840
And this is the time where
we get to celebrate the fact

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:35.600 position:56%
that we survived all of these people
who have statues to themselves all

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:39.120
over this district of
Christopher Columbus.

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:40.420
And people forget that.

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:42.040
People don't -- I mean, we just go

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:45.340
and just say Washington,
D.C. No, it's Columbia.

01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:48.590
This is the District of
Christopher Columbus.

01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:49.890
And what's the sports mascot?

01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:55.750
I mean, think of the message that
we're sending to people every day,

01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:58.390
so know that we're in the
District of Christopher Columbus,

01:13:58.390 --> 01:14:05.020 position:56%
and the sports mascot is a reference
to a time where we were bountied.

01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:09.940
And at the same time, we're the
most likely to be killed by cops.

01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:11.630
And people don't know that.

01:14:11.630 --> 01:14:14.270
We're here talking
about media, right?

01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:16.910
And the fact that we're
so still cancelled

01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:21.240
out of the American
conversation across the board.

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.060
I've gotten phone calls

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:25.610
from my fellow African
American colleagues saying, hey,

01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:27.060
I'm about to go on <i>Fox Business </i>.

01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:28.660
Can you tell me a little
bit about natives?

01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:29.960
I'm about to talk with them.

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.880
It's like, then why
are you going on?

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:33.530
Nobody -- I wouldn't do that.

01:14:33.530 --> 01:14:34.830
I wouldn't do that.

01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:37.750
I wouldn't call my African
American colleague and say, hey,

01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:39.480
I'm going to go and talk
about Black Lives Matter.

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:42.140
No, it would be like I would sit
down and you should be doing this.

01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:46.760
But that's the problem is that
we are the uncomfortable reminder

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:50.950
of what this country has done, is
doing, and will continue to do,

01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:55.400
unless we're included
in these discussions.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:58.550
So one that I -- I
just wanted attention.

01:14:58.550 --> 01:15:03.450
One thing I'd like to start
doing though is I like to --

01:15:03.450 --> 01:15:05.330
we have to recognize that all

01:15:05.330 --> 01:15:09.110
of us are sitting here right now
still on indigenous territory.

01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:11.690
And they are not here,
predominantly not

01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:14.300
because they decided
to leave voluntarily.

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:17.480
That just because they
weren't white Christian,

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:20.080
they were aggressively
and forcibly removed.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:24.500
So let's recognize that we are
all right now, because I'm Oglala.

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:28.980
My people are in the Pine Ridge Res
in South Dakota in the Black Hills.

01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:34.210 position:56%
Even I'm a beneficiary of aggressive
Native removal in this territory.

01:15:34.210 --> 01:15:37.320
So we need to recognize our
privilege in that sense.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:38.800
And we hear that all
the time, you know.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:42.670
It's like, oh, my family's had
this home for six generations.

01:15:42.670 --> 01:15:45.140
Well, it's still Indian
land, you know.

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:47.860
And we like to talk about, oh,
my people are like, you know --

01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:53.250
I used to hang a lot with
a lot of veterans in Denver

01:15:53.250 --> 01:15:54.550
because my grandpa was a veteran.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:55.980
So I'd go to these
places and they'd say, oh,

01:15:55.980 --> 01:15:57.280
we've always fought
for this country.

01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:59.220
No, you haven't always
fought for this country.

01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:01.320
Because this hasn't
always been an America.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:05.320
There are restaurants in Italy,
still pumping out biscotti,

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:08.750
that are older than this nation.

01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:10.880
And we missed that in the language.

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:17.210 position:56%
And that's, I guess, my part in this
is that the Native voice and lens

01:16:17.210 --> 01:16:20.590
and language, that's
what we're talking about.

01:16:20.590 --> 01:16:23.170
The preservation of some of
our languages that are on --

01:16:23.170 --> 01:16:27.420
that like some elders will
not speak because of trauma.

01:16:27.420 --> 01:16:31.190
My Master's thesis
included an Oglala woman

01:16:31.190 --> 01:16:35.480
who would not speak the language
because she was so traumatized,

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:38.260 position:56%
because she went through boarding
schools that gave her a sick feeling

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:41.530
in her stomach to even
speak her language.

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:44.240
It was so traumatic.

01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:48.780
And so I didn't plan
on being a journalist.

01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:52.070
I just thought how white people
use language was to fickle,

01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:53.370
and it was entertaining to me

01:16:53.370 --> 01:16:56.320
that they could say
something and not mean that.

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:59.910
And I'm like, okay, I have
to figure these people out.

01:16:59.910 --> 01:17:02.320
And that's when I -- and I
knew that as a kid because I --

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:03.620
well, that's not what I meant.

01:17:03.620 --> 01:17:06.810
This is what I said, but
that's not what I meant.

01:17:06.810 --> 01:17:10.650
And that was so interesting
to me that it was so fickle,

01:17:10.650 --> 01:17:14.400
it was so thin, and
it melts in water.

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.720
And that was that -- that became --

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:18.590
I, again, didn't plan
on being a reporter.

01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:21.350
I actually was a speech writer
for a state senator trying

01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:23.560
to repeal Columbus Day in Colorado

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:26.980
where the holiday was founded
by Irish, not Italians.

01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:28.920
Remember that.

01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:32.840
And I was offered a position
with <i>The Rocky Mountain News </i>.

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:37.600 position:56%
And then I realized how much the
Native language and lens pushes back

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:42.270
against the American narrative
and makes people uncomfortable.

01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:44.000
And yet we're the ones
that are referenced

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.640
as being politically correct.

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:47.350
We're not politically correct.

01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:49.490
If you want to read
anything politically correct,

01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:52.050
get an American History textbook.

01:17:52.050 --> 01:17:53.350
And, sorry.

01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:56.690
I'm under strict rules not to cuss,

01:17:56.690 --> 01:17:58.870
and sometimes when
you get get fired up.

01:17:58.870 --> 01:18:01.300
I don't know many people
who get fired up

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:04.140
and say what the heck [laughter].

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:08.240
So, you know, I got in trouble
for something, actually, you know.

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:11.860
That's how I got into journalism
was I was pulled into an office

01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:14.020
at the Colorado State Capitol, and
they said, you wrote this thing

01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:17.310 position:56%
about Columbus Day, and you can't do
that, and you need to take it down.

01:18:17.310 --> 01:18:21.240 position:56%
And if you want a future in politics
here, you got to take that down.

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:22.860
I'm like, [hand-clap],
I'm not an editor.

01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:24.160
I filed you.

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:25.460
You got to talk to my editor.

01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:27.750
But I realized how that
shook the foundation

01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:30.350
of what people think
they know, right?

01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:33.900
And listen to the language that
we've agreed on certain things.

01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:36.590
You know, for example, we
know that the R word --

01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:39.500
I'm not going to say it,
the name of the team here --

01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:42.140
is a racial slur that
means proof of Indian kill.

01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:46.880
But yet you can go on CNN,
anywhere, NPR, across the board,

01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:52.470
and people will say some
people believe it's a slur.

01:18:52.470 --> 01:18:57.960
Really? The fact that -- how we -
it's like the idea of it is defined

01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:01.880
as such, yet we make
this argument why?

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:04.660
You have to put this
qualifier in there why.

01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:08.260
And it's the same thing
when it comes to photos.

01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:11.340
If you just on on any website
and it's an Indigenous person

01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:14.880 position:56%
in regalia, those still say costume.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:19.030
We just saw the tape of a young man
in the '40s trying to teach people

01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:24.500 position:56%
who he was then, and we're still
having that same conversation today.

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:26.460
Why aren't you listening?

01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:29.990
Why is it so hard when
the Native voice comes?

01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:31.320
Why does it make people shudder?

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:35.190
Because it calls into
question privilege.

01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:40.230
The idea that the Indigenous People
did survive everything that --

01:19:40.230 --> 01:19:41.530
it's Thanksgiving, right?

01:19:41.530 --> 01:19:45.220
People don't want to talk about
the idea that we saved them.

01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:47.780
That they were cannibals.

01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:50.700
They literally weren't
digging and planting crops.

01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:52.550
They were digging and
looking for gold.

01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:54.970
So when it came time to
eat, you know what they did.

01:19:54.970 --> 01:19:56.590
And this is factually true.

01:19:56.590 --> 01:20:01.410
They dug up Indian
graves and ate the flesh.

01:20:01.410 --> 01:20:03.810
That's Thanksgiving.

01:20:03.810 --> 01:20:07.310
We took care of them while
they were stealing from us.

01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:12.210
And after a plague fell through in
the area, there's this whole idea

01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:14.530
that the Pilgrims showed up
and that they tilled the --

01:20:14.530 --> 01:20:16.090
they didn't till anything.

01:20:16.090 --> 01:20:18.960
The came and the land
was already ready to go.

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:22.310
But a plague came through because
of the Spanish and the Dutch.

01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:24.390
This is the story, our lens.

01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:26.670
Again, our voice.

01:20:26.670 --> 01:20:29.500
It's very uncomfortable for
people to take all of this

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.160
in because it does call

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:35.290
into question everything
you think you know.

01:20:35.290 --> 01:20:38.350
I mean -- and I made some notes
here, but I just really want

01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:42.840
to emphasize that now we are
taking media and using it

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:46.940
to provide you the truth,
because it has been used before

01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:49.680
against us, propaganda.

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:53.020
Everybody knows <i>Wizard
of Oz </i>, right?

01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:54.320
Frank L. Baum.

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:56.110
Do you know what he used to write?

01:20:56.110 --> 01:20:57.680
He used to write columns
about how we need

01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:59.350
to kill Native Americans,
all of them.

01:20:59.350 --> 01:21:00.650
We've wronged them.

01:21:00.650 --> 01:21:02.680
There was a Dorothy and, you
know, it was okay, but --

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:03.980
we're going to kill Indians.

01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:05.550
That's literally what he did.

01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:08.610 position:56%
He was writing this beautiful little
story that everybody likes to show

01:21:08.610 --> 01:21:10.310
to their kids, while
this guy was calling

01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:12.230
for the genocide of
Native Americans.

01:21:12.230 --> 01:21:15.230
Media was used against
us to demonize us

01:21:15.230 --> 01:21:17.550
and strike fear in people.

01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:20.320
Now we get to use it to
provide you the truth,

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:22.870
that we aren't merciless
Indian savages as it's written

01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:25.630
in the Declaration of Independence.

01:21:25.630 --> 01:21:29.080
So we have this opportunity
to even close the gap

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:30.550
that they tried with reservations.

01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:32.530
Out of sight, out of mind.

01:21:32.530 --> 01:21:35.280
But now there's that
geographic distance isn't there

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:39.670
when you have -- Jesus --
when you have this, right?

01:21:39.670 --> 01:21:43.120
I mean, now you have the
Native voice in your pocket,

01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:46.790 position:56%
whether that's written, whether
that's photography, just right away.

01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:49.660
So I think one of the problems

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:54.680
that we're still facing is
just getting the Native voice

01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:55.980
like welcomed.

01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:57.560
I'm sorry to say that.

01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:58.860
Just welcomed.

01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:00.250
Like the Native lens about these.

01:22:00.250 --> 01:22:03.200 position:56%
You guys can probably go to a
website right now and read something

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:05.410
about like a diversity list.

01:22:05.410 --> 01:22:06.710
And we're not included.

01:22:06.710 --> 01:22:08.290
We're still in the other category.

01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:11.740
We haven't even moved out
of the other category yet.

01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:13.120
You can go in a room and people --

01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:17.000
like I was at NBC News and they
were celebrating their diversity.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.020
And they went down the
whole diversity list

01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:20.370
and didn't mention Natives.

01:22:20.370 --> 01:22:24.440 position:56%
I was just at Columbia, Columbia
Journalism, where I got my master's.

01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:27.190
There's not one Native.

01:22:27.190 --> 01:22:29.780
I mean these are real problems,
and it sucks that we have

01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:33.660
to take it upon ourselves to launch
our own websites, our own podcasts,

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:36.290
to talk about race
and police brutality

01:22:36.290 --> 01:22:38.610
and sexual assault, all of that.

01:22:38.610 --> 01:22:40.320
Why aren't we included?

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.680
That's the question.

01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:45.720
Why are Native Americans
still cancelled

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.430
out of the American conversation?

01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:50.200
What does that serve?

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:52.250
It doesn't serve anything
for any of us.

01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:53.790
If anything, it affects
the situation.

01:22:53.790 --> 01:22:59.400
So, I can go on like
this, and I won't.

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:01.040
But I will take questions later.

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:07.870 position:56%
I think the last thing I did want
to say was that my focus of my work,

01:23:07.870 --> 01:23:11.400
again, is to provide also a
platform for other Natives.

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:14.500
So when I was at, you know -- well,
<i>Indian Country Today </i>is on hiatus,

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:17.550
and that sucks because
that was a huge platform.

01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:21.210
And so you imagine all the stories
that are not being told right now,

01:23:21.210 --> 01:23:24.890
and all the shit, sorry, all
the stuff that's happened

01:23:24.890 --> 01:23:28.180
in the past month-and-a-half,
and all of those stories

01:23:28.180 --> 01:23:31.210
that aren't being told in
our -- about our communities.

01:23:31.210 --> 01:23:34.840 position:56%
And I've tried to provide that
platform to people any time I could,

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:36.940
whether it was at Standing
Rock or, you know,

01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:39.100
if it's Oak Flat, et cetera.

01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:42.290
Now my question is, you know,
where are you getting it?

01:23:42.290 --> 01:23:46.910
Where do you guys -- where are
you guys getting your Native news?

01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:48.210
Can you go to the <i>New York Times </i>?

01:23:48.210 --> 01:23:51.190 position:56%
Can you -- where are you getting it?

01:23:51.190 --> 01:23:53.680
And think about that.

01:23:53.680 --> 01:23:55.290
Anyway. I'm done.

01:23:55.290 --> 01:23:57.090
I'm done.

[ Applause ]

&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: For
someone with that --

01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:06.430
for someone with one cup of
coffee, that's pretty fired up.

Oh, yeah [laughter].

01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:11.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: And also, I think it
just really reemphasizes why we're

01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:14.600
here and talking about this,
the importance of these stories

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:18.020
that have their roots
so far back and

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:21.310
yet how much work there
is yet to do.

01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:23.500
Amalia, could you yet come here.

01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.950 position:56%
Let me just log back in really fast.

01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:28.450

ready to go.

keeping an eye on the time.

&gt;&gt; Amalia Cordova: Yes.

01:24:35.110 --> 01:24:36.410
Maybe 10 minutes.

01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:37.710
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Yeah?

01:24:37.710 --> 01:24:39.010
Thank you.

01:24:39.010 --> 01:24:40.310
&gt;&gt; Amalia Cordova: How
do I make this doable?

01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:41.610
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: You
just start working.

01:24:41.610 --> 01:24:42.910
&gt;&gt; Amalia Cordova: Okay.

01:24:42.910 --> 01:24:44.210
Yeah. Okay, there we go.

01:24:44.210 --> 01:24:45.510
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Yeah.

01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:46.810
All right.

01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:48.110
&gt;&gt; Amalia Cordova: Thank you.

01:24:48.110 --> 01:24:49.410
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

01:24:49.410 --> 01:24:50.710
I'm Amalia.

01:24:50.710 --> 01:24:52.010 position:56%
I'm greeting you in [foreign words],
which is the Mapuche language

01:24:52.010 --> 01:24:53.890
from the [foreign words] territory
which is currently known as Chile

01:24:53.890 --> 01:24:56.290
in Argentina, which
is where I was born.

01:24:56.290 --> 01:24:58.060
And I'm a language learner still.

01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:01.640
And I want to also acknowledge
the traditional territory there,

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:04.760
Piscataway Nation, in which
we are gathered here today.

01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:07.150
And I think Simon's
presentation just, you know,

01:25:07.150 --> 01:25:11.600
opens up some of the struggles
that are happening across the rest

01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:15.090
of the hemisphere in terms
of the right to communication

01:25:15.090 --> 01:25:17.980
which is very tied to
the right to exist.

01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:23.430
I've been working with Native
media through video mostly.

01:25:23.430 --> 01:25:26.580
But there's a predecessor
of video in Latin America

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:29.250
in particular, which
is Native radio.

01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:36.780
In many places in Latin America the
Native radio initiative are illegal

01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:38.770
because of the concessions
of the air space.

01:25:38.770 --> 01:25:40.540
So a lot of the radio
is pirate radio

01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:43.410
or radio is working
on borrowed space.

01:25:43.410 --> 01:25:46.560
And radio is also a space
that's really important

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:49.710
because it's more affordable
than video in making a film.

01:25:49.710 --> 01:25:53.980
And it's also -- it can be deployed
at any time once something happens.

01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:57.660
And something did happen
recently on October 8, 2017.

01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:01.270
Radio Producer, Efigenia
Vasquez, was shot and killed

01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:03.730
at a [inaudible] traditional
territories

01:26:03.730 --> 01:26:05.720
in the southern Colombia
[foreign work].

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:09.730
So I've been on that radio
like a month-and-a-half before,

01:26:09.730 --> 01:26:13.240
and [foreign words] radio which
reaches not just the community,

01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:15.770
but spills over into the
local city of [foreign words].

01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:17.940
And, again, it's an important
channel, just like [inaudible]

01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:21.480
and all the other wonderful
[inaudible] we've heard about today

01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:23.960
of really getting the
lowdown, the real story

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.920
on what's happening
in our communities.

01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:28.020
And these land occupations
that were happening

01:26:28.020 --> 01:26:31.060
in traditional territory
are to get back land

01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:33.470
that the government has
already promised to return

01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:36.170
through constitutional recognition
of Indigenous Territories

01:26:36.170 --> 01:26:38.030
and through specific agreements.

01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:43.310
And Efigenia was just covering the
land recovery and she was shot.

01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:46.750
So it's very sad that we
still have people who speak

01:26:46.750 --> 01:26:50.060
out are putting themselves in a
spotlight and in the frontlines

01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:51.770
and endangering their lives.

01:26:51.770 --> 01:26:53.070
So there's a lot at stake here.

01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:55.370
People are willing to do
anything to get the message

01:26:55.370 --> 01:26:58.840
out when it's about survival.

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:04.360
So local Indigenous radio is very
important for local organizing,

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.690
but increasingly we have a
migration to urban centers

01:27:07.690 --> 01:27:10.250
and those urban centers are not
always in our own countries.

01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:12.010
I, myself, migrated.

01:27:12.010 --> 01:27:16.880
So I wanted to talk a little bit
about the other Indigenous voices

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:20.240
in the airspace or in the web space
right here in the United States.

01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:22.650
And one of them is
called Kichwa Hatari.

01:27:22.650 --> 01:27:26.870
Kichwa Hatari is Kichwa-language
radio based out of the Bronx.

01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:30.280
And it's based out of
this wonderful basement

01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:36.580
that Segundo Angamarca was able
to access and create a studio

01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:39.960
and this became, along with
<i>First Voices Indigenous Radio </i>,

01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:43.670
the only Indigenous radio
programs out of New York City.

01:27:43.670 --> 01:27:46.790
And <i>First Voices Indigenous Radio</i>
is actually a program that has been

01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:50.520
on the air for a very long time
through the Pacifica Network run

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:51.820
by [inaudible] Ghost Horse.

01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:54.530
And his is a global Indigenous
program, so I've often gone

01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:56.400
to that radio to translate.

01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:58.270
I've brought participants
from the Native American Film

01:27:58.270 --> 01:28:01.790
and Video Festival who also bring
urgent stories from home to share.

01:28:01.790 --> 01:28:03.470
And I interpret on the air.

01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:06.840
So it's real interesting when
you have these collaborations

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.940
that allow us to hear what's
going on with our brothers

01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:10.870
and sisters across the continent.

01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:14.910
So Kichwa Hatari is kind of
a Latin American counterpart

01:28:14.910 --> 01:28:17.360
to <i>First Voices </i>, and
it's become a native space.

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:19.050
And they welcome hip-hop artists,

01:28:19.050 --> 01:28:21.150
whoever's visiting New York,
and it's multi-lingual.

01:28:21.150 --> 01:28:23.430
It's primarily in Spanish
and Kichwa,

01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:26.730
but they also welcome speakers
of the variance of Kichwa

01:28:26.730 --> 01:28:30.210
from across the seven countries in
the Andes that speak the language,

01:28:30.210 --> 01:28:32.700
but also if your [inaudible]
doesn't speak English,

01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:35.920
then they'll translate into
Spanish or Kichwa on the air.

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:37.220
And this is broadcast
via [inaudible] stereo

01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:43.780
on the Internet live, 8
o'clock at night on Fridays.

01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:45.560
So Kichwa Hatari has come

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:47.460
to the Folklife Festival
and we've had a pop-up.

01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:49.460
And they've been broadcasting
and teaching Kichwa

01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:52.450
and playing Andean music
and that's the first image.

01:28:52.450 --> 01:28:55.530
This was their stand out at the
Folklife Festival this summer.

01:28:55.530 --> 01:28:59.750
So it can be done now with other
means, but we have to also look

01:28:59.750 --> 01:29:03.990 position:56%
at language, not just as an isolate,
something that is spoken by a group

01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:06.040
of people in a remote region.

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.350
Kichwa is bringing people together.

01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:09.680
There's the diaspora of
migrants from the Andean area

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:11.970
and from the Amazonian
areas in Latin America.

01:29:11.970 --> 01:29:14.390
And they're coming together
because of the use of the language

01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:15.690
through the radio program.

01:29:15.690 --> 01:29:17.870
That's been a really
beautiful initiative.

01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:21.830
And then also in another way
connecting some of the topics

01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:23.180
that we've just heard today.

01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:24.940
I think scholarship
is really important.

01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:27.570
We have these archives that are
scattered, but it's the scholars

01:29:27.570 --> 01:29:30.140
who find out and sometimes
link them together

01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:31.690 position:56%
and can help produce better metadata

01:29:31.690 --> 01:29:34.700
so that we can actually
know what is where.

01:29:34.700 --> 01:29:36.930
So I think that's one
thing that has to happen.

01:29:36.930 --> 01:29:38.690
Everyone should -- all
these institutions --

01:29:38.690 --> 01:29:41.480
it's wonderful that OU has done it
-- should look inward and say well,

01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:44.250
what Native resources do I have,
and is it a special collection?

01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:45.550
Is it scattered?

01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:46.850
Is it even a collection?

01:29:46.850 --> 01:29:48.940
Are the resources just
sitting there, right?

01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:51.470
So that's something where NMAI, I
think, has a role to play in sort

01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:54.680
of advising on sort of how
do we pull a magnet through

01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:56.840
and just pull all the
Native resources together

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:58.610
and then start thinking
about tagging them

01:29:58.610 --> 01:30:00.080
in ways that are easy to find.

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:04.050
I trolled the whole Folkways
and Folklife website.

01:30:04.050 --> 01:30:08.080
But I found that a lot of
resources have the original names.

01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:09.630
For instance, I couldn't
find [foreign words],

01:30:09.630 --> 01:30:11.810
but I found Tarascan.

01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:15.760
So the sort of renaming, adding
that into the metadata is important

01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:17.950
to find your ancestors
in the archives.

01:30:17.950 --> 01:30:19.660
So I think that's an
important point, too.

01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:21.560
And the names of the
languages have also changed.

01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:24.950
As we use the languages of our
own creation and not the names

01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:28.850
that other people gave our
people or our languages.

01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:32.360
So this is [inaudible] I wanted
to share, too, which is --

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:34.390
there's a Mapuche scholar
who's the head

01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:37.040
of the Native Studies
Program now at Austin, Texas.

01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:40.540
And he's been working with
a radio show in Santiago,

01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:42.050
Chile, called <i>Wixage Anay </i>.

01:30:42.050 --> 01:30:44.120
It means wake up, get up.

01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:47.160
And it's been broadcast
continually, weekly,

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:49.510
since 1993 in Santiago, Chile.

01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:51.780
It was actually founded in '93.

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:54.170
And it's broadcast in
Spanish and Mapuzungun.

01:30:54.170 --> 01:30:57.140 position:56%
And the idea was to reach the
Mapuche audiences that have migrated

01:30:57.140 --> 01:31:01.130
to the city where they are
becoming assimilated and dispersed.

01:31:01.130 --> 01:31:04.210
So this is a radio show that really
has, again, [foreign word] Hatari,

01:31:04.210 --> 01:31:07.310
brought together communities
that are diasporized.

01:31:07.310 --> 01:31:09.510
Brought them together
through the language.

01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:11.540
And some people have even
revitalized the language

01:31:11.540 --> 01:31:15.100
by listening to the show because
it's completely bilingual, right?

01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:20.720 position:56%
So they have actually, since they've
been recording steadily for 24 years

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:23.190
on cassette, right,
they have an archive.

01:31:23.190 --> 01:31:29.540
And they've started a GoFundMe
campaign to raise $6000

01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:33.030
that they need just to build
a safe space for this archive.

01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:35.150
And they were working in
different radio stations.

01:31:35.150 --> 01:31:36.450
They didn't have their own station,

01:31:36.450 --> 01:31:38.590
so they had like a feminist
radio station sponsor them.

01:31:38.590 --> 01:31:41.010
Then somebody got a job at another
one; they'd move over there.

01:31:41.010 --> 01:31:42.310
They've been on Christian radios.

01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:45.730
I mean, they've just been wherever
they can be to broadcast, right?

01:31:45.730 --> 01:31:47.640
So I wanted to show this video.

01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:49.970
How do I do the notes?

01:31:53.070 --> 01:31:54.370
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: You want
to get out of Notes?

01:31:54.370 --> 01:31:55.670
&gt;&gt; Amalia Cordova: I
want to see my notes.

01:31:55.670 --> 01:31:57.050
I want to see this link.

01:31:57.050 --> 01:31:58.350
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: All right.

01:31:58.350 --> 01:31:59.650
Can I help?

01:31:59.650 --> 01:32:00.950
&gt;&gt; Amalia Cordova: Yeah.

01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:02.250
I think that's the --

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:03.550
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: I don't know how
to do how Melissa got her notes.

01:32:03.550 --> 01:32:04.850
&gt;&gt; Amalia Cordova: I
think it's presenter.

01:32:04.850 --> 01:32:06.150
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: But I
think you can get --

01:32:06.150 --> 01:32:07.450
&gt;&gt; Amalia Cordova: There.

01:32:07.450 --> 01:32:08.750
Okay. That's the Facebook.

01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:10.050
Thank you.

01:32:10.050 --> 01:32:11.350
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: There.

01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:12.650
&gt;&gt; Amalia Cordova: Okay.

01:32:12.650 --> 01:32:13.950
Can I click on that?

01:32:13.950 --> 01:32:15.250
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Yeah.

01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:16.550
&gt;&gt; Amalia Cordova: Will it come up?

01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:17.850
I have to copy it.

01:32:17.850 --> 01:32:20.270
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: And
then take [inaudible].

01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:23.430
And it's three minutes, right?

01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:24.730
&gt;&gt; Amalia Cordova: Yes.

01:32:24.730 --> 01:32:26.030
All right.

01:32:26.030 --> 01:32:27.330
That's it.

01:32:27.330 --> 01:32:28.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hello. I am Luis [foreign words].

01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:34.810
Now I have the honor to be in
the home of [foreign words]

01:32:34.810 --> 01:32:39.090 position:56%
in [foreign words], and their family
here in [foreign words] District

01:32:39.090 --> 01:32:45.340
in Santiago, the capital
city of Chile.

01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:50.450
And this is a moment for all
of us to thank all of you

01:32:50.450 --> 01:32:56.340
who have made contributions,
significant contributions,

01:32:56.340 --> 01:32:59.510
to help the [foreign words]
Radio Show, which I --

01:32:59.510 --> 01:33:17.510
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:18.810
&gt;&gt; Hello, everyone.

01:33:18.810 --> 01:33:22.430 position:56%
My name is [foreign words] and we
are so grateful for your cooperation

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:26.340
and contribution to this
show, radio program.

01:33:26.340 --> 01:33:31.190
Your cooperation is very important
for us to support our radio program

01:33:31.190 --> 01:33:32.490
which is called [foreign words].

01:33:32.490 --> 01:33:35.510
Thank you.

01:33:35.510 --> 01:34:18.660
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:22.490
&gt;&gt; Alysa [speaking in foreign
language] they have expressed their

01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:30.570
gratitude to all of you for your
contribution here in their home.

01:34:30.570 --> 01:34:33.300
Something else you want to add

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:36.200
about what Alysa mentioned,
and speak [inaudible].

01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:39.200
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: All
right, thank you.

01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:43.230
It's just 10:40, and maybe
we can share the link.

01:34:43.230 --> 01:34:44.530
It's on Facebook.

01:34:44.530 --> 01:34:46.610
It's this -- or their Kickstarter.

01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:47.940
&gt;&gt; Amalia Cordova: It's a GoFundMe.

01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:49.240
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: It's a GoFundMe.

01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:50.800
Okay. We can find them there.

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:53.140
I thank you so much,
Amalia [applause].

01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:54.950
I really appreciate
your contribution.

01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:57.800
And to the panel for just
having great patience

01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:00.870
with the technical,
technicalities here.

01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:02.510
And to you, our audience.

01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:05.110
Thank you so much for being here.

01:35:05.110 --> 01:35:10.350 position:56%
I'm sure some of the panelists are
here for questions if you have them.

01:35:10.350 --> 01:35:12.560
Unfortunately, due to our delay,

01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:15.840
we did not have time
to make time for Q&amp;A.

01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:17.140
But I think people --

01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:18.440
&gt;&gt; We have five minutes.

01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:19.740
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: We
have five minutes?

01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:21.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.340
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Oh,
we have five minutes.

01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:23.710
Okay. Oh, I thought that
the panel ended at 10:40.

01:35:23.710 --> 01:35:25.010
Okay, we have five minutes.

01:35:25.010 --> 01:35:28.790
So if there is a question
from the audience

01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:30.090
to any one of the panelists.

01:35:30.090 --> 01:35:32.390
Yes, in the back, please.

01:35:35.450 --> 01:35:38.210
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] with the
preservation of broadcast,

01:35:38.210 --> 01:35:52.040
is there a general belief that
there are recordings that exist

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:56.880
around the [inaudible] that one
might actually find some kind

01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:02.020
of concentrated effort
remains to do the search?

01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:11.740
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: So the question
is in terms of broadcast.

01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:13.940
Is there a searchability --

01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:15.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:16.540
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: -- protocol?

01:36:16.540 --> 01:36:18.700
&gt;&gt; Is there a belief that
there are recordings that exist

01:36:18.700 --> 01:36:22.240
that couldn't be found in
potentially [inaudible] --

01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:23.540
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Absolutely.

01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:24.840
&gt;&gt; -- in native [inaudible]?

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:26.140
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Yeah.

01:36:26.140 --> 01:36:27.440
Hmm.

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:28.740
&gt;&gt; Or is there a general belief

01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:30.040
that too much [inaudible]
necessarily lost [inaudible]?

01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:31.340
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Lina.

01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:32.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa Begay: Yes, I
do believe that there are recordings

01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:34.050
that exist that need to be found.

01:36:34.050 --> 01:36:38.600
I don't know that there's a whole
lot of them as far as the Indians,

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:40.470
where Indians or a
radio program goes.

01:36:40.470 --> 01:36:43.970
But it was an option
for participants

01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:46.020
to request a recording,
to request a tape.

01:36:46.020 --> 01:36:47.380
And so I'm sure that they did.

01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:50.550
And one of the things that I hope
the exhibit will accomplish is

01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:53.250 position:56%
to give us a forum for reaching out
more to the communities of the state

01:36:53.250 --> 01:36:55.720
to identify the photographs, to
help us develop better descriptions

01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:57.020
of the content, and
then also to identify

01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:59.320
if there are other tapes
that exist out there.

01:37:03.210 --> 01:37:07.210
OU does have an NEH-funded
grant right now that has to do

01:37:07.210 --> 01:37:09.660
with preserving music recordings.

01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:11.850
So it's not talking radio.

01:37:11.850 --> 01:37:19.390 position:56%
And they have not had a lot of
response to their surveys, you know,

01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:22.440
asking people what are the
issues with preserving some

01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:24.280
of your recordings that you have.

01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:29.650
So that's a different project,
but they're kind of related.

01:37:29.650 --> 01:37:32.270
I could talk to you more
at length if you want to.

01:37:32.270 --> 01:37:33.710
Yeah.

01:37:33.710 --> 01:37:35.180
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Yes, please.

01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:39.950
&gt;&gt; Why don't you choose in terms
of recordings or other kinds

01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:44.760
of cultural artifacts that would
touch the [inaudible] in terms

01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:49.820
of what other people
should have access to?

01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:52.630
You know, sometimes very
particularly usages --

01:37:52.630 --> 01:37:53.930
&gt;&gt; Lina Ortega Melissa
Begay: Oh, sure.

01:37:53.930 --> 01:37:55.230
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Well, I think
Lina touched on some of that, too,

01:37:55.230 --> 01:37:58.030
with her presentation in sort of
the ceremonies that were documented

01:37:58.030 --> 01:37:59.850
and really having that
kind of insight

01:37:59.850 --> 01:38:03.560
about what you actually
are coming across.

01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:06.160
Anyone on the - want
to speak to that?

01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:09.390
&gt;&gt; Simon Moya-Smith: I know I was
-- if we're talking about like even

01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:10.810
like language preservation.

01:38:10.810 --> 01:38:13.910
Anything like Rosetta Stone
who's making the money off that.

01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:16.920
You know. I mean, when I go into
a store and I see Rosetta Stone,

01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:18.760
and it's an indigenous language,

01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:21.810
and I'm like who gave
you permission, you know?

01:38:21.810 --> 01:38:23.430
Or did you do that on
your own, you know?

01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:25.930
And it's just like we see with
like our Inipi ceremonies,

01:38:25.930 --> 01:38:29.700
our sweat lodges, and that you
can see people charging $70 to go.

01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:31.210
And there was that, a
couple of years ago,

01:38:31.210 --> 01:38:32.510
where he killed a bunch of people.

01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:33.810
One guy did.

01:38:33.810 --> 01:38:35.700
So, I mean, it's about
being responsible.

01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:37.840
But the problem is
when it's our things,

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:40.750
people think they can just take
them, whether if our language,

01:38:40.750 --> 01:38:42.560
our ceremonies, everything.

01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:43.920
It's -- but they can't.

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:45.580
And we're trying to
push back against that.

01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:47.390
So, yeah, there's a
level of responsibility,

01:38:47.390 --> 01:38:49.970
but there is that sense of
privilege that I can just take this

01:38:49.970 --> 01:38:52.150
and do what I want with it.

01:38:52.150 --> 01:38:58.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; There was a presentation
yesterday by the [inaudible] people,

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:03.440
and they seem to have
created a space

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:06.860
where things can be
annotated and be searchable.

01:39:06.860 --> 01:39:08.500
But at the same time
restricted to [inaudible].

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:09.800
&gt;&gt; Michael Pahn: Yeah.

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:11.460
I think you're touching on the
concept of cultural sensitivity

01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:15.590
of like traditional knowledge
systems and, you know,

01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:20.290
a place like a university
or a museum, you know.

01:39:20.290 --> 01:39:23.780
In order to be responsible
stewards of materials we have

01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:27.320
to be responsive to those
kinds of community concerns.

01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:29.160
And it can be really complicated.

01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:35.240 position:56%
I mean there are thousands of Native
communities throughout the Americas,

01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:38.520
and, you know, there isn't
a single Native America.

01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:42.530
There are hundreds of
tribes and communities

01:39:42.530 --> 01:39:44.150
that believe different things.

01:39:44.150 --> 01:39:45.450
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: That's right.

01:39:45.450 --> 01:39:47.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Pahn: I think that the --

01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:52.560
maybe where this isn't as quite
as big an issue with radio is just

01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:54.400
that it's been broadcast
in the first place.

01:39:54.400 --> 01:40:00.400
I think a lot of people are
very sensitive to what goes

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:05.430
out to a broad audience
and what doesn't.

01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:10.070
Now, that is -- those attitudes
have changed over time.

01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:13.990
Maybe in the 1940s
people, even Native people,

01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:16.610
weren't as necessarily
concerned about that.

01:40:16.610 --> 01:40:19.030
But I think increasingly
that's something

01:40:19.030 --> 01:40:20.740
that people are really aware of.

01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:22.110
&gt;&gt; Amalia Cordova: And I
would add really briefly

01:40:22.110 --> 01:40:25.210
that that's why we have
organizations like the Association

01:40:25.210 --> 01:40:27.100
for Tribal Libraries,
Archives, and Museums,

01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:30.440
who are probably working
specifically on those topics.

01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:32.730
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Thank you,
Amalia and Michael, for that.

01:40:32.730 --> 01:40:34.030
&gt;&gt; Amalia Cordova:
There's one last question.

01:40:34.030 --> 01:40:35.330
&gt;&gt; Simon Moya-Smith:
There's a question.

01:40:35.330 --> 01:40:36.630
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Okay, quickly.

01:40:36.630 --> 01:40:42.000
&gt;&gt; I'm a native from Colombia,
South America, but I live in Texas.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:50.100
And I'm very glad to hear
that this kind of conversation

01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:52.440
and I am [inaudible] so
much of the -- what you say.

01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:57.040
I would like many more people to
have the opportunity to hear this.

01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:00.890
It breaks my heart
to see empty chairs.

01:41:00.890 --> 01:41:05.410
[Inaudible] reservation is not
only impending [inaudible].

01:41:05.410 --> 01:41:08.910
It's of the mind, especially
of the young.

01:41:08.910 --> 01:41:15.970
If we don't have some adults who
are interested in seeing this type

01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:20.120
of problem say -- I would say
many high schools in Texas

01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:27.890
and many other places will
be curious to be in a place

01:41:27.890 --> 01:41:30.330
like this that represents so much.

01:41:30.330 --> 01:41:34.860
And to hear some of the voices that
you have, just the preservation

01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:37.940
of the brain, the heart,
and a people.

01:41:37.940 --> 01:41:39.240
&gt;&gt; Simon Moya-Smith: Right on.

01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:40.540
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:41:40.540 --> 01:41:41.840
Muchas gracias.

01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:43.140
&gt;&gt; Jenni Monet: Thank you.

01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:44.440
And thank you everyone.

01:41:44.440 --> 01:41:45.740
I'm sure some of the
panelists are here

01:41:45.740 --> 01:41:47.040
for your questions if
you'd like to speak.

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:48.390
Thank you [applause].

01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:50.880
Thank you so very much for --

01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:54.520
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
