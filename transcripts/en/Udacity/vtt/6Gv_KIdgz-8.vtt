00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.780
Okay, let's take a quick look at the code.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.550
Here's where we entered the user argument, passed the

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.610
user argument. Here's where we check if the user

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.390
is now and if it is throw unauthorized exception. Here's

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.680
where we set the default display name if the

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.330
user doesn't submit it in the form. Yup and that's

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.420
all there is to it, so we've defined a

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.540
wonderful safe profile method except it doesn't actually save anything.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.040
The next lesson you are going to learn to use the data store to save your data.
