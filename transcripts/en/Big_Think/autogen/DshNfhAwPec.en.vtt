just as a quick background human

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059
just as a quick background human
 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.090
just as a quick background human
embryonic stem cells are very amazing

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:14.100
embryonic stem cells are very amazing
 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.980
embryonic stem cells are very amazing
cells I can make all cells in the human

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990
cells I can make all cells in the human
 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.720
cells I can make all cells in the human
body so that's anything you can think of

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730
body so that's anything you can think of
 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.650
body so that's anything you can think of
like brain or skin of a muscle this

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660
like brain or skin of a muscle this
 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.600
like brain or skin of a muscle this
seems not very interesting until you

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610
seems not very interesting until you
 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.990
seems not very interesting until you
begin to consider how if we can use stem

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000
begin to consider how if we can use stem
 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.180
begin to consider how if we can use stem
cells to treat or cure human disease and

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190
cells to treat or cure human disease and
 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.490
cells to treat or cure human disease and
human suffering and so if you think

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500
human suffering and so if you think
 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.220
human suffering and so if you think
about it lots of human diseases like

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230
about it lots of human diseases like
 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.390
about it lots of human diseases like
diabetes or Parkinson's disease or even

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400
diabetes or Parkinson's disease or even
 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.450
diabetes or Parkinson's disease or even
aging or because a certain kind of cell

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
aging or because a certain kind of cell
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.290
aging or because a certain kind of cell
in the human body is lost so for example

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300
in the human body is lost so for example
 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.049
in the human body is lost so for example
in diabetes your pancreatic cells are

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
in diabetes your pancreatic cells are
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.579
in diabetes your pancreatic cells are
lost and you can't make any more insulin

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589
lost and you can't make any more insulin
 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.460
lost and you can't make any more insulin
or in spinal cord injury you lose your

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470
or in spinal cord injury you lose your
 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.960
or in spinal cord injury you lose your
spinal cord cells and you can't move

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970
spinal cord cells and you can't move
 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.360
spinal cord cells and you can't move
anymore and this is very devastating so

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370
anymore and this is very devastating so
 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.640
anymore and this is very devastating so
if human embryonic stem cells can make

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650
if human embryonic stem cells can make
 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.410
if human embryonic stem cells can make
all cells in the human body then

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420
all cells in the human body then
 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.689
all cells in the human body then
theoretically if you have spinal cord

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699
theoretically if you have spinal cord
 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.460
theoretically if you have spinal cord
injury we could take human embryonic

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470
injury we could take human embryonic
 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.980
injury we could take human embryonic
stem cells making new infinite number of

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
stem cells making new infinite number of
 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.649
stem cells making new infinite number of
spinal cord cells and surgically put

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659
spinal cord cells and surgically put
 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.140
spinal cord cells and surgically put
them back into a spinal cord and restore

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150
them back into a spinal cord and restore
 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.090
them back into a spinal cord and restore
a function of that and try to bring

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100
a function of that and try to bring
 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.910
a function of that and try to bring
function back to your muscles and

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920
function back to your muscles and
 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.260
function back to your muscles and
conceptually we can extend this to any

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270
conceptually we can extend this to any
 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.149
conceptually we can extend this to any
range of disease and and I think that

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159
range of disease and and I think that
 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.429
range of disease and and I think that
many people really look to stem cells as

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439
many people really look to stem cells as
 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.419
many people really look to stem cells as
kind of a second generation of medicine

00:01:29.419 --> 00:01:29.429
kind of a second generation of medicine
 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:32.090
kind of a second generation of medicine
that right now we just give you drugs or

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
that right now we just give you drugs or
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.399
that right now we just give you drugs or
pills or shots that basically chemicals

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409
pills or shots that basically chemicals
 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.219
pills or shots that basically chemicals
that try to restore some kind of

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229
that try to restore some kind of
 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.380
that try to restore some kind of
biological function but with stem cells

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390
biological function but with stem cells
 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.580
biological function but with stem cells
what we're talking about is that if

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590
what we're talking about is that if
 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.639
what we're talking about is that if
you're missing cells that we can just

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649
you're missing cells that we can just
 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.940
you're missing cells that we can just
put them right back into you and that

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950
put them right back into you and that
 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.260
put them right back into you and that
this kind of treatment called

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270
this kind of treatment called
 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.999
this kind of treatment called
regenerative medicine we think is very

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009
regenerative medicine we think is very
 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.429
regenerative medicine we think is very
very cool

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439
 
 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.690
 
realistically that this might even be in

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700
realistically that this might even be in
 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.210
realistically that this might even be in
the decades range and so I think well

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220
the decades range and so I think well
 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.039
the decades range and so I think well
that this is somewhat disappointing many

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049
that this is somewhat disappointing many
 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.539
that this is somewhat disappointing many
animal experiments with diseases like

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549
animal experiments with diseases like
 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.910
animal experiments with diseases like
diabetes and Parkinson's disease have

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920
diabetes and Parkinson's disease have
 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.350
diabetes and Parkinson's disease have
already shown that stem cells have

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360
already shown that stem cells have
 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.979
already shown that stem cells have
remarkable ability to help treat or even

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989
remarkable ability to help treat or even
 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.830
remarkable ability to help treat or even
fully cure many kinds of diseases and

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840
fully cure many kinds of diseases and
 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.110
fully cure many kinds of diseases and
recently the FDA approved the shoot

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120
recently the FDA approved the shoot
 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.180
recently the FDA approved the shoot
first human embryonic stem cell based

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190
first human embryonic stem cell based
 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.729
first human embryonic stem cell based
clinical trial and this was for spinal

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739
clinical trial and this was for spinal
 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.800
clinical trial and this was for spinal
cord injury

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810
 
 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.059
 
I think that while it this has made it

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069
I think that while it this has made it
 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.589
I think that while it this has made it
sound human embryonic stem cells

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599
sound human embryonic stem cells
 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.600
sound human embryonic stem cells
sometimes remarkable as you probably

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610
sometimes remarkable as you probably
 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.990
sometimes remarkable as you probably
know there's a lot of ethical and moral

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000
know there's a lot of ethical and moral
 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.940
know there's a lot of ethical and moral
considerations about remember ionic stem

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950
considerations about remember ionic stem
 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.890
considerations about remember ionic stem
cells and I think the fact that they are

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900
cells and I think the fact that they are
 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.770
cells and I think the fact that they are
so clinically powerful but that they are

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780
so clinically powerful but that they are
 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.420
so clinically powerful but that they are
some that there's a lot of

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430
some that there's a lot of
 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.220
some that there's a lot of
considerations involved makes this very

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230
considerations involved makes this very
 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.339
considerations involved makes this very
complicated and this is because as the

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349
complicated and this is because as the
 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.350
complicated and this is because as the
world Shoom embryonic stem cell implies

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360
world Shoom embryonic stem cell implies
 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.540
world Shoom embryonic stem cell implies
that these cells are taken from a human

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550
that these cells are taken from a human
 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.050
that these cells are taken from a human
embryo and so I think very unfortunately

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060
embryo and so I think very unfortunately
 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.000
embryo and so I think very unfortunately
oftentimes when we take these human

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010
oftentimes when we take these human
 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.039
oftentimes when we take these human
embryonic stem cells from the MV o it

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049
embryonic stem cells from the MV o it
 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.509
embryonic stem cells from the MV o it
leads to the collapse of the human

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519
leads to the collapse of the human
 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.620
leads to the collapse of the human
embryo and so it can no longer develop

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630
 
 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.710
 
on is an alternative around this so

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720
on is an alternative around this so
 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.020
on is an alternative around this so
obviously there's a very big promise

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030
obviously there's a very big promise
 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.820
obviously there's a very big promise
with human embryonic stem cells how they

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830
with human embryonic stem cells how they
 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.460
with human embryonic stem cells how they
can help cure disease and that I think

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470
can help cure disease and that I think
 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.190
can help cure disease and that I think
that it'd be really awesome if we could

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200
that it'd be really awesome if we could
 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.680
that it'd be really awesome if we could
find a new way to get them without

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690
find a new way to get them without
 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.460
find a new way to get them without
having to destroy human embryo and so

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470
having to destroy human embryo and so
 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.560
having to destroy human embryo and so
recently there's a new technology called

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570
recently there's a new technology called
 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.930
recently there's a new technology called
the programming that's come up I told

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940
the programming that's come up I told
 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.060
the programming that's come up I told
you before that embryonic stem cells can

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070
you before that embryonic stem cells can
 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.490
you before that embryonic stem cells can
make all cells of the body and so what

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500
make all cells of the body and so what
 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.530
make all cells of the body and so what
we're thinking with reprogramming is of

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540
we're thinking with reprogramming is of
 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.500
we're thinking with reprogramming is of
what if we can turn any cell into an

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510
what if we can turn any cell into an
 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.380
what if we can turn any cell into an
embryonic stem cell the significance of

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390
embryonic stem cell the significance of
 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.250
embryonic stem cell the significance of
this is that if we can take any old cell

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260
this is that if we can take any old cell
 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.810
this is that if we can take any old cell
lying around and we can make it into an

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820
lying around and we can make it into an
 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.730
lying around and we can make it into an
embryonic stem cell then we can

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740
embryonic stem cell then we can
 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.740
embryonic stem cell then we can
basically make infinite amounts of human

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750
basically make infinite amounts of human
 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.450
basically make infinite amounts of human
embryonic stem cells without ever

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460
embryonic stem cells without ever
 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.250
embryonic stem cells without ever
touching a human embryo or harming a

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260
touching a human embryo or harming a
 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.150
touching a human embryo or harming a
human life and I think that this is a

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160
human life and I think that this is a
 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.430
human life and I think that this is a
big step to unlocking the widespread

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440
big step to unlocking the widespread
 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.800
big step to unlocking the widespread
usage and ethical usage of human

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810
usage and ethical usage of human
 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.900
usage and ethical usage of human
embryonic stem cells and that I know

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910
embryonic stem cells and that I know
 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.560
embryonic stem cells and that I know
that at least some politicians and

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570
that at least some politicians and
 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.970
that at least some politicians and
religious officials agree that this is a

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980
religious officials agree that this is a
 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.039
religious officials agree that this is a
very big step at Harvard we're very

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049
very big step at Harvard we're very
 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.110
very big step at Harvard we're very
interested in how it works and so that's

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120
interested in how it works and so that's
 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.630
interested in how it works and so that's
part of what I do that comes in there

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640
part of what I do that comes in there
 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.370
part of what I do that comes in there
are these three genetic switches that if

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380
are these three genetic switches that if
 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.610
are these three genetic switches that if
we turn on we believe we can make many

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620
we turn on we believe we can make many
 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.500
we turn on we believe we can make many
kinds of cells into human embryonic stem

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510
kinds of cells into human embryonic stem
 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.990
kinds of cells into human embryonic stem
cells or human embryonic like cells and

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000
cells or human embryonic like cells and
 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.350
cells or human embryonic like cells and
that this kind of reprogramming if we

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360
that this kind of reprogramming if we
 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.790
that this kind of reprogramming if we
want to bring it to the clinic we have

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800
want to bring it to the clinic we have
 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.500
want to bring it to the clinic we have
to thank how this is going to work how

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510
to thank how this is going to work how
 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.600
to thank how this is going to work how
we can take cells from patients and turn

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610
we can take cells from patients and turn
 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.750
we can take cells from patients and turn
them into stem cells and so there are

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760
them into stem cells and so there are
 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.790
them into stem cells and so there are
several ways to do this and very

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800
several ways to do this and very
 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.800
several ways to do this and very
unfortunately the biggest way right now

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810
unfortunately the biggest way right now
 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.960
unfortunately the biggest way right now
is to use viruses and that doesn't

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970
is to use viruses and that doesn't
 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.270
is to use viruses and that doesn't
really make sense because if we're using

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280
really make sense because if we're using
 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.100
really make sense because if we're using
viruses to make stem cells and we

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110
viruses to make stem cells and we
 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.720
viruses to make stem cells and we
eventually want to be able to use these

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730
eventually want to be able to use these
 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.330
eventually want to be able to use these
stem cells secure patients there's a

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340
stem cells secure patients there's a
 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.180
stem cells secure patients there's a
logical catch right there and so um

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190
logical catch right there and so um
 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.460
logical catch right there and so um
there's several other techniques but

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470
there's several other techniques but
 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.290
there's several other techniques but
what our group is trying to investigate

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300
what our group is trying to investigate
 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.870
what our group is trying to investigate
is whether or not we can use chemicals

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880
is whether or not we can use chemicals
 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.460
is whether or not we can use chemicals
to turn cells into stem cells and so

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470
to turn cells into stem cells and so
 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.060
to turn cells into stem cells and so
basically at Harvard our group what we

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070
basically at Harvard our group what we
 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.860
basically at Harvard our group what we
do is that we basically have lots of

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870
do is that we basically have lots of
 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.510
do is that we basically have lots of
cells and we test thousands of chemicals

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520
cells and we test thousands of chemicals
 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.040
cells and we test thousands of chemicals
on them this is called a chemical

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050
on them this is called a chemical
 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.320
on them this is called a chemical
library and we see if any of these

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330
library and we see if any of these
 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.390
library and we see if any of these
chemicals can turn the cell

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400
chemicals can turn the cell
 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.730
chemicals can turn the cell
than to remember Yannick stem cells and

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740
than to remember Yannick stem cells and
 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.020
than to remember Yannick stem cells and
I think that one day the goal would be

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030
I think that one day the goal would be
 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.240
I think that one day the goal would be
really that if we could just take a

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250
really that if we could just take a
 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.189
really that if we could just take a
cocktail of chemicals dump it on to any

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:36.199
cocktail of chemicals dump it on to any
 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:38.350
cocktail of chemicals dump it on to any
cell and turn it into an embryonic stem

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360
cell and turn it into an embryonic stem
 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.090
cell and turn it into an embryonic stem
cell that can drive clinical therapies

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100
cell that can drive clinical therapies
 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.330
cell that can drive clinical therapies
and can drive research
