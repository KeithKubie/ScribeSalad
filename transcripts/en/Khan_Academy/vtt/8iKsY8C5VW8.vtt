00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.239
Voiceover:Suppose that
Erika simultaneously rolls

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:06.435
a 6-sided die and a 4-sided die.

00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:09.833
Let A be the event that she rolls doubles,

00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:10.566
let me write this,

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:14.633
A be the event that she rolls doubles

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:20.300
and B be the event that
the 4-sided die is a 4.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.300
Use the sample space of
possible outcomes below

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.647
to answer each of the following questions.

00:00:26.647 --> 00:00:28.034
Fair enough.

00:00:28.034 --> 00:00:30.700
What is probability of A,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.070
the probability that Erika rolls doubles?

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:38.500
Over here, we have our sample
space of possible outcomes.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.646
Each of these are equally likely,

00:00:40.646 --> 00:00:42.359
and so let's see how
many of them there are.

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:47.702
There are 1, 2, 3, 4 by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:00:47.702 --> 00:00:49.633
so there are 24 possible outcomes,

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:50.567
which makes sense.

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:53.233
There's 4 possible outcomes
for the 4-sided die

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:55.700
and 6 possible outcomes
for the 6-sided die,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.901
so you have a total of 24
equally likely outcomes,

00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:02.100
so probability of,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.300
let me write it here,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.633
so probability of A is
going to be the fraction

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:12.168
of the 24 equally likely outcomes

00:01:12.168 --> 00:01:13.701
that involve event A,

00:01:13.701 --> 00:01:15.301
that she rolls doubles.

00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:16.633
Let's think about that.

00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:20.033
This is she has rolled doubles, 1 and a 1.

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:22.366
They don't look the same
but they're both 1s.

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:22.968
Let's see.

00:01:22.968 --> 00:01:26.033
We have a 2 and a 2.

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:28.700
We have a 3 and a 3,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.913
and we have a 4 and a 4.

00:01:30.913 --> 00:01:32.701
And it's impossible to have a 5 and a 5

00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:35.301
because the 4-sided die only goes up to 4.

00:01:35.301 --> 00:01:37.368
So there's 4 possibilities,

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:39.836
4 of the 24 equally likely possibilities

00:01:39.836 --> 00:01:42.112
involve rolling doubles.

00:01:42.112 --> 00:01:44.433
There is a 4/24 probability,

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:47.433
or if we divide the numerator
to the denominator by 4,

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:51.700
it is a 1/6 probability that Erika,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.351
a 1/6 probability that
Erika rolls doubles.

00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:57.836
What is probability of B,

00:01:57.836 --> 00:02:00.902
the probability that
the 4-sided die is a 4?

00:02:00.902 --> 00:02:03.966
The probability of B,

00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:07.033
well, once again, there's 24
equally likely possibilities,

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:11.033
and how many of them involve
the 4-sided die being a 4?

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:14.369
You have all of these right over here

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:18.433
involve a 4-sided die being a 4.

00:02:18.433 --> 00:02:21.500
So this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.901
of the 24 equally likely possibilities,

00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:27.766
or you could say 1/4 of the
equally likely possibilities

00:02:27.766 --> 00:02:32.033
or the probability is 1/4,

00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:33.766
which makes sense
because probability of B,

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:36.233
it ignores the 6-sided die,

00:02:36.233 --> 00:02:38.234
and it just says what's the probability

00:02:38.234 --> 00:02:39.701
that the 4-sided die is 4?

00:02:39.701 --> 00:02:41.770
Well, that's 1 one of
the 4 possible outcomes

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.935
for that 4-sided die.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.501
What is the probability of A given B,

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:49.566
the probability that Erika rolls doubles

00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:52.633
given that the 4-sided die is a 4?

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:54.706
Let's just think about this a little bit,

00:02:54.706 --> 00:03:04.235
probability of A given
that B has happened,

00:03:04.235 --> 00:03:06.633
given that B has happened.

00:03:06.633 --> 00:03:08.366
Essentially, we are restricting

00:03:08.366 --> 00:03:10.635
our equally likely possibilities now

00:03:10.635 --> 00:03:13.100
to the situation where B has happened.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.235
Given B means we're assuming
that B has happened.

00:03:16.235 --> 00:03:19.100
Now, we're restricting our sample space

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.633
of possible outcomes where B has happened

00:03:21.633 --> 00:03:23.767
to this right over here.

00:03:23.767 --> 00:03:30.766
Now there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6 equally likely outcomes.

00:03:30.766 --> 00:03:34.233
How many of them involve A happening?

00:03:34.233 --> 00:03:37.701
This one right over here
that we had already circled,

00:03:37.701 --> 00:03:40.905
this is the one out of the
6 equally likely outcomes

00:03:40.905 --> 00:03:44.366
that involve doubles,

00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:47.433
so there is a 1/6 probability.

00:03:47.433 --> 00:03:48.500
Now that makes sense.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.568
Let me just write this down.

00:03:49.568 --> 00:03:52.102
This is 1 over 6.

00:03:52.102 --> 00:03:53.634
Why does this make sense?

00:03:53.634 --> 00:03:57.633
Because with a 4-sided
die we're assuming is a 4.

00:03:57.633 --> 00:03:59.700
So essentially, this
is analogous to saying

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.968
when you roll a 6-sided die,

00:04:00.968 --> 00:04:03.966
what's the probability
that you get a 4 as well,

00:04:03.966 --> 00:04:06.368
because that's the only way
you're going to get doubles,

00:04:06.368 --> 00:04:08.580
given that the 4-sided die is 4.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.366
And we see that right over here.

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:12.100
The 6-sided die has to be a 4 as well

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.100
in order for this to be doubles

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.233
because we're assuming it's given that B,

00:04:16.233 --> 00:04:17.633
we're given event B,

00:04:17.633 --> 00:04:21.168
we're restricting our
sample space with event B.

00:04:21.168 --> 00:04:23.701
What is the probability of B given A,

00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:25.566
the probability that the 4-sided die is 4

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:28.433
given that Erika rolls doubles?

00:04:28.433 --> 00:04:30.168
Let's just think about that a little bit.

00:04:30.168 --> 00:04:35.766
The probability of B given A,

00:04:35.766 --> 00:04:42.477
B given that A is true.

00:04:42.766 --> 00:04:44.575
So what's this going to be?

00:04:45.376 --> 00:04:47.700
This means we're going to
restrict our sample space

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:54.100
to essentially 4 equally likely
outcomes that A has happened

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.500
so where A is true, I guess I could say.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.766
So there's 1, 2, 4.

00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:01.834
And how many of them
involve event B being true?

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:04.767
Well, the only one of these 4 that involve

00:05:04.767 --> 00:05:07.700
event B being true is
this one right over here,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.234
where we've got our doubles.

00:05:09.234 --> 00:05:15.966
So there is a 1/4 probability
that if we assume,

00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:17.768
given that we've gotten doubles,

00:05:17.768 --> 00:05:22.034
the probability that
the 4-sided die is a 4.

00:05:22.034 --> 00:05:24.766
This is a 1/4 probability,

00:05:24.766 --> 00:05:27.234
and that makes sense.

00:05:27.234 --> 00:05:30.100
If we've got doubles and one
of them is a 4-sided die,

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.834
we either have doubles at 1, doubles at 2,

00:05:31.834 --> 00:05:33.566
doubles at 3, or doubles at 4.

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:35.234
You see that here, doubles 1, doubles 2,

00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:36.834
doubles 3, doubles 4.

00:05:36.834 --> 00:05:39.300
Well, given that, what's the probability

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.700
that the 4-sided die is 4?

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.233
Well, that means that's
one out of these 4 outcomes

00:05:43.233 --> 00:05:45.813
where it's a double 4 is right over here.

00:05:45.967 --> 00:05:46.786
All right.

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:49.968
What is the probability of A and B,

00:05:49.968 --> 00:05:52.708
the probability that Erika rolls doubles

00:05:52.708 --> 00:05:57.100
and the second die is 4?

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.633
This means both A and B happened.

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:02.700
Let's look at this.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.530
Actually let me write it here.

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.833
Let me do it in a new color.

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:08.433
The probability of,

00:06:08.433 --> 00:06:11.034
and I'll write "and"
here in a neutral color,

00:06:11.034 --> 00:06:14.500
the probability of A and B.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.538
Probability of A and B is equal to.

00:06:17.676 --> 00:06:19.633
Well, now, we're looking at once again,

00:06:19.633 --> 00:06:22.633
we have 24 equally likely outcomes.

00:06:22.633 --> 00:06:25.501
We have 24 equally likely outcomes.

00:06:25.501 --> 00:06:28.966
How many of them involve A and B?

00:06:28.966 --> 00:06:31.567
To get A and B, you have to have doubles

00:06:31.567 --> 00:06:35.633
and the 4-sided die needs to be a 4.

00:06:35.633 --> 00:06:37.367
Essentially, you have to have doubles 4.

00:06:37.367 --> 00:06:38.967
Well, there's only one outcome

00:06:38.967 --> 00:06:41.500
out of the 24 equally likley outcomes

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.167
that meets that situation,

00:06:44.167 --> 00:06:45.834
this one right over here,

00:06:45.834 --> 00:06:51.234
so there is a 1/24 probability,

00:06:51.234 --> 00:06:54.879
1/24.

00:06:55.634 --> 00:07:00.833
What is probability of A times
probability of B given A?

00:07:00.833 --> 00:07:03.300
Here, we could just go back to
our numbers right over here.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.833
Probability of A, that's going to be 1/6.

00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:08.925
Let me do that in a magenta color.

00:07:08.925 --> 00:07:11.966
I like to keep my colors,
be careful about my colors.

00:07:11.966 --> 00:07:17.766
That's 1/6 times the
probability of B given A.

00:07:17.996 --> 00:07:21.366
So the probability of B given
A is 1/4 right over here,

00:07:21.366 --> 00:07:23.833
times 1/4,

00:07:23.833 --> 00:07:26.900
which is, curious enough, 1/24,

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.733
1/24.

00:07:29.935 --> 00:07:33.433
What is probability of B times
probability of A given B?

00:07:33.433 --> 00:07:36.617
Probability of B, we figured out, is 1/4,

00:07:36.955 --> 00:07:38.261
1/4,

00:07:38.302 --> 00:07:41.453
and the probability of A given B is 1/6,

00:07:41.592 --> 00:07:45.492
times 1/6,

00:07:45.492 --> 00:07:49.501
which is equal to 1/24.

00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:51.180
Now does it make sense

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.500
that the probability of A and B is 1/24,

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.833
the probability of A times
probability of B given A is 1/24,

00:07:56.833 --> 00:08:00.367
and the probability of B times
probability of A given B,

00:08:00.367 --> 00:08:01.167
they're all 1/24?

00:08:01.167 --> 00:08:03.666
Is this always going to be the case?

00:08:03.967 --> 00:08:04.833
Well, sure.

00:08:04.833 --> 00:08:07.449
Think about what probability
of A and B means.

00:08:07.449 --> 00:08:09.501
What I mean is that they both happened.

00:08:09.501 --> 00:08:11.033
But that's the same way as saying

00:08:11.033 --> 00:08:14.195
what's the probability of,

00:08:14.195 --> 00:08:16.100
let's just say A is happening.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.102
Well now, for B and A to happen,

00:08:18.102 --> 00:08:19.511
it's just going to be
that times the probability

00:08:19.511 --> 00:08:22.233
that B is true given that A is true,

00:08:22.233 --> 00:08:25.633
because you could say, well,
are you constraining it.

00:08:25.633 --> 00:08:26.641
We're already multiplying

00:08:26.641 --> 00:08:28.633
by the probability of A being true,

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:30.039
and now we're multiplying
by the probability

00:08:30.039 --> 00:08:32.100
that B is true given A is true.

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.706
I actually often like to swap these around

00:08:34.706 --> 00:08:37.367
just so it gets a little
bit clearer in my head.

00:08:37.367 --> 00:08:39.100
This one, let's just write it like this,

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.833
the probability of B given A

00:08:42.833 --> 00:08:45.967
times the probability of A.

00:08:45.967 --> 00:08:48.567
This is the probability
that event A is true,

00:08:48.567 --> 00:08:52.633
and this is the probability
that event B is true

00:08:52.633 --> 00:08:55.573
given that we know that A is true.

00:08:55.573 --> 00:08:56.711
It completely makes sense

00:08:56.711 --> 00:08:58.167
that this is going to be the same thing

00:08:58.167 --> 00:09:03.233
as the probability of A and B.

00:09:03.233 --> 00:09:05.367
Clearly, this is a
probability of both of these,

00:09:05.367 --> 00:09:06.967
both A and B happening.

00:09:06.967 --> 00:09:08.434
You can go the other way around.

00:09:08.434 --> 00:09:11.233
The probability of A given B

00:09:11.233 --> 00:09:14.233
times the probability of B,

00:09:14.233 --> 00:09:15.434
that would also be,

00:09:15.434 --> 00:09:16.367
so B ...

00:09:16.367 --> 00:09:18.172
We're saying B needs to be true,

00:09:18.172 --> 00:09:19.900
and that given that B is true,

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.500
that A needs to be true as well,

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.633
so it makes complete sense

00:09:22.633 --> 00:09:24.366
that this is going to be the probability

00:09:24.366 --> 00:09:28.467
of A and B as well.
