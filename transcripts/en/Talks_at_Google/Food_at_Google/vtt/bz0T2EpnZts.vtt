[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.660
SPEAKER 1: Can you please give
a warm welcome to Adrian Martin?

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.420
ADRIAN MARTIN: OK.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.676
Guys, thank you so, so much
for coming along today.

00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:19.540
I can't believe
the crowd in here.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.982
It's mad.

00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:22.940
I suppose I wanted to
talk to you a little bit.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.377
So you've got a copy of my
book, and you've probably

00:00:25.377 --> 00:00:26.960
been flipping through
it a little bit.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.959
So I'm going to talk about
that in a little bit.

00:00:28.959 --> 00:00:31.220
But firstly, I just wanted
to talk about, I suppose,

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.680
my story and my background.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.470
Because this is one thing I
get asked about all the time.

00:00:38.226 --> 00:00:41.690
I get told very, very
regularly I look about 16.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.390
Right?

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.800
I get told that nearly
every day of my life.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.940
I'm 25, believe it or not.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.180
And I suppose my thing-- and
with the Leaving Cert results

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.530
that came out yesterday--

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.020
we'll go into that
in a little bit.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.310
But about eight years ago,
I completed my Leaving Cert.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.310
Before that, my
interest was always

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.000
in food and in cooking and
in all that kind of stuff.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.730
Looking back to when
I was 14, I worked

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.220
in this little SuperValu.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.540
I'm from Cavan, OK?

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.770
So I'm from a little village
called Bawnboy in Cavan.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.131
The biggest town near there
is called Balleyconnell.

00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:21.630
Yeah.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.590
It's a great little
village where I live in.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.610
But my thing was always--

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.260
I always had this
interest in food.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.120
So my first job was cleaning
toilets, washing cars,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.180
and sweeping floors
in the SuperValu.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.050
So that was my first job ever.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.020
And I've always been a big
believer in the wheel that

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.840
squeaks the most gets the oil.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.390
OK?

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.670
So believe it or not,
I'm the squeaker.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.130
I literally believe that
if I can't get something,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.770
I will try my best to get it.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.260
So when I was working in
SuperValu, I was at the manager

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.160
every single day.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.660
So this was my
little part-time job,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.600
14-year-old in on a Saturday.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.710
Sunday, I was like, I want to
get in on the delicatessen.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.310
I want to do a little
bit of cooking.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.617
And the manager would
always be like, no, no.

00:02:05.617 --> 00:02:07.450
You're going to go in
there and make a mess.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.440
You're going to go in
there and make a mess.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.125
So I got fed up asking because
I asked every single day.

00:02:13.125 --> 00:02:14.424
And I walked in--

00:02:14.424 --> 00:02:15.090
let's be honest.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.260
I walked out of the job and
walked down to a restaurant

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.337
down beside me.

00:02:20.337 --> 00:02:21.170
Well, I didn't walk.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.600
Actually, my dad
dropped me down.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.560
And it's a bit far.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.320
It's about half an hour
away from me into Blacklion.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.180
And the chef that ran
that restaurant there

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.590
was Neven Maguire.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.110
So I walked up to the door
to Neven, 14-year-old.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.310
I was knocking on the door.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.270
I was like, Neven, give
us a job, will you?

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.960
Like this.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.960
And Neven was like, you're
a bit young, inexperienced.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.710
I was like, I have a
mad interest in food.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.010
Please, can I
train to be a chef?

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.630
I'm really interested in it, and
I've always watched it on TV.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.400
My obsession, actually, on
TV was with Richard Corrigan,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.920
another chef who's opened a
place there in Virginia more

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.310
recently, who's,
obviously, fed the queen

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.396
and he's cooked for
so many amazing people

00:03:01.396 --> 00:03:02.270
throughout the years.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.792
So I was fascinated by him.

00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:05.375
The reason my
fascination was with him

00:03:05.375 --> 00:03:08.530
was because he was able to get
a load of random ingredients

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.404
and make incredible dishes
out of random ingredients.

00:03:11.404 --> 00:03:12.320
That was my obsession.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.720
Also, he could
chop like a ninja.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.770
We'd chop, and he
wouldn't-- he'd look away,

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.250
and he wouldn't cut
his hand off, right?

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.010
So I landed up to
Neven's restaurant.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.650
He gave me the
opportunity to work there.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.227
So I was in secondary school.

00:03:27.227 --> 00:03:29.060
The restaurant was open
Wednesday to Sunday.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.880
So after school, on
Wednesday, Thursday,

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.550
Friday, I was straight off
to the restaurant there.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.890
My first job was
to peel potatoes.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.380
So 50-kg bags of potatoes.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.470
You were given 50 bags
of 50-kg bags of potatoes

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.690
and told, OK, for
the rest of the day,

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.240
you're going to peel all those,
like in the army, basically.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.160
That was my first job.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.380
Did you ever see a spinach leaf?

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.420
You know the little
stem on a spinach leaf?

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.160
Pick the little stem off.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.670
That's the job, OK?

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.770
And place it into a container.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.650
So those little jobs were
the first things that I did,

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.686
but I had this army
of chefs around me

00:04:05.686 --> 00:04:07.060
that were doing
different things.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.435
You'd have one
chef in there that

00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:12.080
was cooking steaks and venison
and the most incredible racks

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.357
of lamb and stuff.

00:04:13.357 --> 00:04:15.940
And you had someone else who was
plating up desserts and doing

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.631
all these incredible designs.

00:04:17.631 --> 00:04:19.339
You had someone else
who was at the pass,

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:21.560
calling orders and
sending plates away.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.920
And there was so much
action going on around me.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.170
And I was soaking everything up.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.520
I found myself to be
seriously comfortable

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.670
in that environment.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.950
I just soaked it up,
and I loved it to bits.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.760
I would go back to school.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.580
When I was in
school, the whole way

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.480
through school, to be
very honest with you,

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.712
I was probably
the biggest messer

00:04:41.712 --> 00:04:42.920
you'd ever meet in your life.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.097
You would not have wanted
me to be in your class.

00:04:45.097 --> 00:04:46.430
Let's be very honest, all right?

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.734
If you were in a
class with me, a lot

00:04:48.734 --> 00:04:50.900
of people that were in
school with me would be like,

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.695
god help you if you're
in class with that fella.

00:04:52.695 --> 00:04:53.330
All right?

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.730
That's the truth.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.646
I had a serious problem with--

00:04:57.646 --> 00:04:58.520
I've always had this.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.282
A serious problem with reading.

00:05:00.282 --> 00:05:02.240
I've always had help with
reading the whole way

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.430
throughout school
and at spelling.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.433
Massive problem with
spelling, as well.

00:05:06.433 --> 00:05:07.870
And I'll get into that.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.596
So in my Leaving Cert-- and the
results were out yesterday--

00:05:10.596 --> 00:05:11.970
this was the
biggest goal for me.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.575
So throughout 14 to about 17--

00:05:14.575 --> 00:05:17.010
I did my Leaving Cert at 17.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.285
And 14 to 17, I
worked continuously

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:20.970
in Neven's restaurant.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.060
I worked my way up, so I got
on to a section of my own,

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.709
where I was able to
serve out food myself.

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:30.000
So I was able to basically
hold a full-time job while I

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.710
was at school at the same time.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.690
I was able to work
in school-- well, not

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:34.680
really work in school.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.492
Sit in school and go to work.

00:05:37.492 --> 00:05:39.450
And when the Leaving Cert
results came out-- so

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.030
for my Leaving Cert,
I didn't study at all.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.140
I had no interest in it.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.660
I didn't know exactly
what I wanted to do.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:49.750
And I just felt like I
was put through a system.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.860
So it was kind of
like, for me, I'm

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.410
not an academic person at all.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.030
I find it very, very
hard to sit down

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.700
in front of a laptop and
actually type something

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.621
or write something at all.

00:06:01.621 --> 00:06:03.370
I'm a completely
different type of people.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.180
And that's why I think that this
system didn't suit me at all.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.330
So for my Leaving
Cert, I didn't study.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.610
My first exam was English.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.690
It was very sunny as,
you know, it always

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.120
is on the Leaving Cert.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.870
And once I did my
first exam, I sat out

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.290
sunbathing after instead of
studying for the rest of them.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.140
So that was kind of my thing.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.520
And when I got my results, which
was yesterday, eight years ago,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.170
and I got 180 points.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.670
OK?

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.840
So 180 points in
your Leaving Cert

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.620
is, like, some of the
exams, I walked in,

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.780
I just wrote the
exam number on them.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.960
Wrote out a few little
lines and walked out.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.860
That was kind of it.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.620
180 points.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.770
Looking at all my friends.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.600
So this was kind of like
a really big low for me

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.740
in my life.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.757
It kind of hits you.

00:06:50.757 --> 00:06:52.715
And all your friends are
out there celebrating.

00:06:52.715 --> 00:06:53.923
They're all going to Trinity.

00:06:53.923 --> 00:06:58.890
They're all going to UCD, DCU,
going to the Limerick, Galway,

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.120
incredible universities.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:06.360
All out celebrating, drinking,
they've done a great exam.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.700
But for me, at that
stage in my life,

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:10.890
I was like, what
am I going to do?

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:15.050
All my mates and
everything are out

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.485
celebrating that they've got
this incredible opportunity

00:07:17.485 --> 00:07:19.254
to go to do exactly
what they want to do.

00:07:19.254 --> 00:07:20.420
They can go become teachers.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.340
They can work at incredible
places like Google.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.840
You know?

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.510
They could do all
these kind of things.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.770
For me, it was kind of,
I've got one opportunity

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:29.920
and that's cooking.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.510
So I applied to college.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:37.620
For someone that has 180
points in your Leaving Cert,

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.880
to apply to college, you have to
pay your whole way through it.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.290
So I got into a PLC,
which is literally--

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.050
you literally do two
days a week and you

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.720
work there two days a week
on your days off of work.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.180
But you also go to work and
you work your full-time job,

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:54.681
as well.

00:07:54.681 --> 00:07:56.679
So you fund your whole
way through your college.

00:07:56.679 --> 00:07:58.260
But in two years
in Enniskillen, in

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.140
a small, little tiny
college, I got my papers

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.970
to become a professional chef.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:05.160
So really, it's a
hands-on course.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.670
Everything is literally, you
start with your different types

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.350
of cuisines.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.650
You learn how to, I suppose,
butcher up a chicken.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.140
That's like a module, and
you're examined on that.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.000
I know it's really
weird, but those are

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.720
kind of things-- filet a fish.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.250
That was also an exam.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.970
You know, that's the exams
that we did in college.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.540
And that was really
hands-on things.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.890
After that, then
I took a big leap.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.020
I applied to a
college in Killybegs.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.690
And I wanted to get myself
a degree in culinary arts.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:36.780
So I thought this was a
really big step for me.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.530
It was going to be
three days a week,

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.679
so I'd miss out on my
Wednesday in work in Neven's.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.359
And I wanted to get
myself a degree,

00:08:44.359 --> 00:08:45.900
because the papers
were great and I'd

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.080
be able to teach,
actually, cooking.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.189
So I took the leap on
it and did my exams.

00:08:53.189 --> 00:08:55.230
Obviously, when you're in
a small, little college

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:59.190
like that, your lecturers really
pay great attention to you.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:01.110
So each module that I did--

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.477
for instance, we did French.

00:09:03.477 --> 00:09:05.310
It wasn't just French
to learn the language.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.170
It was French that we
learned the language of food.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:10.520
So we learned all about
food but in French.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.690
And our exam was
we had to present

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:17.280
a region all about the food of
a particular region in France.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.170
So I picked Normandy,
because I love it

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:20.310
because of all the
different types of cheeses

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.100
and the calvados,
the apple brandy.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.180
You know, all the
different types

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.370
of cuisines that are in France.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:33.930
That was an exam for my
college in Killybegs.

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.510
So when I did that, I passed
all my exams, believe it or not.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:37.900
Very, very lucky to do it.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.010
Got myself my degree and
I came to a crossroads.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:45.000
So you're working in a kitchen
at the hours of, like, 70 hours

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.220
a week, maybe 80 some weeks.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.226
You're in at 9 o'clock
in the morning.

00:09:49.226 --> 00:09:50.850
You're finished at
1:00 in the morning.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.420
OK?

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.690
You eat your dinner
while you're standing up,

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.907
but also you're keeping
an eye on your section.

00:09:56.907 --> 00:09:58.740
And you're making sure
that everything's OK.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.448
You're ready for that
service that night.

00:10:00.448 --> 00:10:03.240
Because believe it or not, in
Neven's restaurant at the time,

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.156
coming to the time that
I was doing my degree,

00:10:05.156 --> 00:10:07.571
we were voted 15 best
restaurants in Europe.

00:10:07.571 --> 00:10:08.070
OK?

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.350
So that's why the
standards were so high.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.085
We were serving food
to such high standards

00:10:14.085 --> 00:10:17.600
that you had to be so
well-prepared in advance.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.890
So the hours are really tough.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.260
You're sleeping there.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.390
So you've got a room
in the restaurant,

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:24.760
out the back of the restaurant.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.968
They're not the greatest
rooms ever, let's be honest.

00:10:26.968 --> 00:10:30.270
They weren't very nice to live
in, but that's where we stayed.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:34.760
So you lived this life of
working in this restaurant.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.750
And when I finished my
degree, the crossroads

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.870
was either-- all my friends
were chefs, because that's

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:42.520
who I socialized with.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.460
It came to a crossroads where
either I go to Australia--

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.519
Melbourne had an amazing
food scene at the time.

00:10:48.519 --> 00:10:50.560
And there was Michelin
star restaurants and stuff

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.970
that all my friends were
going out there to work in.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.200
And I had applied for a
visa, but I let them all go.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.540
I stayed in Ireland
and I took a chance.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.895
And it's probably
a chance that I--

00:11:00.895 --> 00:11:04.060
that crossroads where I came
to, when I made that decision,

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.370
it's one that I am
really, really thankful

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:08.230
that I stayed here for.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:12.100
And I decided that because I
had a degree in culinary arts.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.680
I learned so much about
product development.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.780
I learned so much about, I
suppose, just food, in general,

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.180
and the different types
of jobs that are in food.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.270
So I was always taught that
the only job that I could do

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.080
was be a chef in a restaurant.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.795
That was kind of it.

00:11:28.795 --> 00:11:30.420
But outside of that,
believe it or not,

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.919
there's product
development, there's

00:11:31.919 --> 00:11:36.040
teaching in cookery schools,
there's endless jobs in food.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.250
And so I decided that I would
offer my services to businesses

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:40.120
all across Ireland.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.212
So I just took a chance,
started sending emails.

00:11:43.212 --> 00:11:45.670
Started picking up the phone
and ringing people and saying,

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:49.060
you know, I worked in this
restaurant with Neven Maguire.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.700
He's Ireland's most
well-known chef.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.100
I can come in and maybe
do product development

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.660
with your business.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:00.475
Maybe help you guys out in
some way, developing new menus,

00:12:00.475 --> 00:12:02.660
working with you and
all that kind of stuff.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.720
And I basically
offered it for nothing.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.100
So I was like, I'll do
it for 100 euro a week,

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.559
and I'll give you
all my recipes,

00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:09.850
and I'll give you all my ideas.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:10.720
And that's kind of--

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.636
as long as you let me
stay with you, you know?

00:12:12.636 --> 00:12:14.800
That's kind of the way
I put it with them.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.661
And I started in
Bandon, in Cork.

00:12:17.661 --> 00:12:18.910
So that was my first business.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.160
It was actually butcher shops.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.360
It was cafes.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.980
It was artisan food stores
and other restaurants

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.030
that I worked with.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.865
I had businesses, all together,
that I traveled around Ireland

00:12:27.865 --> 00:12:28.365
to.

00:12:28.365 --> 00:12:30.520
I worked in every single
county, believe it or not.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.160
128 businesses
altogether I worked with.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.240
So a week, maybe three days
here, three days there,

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.890
traveling.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:39.800
Completely broke.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.425
I had no money.

00:12:40.425 --> 00:12:41.799
But it was a chance
that I wanted

00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:43.190
to take to get my
name out there.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:46.330
The beauty about it was
that I got the interaction

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:47.680
with their customers.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.010
I got to meet so many different
types of people, which

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.510
brought me out as a person.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:56.380
So when you leave
a kitchen, you look

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.750
like, I suppose-- there's
white walls everywhere.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:59.860
There's no windows.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.230
You're very pale in the face.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:06.060
Your eyes are-- you
look wrecked, basically.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.690
You look shattered
coming out of there.

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:12.910
So when I came out of the
kitchen, my communication

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:14.590
skills, literally,
I didn't have any.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:15.670
They were nonexistent.

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.490
You know, you're so
focused on your job

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:22.100
that I needed to improve
on my communication skills.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.950
So that was one
thing that I found.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:25.510
Traveling all across
Ireland really

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:26.920
brought me out as a person.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.378
Really brought me out to be
able to get out there and speak

00:13:29.378 --> 00:13:31.030
to people.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:36.100
Because at the end of the day,
I was kind of put in a box

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.280
and felt like I was very
uncomfortable in speaking

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.090
with people.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.820
So once I traveled the
country, I got very lucky.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.561
I got asked to go in
and meet students.

00:13:45.561 --> 00:13:47.810
I got asked to go in and do
demonstrations in schools.

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.645
I got asked to do demos
at food festivals,

00:13:50.645 --> 00:13:53.110
at agricultural shows,
all that kind of stuff.

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:55.820
And I found myself to be
very comfortable doing this.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.885
I enjoyed getting up
in front of a crowd.

00:13:57.885 --> 00:14:00.010
I can get up in front of
a crowd like you guys here

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.090
today and talk.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.430
But when I have food,
it's kind of like I'm

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:04.764
taking people on a journey.

00:14:04.764 --> 00:14:06.430
So it's kind of like
I've got food here,

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.580
but you're also with
me and you're, like,

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.220
in on the experience, but
only you in the room can

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.330
feel that experience.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.670
And that's kind of
the thing that I

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.650
feel when I do a cooking demo.

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:20.770
And so I find myself to
be very, very comfortable.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.040
I got very used to
going around to schools.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.000
I traveled around to
secondary schools.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.280
I actually got
picked up by so many

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.950
different secondary
schools all across Ireland,

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:33.340
doing talks on healthy eating,
doing talks on, I suppose,

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.590
how to cook from scratch.

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:38.530
My age group, believe it or
not, lost out on cooking.

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:42.370
25 to 35-year-olds,
9 out of 10 of us

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:44.420
actually can't cook at all.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.090
It's actually proven in Ireland.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.520
The reason for that was
the Celtic Tiger, the boom.

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.270
Our parents were
literally spending money

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:57.760
on literally just, I suppose,
ready meals, eating out a lot

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.910
more, and weren't
interested in cooking.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:03.486
Cooking is a thing that's
passed down by your parents.

00:15:03.486 --> 00:15:05.110
It wasn't passed down
to my generation.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:07.526
I'm just lucky that I trained
in it so I know how to cook.

00:15:07.526 --> 00:15:09.100
But my mom wouldn't
have passed it

00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.215
down to my brothers
or sisters who

00:15:12.215 --> 00:15:13.910
are around the same age as me.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.140
So 9 out of 10 of us
can't cook at all.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.530
So I thought, schools,
this is a great opportunity

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.180
to get in here, make
sure that doesn't

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:22.280
happen to the next
generation coming through.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.620
So traveling so
much around schools.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.250
Got picked up one
day by the TV3.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.207
It was a show called
"The Late Lunch Live."

00:15:30.207 --> 00:15:32.540
It's now called-- well, it
was "The Seven O'clock Show."

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:33.873
Now it's "The Six O'clock Show."

00:15:33.873 --> 00:15:36.790
They can't make up their mind
for what it's really called.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:40.160
But it was giving me
an opportunity, really,

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:44.280
to get on television and
actually cook on television.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.360
And it was on my 23rd birthday,
so it was two years ago,

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.380
the 9th of October.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.950
And I cooked which Sharon
Corr and Lucy Kennedy.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:55.900
So shaking like mad and
getting up there and doing it.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.850
But I've been a regular on
the show there ever since,

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.460
for two years now.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.720
And it's just been an incredible
experience for me in there,

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.370
and it was a great platform
for me to really improve

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.829
on what I did.

00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:11.370
Believe it or not,
so you see the way

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.910
I call myself Chef
Adrian, the name

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.330
came from when I came
to the crossroads.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:19.430
I said I'd set myself up
a little Facebook page

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:20.855
and document all my travels.

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:27.260
I didn't know what to call it.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.380
I documented all my
travelings through it

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.320
and through, I suppose,
YouTube and through Twitter,

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:35.240
and through loads
of different places.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.450
And the reason for
it was-- you ever

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.012
see Gordon Ramsay is called
Chef Ramsay in America?

00:16:41.012 --> 00:16:42.970
And I was like, that
sounds kick-ass, you know?

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.430
So I was like, I'm going
to call myself Chef Adrian,

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:46.430
and it stuck.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:48.890
And believe it or not,
I actually hate it now,

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:52.640
but I'm not allowed
to remove it.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.100
They won't allow me
to remove it anymore.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.481
But that's kind of stuck
and that's been it.

00:16:58.481 --> 00:16:58.980
Yeah.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:03.980
It's kind of been a journey that
I took through social media.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.050
Gathered together
followers in social media,

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:08.150
got picked up by TV.

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:12.030
Believe it or not, my biggest
break was about two years ago.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.819
That was the start of it.

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:16.650
About two years ago,
I made a recipe.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:18.829
I was in a school and
the kids were all like,

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:22.040
Adrian, why don't you do
recipes for doner kebabs?

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.200
Why don't you do
recipes for spice bags?

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.300
Because this is all
that we're eating.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.560
I was like, OK.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.829
So I made a little video
with my own camera at home.

00:17:30.829 --> 00:17:32.870
It was literally the
cheapest little Canon camera

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:34.670
you could ever buy,
believe it or not.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:38.630
And I edited it myself on
my own thing, uploaded it

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:44.896
onto YouTube, and I got such a
massive response to this video.

00:17:44.896 --> 00:17:47.270
So all of a sudden, RTE came
to me and were like, Adrian,

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:48.110
we love your video.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:51.790
Come in here and
make a show with us.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.810
Lovin Dublin were like,
Adrian, come in here

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:55.510
and do some work with
us and everything.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.070
Absolutely everything
exploded from this one video.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:18:01.460
It was a spice bag I
made, believe it or not.

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.230
So it was actually
a 30-second video

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.320
that literally opened a whole
world that I'd never thought

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.670
I would have seen, ever.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.700
So I started making
videos for Lovin Dublin.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.255
So all the small, little,
tiny, little Tasty videos?

00:18:13.255 --> 00:18:14.120
Those are my hands.

00:18:18.689 --> 00:18:20.480
And I didn't believe
that that was actually

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.560
a business in food itself.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.100
So the idea that the book--

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.790
so I released a show.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:33.224
I just took the idea from
the students themselves.

00:18:33.224 --> 00:18:35.390
They were like, to me, as
you can see, why don't you

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:36.554
do recipes for spice bags?

00:18:36.554 --> 00:18:37.970
Why don't you do
recipes for stuff

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.160
that we're actually eating?

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:42.670
In Ireland, at the moment,
we're spending $9 million a week

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:43.620
on takeaways.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.170
We are.

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:46.900
Which is a lot.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:47.400
Yeah.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.140
It is a lot, isn't it?

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:51.290
Yes.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:52.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.950
ADRIAN MARTIN: $9 million
a week on takeaways.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:58.118
That's a lot, isn't it?

00:18:58.118 --> 00:18:59.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:02.010
ADRIAN MARTIN: It is a lot.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:06.800
So the majority of
that would be pizza,

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:08.300
actually, believe it or not.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:08.800
Yeah.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.410
Pizza is the majority of that.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:17.300
Well, the idea of the
book was literally

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.730
that we'd get students--

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:21.290
so this is what they're eating--

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.902
chicken filet rolls,
doner kebabs, spice bags,

00:19:23.902 --> 00:19:24.860
all that kind of stuff.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:26.540
Show them how to
make it themselves,

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.349
get them a little bit
interested in food.

00:19:29.349 --> 00:19:30.890
But believe it or
not, it wasn't just

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:32.910
students that were
eating this food.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:33.770
It was everyone.

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:36.050
Absolutely everybody
in the country

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:37.730
is eating this kind of food.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.280
My age group's eating
this type of food.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.430
My parents and their
age group are all

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.360
eating that type
of food, as well.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:48.610
So it really fit it
in so nicely for me.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:52.790
The idea of the book came
to me just about last year.

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.710
So all the little
videos were doing great.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.440
We created a little
series on RTE Player,

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.450
which was just an
online series, which

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.140
was just Fakeaway recipes.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.070
So we had 10 different
style recipes.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:05.330
They went down the street.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.700
We also, then, created
a show called--

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:10.460
so we wanted to feed
Ireland's obsession with food.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.590
So you know the way there's
restaurants popping up

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.020
everywhere that's like,
"this is the best burger you

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.720
can possibly get in Ireland."

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.850
"These are the best
wings," you know?

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:21.140
This was kind of--

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.860
Ireland's obsession
with food was like this.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.380
So we created a show for that.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.840
We just followed along
with what people wanted.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.760
So we created a show called
"Chef Adrian Eats Ireland."

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.990
And I went there to find
the best wings, the best

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:39.340
burger, the best ice cream,
you know, whatever it is.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:43.220
And we created this little
online series with a TV budget

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.800
just for RTE player.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.170
And we had six
different episodes.

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.510
Obviously, everything
was in there sponsored

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:52.755
and everything by
Carr's Crackers-- mad,

00:20:52.755 --> 00:20:54.530
I know, Carr's Crackers.

00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:58.220
But it was an opportunity
I was given by them

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.300
to create my own little show.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.270
So the book followed
that perfectly.

00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:04.910
So it was kind of in sync.

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.260
The recipes that we
were cooking on the show

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.070
were actually recipes
that are in the book.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.480
Before I explain a little
bit about the book,

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.320
I wanted to talk to you.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.970
So before I brought
out the book,

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:19.550
I had to do a little
bit of research.

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:23.230
Ireland is obsessed
with dieting these days.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:26.460
You've got either-- one
side of the spectrum

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.270
is everyone wants to
look like bodybuilders.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.650
They exercise every single day.

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.630
They're really
strict on their diet.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:38.150
And you know, they're out there
going to the gym so often.

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:41.150
But every single post you
run through on Facebook

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:43.010
is somebody's
weightlifting or squatting

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:45.240
or I don't know what it is.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.760
There's that obsession there.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.740
But there's the opposite
side of the spectrum,

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.260
where people have absolutely--
and this is where the $9

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:53.480
million spent on
takeaway comes in--

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.970
where people have absolutely
no interest in that at all

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.690
and avoid it at whatever costs.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:01.430
So I don't know where--

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:02.760
some people are in the middle.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:03.670
Some people are fine.

00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:08.120
But there's two sides of this
spectrum that are extreme.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.000
So there's that side, and
then there is this side.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.330
So what I was trying to do was--
the book doesn't feed into--

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:17.140
because there's so many healthy
books out there at the moment.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:18.800
There's so many
fitness books that

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.350
feed a diet, a
particular type of diet.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:23.930
I had no interest
in that at all.

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:25.720
I'm an ordinary, average person.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.422
OK?

00:22:26.422 --> 00:22:27.380
I'm in the middle here.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.400
I cook for myself.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.830
I believe that I use the
best quality ingredients

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.810
you can possibly buy.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:34.330
I read a book,
believe it or not.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:35.060
No, I listened to a book.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:35.559
Sorry.

00:22:35.559 --> 00:22:38.210
I didn't read a book.

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:41.030
And it was called
"The Diet Myth."

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:45.760
Probably the best I've
ever listened to or read.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.010
It explains diets inside out.

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:50.870
I met with the guy
that wrote the book,

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:54.890
and he invited me down to
Cork to meet with a lecturer

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:57.230
down there who travels
the world lecturing

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:58.850
on this kind of thing.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:02.270
Diets-- the problem is it
is so hard to maintain it.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.340
It's so hard to keep it up.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:08.630
It's so hard to continuously
be so strict on a diet.

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:11.900
Any diet at all, may
it be, say, you're

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.960
eating lentils for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.430
At the end of the
day, lentils are

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:18.830
going to be the
most horrible thing

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:20.727
to eat breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.

00:23:20.727 --> 00:23:21.810
And that's an extreme one.

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:23.750
But say if you went
on any type of diet

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:25.660
at all, what happens normally?

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.680
You last about, what?

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.650
Maximum-- some people
last longer than others.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.630
Some people may only
last two months.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:36.890
They lose a load of weight
in a short space of time.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:38.940
They kind of shock their system.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:43.760
And they end up putting on
what they lost because they've

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.580
lost their momentum, and they've
lost interest in the diet

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.830
because it's so
hard to maintain.

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:51.670
Basically, sums up every
single diet out there.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:53.930
And I have no
interest in telling

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.305
you to go out there and
diet and go out there and do

00:23:57.305 --> 00:23:58.170
that kind of thing.

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:02.210
So I kind of explain, in the
book, a little bit about that.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:05.990
All we need to do is look at
the way our grandparents, back

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:10.190
in the '80s, early
'90s, used to cook.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.310
They used to use the best
of quality ingredients

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:13.660
you could possibly buy.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.020
They cooked with cream.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.190
They cooked with butter.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:17.810
They cooked with oils.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:22.130
They cooked with the best
Irish ingredients you can buy,

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:23.370
which is on our doorstep.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:26.150
So you can walk
into a butcher shop.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:27.590
When they bought
their meat, they

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:29.780
didn't ask for the
fat to be cut off.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:30.980
They cooked with it on.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:31.520
OK?

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.760
Because that's a natural fat.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:38.300
Fat, at the end of the day,
is like an aid in digestion.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.370
The one thing we do
really need to look at

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.590
is that processed foods
that we're eating.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.830
So the processed sugars,
the processed fats, as well.

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:48.652
They're kind of
destroying our bodies.

00:24:48.652 --> 00:24:50.860
I know this is getting in
a little bit deep about it,

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:53.370
but that's kind of the
ins and outs of it.

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:55.760
If you look at the way your
grandparents used to cook

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.540
and you feed that into
your own cooking--

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.390
so if you're cooking
a meal during the day,

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:04.390
what way would your
grandparents cook it?

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:08.946
They would literally do it the
most basic methods of cooking,

00:25:08.946 --> 00:25:11.190
but it was the most
healthy for us.

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:13.680
A broad range then was
used throughout the week.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.900
You need a broad range of
different types of food

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.660
to sustain a healthy lifestyle.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.160
Obviously, we also need a
little bit of exercise, as well.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.680
So if you're not into
running, if you're not

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:25.805
into going to the gym or
anything like that, go out

00:25:25.805 --> 00:25:27.050
and just walk.

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:27.880
It's very simple.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.690
Just go on a walk
once or twice a week.

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:33.400
It is what helps you.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.560
I want to feed the
obsession here.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.590
This is the obsession
here that $9 million

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:38.930
is spent on takeaways a week.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:43.120
I have absolutely no
interest in cooking.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.780
I have no interest
in exercising at all.

00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:49.840
So let's create a book
for these guys here.

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.385
Let's bring them into the middle
and make them a little bit

00:25:52.385 --> 00:25:54.010
healthy and shake
them up a little bit.

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:56.280
That's really what the
idea of the book was.

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.210
And there you have it
in front of you there.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:01.510
And you'll notice that some of
the recipes use full-fat cream.

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:04.307
You'll notice that some of
the recipes use grapeseed oil.

00:26:04.307 --> 00:26:05.890
You'll notice that
some of the recipes

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.470
use spice combinations
and stuff.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:10.270
Everything is home-cooked.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:11.240
That's the idea of it.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.420
It's not processed.

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.370
You're buying the best
of quality ingredients

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:16.960
you can afford.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.290
You're cooking a meal that
is really good for you,

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:24.090
but also it's stopping
you from buying $9 million

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:27.250
worth of takeaway
a week every week.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.730
I hope you enjoy it.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:32.405
It was, to be
honest with you, it

00:26:32.405 --> 00:26:34.630
was a dream of mine
to ever do this,

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:37.000
me watching Neven for years.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.180
When I was peeling my potatoes,
and Neven was on-- he's

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:42.100
on his 16th book now.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.980
He's done so many
different TV shows for RTE.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:48.580
That's kind of like a dream of
mine to do something like this.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.600
Get up and talk
to people like you

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.402
and do little bits of things
on TV and stuff like that.

00:26:53.402 --> 00:26:55.610
It's always been a dream of
mine, from a 14-year-old,

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:58.780
watching Richard Corrigan
on there and stuff.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.640
One in a million chance
can someone like me

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:02.500
get the opportunity to do that.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.640
I'm so thankful
that I can do it,

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:08.612
and it's actually unbelievable
that I am doing it, as well.

00:27:08.612 --> 00:27:10.070
I hope you really,
really enjoy it.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:11.653
I put my heart and
soul into the book.

00:27:11.653 --> 00:27:15.320
I've done so much
research and so much,

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:19.510
I suppose, trial and error,
eating these different types

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:24.210
of dishes and trying to get
the exact replicas in there,

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.422
as well.

00:27:25.422 --> 00:27:26.380
Give them a little try.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.520
Let me know how you get on.

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.770
You can send me, I don't
know, a little picture of how

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:32.590
you get on if you want online.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:35.710
I've had so many
great responses to it.

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:37.960
Believe it or not, the book
is out now seven weeks,

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.760
and it's been the best-selling
cookbook in Ireland

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.634
the last seven weeks.

00:27:40.634 --> 00:27:41.516
There you go.

00:27:41.516 --> 00:27:45.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.520
Which is mad.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.470
It's really crazy.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.363
But yeah, that's it, yeah?

00:27:51.363 --> 00:27:52.238
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:27:52.238 --> 00:27:53.210
Well done.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:54.182
Thank you very much.

00:27:54.182 --> 00:27:58.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:59.686
Hey, thanks, Adrian.

00:27:59.686 --> 00:28:00.310
That was great.

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:02.300
Thank you very much.

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.230
I think our audience will
probably agree with me.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:10.900
You come across as a
very determined person

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:13.890
and very innovative, as well.

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:14.840
Wouldn't you think so?

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.020
With the different
challenges that he faced,

00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.670
especially after his training.

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.130
So I'm very
surprised the cooking

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:22.338
doesn't come from the family.

00:28:22.338 --> 00:28:24.919
But where does that
personality trait come from?

00:28:24.919 --> 00:28:26.710
Does that come from
someone in your family,

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:28.880
that entrepreneurship?

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.160
That very innovative--

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.070
ADRIAN MARTIN: Oh, my dad is
heavily involved in business.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:38.290
So my dad runs an event
management company that sets up

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:39.850
food festivals and stuff.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:41.752
So he's involved
in food himself.

00:28:41.752 --> 00:28:43.085
SPEAKER 1: What are they called?

00:28:43.085 --> 00:28:44.918
ADRIAN MARTIN: It's
Martin Event Management.

00:28:44.918 --> 00:28:49.030
So he sets up cooking
demo stations and kitchens

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.750
and does all that kind of stuff.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:53.140
So it fit in nicely
that the two of us

00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:56.662
get to work together in what
we do, which is bit mad.

00:28:56.662 --> 00:28:58.870
SPEAKER 1: And was he doing
that when you were young,

00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:59.620
when you were a child?

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.230
Or is that something
that came later on?

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:02.630
ADRIAN MARTIN: No, it
actually only came, literally,

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:03.880
when I started up, as well.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.770
He set it up at the same
time as me, and the two of us

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:09.900
kind of coincided and
worked together in that.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:10.925
So it was really cool.

00:29:10.925 --> 00:29:11.310
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:11.810
Great.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:12.350
Very good.

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.310
As usual, I'll ask one
or two more questions,

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:17.800
then I'll hand the
microphone out to you guys.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.480
So this happens to me about
two or three times a week--

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.090
and it's not because
I'm a millennial,

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:25.530
because I'm not
really a millennial--

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:29.320
tell us about a time you
had an absolute disaster

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.506
of a cooking experience.

00:29:31.506 --> 00:29:32.950
ADRIAN MARTIN: I've had loads.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:36.310
Oh, my god, six years in that
kitchen, I've had so many.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:38.650
My worst one, I think, I
always look back on it.

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:41.960
So we used to make these
sauces called veloutes.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.260
So Wednesday is
your main prep day.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.350
And your veloutes take in the
space of, like, five hours

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:48.300
to make.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.560
Each veloute is finished
off with a liaison,

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.450
which is literally egg yolk
and cream mixed together.

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:57.770
And it gives the veloute a
shine and thickens it naturally.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:01.855
But what happened to me was
I made all the veloutes.

00:30:01.855 --> 00:30:03.730
They were always put in
these little buckets.

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:04.720
There were labeled.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.850
They were placed into
this, like, chiller

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:08.770
first to blast chill them.

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:11.290
And then they were
placed into the cooler.

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:14.500
But while I was pulling them
all out of the blast chiller,

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.770
every single one of them
landed on the ground.

00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:19.380
So I was standing there
and I was like, oh, no.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.790
There is four
hours of work gone.

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:24.560
So you can imagine-- and
then service is coming.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.810
And you have to try and
make these different types--

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:31.750
prawn veloute, Thai
broth, mushroom veloute

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.520
with grated truffle
in there that's worth,

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.590
like, thousands of
euros and stuff.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:39.110
So you can imagine what it's--

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:40.050
it was a 'mare.

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:40.958
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:30:40.958 --> 00:30:44.560
I imagine you got in a bit of
trouble about that happening.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.190
Do we have any audience
questions just yet?

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:48.160
I've got one here.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.790
Here you go.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:53.580
AUDIENCE: You say we should
cook like our grandparents.

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.340
So how do you feel about the
more modernist techniques

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.794
that are out there these days?

00:30:57.794 --> 00:31:00.210
ADRIAN MARTIN: A lot of the
modern techniques-- obviously,

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:03.810
we cook like our grandparents,
like we look at our ingredients

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:05.610
the same way that
they look at it.

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:07.910
But obviously, the modern
techniques that come in

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:11.340
fit in so nicely
with it, as well.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:14.850
I believe that if you look back,
it's just really looking back

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:18.110
to basics the way they used
to shop rather than cook.

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:20.100
But the modern
techniques of cooking,

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.729
using different types of
spices and seasons and stuff,

00:31:22.729 --> 00:31:23.770
are absolutely brilliant.

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:26.545
Yeah.

00:31:26.545 --> 00:31:29.323
SPEAKER 1: And back over here.

00:31:29.323 --> 00:31:30.557
ADRIAN MARTIN: Cool.

00:31:30.557 --> 00:31:31.390
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:33.255
ADRIAN MARTIN: I love
all these questions.

00:31:33.255 --> 00:31:34.792
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:34.792 --> 00:31:35.700
Hi.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.100
Yeah, my question is what,
from a personal point

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.674
of view, what kind of advice
you would give someone who's

00:31:40.674 --> 00:31:42.090
doing the same
thing you're doing,

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:45.570
like kind of becoming a
chef, but hasn't found

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:49.080
the motivation yet to be that
determined about, oh, I'm

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.770
setting up my career here?

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:53.035
So is there anything-- maybe
you had a moment yourself

00:31:53.035 --> 00:31:55.000
where you were like, oh, no.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:55.870
ADRIAN MARTIN: Yeah.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:59.800
Honestly, six years
in Neven's kitchen,

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.300
when you're coming
to the end of it,

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.140
I was literally just
exhausted and tired

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.880
and needed something new.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.630
Six years is a long time
to stay in any restaurant.

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:12.170
Normally, chefs only stay for
about half a year to a year.

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:15.300
All I recommend doing, really,
is traveling around as much

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:16.720
as you can and
picking up as much

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.840
as you can from
different restaurants.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:23.090
I actually worked in here
for about a six-month stint

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:24.942
in Bon Appetit.

00:32:24.942 --> 00:32:27.210
It was actually when
I worked in Neven's.

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:29.550
We were sent off to
Michelin-star restaurant

00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:32.680
to actually learn about
Michelin-star food.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.290
So I headed up pastry
there for about six months,

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:36.850
which is kind of like--

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:39.770
as I always say-- change
is as good as a rest.

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:40.870
It really helped me.

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:43.740
I also went over, then,
to work in Ramsay's place.

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.030
Best meal I've ever had.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:46.610
I was there for,
like, three weeks.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:48.304
So you can do stages in there.

00:32:48.304 --> 00:32:49.470
It's in Royal Hospital Road.

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:51.330
He has three Michelin stars.

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:53.970
And you know I was
saying, I'm a believer

00:32:53.970 --> 00:32:56.070
that the wheel that squeaks
the most gets the oil.

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:57.780
I was literally the
most annoying person

00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:59.571
ever for those three
weeks in that kitchen.

00:32:59.571 --> 00:33:01.756
I'd say they really liked
to see the end of me.

00:33:01.756 --> 00:33:05.230
But travel around as much as
you can and get your degree.

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:07.090
But there's loads of
opportunities out there

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:09.540
in cooking itself, not just
being a chef in a kitchen

00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:10.950
or running a kitchen.

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:11.810
I'm 25.

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:13.072
Everyone keeps asking
me, why don't you

00:33:13.072 --> 00:33:13.900
have your own restaurant yet?

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.358
Why don't you have
your restaurant?

00:33:15.358 --> 00:33:17.670
There's no point in me having
a restaurant when I'm 25.

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.770
I'd be better off having
a restaurant when I'm 35.

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:23.160
So then I have a lot more
experience behind me.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.284
I know exactly what I
want to do at that stage.

00:33:25.284 --> 00:33:26.700
Because I'm only
figuring out what

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.641
I want to do as I go along now.

00:33:30.874 --> 00:33:33.040
AUDIENCE: My question was,
do you have a restaurant?

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.062
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:34.062 --> 00:33:35.020
ADRIAN MARTIN: I don't.

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:35.440
No, no.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.840
AUDIENCE: And the
second question

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.360
is, as you don't have a
restaurant, two or three names

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.950
that you suggest to eat in
Dublin that you say, wow.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:44.230
ADRIAN MARTIN: Oh, OK.

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:48.687
Obviously, The Greenhouse
is absolutely amazing.

00:33:48.687 --> 00:33:50.520
Have any of you ever
been to the Greenhouse?

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.146
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:51.146 --> 00:33:52.145
ADRIAN MARTIN: You have?

00:33:52.145 --> 00:33:52.972
What do you think?

00:33:52.972 --> 00:33:54.300
AUDIENCE: Best
restaurant up town.

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.133
ADRIAN MARTIN: Yeah.

00:33:55.133 --> 00:33:56.180
It's insanely good.

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.625
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:57.625 --> 00:34:00.000
ADRIAN MARTIN: Did you have
the little beetroot meringues

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.466
with the pistachio?

00:34:01.466 --> 00:34:02.132
AUDIENCE: I did.

00:34:02.132 --> 00:34:02.610
Actually, I did.

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:04.109
ADRIAN MARTIN: I
robbed that recipe.

00:34:04.109 --> 00:34:06.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:08.340
That's a great little thing.

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:11.400
That restaurant is insane.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.289
I suppose I would go
outside of Dublin.

00:34:14.289 --> 00:34:15.330
I was in the Cliff House.

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:16.830
I actually didn't
think it was going

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:21.060
to be that nice-- the
Cliff House in Waterford.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.352
The best hotel I've
ever stayed in.

00:34:23.352 --> 00:34:25.560
If you leave your room,
there's a sensor on the door.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.726
As soon as you leave your
room, these little fairies

00:34:27.726 --> 00:34:29.850
come in and make your
bed and everything.

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:32.569
And it has a Michelin-star
restaurant on-site, as well.

00:34:32.569 --> 00:34:33.610
It's really, really good.

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:34.600
It's worth traveling there.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:34.760
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:35.320
Great.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:35.679
Thank you.

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:36.064
Yeah.

00:34:36.064 --> 00:34:37.105
The Cliff House is great.

00:34:37.105 --> 00:34:39.179
And they have one in
town, as well, don't they?

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:39.730
Are they linked?

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:40.938
ADRIAN MARTIN: The sister's--

00:34:40.938 --> 00:34:42.360
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, the sister.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.000
So while the audience is
thinking of another question,

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.060
I read that when
you have time, you

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:52.370
try to get out and do a little
bit of running now and again.

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:55.770
We have any runners
in the audience today?

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:56.742
Yeah, got a few.

00:34:56.742 --> 00:34:57.920
ADRIAN MARTIN: Well, they
probably put me all to shame.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.919
SPEAKER 1: That's great.

00:34:58.919 --> 00:35:00.840
What's your post-run treat?

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.530
ADRIAN MARTIN: I don't know.

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:05.640
I used to have bananas.

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.500
I used to play
football as a kid.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.285
I used to eat a banana.

00:35:09.285 --> 00:35:12.250
I had two bananas before
a football match years ago

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.320
and everything came up.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.460
So I don't like bananas anymore.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:16.950
I'd recommend a banana.

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:19.180
Just one, not two.

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:19.930
But I don't know--

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:20.260
SPEAKER 1: Is that all?

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:21.759
ADRIAN MARTIN:
--what I normally do.

00:35:21.759 --> 00:35:23.750
I normally get this
idea in my head.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:26.490
I'm kind of a very
fidgety person, always

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:28.710
wanting to move about
and go on the go.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.060
So if I get it in my head
that I'm going for a run,

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:34.710
I'm literally in the
run before I actually

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:36.900
think of what I'm going
to eat beforehand.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.717
And I'm always
just a big believer

00:35:38.717 --> 00:35:40.550
in eating your breakfast,
lunch, and dinner.

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.010
Eating your three meals,
cooking them yourself,

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:45.220
and eating nicely.

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:48.260
SPEAKER 1: I run so that I
can add in an extra meal.

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:49.490
ADRIAN MARTIN: I like that.

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:52.160
SPEAKER 1: I know what I'm going
to eat before I go for my run.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.740
We have another few
questions over here.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:56.600
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.726
I actually wanted to ask
a bit more about shopping,

00:35:58.726 --> 00:36:00.725
because you mentioned
it's very important to buy

00:36:00.725 --> 00:36:01.940
good ingredients and things.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.875
And I think it's
often stopped us

00:36:03.875 --> 00:36:05.250
from cooking when
you don't have,

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:06.650
at home, some ingredients.

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:09.170
So what is the best advice, how
to organize your shopping so

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:11.240
that you're not really
going with a book

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.340
and choosing three items,
but more holistically,

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.370
so it kind of gives you
inspiration for cooking?

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:17.370
ADRIAN MARTIN: Yeah.

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:19.260
I put a little section
in the book there.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.880
It's "What to Have
in Your Cupboard."

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:26.100
So there's a selection of
spices and oils and stuff.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.250
If you have-- you can probably
look in your cupboard already.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:31.415
And you look at that
little list and it'll say--

00:36:31.415 --> 00:36:33.290
you can probably look
in it and then be like,

00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:35.750
oh, I actually have the
majority of that stuff already.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:39.290
The book is literally
anything that

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:44.270
is easily accessible, bought,
in all your shops in Ireland.

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:47.780
And for me, when I'm
cooking, I probably

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:50.910
do it the wrong way, which is
a lot more expensive to do.

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:53.370
I buy ingredients every day.

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:54.770
So I go shopping every day.

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:59.540
So if I'm cooking my
meals, the day before,

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.955
I'll do my shopping
for just that day.

00:37:01.955 --> 00:37:04.790
I'd recommend maybe going on a
Sunday and gathering together.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:07.520
So you know exactly what
you're making all week

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:10.610
so that you stick to a
plan, more than anything.

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:11.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.016
ADRIAN MARTIN:
Yeah, a little bit.

00:37:13.016 --> 00:37:13.880
But I love it.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:18.070
My thing is if I'm too lazy
this evening to go shopping,

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:19.820
I'll have something
in the cupboard there.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:23.210
I'll look at the ingredients
and go, right, I can make--

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:24.060
I don't know.

00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:27.009
I've got prawns there,
I've got noodles--

00:37:27.009 --> 00:37:27.800
like, rice noodles.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.392
Let's make Pad Thai, you know?

00:37:29.392 --> 00:37:31.100
Because you'll have
little bits and bobs.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.550
You can always add in different
types of ingredients and stuff.

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:36.920
And that's kind of
the way I look at it.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:40.860
You can even get creative with
food, have some fun with it,

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:41.660
as well.

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.260
If you're too lazy
one of the evenings

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.740
to actually do
something, have a look

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:47.450
at what you have
instead of picking up

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:51.590
the phone a dialing Just
Eat, whatever it is.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:54.140
Have a look at what you have
and I can put money on it,

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:59.094
you can put together something
really fast, really easy.

00:37:59.094 --> 00:38:00.260
A lot quicker than takeaway.

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:08.150
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for the talk.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:10.483
Before I worked here, I worked
also in a five-star hotel

00:38:10.483 --> 00:38:11.550
and had chefs every day.

00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:13.216
And I think you are
the most humble chef

00:38:13.216 --> 00:38:16.460
I've ever met, which I think
is really, really cool.

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.417
And I have a light question.

00:38:18.417 --> 00:38:20.750
What is one thing that you
really dislike, but sometimes

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:22.416
you have to prepare
it for someone else,

00:38:22.416 --> 00:38:25.234
but you really hate it?

00:38:25.234 --> 00:38:26.400
ADRIAN MARTIN: I don't know.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.619
I don't mind-- what?

00:38:27.619 --> 00:38:28.660
AUDIENCE: You hate sushi.

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:29.860
ADRIAN MARTIN: Oh, yeah, sushi.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:30.410
Yeah.

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:32.535
I've made sushi so many
times, I just can't eat it.

00:38:32.535 --> 00:38:33.300
Agh.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:34.490
No.

00:38:34.490 --> 00:38:36.050
No, it's not for me at all.

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:36.620
Sorry.

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:38.580
There are just some
things that aren't for me.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.030
But yeah.

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.940
I just think it's--

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.460
I don't know what it is.

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.860
Just can't get my
head around it.

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:50.100
What else do I not like?

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:52.537
Banoffee pie because
bananas, you know?

00:38:52.537 --> 00:38:53.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:55.270
Anything to do with bananas.

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:58.120
Oh, also, what gets
on my nerves, right,

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.600
is do you know when you
have a smoothie and it says,

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:01.410
mango smoothie?

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:02.075
OK?

00:39:02.075 --> 00:39:03.800
But they put banana in it?

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.200
It's a banana smoothie, come on.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.702
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:06.702 --> 00:39:07.910
It just tastes like a banana.

00:39:10.674 --> 00:39:11.840
AUDIENCE: How are you doing?

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.400
ADRIAN MARTIN: Hi.

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.360
AUDIENCE: I was giving
a look to your book,

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.150
and there is different
kind of food in it.

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:22.340
There's a bit o Italian,
there is a bit of Indian.

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:23.700
So I have two questions.

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.150
The first one is, where
do you get inspiration

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:29.000
when you of a new recipe?

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.890
And the second question
is, I have a dinner

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:32.570
party coming next week--

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:34.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:35.690
I swear to God.

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:39.230
And I would like to have a
suggestion from your book

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:40.680
for a starter and a main.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.596
ADRIAN MARTIN: OK, OK.

00:39:41.596 --> 00:39:43.220
I like that, actually.

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:46.020
So what was the first question?

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.440
I've forgotten it.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.190
AUDIENCE: Your
inspiration, where you take

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.950
inspiration in the recipes.

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:51.575
ADRIAN MARTIN: The
inspiration behind--

00:39:51.575 --> 00:39:54.980
so you see it's all
broken down into chapters?

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.492
I've traveled to
all these places

00:39:56.492 --> 00:39:58.200
to try all these
different types of food.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:02.890
You can see, in Japan
there, when I was in Japan,

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:05.540
I got this lovely little
scallop on the street.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.360
I was amazed by it.

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.287
It was just this guy who was
standing at this little stall.

00:40:09.287 --> 00:40:10.620
He had the shell on the scallop.

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:13.700
He took the coral off and he
had a blowtorch and he just--

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.260
sea salt-- blowtorched
the scallop there.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:18.237
And it was in a--

00:40:18.237 --> 00:40:20.570
served, give you a little
fork, and you eat your scallop

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:22.235
on the go, blowtorched scallop.

00:40:22.235 --> 00:40:23.510
And I was obsessed with that.

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:25.910
So kind of the inspiration
behind-- you'll

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:28.550
see each recipe has a story.

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:30.660
On top, each recipe has
a little story there.

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:33.920
And there's a pancake in
there called a socca pancake.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:37.320
So in Nice, there's
Nicoise cuisine.

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:39.230
They have their own
type of cuisine that's

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:41.850
completely different to France.

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:46.120
And they have all their own
different ethnic dishes.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.290
The socca, I was
obsessed with it.

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:50.690
Because in the market
square in Nice,

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:53.012
when you walk into
the market square,

00:40:53.012 --> 00:40:54.095
there's this massive line.

00:40:54.095 --> 00:40:55.636
And I was like,
what's going on here?

00:40:55.636 --> 00:40:58.080
There's this big line lining
up for this type of pancake.

00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.420
And I walked up.

00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:02.030
Anyway, they make it
there at the stall.

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:05.330
It's a little like, I
suppose, bike and cart.

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:08.000
And when they make it, they
mix it up and roll it out.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.834
They place it onto this
little type of cart.

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:12.374
It goes through a pizza oven,
it comes back in seven minutes.

00:41:12.374 --> 00:41:13.920
Next thing, this
massive line forms,

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.430
and it's this crispy
chickpea pancake.

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:18.710
But every recipe inside
there has a story

00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:20.720
of where I've seen
it before and I

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.582
wanted to learn how to make it.

00:41:22.582 --> 00:41:24.290
And then, what I was
saying was the wheel

00:41:24.290 --> 00:41:25.670
that squeaks gets the oil.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:27.450
When I was in Nice, I was
like, show me how to make that.

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:28.610
I'm not leaving until
you show me how.

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:29.110
You know?

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:32.230
And that's kind of where I
learned my recipes and stuff,

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:34.750
from traveling and all.

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:36.477
For your dinner party--

00:41:36.477 --> 00:41:38.350
AUDIENCE: Pick two, please.

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:40.100
ADRIAN MARTIN: Scallops
and black pudding.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.516
Very, very simple
to put together.

00:41:41.516 --> 00:41:48.384
It literally takes you, like,
30 seconds to two minutes--

00:41:48.384 --> 00:41:50.470
like, two minutes, each
side of your scallop

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:51.630
will cook your scallops.

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:53.120
Black pudding on the same pan.

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.536
How many people
have you got over?

00:41:54.536 --> 00:41:55.740
Six, is it?

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:56.380
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.213
ADRIAN MARTIN: Four.

00:41:57.213 --> 00:42:00.330
So literally four scallops each,
four pieces of black pudding.

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:04.184
A Granny Smith apple, which is
sliced up really, really thin,

00:42:04.184 --> 00:42:05.600
mixed through your
lamb's lettuce.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:08.022
Lemon juice, olive
oil, sea salt.

00:42:08.022 --> 00:42:10.520
Put that in the middle of the
plate, arrange your scallops.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.603
Make sure you get a lovely
color on your scallops.

00:42:12.603 --> 00:42:15.627
AUDIENCE: I asked you for an
easy recipe, a very easy one.

00:42:15.627 --> 00:42:17.210
ADRIAN MARTIN: What
else could you do?

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:19.185
So you're-- oh, a lovely
starter-- actually,

00:42:19.185 --> 00:42:21.560
it's not in the book, but a
lovely starter you could do--

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.934
because we've got
nectarines that

00:42:22.934 --> 00:42:25.940
are in season at the
moment, if you get yourself

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.190
a little bit of
ricotta cheese, you

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:30.530
get yourself some
sriracha sauce.

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:32.810
Drizzle in some sriracha
sauce into your ricotta.

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:35.480
Lemon juice, pinch of
salt. Mix that together.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.670
Get yourself some
toasted sourdough bread.

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:39.440
Spread that on your
sourdough bread

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.750
and get yourself
a dry griddle pan.

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:45.380
And griddle little
segments of your nectarine

00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:49.572
or peach and place those
on top with some rocket.

00:42:49.572 --> 00:42:51.280
AUDIENCE: Now you're
talking like a chef.

00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.113
ADRIAN MARTIN: Yeah.

00:42:52.113 --> 00:42:52.940
AUDIENCE: You know?

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.547
And a little, I
don't know, dessert?

00:42:54.547 --> 00:42:55.505
ADRIAN MARTIN: Dessert.

00:42:55.505 --> 00:42:56.765
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:56.765 --> 00:43:01.150
There's After Eight
cheesecake there.

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:04.740
So I had a big obsession
for desserts in there.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:06.740
There's After Eight
cheesecake, which is insane.

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:09.560
And also, your main course.

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.705
If you're looking at the sides,
have the little try at Easter--

00:43:12.705 --> 00:43:13.830
AUDIENCE: It looks amazing.

00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:15.880
ADRIAN MARTIN: It
looks good, doesn't it?

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.220
There's Hasselback potatoes.

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.704
So if you have a little
look at your side dishes,

00:43:20.704 --> 00:43:22.120
these Hasselback
potatoes, they're

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:24.660
literally, like, the
most insanely crispy,

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.950
fluffy potatoes you'll ever
have in your life ever.

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:28.480
They're really, really good.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.313
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:29.313 --> 00:43:31.618
ADRIAN MARTIN: Thank you.

00:43:31.618 --> 00:43:32.980
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:36.940
I'm just wondering,
so when I was 15, 16,

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:39.910
I had the urge to
become a chef, as well.

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:42.760
However, my parents--
especially my dad-- was like,

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:45.610
no, you need to go to uni,
and you've got your brains.

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:48.070
And in the Netherlands,
because I'm Dutch,

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:49.670
you have to have
a certain degree

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:52.330
to go into cooking school.

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:53.950
And I was--

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:55.570
I wasn't eligible to go in.

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:58.390
But I'm still doubting
until the day of today

00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:01.220
whether I should do
a cooking school.

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:03.730
However, my question to you
is, obviously, you started

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:05.500
when you was really young.

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:07.870
Have you ever felt
like you missed out

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:10.450
on your youth whilst
other friends were doing,

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:14.590
I don't know, going out,
meeting other girls or guys,

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:15.610
going out for drinks?

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:17.557
And I know you're
really passionate,

00:44:17.557 --> 00:44:20.140
but I'm just wondering, have you
ever felt like you missed out

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:22.970
or that you wanted to
change to something else?

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:24.820
And what would be
your advice to people

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:27.970
that have had a dream
similar to you, as well,

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:32.335
but couldn't because of, I
don't know, college or whatever?

00:44:32.335 --> 00:44:34.340
ADRIAN MARTIN: My thing was--

00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:36.760
I suppose I went through
so many different phases

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:39.010
since I was working there.

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:40.960
You go through so many
different emotions

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.510
because you're seeing
the same people

00:44:42.510 --> 00:44:47.400
every single day of the
week, your 80 hours a week.

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:50.470
So literally, your
emotions change like that.

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:51.700
And yeah.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:55.810
I went through so many
different kind of emotions.

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:56.940
All my friends--

00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:59.620
I have two friends, believe
it or not, now because of it.

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.406
Two of my best friends have
stuck with me from school

00:45:02.406 --> 00:45:08.000
and literally have been
the best guys to me

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.270
and understood that I had
those long hours and stuff.

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:15.070
But the amount of friends that
just literally dropped and left

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:17.050
because, you know,
they were asking you,

00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:18.180
oh, we're going here.

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.390
Let's go here.

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:20.620
You miss out on everything.

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:22.161
You really do miss
out on everything,

00:45:22.161 --> 00:45:24.690
but it was a sacrifice
I had to take.

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:27.010
Looking back,
probably my parents

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:28.260
were the biggest help to me.

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.310
They were always
like, oh, just wait

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:31.570
until you get to your future.

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:32.945
You never know
what you could do.

00:45:32.945 --> 00:45:35.920
You could be maybe working in a
college as a college lecturer.

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:37.059
You could be maybe--

00:45:37.059 --> 00:45:37.600
I don't know.

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:41.020
My dad was always a believer
that if you believe something,

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:45.130
follow through in it, and
it'll work out in the end.

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:47.810
It was a lot of hard
work, long hours.

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:49.260
There's even Bon Appetit.

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:51.470
I will give you an example.

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:55.770
Oliver Dunne was the chef who
trained under Gordon Ramsay.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:59.350
For six-- I think it was six,
seven months I was there,

00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:01.940
every day, I stood
here on pastry.

00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:04.720
Oliver stood here, who was
the owner of the restaurant,

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.610
and shouting at me,
and gave me abuse,

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:11.470
and told me I'm a f'ing
idiot, and you're a--

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:13.140
whatever-- all day.

00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:16.870
So you'd listen to that
all day from someone.

00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:18.230
Yeah, it's tough.

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:20.147
It really is a tough career.

00:46:20.147 --> 00:46:21.230
It's getting a lot better.

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:24.730
There's a lot more help
out there for chefs.

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:28.360
There's a massive shortage
in them in Ireland.

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:32.350
There's a shortage
of about 5,000 chefs.

00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:35.740
And the reason for that,
they blame the qualification

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:36.680
schemes, but it's not.

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.210
It's the treatment
that chefs are

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:40.750
receiving in the restaurants.

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:43.420
It's not the way to
treat people at all.

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:46.630
There is a lot more rules and
regulations coming in for us.

00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:49.260
Some of the places
are disgraceful.

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:52.150
Let's be honest, having
pots and pans thrown at you

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:53.890
is not very nice.

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:58.890
But obviously, those guys
are being sought after.

00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:01.910
But I recommend, if you
want to do something

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:06.460
and you believe that the end
goal is you get an amazing job,

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:09.595
an amazing life, I think
follow through with it.

00:47:09.595 --> 00:47:10.325
Yeah.

00:47:10.325 --> 00:47:11.200
SPEAKER 1: Very good.

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.930
Certainly sounds like there
is room in the market for you

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:14.830
if you feel like--

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:15.020
ADRIAN MARTIN:
There's lots of room.

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:15.914
Loads of room.

00:47:15.914 --> 00:47:16.860
Loads of room.

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:17.485
SPEAKER 1: There's
one more question

00:47:17.485 --> 00:47:18.734
over on this side of the room.

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:22.330
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:25.570
When you were talking right
now about your experience,

00:47:25.570 --> 00:47:27.970
it reminded me
about a movie, and I

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:30.400
wanted to ask you which
are-- like, for example,

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.190
for me, the cooking movie
I love is "Ratatouille."

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:34.690
It's my cooking movie.

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:38.982
Which are your favorite
cooking-related movies?

00:47:38.982 --> 00:47:39.940
ADRIAN MARTIN: I love--

00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:44.860
what have I watched recently?

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:46.220
I'm obsessed with cooking shows.

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:49.040
I watch so many of them.

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:51.084
Have you ever seen
"Man versus Food?"

00:47:51.084 --> 00:47:52.042
AUDIENCE: Adam Richman.

00:47:52.042 --> 00:47:52.920
ADRIAN MARTIN: Huh?

00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:53.640
AUDIENCE: Adam Richman.

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:54.130
ADRIAN MARTIN: Adam Richman.

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:54.629
Yeah.

00:47:54.629 --> 00:47:57.460
I actually met Adam recently.

00:47:57.460 --> 00:47:59.890
He came to Guinness.

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:01.400
I was obsessed with that show.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:02.890
So when we met Adam, we
were literally like--

00:48:02.890 --> 00:48:03.240
[GASPS]

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:04.531
I was literally standing there.

00:48:04.531 --> 00:48:06.662
I was like, I
can't speak to him.

00:48:06.662 --> 00:48:09.310
But my friend
thought it'd be funny

00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:10.675
that we were, like, messing.

00:48:10.675 --> 00:48:13.050
We were just like, oh, let's
get him to do the challenge.

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:15.250
But no, he wasn't up for it.

00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:18.610
I love so many different
types of cooking shows.

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:20.170
My all-time favorite
cooking show

00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:24.700
ever is "The F Word"
by Gordon Ramsay.

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.130
Probably the best put
together cooking show ever.

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:29.470
It's so good to watch.

00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:32.670
Gordon's such a fast-paced chef.

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:34.630
He's fiery, obviously.

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:38.740
But it's so interesting
to see ordinary people

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:40.390
come in and work
inside his kitchen

00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:43.630
and serve food out to an
amazing set of guests and stuff.

00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:45.040
It's a really, really good show.

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:49.600
He's also set a new series
out in the US at the moment.

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:50.720
"The F Word" again, yeah.

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:51.460
It's really good.

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:51.720
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:52.040
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:52.250
Great.

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:52.750
Thank you.

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:55.760
So I'll just ask one last
question before we close.

00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.520
I love that you've
created a book that's

00:48:57.520 --> 00:49:00.330
for the people on the
other end of the spectrum

00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:01.930
because, like you
were saying, it's

00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:04.460
so easy to drop
out of these habits

00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:07.060
and stop continuing them.

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:10.660
Have you had any
feedback from people on--

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:13.360
what kind of a feedback have
you had on the book so far?

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:17.860
ADRIAN MARTIN: Well,
thousands of pictures

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.710
from actual students,
which I didn't

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:21.950
expect it to be students.

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:26.350
I expected it to be just
mommies, at the end of the day.

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:29.000
But no, students
have picked up on it

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.840
and yeah, it's been amazing.

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:35.259
I'm receiving pictures
every single day of recipes

00:49:35.259 --> 00:49:36.300
being made from the book.

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:39.380
Oh, I made your-- it was
really delicious, you know?

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:42.640
And that makes my day.

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:46.639
Also, I was a nervous wreck
when the book came out.

00:49:46.639 --> 00:49:48.930
Because it's your it book,
so you're shaking and stuff.

00:49:48.930 --> 00:49:50.971
So when I walked in to
see it on the shelf, like,

00:49:50.971 --> 00:49:52.570
your heart's racing.

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:54.990
But I remember walking in--
and actually, it's funny--

00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:55.570
into Eason.

00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:58.226
And there was a guy actually
reading it and I was like, oh!

00:49:58.226 --> 00:49:59.192
Like, walked away.

00:49:59.192 --> 00:50:01.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:03.420
I should've stood beside
him, like, so what you think?

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.788
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:11.660
But yeah, I was a
nervous wreck about it.

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.134
Yeah, so I was like--

00:50:13.134 --> 00:50:15.550
like, it's either you make it
or you break it with a book.

00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:18.260
It's a big risk to do.

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:20.620
And if your book
doesn't do well,

00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:22.780
you can say goodbye to
your career, really.

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:24.520
You won't go as
further on as you can.

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:27.065
So it's such a massive
risky thing to do.

00:50:27.065 --> 00:50:29.500
I'm just lucky that
it's done so well

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:32.231
and that I've had massive
feedback from everyone.

00:50:32.231 --> 00:50:33.230
SPEAKER 1: That's great.

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:34.240
Congratulations.

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:37.660
And I hope that you get a few
photos from the various people

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:43.480
in this room today from taking
your recipes home with them.

00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:45.920
Thank you so much for coming
in to speak to us today.

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:46.961
ADRIAN MARTIN: Thank you.

00:50:46.961 --> 00:50:50.820
[APPLAUSE]
