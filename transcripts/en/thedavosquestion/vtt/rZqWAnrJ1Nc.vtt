&gt;&gt;Brad Anderson: I think most of the time
we have spent here at Davos has been on the

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.529
environment. And I think actually there is
a perverse logic because we have to reinvent

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.880
the way we do things and get more efficient.
And it's a chance to actually integrate the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.900
environment which is into the same thing.
So we've been having a lot of discussion across

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.109
companies of really I think exciting stuff
where we may be able to tie companies' efforts

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.480
together that will have a big effect on the
environment as well as stanch some of the

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.429
financial problems. I think actually both
of them can be dealt with. At least in our

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:28.759
business.
