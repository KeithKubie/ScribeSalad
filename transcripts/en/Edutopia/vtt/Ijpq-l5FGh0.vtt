00:00:08.106 --> 00:00:12.886
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, ladies and
gentlemen, let's rock and roll.

00:00:12.886 --> 00:00:14.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A good teacher
is a precious commodity.

00:00:15.086 --> 00:00:17.136
&gt;&gt;Teacher: That's a pretty
cool way to encrypt this.

00:00:17.136 --> 00:00:18.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: There just
aren't enough to go around,

00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.896
especially in urban
and rural districts.

00:00:21.216 --> 00:00:23.786
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Do you think these
Cray computers could break this?

00:00:23.786 --> 00:00:25.536
&gt;&gt;Student: In about two seconds.

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:26.586
&gt;&gt;Teacher: About two seconds.

00:00:26.956 --> 00:00:27.406
Do you know--

00:00:27.406 --> 00:00:30.006
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Schools of education
have come under fire for turning

00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:32.326
out teachers with inadequate
content knowledge,

00:00:32.546 --> 00:00:36.356
insufficient classroom experience,
and few technological skills.

00:00:36.356 --> 00:00:37.836
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And my favorite
matrix, obviously,

00:00:37.836 --> 00:00:39.436
is two negative seventeen eleven--

00:00:39.746 --> 00:00:43.136
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But there's a quiet
revolution underway in schools

00:00:43.136 --> 00:00:44.846
of education across the country.

00:00:44.846 --> 00:00:46.306
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, so we're
getting a lot of sugars--

00:00:46.306 --> 00:00:49.676
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A movement that puts
student teachers in classrooms early,

00:00:49.776 --> 00:00:53.056
and supports their development
with peer groups, mentor teachers

00:00:53.276 --> 00:00:58.076
and even extraordinary students.

00:00:58.076 --> 00:01:02.416
&gt;&gt;Randy: This represents the bone in
your head, and I would be the earth

00:01:02.416 --> 00:01:04.316
and that's about the
right scale, all right?

00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:08.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At the University of
Virginia's Curry School of Education,

00:01:08.426 --> 00:01:12.516
incoming students begin a five year
program by studying core subjects

00:01:12.516 --> 00:01:14.716
and discovering engaging
ways to teach them.

00:01:14.796 --> 00:01:18.106
&gt;&gt;Randy: We've got your head
is the earth, this is the moon,

00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:21.516
and see if you can
work out the phases

00:01:21.516 --> 00:01:23.106
by having the moon orbit the earth.

00:01:23.706 --> 00:01:26.066
&gt;&gt;I wanted there to be an
opportunity for students

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:29.146
to experience the phenomena
in a classroom.

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:33.196
They have a basic understanding of
their content, or their subject area.

00:01:33.936 --> 00:01:36.796
They're pretty green when it comes
to knowing how to teach that,

00:01:37.426 --> 00:01:39.486
and I wanted to model how
you can start something

00:01:39.486 --> 00:01:41.306
that really engages students.

00:01:42.356 --> 00:01:44.466
&gt;&gt;What is it about this
activity that made it effective?

00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:47.286
&gt;&gt;Student: I think anything
where you make the learner

00:01:47.416 --> 00:01:51.786
like a really active part, definitely
it makes it relate to them.

00:01:51.786 --> 00:01:54.186
So I think anything where you can do
that, like change your perspective,

00:01:54.626 --> 00:01:57.596
just makes it all that
more fun and interesting.

00:01:57.766 --> 00:02:00.726
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You find that
picture that you wanted.

00:02:00.726 --> 00:02:02.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Curry students
get into classrooms early

00:02:02.976 --> 00:02:04.426
and often in the program.

00:02:04.716 --> 00:02:06.216
As sophomores, they spend most

00:02:06.216 --> 00:02:08.456
of the year observing
mentor teachers at work.

00:02:08.506 --> 00:02:08.746
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Thursday.

00:02:09.256 --> 00:02:12.256
Can you see my tongue
does something different?

00:02:12.256 --> 00:02:16.076
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Watching an
experienced master teacher work

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:19.056
with those children, seeing
how the children react

00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:22.616
and seeing how the teacher adjusts
with each child, and with the group

00:02:22.616 --> 00:02:24.516
of children, it's totally invaluable.

00:02:24.516 --> 00:02:26.836
I mean, you can't just imagine this.

00:02:27.486 --> 00:02:28.896
You have to see it at work.

00:02:29.536 --> 00:02:32.906
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Try doing file,
quit and see if that works.

00:02:33.316 --> 00:02:34.766
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Later in
the Curry program,

00:02:34.766 --> 00:02:37.286
students get involved
in one on one tutoring.

00:02:37.716 --> 00:02:41.656
They also develop and present some
class lessons before honing their

00:02:41.656 --> 00:02:44.406
teaching skills as full
time student teachers.

00:02:44.406 --> 00:02:48.646
&gt;&gt;Jessica: I want you
guys to think of a person

00:02:48.646 --> 00:02:54.086
who you think exemplifies, you know,
you like the way they present--

00:02:54.386 --> 00:02:57.046
&gt;&gt;It looks so easy until you
get on in there and do it,

00:02:57.216 --> 00:02:59.966
and then you're like,
"Whoa, this is so hard."

00:02:59.966 --> 00:03:02.786
I mean, getting ready for
a lesson, hours go into it.

00:03:02.786 --> 00:03:05.296
Classroom management, I
mean, that is a huge issue.

00:03:05.926 --> 00:03:08.396
&gt;&gt;When you present information that--

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:11.286
&gt;&gt;Mary: There's nothing like walking
into a classroom with twenty,

00:03:11.286 --> 00:03:15.566
twenty-five, thirty active students,
and you've got to teach them.

00:03:15.566 --> 00:03:17.296
And the first thing you've
got to do is to be able

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:19.596
to manage the classroom, because
if you can't manage a classroom,

00:03:19.596 --> 00:03:20.956
you're going to teach
very much of anything.

00:03:21.346 --> 00:03:25.196
And the second thing you've got to do
is to be able to present the lesson

00:03:25.356 --> 00:03:29.066
or lessons in a way that the
children understand, they can learn

00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:30.026
and they'll want to learn.

00:03:30.026 --> 00:03:31.426
&gt;&gt;Jessica: And then who's
going to do the biography.

00:03:31.836 --> 00:03:35.716
&gt;&gt;Mary: There's no place to do
that better than to actually be

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:39.616
in a classroom with
a group of students.

00:03:40.636 --> 00:03:44.046
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We have kind of a full
agenda tonight, so we're going

00:03:44.046 --> 00:03:45.456
to go right ahead and get started.

00:03:45.456 --> 00:03:47.006
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Another
teacher trainer program

00:03:47.006 --> 00:03:51.086
that stresses extensive classroom
work is Colorado State University's

00:03:51.086 --> 00:03:55.246
Project Promise, a yearlong
graduate degree program for people

00:03:55.246 --> 00:03:57.816
who are changing careers
to enter teaching.

00:03:58.016 --> 00:04:00.126
&gt;&gt;Carrie: And I really
like love these kids,

00:04:00.126 --> 00:04:01.656
and I finally had that feeling.

00:04:01.656 --> 00:04:03.926
Like for a full hour, I'll
have that feeling, you know.

00:04:04.656 --> 00:04:07.576
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For Carrie Hanson,
it meant making the adjustment

00:04:07.576 --> 00:04:10.066
from the solitary life
of a chemical engineer,

00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:13.456
to the collaborative enterprise
of teaching high school science.

00:04:13.456 --> 00:04:16.776
&gt;&gt;Carrie: Ionic compounds, from
now on, you're never going to look

00:04:16.776 --> 00:04:18.136
at the label the same, right?

00:04:18.136 --> 00:04:21.016
So speaking of ionic compounds,

00:04:21.926 --> 00:04:25.776
we've got this cool card
game that you've seen before.

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:28.596
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Project
Promise students are exposed

00:04:28.596 --> 00:04:32.656
to the classroom teaching environment
just three weeks into the program,

00:04:32.916 --> 00:04:34.436
but they don't go it alone.

00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:38.076
They are constantly monitored
and evaluated by their peers.

00:04:38.076 --> 00:04:38.756
&gt;&gt;Teacher: How do you think it went?

00:04:39.296 --> 00:04:41.316
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I was really
excited about the students.

00:04:41.316 --> 00:04:42.346
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Their mentor teachers.

00:04:42.346 --> 00:04:44.526
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It worked well,
and it worked well for review.

00:04:44.956 --> 00:04:47.216
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And by one of
the program's directors.

00:04:47.216 --> 00:04:50.056
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Your transition
from the food labels

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:52.216
to the game was a little rough.

00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:55.636
&gt;&gt;Emily: Peer review
is very important.

00:04:55.636 --> 00:04:58.146
You have the advantage
of having people

00:04:58.146 --> 00:05:00.546
who are very close to the situation.

00:05:00.546 --> 00:05:03.296
It's not somebody who taught
ten or fifteen years ago.

00:05:03.296 --> 00:05:05.146
I mean, you're right
there, you just did it.

00:05:05.756 --> 00:05:10.306
And if you're working with a mentor
teacher or an experienced teacher

00:05:10.306 --> 00:05:14.456
or college professor, that
interaction can be very effective

00:05:14.456 --> 00:05:16.366
in learning how to teach.

00:05:16.496 --> 00:05:19.236
&gt;&gt;Steve: So I'm going to
put up a code on the board.

00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:20.826
I want to see if anybody
can break it.

00:05:21.846 --> 00:05:22.396
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While half

00:05:22.396 --> 00:05:25.846
of the teachers entering the
profession nationwide leave teaching

00:05:25.846 --> 00:05:28.646
during their first five
years, the retention rate

00:05:28.646 --> 00:05:32.226
for Project Promise grads, like
Steve Sayers, is 80 percent.

00:05:32.226 --> 00:05:33.366
&gt;&gt;Steve: That is a word.

00:05:33.796 --> 00:05:35.276
&gt;&gt;Narrator: He credits
the program's success

00:05:35.276 --> 00:05:38.766
to the camaraderie
of peers and staff.

00:05:38.766 --> 00:05:41.416
&gt;&gt;Steve: You know when they walk
into the room or walk down the hall,

00:05:41.786 --> 00:05:43.206
they will come up to you and say,

00:05:43.206 --> 00:05:45.286
"How are things going,
what can I do?"

00:05:45.626 --> 00:05:46.836
and they are there for you.

00:05:46.836 --> 00:05:49.046
Any phone call and they respond.

00:05:49.446 --> 00:05:51.356
So the support is there.

00:05:51.416 --> 00:05:55.226
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In addition to mastering
core content and teaching skills,

00:05:55.346 --> 00:05:57.586
today's teachers are
confronted with the challenge

00:05:57.586 --> 00:05:59.256
of teaching in the digital age.

00:05:59.596 --> 00:06:04.546
&gt;&gt;When it comes to acquiring
vital technology skills,

00:06:04.546 --> 00:06:06.976
pre-service teachers need
all the help they can get,

00:06:07.386 --> 00:06:10.146
and at Washington Middle
School in Olympia, Washington,

00:06:10.446 --> 00:06:12.296
help comes from seventh graders.

00:06:12.776 --> 00:06:15.006
&gt;&gt;Student: The title's
here, and that font is good

00:06:15.006 --> 00:06:16.156
for the titles 'cause it's big.

00:06:16.156 --> 00:06:18.146
It's big enough that you can
distinguish the letters, and--

00:06:18.466 --> 00:06:20.596
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay, do you see
anything you would change?

00:06:20.696 --> 00:06:23.766
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah, there's
no home link here.

00:06:23.936 --> 00:06:24.226
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay.

00:06:24.466 --> 00:06:27.776
&gt;&gt;Student: I notice that on your
previous page, like you have on here,

00:06:27.906 --> 00:06:32.386
and that's really good, but some
browsers don't have back buttons,

00:06:32.496 --> 00:06:35.666
so they have to retype the
URL, which is really annoying.

00:06:36.046 --> 00:06:37.916
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Begun in
nineteen ninety-six,

00:06:37.916 --> 00:06:41.596
the Generation Y program pairs
tech savvy grade schoolers

00:06:41.696 --> 00:06:43.406
with tech challenged teachers,

00:06:43.406 --> 00:06:45.976
to help them integrate new
technology into their lesson plans.

00:06:47.016 --> 00:06:49.106
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Right now, what
we have is a couple websites

00:06:49.186 --> 00:06:51.456
for our research purposes,
but that's about it,

00:06:51.966 --> 00:06:54.236
so what kind of suggestions do
you think you might have as far

00:06:54.236 --> 00:06:55.696
as wording to use technology.

00:06:55.696 --> 00:06:58.206
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, like
for a presentation

00:06:58.366 --> 00:07:01.866
about how they did a
PowerPoint would be a good one.

00:07:01.866 --> 00:07:04.156
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Now operating
in more than forty states,

00:07:04.156 --> 00:07:07.026
this elegantly simple
concept was the brainchild

00:07:07.026 --> 00:07:09.686
of Olympia school district's
technology coordinator,

00:07:10.016 --> 00:07:10.876
Dennis Harper.

00:07:10.986 --> 00:07:15.026
&gt;&gt;Dennis: I was a former university
college of education trainer

00:07:15.026 --> 00:07:18.536
of pre-service teachers,
and typically,

00:07:18.536 --> 00:07:22.646
a lot of the instruction they get
are from professors who haven't been

00:07:22.646 --> 00:07:24.466
in a classroom in twenty years.

00:07:24.466 --> 00:07:26.796
There's not a teacher in the
United States that actually went

00:07:26.826 --> 00:07:30.656
to K-twelve schools when the
world wide web was in existence.

00:07:31.026 --> 00:07:33.886
So teachers don't realize,
you know, the resources.

00:07:33.996 --> 00:07:36.356
They don't realize how
sharp these kids are.

00:07:36.976 --> 00:07:39.976
They don't realize the fact that
for the first time in history now,

00:07:39.976 --> 00:07:43.566
we have students knowing
more than their teachers

00:07:43.566 --> 00:07:47.076
about something that's really
central and important to society.

00:07:47.286 --> 00:07:49.656
&gt;&gt;Student: And web pages, there's
just like endless possibilities.

00:07:49.826 --> 00:07:53.296
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While more experienced
Gen Y kids help student teachers

00:07:53.296 --> 00:07:54.816
with tech infused lessons,

00:07:55.226 --> 00:07:58.636
fourth graders help their
classroom teachers learn new skills,

00:07:58.956 --> 00:08:00.216
like video editing.

00:08:00.216 --> 00:08:01.086
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What's a transition?

00:08:01.156 --> 00:08:04.256
&gt;&gt;Student: Transitions are like,
you can fade in and fade out,

00:08:04.836 --> 00:08:06.706
and you can like a dial--

00:08:06.876 --> 00:08:09.476
&gt;&gt;Dennis: More than ninety-eight
percent of the thousands of teachers

00:08:09.476 --> 00:08:12.696
that have been involved with this
program have said they preferred

00:08:12.696 --> 00:08:15.006
learning from students
than learning from adults.

00:08:15.196 --> 00:08:17.816
Teachers go into teaching 'cause
they like to work with kids,

00:08:17.816 --> 00:08:19.676
and that's what makes
this model successful.

00:08:19.936 --> 00:08:20.516
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Then what happens?

00:08:20.516 --> 00:08:21.316
&gt;&gt;Teacher: This looks pretty easy.

00:08:21.396 --> 00:08:23.206
Is it really this easy?

00:08:23.206 --> 00:08:26.686
&gt;&gt;Narrator Whether it's teaching tech
skills or a classroom discipline,

00:08:26.686 --> 00:08:30.576
the new model for teacher
education is all about collaboration

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:33.366
between students and
their mentors of any age,

00:08:33.606 --> 00:08:36.066
with whom they share
the joy of teaching.

00:08:36.066 --> 00:08:39.546
&gt;&gt;Teacher: The last couple of weeks,
what started to happen is that I feel

00:08:39.546 --> 00:08:42.246
like I stopped hanging in there
and started really teaching well,

00:08:42.356 --> 00:08:44.736
and it's a really cool feeling.
