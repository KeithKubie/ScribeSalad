1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,500
So today we find ourselves in a very
different novelistic world than we've been

2
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:10,150
in for the last week and
a half on the road. Um,

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,860
did anyone take this course
because they love on the road?

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,530
Anybody one sort of
ambivalently yes. Okay.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,490
Sometimes I do get students who,
um,

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,280
have just an image of this novel in their
mind or they read it when they were in

7
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:30,060
high school and have a sort of irrational,

8
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:33,240
passionate love for it. Um, and,

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:36,090
and so sometimes people
approach it in that way.

10
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:41,091
And I think in a way it holds that aura
around itself in our culture and in the

11
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:46,680
history of the novel in this period
that we're studying together.

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,930
I'm going to talk a little bit
about it's publishing history.

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,860
Um,

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,860
it's compositional history actually at
the end of my two lectures on the novels.

15
00:00:58,671 --> 00:01:03,060
So I would ask you just to reserve
whatever curiosity you have about that.

16
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,150
Um, so I, in a way, I'm
flipping my usual practice.

17
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:09,150
I would tell you a little bit about its
publication history at the beginning.

18
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:11,280
I'm going to do that at the end.
Um,

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,550
for this reason that it has such a
special place in the imagination of our

20
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:23,550
culture and so I'm going to talk about
that after we have a better understanding

21
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:24,750
of what's going on in the book.

22
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,310
My point at the end of my lecture on the
Lita on Monday was that [inaudible] is

23
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:37,911
trying to imagine an autonomous work
of art that has a life to it that is in

24
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:45,090
some sense animated or personified,

25
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,450
and that this desire to make the aesthetic
something living introduces to the

26
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:56,640
world of the aesthetic,
the problem of mortality,

27
00:01:56,641 --> 00:02:01,641
it's mortality that gives it
that sense of ephemeral value,

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:08,480
but it's also mortality that
threatens to cancel it out altogether.

29
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,830
The language that the beets tried to
imagine tried to write takes up some of

30
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:22,530
these problems that we saw in Dubach off.

31
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,170
Unlike Novakof,

32
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,230
these writers are not trying to make a
language that is autonomous and separate

33
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:32,910
from the world,

34
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,090
so you will not see the kind of artifice
and the Labor detention to form.

35
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,860
You're not going to have a writer spending
a month on the representation of a

36
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:51,220
barber from Kaz beam. You're not
going to get that in the beats. Um,

37
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,970
instead you're getting something,

38
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,220
a language that tries to
come as close as possible,

39
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,600
not necessarily to life in all its facets,

40
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,540
but to life as we experience it

41
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,480
in a certain way.

42
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,840
This is not a rejection of modernism and
its desire for the autonomous work of

43
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:21,280
art. Um, because partly as I've shown the,

44
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:26,281
I like the desire for the autonomous
work of art shades into the desire to

45
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:28,270
replicate life.

46
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,920
There is that desire much more explicitly
in the writing of Jack Kerouac,

47
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:40,050
the desire to replicate experience
as you read the feeling of having the

48
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:44,980
experience that the writer wants you
to have and that the writer himself has

49
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:49,900
had, that's always going to be important,
um, to understanding this work.

50
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,280
So that's one aspect in which it
shares something with modernism.

51
00:03:56,291 --> 00:04:00,130
Even though stylistically and as
a matter of craft and composition,

52
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:01,480
it looks very distinct.

53
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:07,230
The other way it shares an ambition of
modernism is precisely in that effort to

54
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:12,340
communicate experience consciousness.

55
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,410
So if you've read it all in the novels
of, for a Virginia Woolf, for example,

56
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:22,480
or in James Joyce's novels,
you know,

57
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,050
that part of modernist innovation,

58
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,410
part of the stylistic difficulty is the
effort to put on the page what happens

59
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:33,190
in the mind,

60
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:39,390
that sense of the mind drifting from
one idea to another that you get in

61
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:44,590
Virginia Woolf's prose.
So magically in Woolf's prose.

62
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,620
So that is something these
writer's share with modernism.

63
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,050
But there's one big difference and I
want to exemplify that for you just by

64
00:04:56,051 --> 00:05:00,010
reading to you two parallel texts,

65
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,050
one from the modernist Canon
and one from the beat Canon.

66
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,620
So first I want to read to you,
um,

67
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,150
the footnote to ts Elliot's the wasteland.
Now,

68
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:16,640
the wasteland was the first,
uh,

69
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,660
the first poem to have footnotes
and you have to ask yourself,

70
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:26,680
what do you have to think? The poem is in
order to think that it needs footnotes.

71
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,030
Um, so I'm going to, uh, say
a little bit more about that,

72
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:34,960
but let me just read to you first,
um, from the notes on the wasteland,

73
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,480
not only the title,
but the plan.

74
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:45,370
And a good deal of the
incidental symbolism of the
poem were suggested by Miss

75
00:05:45,371 --> 00:05:50,371
Jesse l Weston's book on the grail
legend from ritual to Romance Cambridge.

76
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,760
He has a little bibliography there.
Indeed.

77
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:57,350
So deeply am I indebted
Miss Weston's book.

78
00:05:57,351 --> 00:06:02,180
Will Lucy elucidate the difficulties of
the poem much better than my notes can

79
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:06,800
do and I recommend it apart from the
great interest of the book itself to any

80
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:11,801
who think such elucidation of the poem
worth the trouble to another work of

81
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:12,771
anthropology.

82
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:16,760
I am indebted in general one which has
influenced our generation profoundly.

83
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,990
I mean the golden bough I have used,
especially the two volumes,

84
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,240
Adonis Atis,
oh Cyrus,

85
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,990
anyone who was acquainted with these
works will immediately recognize in the

86
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:30,710
poem certain references
to vegetation ceremonies.

87
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,970
And then there are particular notes,
uh, for the different parts of the poem.

88
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:37,640
That's the introduction to the footnotes.

89
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,500
What I want you to note there is the
sense that the matter of the poem comes

90
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:52,160
from an archive and
archive of scholarly work,

91
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,700
a body of knowledge that you read about.

92
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:01,250
So now, and I also want you to note
that language, Miss Jessie Western.

93
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,230
It's a very mannered decorous language.
Now

94
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,830
I would like to read to you from

95
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,360
the footnote to how Allen Ginsburg's
famous poem that for many people embodied

96
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,280
at the time what it meant to be
engaged in this new literary project.

97
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,830
So this is footnote to how

98
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,560
holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy,

99
00:07:34,561 --> 00:07:39,270
holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy.

100
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,830
The world is holy.
That is holy.

101
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,770
The skin is holy.
The nose is holy.

102
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,120
The Tang and cock and hand and Asshole,
holy,

103
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,250
everything is wholly, everybody's
holy. Everywhere is wholly.

104
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,210
Every day is in eternity.
Every man's in angel,

105
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:05,220
the bums as holy as the Sarah Fim.
The Madman is holy.

106
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:09,690
As you my soul are wholly,
the typewriter is holy.

107
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:12,150
The poem is holy.
The voices holy,

108
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:17,280
the hearers are wholly the
ecstasy is holy. Holy Pete,

109
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,940
her Holy Allen,
Holy Solomon,

110
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:25,860
Holy Lucian, holy Kerouac,
holy Hunka, holy Burroughs,

111
00:08:25,861 --> 00:08:30,510
holy Cassidy, holy. The unknown,
buggered and suffering beggars.

112
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:33,600
Holy.
The hideous human angel colts.

113
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,450
Little different tone,
don't you?

114
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,940
Few things I want to note about that.
Besides the obvious,

115
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:52,010
the fallout of poetic inspiration
is not to be found in an archive.

116
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:59,210
It is not be found in Miss Jessie
Weston's book on ritual and Romance.

117
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,560
It is not to be found with a
bibliography saying Cambridge.

118
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,683
Okay.

119
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,050
That's not where you find
the fount of the great poem.

120
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,830
The footnote to Howell says
that the source of Howell,

121
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:21,870
that's what footnotes.
Are there an indication of the source?

122
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,540
It says that the source of the poetry
is that wholly lived experience

123
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,560
and a particular slice
of lived experience.

124
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:42,550
The formerly rejected the
in decorous the ecstatic.

125
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,730
I noticed that,
um,

126
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:53,710
several of you were smiling in a way
as I read that suggested you were

127
00:09:53,711 --> 00:09:58,690
embarrassed by the performance.
Right.

128
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,580
I did not elicit this by accident.

129
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,330
Embarrassment is something
that the beats value.

130
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:11,603
Yeah.

131
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,080
When Ginsburg first read Howl,

132
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,823
okay.

133
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,770
He, uh, he was on stage and there
was a little bathroom was that,

134
00:10:20,771 --> 00:10:24,540
this was an in, uh, um, I think it was
in a bookstore. I can't remember. I,

135
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,320
I didn't reread my notes on how,
um,

136
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,400
and so when the show started,
he was,

137
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:37,430
he was in the bathroom on the pot with
the door open and then he sorta hiked.

138
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,330
He got up and he hiked up his
pants and he walked out and he,

139
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:48,110
he gave his reading of how
this is indicative of the
sense that he wants to lay

140
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:53,520
bare in a literal way,

141
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,020
all the see Munis of human life,

142
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,150
all the aspects of what it
means to be an embodied person.

143
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,660
All the ecstasies that
come from that embodiment.

144
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,590
And of course this is not at
all original to Ginsburg. Uh,

145
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,000
if you read Walt Whitman,
you will see much, uh,

146
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:19,620
much of the same ethos and
probably a lot better poetry. Um,

147
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,750
so Ginsburg is not the first to do this
in the American tradition for sure,

148
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,260
but it's a very important
part of what the beats revive.

149
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,710
And I want to get at that question of
embarrassment because it comes up very

150
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:36,450
explicitly on page 36

151
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,630
embarrassment is the
monetized in on the road.

152
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,233
Okay.

153
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,430
And it's assigned what I think

154
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,860
is a very interesting provenance.

155
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,840
So this is Chad king
talking to sal paradise.

156
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,230
Uh,
quavering twain comes out when he speaks.

157
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:11,530
The thing I always liked sell about the
plains Indians was the way they always

158
00:12:11,871 --> 00:12:16,871
got sedan and embarrassed after they
boasted the number of scalps they got in

159
00:12:16,881 --> 00:12:18,770
Roxanne's life in the far west.

160
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:23,120
There's an Indian who gets all red over
blushing because he thought so many

161
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:27,260
scalps and he runs like hell into the
plains to glory over his deeds in hiding.

162
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,210
Damn,
that tickled me.

163
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:36,580
This sense of embarrassment is the sense
that the excess of what joy in this,

164
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,610
uh, in this, um, passage,

165
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,750
the Indians bravery, his
achievement, his success,

166
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,120
all of that is in excess of the decorous
presentation of that experience,

167
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,090
of that real world of life,
of that excessive joy.

168
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:08,830
And it's given here this sort of cliched
noble origin with the native American,

169
00:13:12,411 --> 00:13:13,430
the plains Indian.

170
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:20,020
So there's a sense in the plains Indian
that he is both the embodiment of a

171
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:24,890
noble restrained lineage,

172
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,610
but also deepen that American
past is this sense of,

173
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,110
of great access.

174
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,290
Embarrassment tells us we're
in the presence of the excess.

175
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:45,180
And that's why beat writers court
it, that's why I courted it. Um,

176
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,190
today for you,

177
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,120
the excess requires for the
beets a new kind of language,

178
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,640
one aspect of their language,
which maybe you've noticed it on the road.

179
00:14:00,641 --> 00:14:05,080
It's not quite so pronounced and
on the road as it is elsewhere,

180
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,390
certainly in the letters that, that
these figures right to each other. Um,

181
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,890
part of that is the
elimination of small words,

182
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,850
VI and um,
the abbreviation of certain words,

183
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:23,560
your to why are there all kinds of
little abbreviations they they make.

184
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:28,000
And it suggests that language has to
be wrenched out of its conventions.

185
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,160
Syntax can be set aside,

186
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:35,980
language needs to move at the speed of
experience and at the speed of ecstasy.

187
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:40,090
So that's one small way in the
language that they practiced,

188
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,540
tried to imitate the experience that
they were a immersing themselves in.

189
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,460
Um, but there were more formulated,

190
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,090
formulated,
um,

191
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,400
ways of capturing that experience
in language. Jack Kerouac,

192
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,240
uh,

193
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,240
had a list of essential that he taped
up on his wall when he was writing.

194
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:09,140
Um,
and this is what they include,

195
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:16,570
scribbled secret notebooks and wild
type written pages for your own joy.

196
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:22,670
And that's why our your own joy,
submissive to everything,

197
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,050
open listening,

198
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,080
tried never to get drunk outside your own
house. Well this is a piece of advice.

199
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:31,760
Clearly he never took.

200
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,540
Be In love with your life.

201
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,660
Be Crazy dumb.

202
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:42,980
Seem to have the mind blow
as deep as you want to blow,

203
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,970
right what you want.
Bottomless from bottom of the mind,

204
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,170
the unspeakable visions of the individual

205
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:57,050
entranced fixation,
dreaming upon object before you.

206
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,860
And then my st my,

207
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,980
my favorite one is you're
a genius all the time.

208
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:07,640
Now try putting that up in front of
your desk. You're a genius all the time.

209
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:11,130
It will help you to produce a
lot of writing. I guarantee. Um,

210
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,860
Kerouac tried over and over again to
write on the road and it was an effort to

211
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,600
practice this kind of free language
that would be uninhibited and that would

212
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:33,980
gesture towards some deeper,

213
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,330
bottomless part of the human experience.

214
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:42,320
The human soul. Sometimes
it was spiritualized. Um,

215
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,120
in this sense, this is why I put this
quote up on the board from on the road.

216
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,990
We've got to go some place,
find something.

217
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:56,170
There's a relentless seeking sense
that's at the heart of this work.

218
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,220
Now, for those of you who
don't know, I'm on the road,

219
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,400
does document pretty closely the actual
road trips that Jack Kerouac took,

220
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,380
uh, with Neal Cassady and
a whole host of others.

221
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,900
And I can do a little decoding for you.

222
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,820
Old Bully is William
Burroughs and his wife,

223
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:23,110
Jane Jane Lee.
Um,

224
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,560
Hunka, I can't remember who
Hunka is now in the book.

225
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,460
These are some minor characters who
lived with them and went to Columbia with

226
00:17:31,461 --> 00:17:35,810
them or were in their circle when these
writers lived in the neighborhoods in

227
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:37,880
New York,
around Columbia University.

228
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,350
So Alan Ginsburg is Carlo marks.
Um,

229
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,690
and Ginsburg went to Columbia.
He was kicked out of Columbia,

230
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:50,280
um, and then sort of went
back, was in and out of school.

231
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,460
So a lot of them were in this little
community and they picked up wanderers and

232
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,880
various people who, um,
wanted to learn from them.

233
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:03,330
And that's what Neal Cassady,
uh,

234
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:08,390
was to them at first I kind of wander or
who wanted to be in their intellectual,

235
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,910
uh,
but Bohemian circle.

236
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,210
Okay.

237
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:19,210
So you see the kind of
language that Neal represents,

238
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:26,210
um, at the very beginning
of the novel. First of all,

239
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,640
he's introduced in this
very mysterious way.

240
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,183
Yeah.

241
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:40,110
First reports of him, this is on,
on the first page of part one.

242
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,060
The middle of that first paragraph,

243
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:47,010
first reports of him came to me
through Chad King, who'd known,

244
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,690
who showed me a few letters from him
written in New Mexico reformed school.

245
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:57,050
So his letters come out
of this western land,

246
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,410
New Mexico and a land of criminality,
the reform school.

247
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:06,470
So he's exotic just from the very
beginning and it's an exotic language.

248
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,460
It's the letters that come out of this
exotic place that first catch their

249
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:12,294
attention.

250
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,130
Yeah.

251
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:18,190
I was tremendously interested in
the letters because they so naive.

252
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:22,510
Lee and sweetly ask Chad to teach him
all about Nicha and all the wonderful

253
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:24,340
intellectual things that Chad knew.

254
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,260
At one point Carlo and I talked about
the letters and wondered if we would ever

255
00:19:29,261 --> 00:19:31,210
meet the strange Dean Moriarty.

256
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,340
This is all far back when Dean was not
the way he is today when he was a young

257
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,470
jail kid.
Shrouded in mystery.

258
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:43,240
Then news came that dean was out of reform
school and was coming to New York for

259
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:44,074
the first time.

260
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,400
Also there was talk that he had
just married a girl called Mary Lou.

261
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,740
It's that passive sense.
There was talk who's talking?

262
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:57,790
We don't know.
That passive verb there was talk

263
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,280
gives you the sense that
there's this wide community

264
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:11,590
passing word mouth to mouth of the
coming of a mysterious spiritual figure.

265
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,970
First reports of him news came.

266
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,070
There was talk.

267
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:28,030
So language is this communal set of
rumors spiritualized by its very vagueness

268
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:31,580
and shared quality

269
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:39,040
and then it's just fascinating
to listen to what Dean says.

270
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,510
No, this is on page two.
This is how he talks.

271
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,560
All this time dean was telling Mary
Lou things like this. Now Darling,

272
00:20:51,561 --> 00:20:55,190
here we are in New York and although I
haven't quite told you everything that I

273
00:20:55,191 --> 00:20:59,300
was thinking about when we about when we
crossed the Missouri Cross Missouri and

274
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:03,080
especially at the point when we passed
the Boonville were reformatory which

275
00:21:03,081 --> 00:21:04,970
reminded me of my jail problem.

276
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:10,010
It is absolutely necessary now to post
pone all those leftover things concerning

277
00:21:10,011 --> 00:21:14,690
our personal love things and at once
begin thinking of specific work work life

278
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,020
plans and so on in the way
he had in those early days.

279
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:23,380
His language is a sort of mishmash
of poorly used academic locations,

280
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:32,770
work life plans. It sounds almost
like a corporate speak in a way.

281
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,820
It has that, that um, dry quality to it.

282
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,540
Yeah.

283
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,760
And then on the top of three
we get another example.

284
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,720
In other words, we've got to get on
the ball, darling. What I'm saying.

285
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:52,280
Otherwise it'll be fluctuating and lack
of true knowledge or crystallization of

286
00:21:52,281 --> 00:21:53,210
our plans.

287
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:58,420
So this is not yet that idealized speech
that cure wack is dreaming of when he

288
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:05,330
writes the list of essential
for spontaneous prose.

289
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,690
That's deans language is not that
in these passages is desire for the

290
00:22:11,151 --> 00:22:16,151
intellectual download from Chad is not
what's going to make him the figure of

291
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:23,180
the new language for so

292
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:25,710
okay.

293
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:30,710
Rather it is another kind of language
that he represents that will be that kind

294
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:36,930
of germ of what sal was looking for.

295
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,540
This is UC also want to,
at the beginning here

296
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,240
I went to the cold water flat with the
boys and dean came to the door in his

297
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,310
shorts.
Mary Lou was jumping off the couch.

298
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,880
Dean had dispatched the occupant of the
apartment to the kitchen probably to

299
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:57,600
make coffee while he proceeded
with his love problems for to him,

300
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,930
sex was the one and only holy
and important thing in life.

301
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,990
Although he had to sweat and
curse to make a living and so on.

302
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,160
You saw that in the way he stood
bobbing his head, always looking down,

303
00:23:08,161 --> 00:23:12,750
nodding like a young boxer to insert two
instructions to make you think he was

304
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:17,700
listening to every word throwing in
a thousand yeses and that's right.

305
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,590
There's this sense of enthusiasm.

306
00:23:21,591 --> 00:23:26,591
So his response is not an
articulation of some thought,

307
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,500
but in a fusion. Yes, that's right.

308
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:35,680
It's a visceral response and you
see it even more clearly on four.

309
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,300
Okay.

310
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,160
So he's staying,
Dean is staying with sound

311
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,360
and sal has writing and they're
ready to go out and sell.

312
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:52,160
Says, hold on a minute,
I'll be right with you.

313
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:56,270
As soon as I finish this chapter and it
was one of the best chapters in the book.

314
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,810
Then I dressed and off we flew
to New York to meet some girls.

315
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,390
So I'm going to skip along a little
bit. Um, I was, uh, let's see.

316
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,630
As we, uh, actually I'm going
to read that part. As we rose,

317
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:13,280
as we wrote in the bus in the weird
phosphorescent void of the Lincoln tunnel,

318
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,540
we leaned on each other with fingers
waving and yelled and talk to excitedly.

319
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,740
And I was beginning to get the bug.
Like Dean, he was simply a youth,

320
00:24:21,741 --> 00:24:25,430
tremendously excited with life.
And though he was a con man,

321
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:28,910
he was only calling because he wanted
so much to live and get involved with

322
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:31,670
people who would otherwise
pay no attention to him.

323
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:36,170
He was calling me and I knew it for room
and board and how to write, et Cetera,

324
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,220
and he knew. I knew this had been
the basis of our relationship,

325
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,060
but I didn't care and we got along
fine. No pestering, no catering.

326
00:24:44,061 --> 00:24:46,790
We tiptoed around each other
like heartbreaking new friends.

327
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:51,770
I began to learn from him as much as he
probably learned from me as far as my

328
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:55,070
work was concerned. He said, go
ahead. Everything you do is great.

329
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:00,560
He watched over my shoulder
as I wrote stories yelling.
Yes, that's right. Wow Man.

330
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:05,210
And Phew.
Wow is dean's word.

331
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:12,440
Wow is the kind of word
that means nothing,

332
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:18,840
but it suggests the immediacy
of Dean's engagement.

333
00:25:18,841 --> 00:25:23,100
So all that talking on the bus and the
way they're moving their hands, the bug,

334
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:29,070
that's all where this
language is rising from.

335
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,980
That's where the new language
it was going to come from.

336
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:37,700
And you can see how so
assimilates that on page 35

337
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,010
this is just as he is coming into Denver.

338
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,180
I said to myself,
wow,

339
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:56,950
what will Dan for me like I got on that
hot road and off I went in a brand new

340
00:25:56,951 --> 00:26:01,360
car driven by Denver businessmen
of about 35 he went 70.

341
00:26:01,361 --> 00:26:06,040
I tingled all over accounted minutes and
subtracted miles just to head over the

342
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:10,780
rolling wheat fields, fields, all golden
beneath the distance snows of SDS.

343
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,030
I'd be seeing old Denver at last.

344
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:17,560
I pictured myself in a Denver bar that
night with all the gang and in their eyes

345
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:22,120
I would be strange and ragged and like
the prophet who has walked across the

346
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:27,121
land to bring the dark word and
the only word I had was wow.

347
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:29,840
Yeah.

348
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,620
So Neil's so I mean, uh, sorry. Yeah.

349
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,570
Um, dean sense, I will do
this and please forgive me.

350
00:26:38,571 --> 00:26:43,130
I will sometimes slip into calling
him dean because he didn't, uh, sorry.

351
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,950
Do you ever mind, you
know what I'm saying? Um,

352
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,460
I will sometimes slip into calling
him kneel when his name is dean. Um,

353
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,633
Dean

354
00:26:55,410 --> 00:27:00,410
has already projected this
motive language into south.

355
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,700
So even as he's saying to south,
teach me how to write,

356
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,940
what he's doing is
teaching sao how to write,

357
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,920
how to write this kind of book,
how to be the prophet of wow.

358
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,203
Okay.

359
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:21,700
This is all over the text. If
you look at on 62, page 62,

360
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,400
some of these little stories, Remy
woke up and saw me come in the window,

361
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,110
his great laugh,

362
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:37,120
one of the greatest laughs in
the world [inaudible] in my ear.

363
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:41,590
And then if you just
skip up to the top of 63,

364
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,240
the strange thing was that next door
to Remy lived in Negro called Mr. Snow.

365
00:27:46,241 --> 00:27:49,690
Who's laugh I swear on
the Bible was positively.

366
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,080
And finally the one greatest
laugh in all this world.

367
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,940
The laugh is a lot like the wow.

368
00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:00,570
It's that sound you make just because
you're experiencing something just because

369
00:28:01,031 --> 00:28:05,770
you're having a response to what's in
front of you. Something someone says.

370
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:11,410
Okay, that's another example. Um, and
the last one I'll give you is on 55.

371
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:19,420
This is when they've gone up
to the mountain pass after
getting in fights in the

372
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:25,241
bars in Denver in the whole eastern dark
wall of the divide this night there was

373
00:28:26,481 --> 00:28:31,100
silence and the whisper of the wind,
except in the ravine where we roared.

374
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:34,280
And on the other side of the divide
was the great western slope and the big

375
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:36,370
plateau that went to steamboat springs,

376
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:41,150
springs and dropped and led you to the
western Colorado Desert and the Utah

377
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:46,040
desert all in darkness. Now as we fumed
and screamed in our mountain nook,

378
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,860
mad drunk and Americans
in the mighty land,

379
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:52,340
we were on the roof of America
and all we could do was yell,

380
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:57,400
I guess across the night eastward over
the plains where somewhere in old man

381
00:28:58,431 --> 00:29:03,431
with white hair was probably walking
towards us with the word and would arrive

382
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:07,700
any minute and make us silent
there,

383
00:29:07,701 --> 00:29:10,010
yell at the top of the world,

384
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,200
seems to sow something that
calls for a replacement.

385
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:22,870
It calls for some other profit to come
walking ragged towards them and make them

386
00:29:24,381 --> 00:29:29,000
fall silent with his word.
But in the meantime,

387
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:33,410
what you have is the continual
reproduction of that yell,

388
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,860
that laugh that wow, that, yes, that,

389
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,630
that's all right.

390
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:44,920
All those things they say just to register
their existence and their relation

391
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:46,894
with one another.

392
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,160
I want to note something else though about
the first time that Dean and sal meat

393
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,250
and the contextualizing of that meeting,

394
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,610
when they first meet in that
passage that I read to you,

395
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:08,790
he's just rising up from having sex on
the couch with Mary Lou in someone else's

396
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:09,670
apartment.

397
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:13,180
He sent the owner of the apartment into
the kitchen so he could have sex with

398
00:30:13,181 --> 00:30:17,740
Mary Lou on the couch. In other
versions, he says that, um,

399
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:21,340
that dean got up and was naked,
not that he was in his shorts.

400
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:27,970
There's an immediate sexual sense that
charges the relationship between these

401
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:31,780
people.
It also,

402
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:36,810
those relationships take place in the
context of continual negotiations of

403
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:39,640
sexual relationships.

404
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:44,850
And so the book begins with that
explanation that I first met Dean not long

405
00:30:46,631 --> 00:30:48,580
after my wife and I split up.

406
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:52,000
I had just gotten over a serious illness
that I won't bother to talk about

407
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:56,020
except that it had something to do with
the miserably weary splitting up in my

408
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,760
feeling that everything was dead.

409
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:04,320
Deans negotiations between Mary Lou
and Camille in Denver where he has his

410
00:31:05,801 --> 00:31:10,570
schedule and he has this exact time he
has to get from one hotel to the other to

411
00:31:10,571 --> 00:31:14,650
sleep with each of them. And then he
has to meet Carlo Ginsburg in the,

412
00:31:14,651 --> 00:31:19,270
I mean this bird Carlo marks in
the basement in the basement,

413
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,460
uh,
to have his,

414
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:25,550
his conversations to get to the
bottom lessness of each other's mind.

415
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,490
All those negotiations
are absolutely crucial.

416
00:31:30,491 --> 00:31:32,920
It's what they spend
their time talking about.

417
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:36,940
Often it's what they spend
their time negotiating.

418
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:43,140
So the search for the immediate language
of experience is part and parcel of a

419
00:31:44,951 --> 00:31:49,951
very complex negotiation of sexual
ties between multiple people.

420
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:53,080
And it's not just between
the men and the women,

421
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:58,270
it's between the men and the
men. And that moment when, um,

422
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,410
when south meets dean at
the door and he's naked,

423
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,060
it's reflected when he
sees dean with Camille.

424
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:11,950
Camille opens the door to their room when
they're in Denver and he finally sees

425
00:32:11,951 --> 00:32:12,820
dean in Denver.

426
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:18,100
He opens the door to the room and there's
a picture that Camille has drawn of

427
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:22,780
Dean, a portrait of him completely
naked. And it notes, you know, his,

428
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,570
his penis.
In that picture

429
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,361
it says,

430
00:32:28,361 --> 00:32:33,361
if Sal's first experience of
Dean is already in that scene,

431
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,480
assimilated into the image of Dean,

432
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:42,770
the disembodied aesthetic image of dean.

433
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:48,400
But that aesthetic image of Dean is
all bound up in these negotiations.

434
00:32:48,771 --> 00:32:50,960
So it's a picture that Camille has drawn.

435
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:55,160
And of course Camille doesn't know that
he's sleeping with Mary Lou in another

436
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:57,110
hotel on the same day and so on.

437
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:02,680
So all of that is very palpable and Sal's
own desire for Dean is sublimated in

438
00:33:05,511 --> 00:33:07,460
those scenes,

439
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,970
but it's everywhere at
the level of the language.

440
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,510
And if you note the repeated
presence of that question,

441
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:19,790
where was dean, where was
dean? He's always missing.

442
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,960
When sal gets to Denver,
that's what he wants to know.

443
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,820
When he gets back to New York. Finally
at the end of this first road trip,

444
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,210
he has missed dean. There's always
the sense that dean evades him,

445
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:41,950
and I think part of that sense of any
vacating object of desire is again,

446
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,730
the pursuit of sex in this novel.

447
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,920
It's part of the pursuit of sex.

448
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,213
Yeah.

449
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:02,150
You might think given all this and
given the ultimate plot of on the road,

450
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:08,910
that being on the road is about
pursuing that kind of desire,

451
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:13,170
and that is necessitated by leaving home.

452
00:34:13,171 --> 00:34:16,710
You have to leave home in
order to pursue that desire.

453
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:23,030
But I would suggest to you that home is
absolutely crucial to the production of

454
00:34:23,491 --> 00:34:27,030
this desire.
And I want to point you to page 26

455
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,980
this is south story about

456
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,100
big slim hazard.

457
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:43,780
A Hobo that he wants knew as a little boy.
Oh,

458
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,140
so he was a hobo by
choice as a little boy.

459
00:34:46,141 --> 00:34:49,470
He'd seen a Hobo come up to ask
his mother for a piece of Pie,

460
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,980
and she had given it to him.
And when the Hobo went off down the road,

461
00:34:52,981 --> 00:34:56,040
the little boy had said,
my work was that fellow.

462
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:01,110
Why that's a Hobo Ma.
I want to be a Hobo someday.

463
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,320
Shut your mouth.
That's not for the like of the hazards,

464
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:06,450
but he never forgot that day.

465
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:10,380
And when he grew up after a short
spell playing football at Lsu,

466
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,580
he did become a hobo.

467
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:18,300
Being a Hobo is produced in this little
vignette by the experience of seeing a

468
00:35:20,831 --> 00:35:23,020
Hobo get pie from your mother.
Now,

469
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:26,560
did any of you notice
how often sal eats pie?

470
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,190
Let me just demonstrate

471
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,800
the litany of Pi. Okay. Page 15

472
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,493
yes.

473
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,480
Actually, let's start
on 14 or perhaps on 13

474
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,903
hmm.

475
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:50,190
13 along about three in the morning
after an apple pie and ice cream in a

476
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,150
roadside stand.

477
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:55,470
That's so top of 14 I ate
another apple pie and ice cream.

478
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,350
That's practically all I ate
all the way across the country.

479
00:35:58,351 --> 00:36:02,040
I knew it was nutritious
and it was delicious. 15

480
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:07,800
bottom. I ate apple pie and ice
cream. It was getting better.

481
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:11,640
As I got deeper into Iowa, the
pie bigger, the ice cream richer.

482
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,820
There were the most beautiful
bevies of girls everywhere.

483
00:36:14,821 --> 00:36:18,390
I looked in Des Moines that afternoon.
They were coming home from high school,

484
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:22,410
but I had no time now for thoughts
like that and promised myself a ball in

485
00:36:22,411 --> 00:36:24,930
Denver.
And if you look on one oh seven,

486
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,690
the first thing sell does when he
gets home is eat. When I got home,

487
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:34,870
I ate everything in the icebox.
My mother got up and looked at me.

488
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:39,700
Poor little Salvatore. She said, in
Italian, you are Theon, you're thin.

489
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:44,140
Where have you been? All this time I
had on two shirts and two sweaters.

490
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,560
My canvas bag had torn cotton field pants
and the tattered remnants of my Herati

491
00:36:49,571 --> 00:36:50,404
shoes in it.

492
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,240
My aunt and I decided to buy a new
electric refrigerator with the money I had

493
00:36:55,241 --> 00:36:59,230
sent her from California.
It was to be the first one in the family.

494
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,620
There is a sense in which hunger,

495
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,900
the hunger generated by
the road in south case.

496
00:37:07,901 --> 00:37:10,030
In this last scene he's been panelists.

497
00:37:10,031 --> 00:37:14,420
All he had was cough drops
to eat at the very end. Um,

498
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:20,130
that the hunger generated by the road
exists in a necessary relation to the

499
00:37:22,061 --> 00:37:23,710
consumption of home.

500
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,810
And I would suggest to you that the
consumption of home is driven by a certain

501
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:30,550
kind of desire as well.

502
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:36,750
That desire to move up in
the American class structure,

503
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:42,100
the first electric
refrigerator in my family,

504
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,910
he's earned a little money
on the road and sent it home.

505
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:51,610
What it does for him is
allow him to buy his aunt,

506
00:37:51,611 --> 00:37:56,611
this symbol of a middle class American
domesticity and he is a happy participant

507
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:00,760
in this new purchase.

508
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:05,890
This is not exactly just what the women
do while the boys are out on the road.

509
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,930
The boys want the pie.

510
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:14,250
The boys want to become hobos because
there's a kind of hunger that's generated

511
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:18,310
at home.
It's satisfied at home,

512
00:38:18,311 --> 00:38:20,350
but it's also generated at home.

513
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,000
And I want to suggest to you that
part of the misogyny of the novel,

514
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:30,690
which I'm sure is palpable to all of
us as we read part of that misogyny is

515
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:35,440
connected to this consumptive ethos.

516
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,840
So when we talk about
desire for something,

517
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:45,160
we've got to go some place,
find some thing.

518
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,520
The very vagueness of that desire is
connected with the basic hungers of the

519
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:55,690
body for sex,
for food,

520
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:01,660
for sleep. Even we see dean
sort of begging for sleep,

521
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,880
uh, after his conversation with Carlo
marks in the basement in Denver.

522
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:13,260
Those kinds of desires are connected
also with that American habit of

523
00:39:15,251 --> 00:39:18,970
consumption.
This is a consumer society.

524
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:23,290
In the 1950s it was already very much so.

525
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:29,430
The mass production after World
War Two had already taken hold.

526
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:35,310
Supermarkets as we saw in wise blood are
already something one can be fond of as

527
00:39:36,911 --> 00:39:37,930
Enoch was.

528
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:44,430
And so if this is a novel whose
aura has always said to us,

529
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:49,500
be free,
be counter cultural.

530
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:57,090
What I'm suggesting is that it's
structured around a very deeply embedded

531
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,120
American cultural trait of consumption.

532
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,860
It spiritualizes that kind of desire

533
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,240
and my symbol for it is pie.

534
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,293
Yeah.

535
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,740
One I'll show you one last thing about
how the language works and this is on

536
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:27,780
page 49

537
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,673
okay.

538
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:42,880
To set aside the critique
of that search for a moment.

539
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:48,570
I just want to move back into it in
these spiritual terms and see what we can

540
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:49,504
see.

541
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:55,930
When Dean and Carlo are
talking to each other,

542
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:01,200
there's a lot of anxiety on either
part about whether they have actually

543
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:04,240
attained that thing that
they were looking for.

544
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:11,520
On 48 they're talk is decide is
described as business in the beginning.

545
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,250
Then they got down to business.
They sat on the bed,

546
00:41:15,251 --> 00:41:17,710
cross legged and looked at each other.

547
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,800
I slouched in a nearby
chair and saw all of it.

548
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,530
They began with an abstract thought,
disgust.

549
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:25,900
It reminded each other of
another abstract point.

550
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,580
Forgotten in the rush of events,

551
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:31,450
Dean apologized but promised he could
get back to it and manage it. Fine,

552
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:36,230
bringing up illustrations and then they
have this very complicated back and

553
00:41:36,231 --> 00:41:40,850
forth about things that they remembered
or didn't and they hash these things

554
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:41,684
over.

555
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:43,590
Okay.

556
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,000
Then Carlo as dean,

557
00:41:45,001 --> 00:41:50,001
if he was honest and specifically if he
was being honest with him in the bottom

558
00:41:50,071 --> 00:41:52,800
of his soul,
why do you bring that up again?

559
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,730
There's one last thing I want to
know, but dear sal, you're listening.

560
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,620
You're sitting there, we'll ask
cell. What would he say? And I said,

561
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,370
that last thing is what you can't get,
Carlo,

562
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,460
nobody can get to that last thing.

563
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:13,170
We keep on living in hopes
of catching it once for all.

564
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,130
Yeah.

565
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:19,960
So all this language is produced because
you can't ever get to that last thing.

566
00:42:19,961 --> 00:42:24,880
You have to keep hashing it over. But
if you, if you, um, go to the next page,

567
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:27,790
yeah,

568
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,160
you can see actually two pages over.

569
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,600
You can see that already sao is taking
what he can get from this language and

570
00:42:39,971 --> 00:42:42,670
transposing it into his
experience of reality.

571
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,860
So Carlo had earlier, just,
sorry to flip back and forth.

572
00:42:47,861 --> 00:42:52,630
So much had had,
had read earlier his poem,

573
00:42:52,631 --> 00:42:56,860
this is on 47, um, to sell. He's,

574
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,330
he'd been reading poetry.

575
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:05,450
Carla woke up in the morning and heard
the vulgar pigeons yakking in the street

576
00:43:05,451 --> 00:43:06,500
outside his cell.

577
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:10,130
He saw the sad Nightingale's nodding on
the branches and they reminded him of

578
00:43:10,131 --> 00:43:13,310
his mother. A gray shroud fell
over the city, the mountains,

579
00:43:13,311 --> 00:43:17,480
the magnificent Rockies that you can see
to the west from any part of town where

580
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:22,220
paper machine say the whole universe
was crazy and cockeyed and extremely

581
00:43:22,221 --> 00:43:26,420
strange. So this is what Carlo
represents in his poetry. Well,

582
00:43:26,421 --> 00:43:29,840
if you look Sao after
witnessing what it means,

583
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:31,910
what their business is with one another,

584
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,210
the way they try to get to the
bottom of each other's soul.

585
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,100
Yeah,

586
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:42,100
he looks out and he sees the
world through Carlos eyes.

587
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,300
He's been awake though all this time.
Listening. What were you thinking, Sal?

588
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:54,340
I told them that I was thinking they
were very amazing maniacs and that I had

589
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:58,060
spent the whole night listening to them
like a man watching the mechanism of a

590
00:43:58,061 --> 00:44:03,061
watch that reached clear to the top of
Berta to burritoed pass and was yet made

591
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:09,010
with the smallest works of the most
delicate watch in the world. They smiled.

592
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:13,210
I pointed my finger at them and said, if
you keep this up, you'll both go crazy,

593
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,370
but let me know what
happens as you go along.

594
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:20,560
I walked out and took a trolley to my
apartment and Carlo Marx's paper machine

595
00:44:20,561 --> 00:44:25,561
mountains grew red as the great
sun rose from the eastward plains.

596
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:31,380
So the poetry that is part and
parcel of the between Dean and Carlo,

597
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:39,290
Carlos Poetry seeps out of that
basement room and there's a,

598
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:44,291
a real spatial sense here that it's being
generated at the base of the world and

599
00:44:46,531 --> 00:44:50,880
it goes up in, it transforms
these mountains into paper mushy.

600
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:54,750
It makes them in one sense,
false.

601
00:44:54,751 --> 00:44:59,751
There's a falseness to the overlay that
Carlo gives to sal and through which he

602
00:45:01,681 --> 00:45:06,240
then sees there's a falseness,
a craftiness,

603
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,660
but it's a kind of folk craftiness.

604
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:13,990
This is not the craftiness of modernism.
This is paper machete,

605
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,180
a fairly crude folk art.
Anyone can do it,

606
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:20,370
get your strips of
newspaper and paste them up.

607
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:26,570
So it has a quality that is different
from Humberto elaborate worldview through

608
00:45:30,091 --> 00:45:32,640
which we see or don't see Lolita.

609
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,430
It's a very different kind of crafting,

610
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:40,820
but yet it does replace reality in a
similar way or it makes demands on reality

611
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,570
that pushed the real back.

612
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:54,380
And so even though they can never
get to the bottom of their souls,

613
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:59,360
they can never get a cell says
that last thing you could.

614
00:45:59,361 --> 00:46:01,020
That's what you could never have.

615
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:07,050
Even though that's true,
it has this world making power.

616
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:13,070
To what end will that power be used?

617
00:46:13,071 --> 00:46:16,400
This is one question I want you to
think about as you finish this novel.

618
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:21,950
What do these figures think
language can be used for?

619
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,230
What's it good for?
What can it do for them?

620
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:33,770
What beyond that kind
of economics of desire,

621
00:46:33,771 --> 00:46:38,240
that accounting,
if you look on 1-081-OH-SEVEN-108 again,

622
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,340
the very end of the section,

623
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:54,210
I had my home to go to my place to lay
my head down and figure the losses and

624
00:46:54,251 --> 00:46:58,060
figure the gain that I knew
was in there somewhere too.

625
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:00,880
What are the losses?
What are the gains?

626
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:06,660
Is it just a representation of an
imaginative and desire full economy,

627
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:11,410
or is there some other
thing being produced here?

628
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:15,280
What is the sump thing?
What is the someplace?

629
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,730
So in that relation,

630
00:47:18,731 --> 00:47:22,270
I'd like you to think about the
representation of America in the novel.

631
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:26,050
What do you see there when
you think about the America?

632
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,570
They're giving us all these figures,

633
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:33,790
so that's free or reading in
section. Um, please bring Lolita.

634
00:47:33,791 --> 00:47:37,930
I think you're going to spend most of
your time talking about Lolita section for

635
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:38,800
on the road.

636
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,880
We'll probably be next week unless
you're TF wants to bring up some brief

637
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:46,450
questions about it. Um,
but that's all for today.
