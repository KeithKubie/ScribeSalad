Ireland and the question is quite a

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920
Ireland and the question is quite a
 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.280
Ireland and the question is quite a
broad one for them did you explain what

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290
broad one for them did you explain what
 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.930
broad one for them did you explain what
is background radiation and what

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940
is background radiation and what
 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.549
is background radiation and what
relevance is what happened exactly the

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559
relevance is what happened exactly the
 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.349
relevance is what happened exactly the
Big Bang okay it so you're asking what

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359
Big Bang okay it so you're asking what
 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.630
Big Bang okay it so you're asking what
is background radiation what astronomers

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640
is background radiation what astronomers
 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.730
is background radiation what astronomers
mean is radiation that comes to us

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740
mean is radiation that comes to us
 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.470
mean is radiation that comes to us
almost the same brightness from every

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480
almost the same brightness from every
 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.839
almost the same brightness from every
direction in the sky imagining that

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849
direction in the sky imagining that
 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.460
direction in the sky imagining that
we're outside the Earth's atmosphere and

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470
we're outside the Earth's atmosphere and
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.870
we're outside the Earth's atmosphere and
outside the solar system to make a

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
outside the solar system to make a
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.209
outside the solar system to make a
measurement so this would be radiation

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219
measurement so this would be radiation
 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.610
measurement so this would be radiation
that comes from the entire cosmos and so

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620
that comes from the entire cosmos and so
 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.020
that comes from the entire cosmos and so
that's why we call it background we

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030
that's why we call it background we
 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.350
that's why we call it background we
can't recognize any individual source

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360
can't recognize any individual source
 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.639
can't recognize any individual source
otherwise we would say well that

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649
otherwise we would say well that
 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.130
otherwise we would say well that
radiation came from a galaxy or a planet

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140
radiation came from a galaxy or a planet
 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.470
radiation came from a galaxy or a planet
or a star so background radiation is

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480
or a star so background radiation is
 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.020
or a star so background radiation is
radiation that has no obvious individual

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030
radiation that has no obvious individual
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.150
radiation that has no obvious individual
source must come from the cosmos as a

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160
source must come from the cosmos as a
 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.340
source must come from the cosmos as a
whole so there are several kinds of

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
whole so there are several kinds of
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.350
whole so there are several kinds of
background radiation that we study and

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360
background radiation that we study and
 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.490
background radiation that we study and
one is called the cosmic microwave

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500
one is called the cosmic microwave
 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.459
one is called the cosmic microwave
radiation and it's the primordial heat

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
radiation and it's the primordial heat
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.080
radiation and it's the primordial heat
from the Big Bang material it's really

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090
from the Big Bang material it's really
 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.270
from the Big Bang material it's really
quite bright it's about a micro watt per

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280
quite bright it's about a micro watt per
 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.609
quite bright it's about a micro watt per
square meter and so it's hard for us to

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619
square meter and so it's hard for us to
 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.140
square meter and so it's hard for us to
measure but it's really quite bright

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150
measure but it's really quite bright
 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.179
measure but it's really quite bright
there are other kinds that are gamma

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189
there are other kinds that are gamma
 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.390
there are other kinds that are gamma
rays or x-rays or other wave wavelengths

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
rays or x-rays or other wave wavelengths
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.010
rays or x-rays or other wave wavelengths
of infrared where we haven't yet

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020
of infrared where we haven't yet
 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.480
of infrared where we haven't yet
identified where all this radiation

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490
identified where all this radiation
 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.580
identified where all this radiation
comes from but we sort of imagine that

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590
comes from but we sort of imagine that
 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.219
comes from but we sort of imagine that
it comes from individual stars or

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229
it comes from individual stars or
 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.719
it comes from individual stars or
galaxies that we just haven't been able

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
galaxies that we just haven't been able
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.120
galaxies that we just haven't been able
to identify nevertheless it's an

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130
to identify nevertheless it's an
 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.170
to identify nevertheless it's an
interesting question

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180
interesting question
 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.640
interesting question
because down do you know if you found

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650
because down do you know if you found
 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.560
because down do you know if you found
everything in the universe you have to

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
everything in the universe you have to
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.999
everything in the universe you have to
be able to account for all of this

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
be able to account for all of this
 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.340
be able to account for all of this
radiation that may or may not come from

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350
radiation that may or may not come from
 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.960
radiation that may or may not come from
something you know about so you're not

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970
something you know about so you're not
 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.730
something you know about so you're not
done with astronomy until you can

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740
done with astronomy until you can
 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.499
done with astronomy until you can
explain where all the background

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509
explain where all the background
 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.450
explain where all the background
radiation comes from that makes it

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
radiation comes from that makes it
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.920
radiation comes from that makes it
interesting even though it's sort of

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
interesting even though it's sort of
 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.469
interesting even though it's sort of
hard to measure it so the cosmic

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479
hard to measure it so the cosmic
 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.969
hard to measure it so the cosmic
microwave background radiation is

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979
microwave background radiation is
 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.230
microwave background radiation is
different from all the others that we

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240
different from all the others that we
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.609
different from all the others that we
know about because we think that it

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619
know about because we think that it
 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.889
know about because we think that it
comes from the Big Bang material itself

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
comes from the Big Bang material itself
 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.780
comes from the Big Bang material itself
and it comes to us from all directions

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790
and it comes to us from all directions
 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.600
and it comes to us from all directions
because the universe is so immensely

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610
because the universe is so immensely
 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.690
because the universe is so immensely
large that every direction that we look

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700
large that every direction that we look
 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.310
large that every direction that we look
we're looking at a piece of the Big Bang

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
we're looking at a piece of the Big Bang
 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.440
we're looking at a piece of the Big Bang
material when we look far enough back in

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450
material when we look far enough back in
 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.020
material when we look far enough back in
time so to us it looks like it's

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030
time so to us it looks like it's
 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.999
time so to us it looks like it's
completely uniform are almost completely

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
completely uniform are almost completely
 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.700
completely uniform are almost completely
uniform so we can't detect a center or

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
uniform so we can't detect a center or
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.229
uniform so we can't detect a center or
an edge of the universe by looking at

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
an edge of the universe by looking at
 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.680
an edge of the universe by looking at
this material it's very startling to

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690
this material it's very startling to
 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.790
this material it's very startling to
people that we cannot find

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
people that we cannot find
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.470
people that we cannot find
Center or edge but there seems to be no

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480
Center or edge but there seems to be no
 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.750
Center or edge but there seems to be no
center or edge there is on the other

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760
center or edge there is on the other
 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.700
center or edge there is on the other
hand the farthest you can look you

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710
hand the farthest you can look you
 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.460
hand the farthest you can look you
cannot see back in time any farther than

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470
cannot see back in time any farther than
 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.860
cannot see back in time any farther than
the age of the universe so you can't see

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870
the age of the universe so you can't see
 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.780
the age of the universe so you can't see
any farther than light will travel in

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790
any farther than light will travel in
 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.520
any farther than light will travel in
the age of the universe so there's an

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530
the age of the universe so there's an
 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.010
the age of the universe so there's an
observable edge but not a real edge as

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020
observable edge but not a real edge as
 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.590
observable edge but not a real edge as
far as we know
