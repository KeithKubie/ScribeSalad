00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.340
So we started out this course using functions. In

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.590
lesson one, we built a couple of different projects. Then,

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.810
we came across a scenario where using functions didn't

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.360
quite work really well. This was when we were trying

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.744
to build a movie website. This led us to

00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:18.752
lesson two, where we were introduced two classes and we

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:22.708
built a bunch of different projects using classes. Here in

00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:25.480
lesson three we will write our very first class, and

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.345
we will return to our movie website example. Let's begin. Now the

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:32.897
output of the program we are about to build will look a

00:00:32.897 --> 00:00:38.035
little bit like this. A movie website with all of your favorite

00:00:38.035 --> 00:00:42.070
movies,.and if you click on one of them its trailer will play.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:49.583
[MUSIC]

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:51.020
Let's build this.
