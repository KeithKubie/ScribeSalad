neat thing and it's something where if
 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.539

there'd been a human creating them we

there'd been a human creating them we
 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:16.560
there'd been a human creating them we
would have been very impressed by that

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570
would have been very impressed by that
 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.930

sort of formal abstract universe of

sort of formal abstract universe of
 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.970
sort of formal abstract universe of
possible programs so i think it's sort

possible programs so i think it's sort
 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.730

of an interesting question when we look

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740
of an interesting question when we look
 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.350
of an interesting question when we look
at different areas of sort of human

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:38.099
endeavor to what extent what we have
found what we create is something that

found what we create is something that
 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:42.930
found what we create is something that
is is a feature of kind of us as humans

area I've thought about quite a bit as

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399
area I've thought about quite a bit as
 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:51.479
area I've thought about quite a bit as
mathematics and the question is is the

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489
mathematics and the question is is the
 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.520
mathematics and the question is is the
mathematics that we have today sort of a

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530
mathematics that we have today sort of a
 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.219
mathematics that we have today sort of a
a necessary kind of formal structure or

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:56.229
a necessary kind of formal structure or
 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:57.840
a necessary kind of formal structure or
is it something that really is more a

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850
is it something that really is more a
 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.389
is it something that really is more a

reflection of the particular history of
 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.579
reflection of the particular history of
human mathematics and so one thing that

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589
human mathematics and so one thing that
 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:04.530
human mathematics and so one thing that
we can think about is this if we look at

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540
we can think about is this if we look at
 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.330
we can think about is this if we look at
sort of all the mathematics that's been

theorems have been derived in the
history of mathematics and the question

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140
history of mathematics and the question
 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.319
history of mathematics and the question
though is why those axioms why not other

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329
though is why those axioms why not other
 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.050
though is why those axioms why not other
axioms well we can sort of think about

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060
axioms well we can sort of think about
 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.060
axioms well we can sort of think about
the universe of all possible axioms we

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070
the universe of all possible axioms we
 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.080
the universe of all possible axioms we
can just imagine kind of enumerated

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090
can just imagine kind of enumerated
 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.969
can just imagine kind of enumerated
possible axiom systems that one can

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979
possible axiom systems that one can
 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.490
possible axiom systems that one can
formally consider and we do that and we

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500
formally consider and we do that and we
 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.020
formally consider and we do that and we
can say out of this universe of all

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030
can say out of this universe of all
 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.209
can say out of this universe of all
possible axiom systems whether the

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219
possible axiom systems whether the
 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:02.190
possible axiom systems whether the
axioms that correspond to our particular

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200
axioms that correspond to our particular
 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.649
axioms that correspond to our particular
mathematics lie and so I know the answer

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659
mathematics lie and so I know the answer
 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.209
mathematics lie and so I know the answer
to that for things like logic for

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219
to that for things like logic for
 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.340
to that for things like logic for
example I know that logic if you were to

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350
example I know that logic if you were to
 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.200
example I know that logic if you were to
enumerate all possible axiom systems

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210
enumerate all possible axiom systems
 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.720
enumerate all possible axiom systems
logic is about the 50,000th axiom system

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730
logic is about the 50,000th axiom system
 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.550
logic is about the 50,000th axiom system
that you'd find in that enumeration

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560
that you'd find in that enumeration
 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.240
that you'd find in that enumeration
so realizing that it makes one makes one

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250
so realizing that it makes one makes one
 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.070
so realizing that it makes one makes one
think about so why this mathematics and

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080
think about so why this mathematics and
 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.390
think about so why this mathematics and
not some other and what one realizes

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400
not some other and what one realizes
 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.800
not some other and what one realizes
it's really the mathematics we have

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810
it's really the mathematics we have
 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.720
it's really the mathematics we have
today is something that is a direct

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730
today is something that is a direct
 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.680
today is something that is a direct
historical consequence of ideas that

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690
historical consequence of ideas that
 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.259
historical consequence of ideas that
existed in ancient Babylon arithmetic

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269
existed in ancient Babylon arithmetic
 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.120
existed in ancient Babylon arithmetic
and geometry and so on that got sort of

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130
and geometry and so on that got sort of
 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.860
and geometry and so on that got sort of
generalized to give us the mathematics

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870
generalized to give us the mathematics
 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.080
generalized to give us the mathematics
we have today and that's the mathematics

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090
we have today and that's the mathematics
 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.240
we have today and that's the mathematics
that we use to kind of make our

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250
that we use to kind of make our
 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.860
that we use to kind of make our

descriptions in physics and do our
 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.350
descriptions in physics and do our
engineering and so on what one realizes

engineering and so on what one realizes
 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.759
engineering and so on what one realizes
is that there's this whole sort of

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769
is that there's this whole sort of
 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.650
is that there's this whole sort of
universe of other possible mathematics

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660
universe of other possible mathematics
 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.140
universe of other possible mathematics
is out there that in fact in many cases

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150
is out there that in fact in many cases
 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.750
is out there that in fact in many cases
can be much more powerful in describing

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760
can be much more powerful in describing
 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.220
can be much more powerful in describing
things that we see in the natural world

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230
things that we see in the natural world
 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.380
things that we see in the natural world
and so on and that forms sort of the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390
and so on and that forms sort of the
 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.530
and so on and that forms sort of the
basis for for a lot of New Directions in

basis for for a lot of New Directions in
 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.809
basis for for a lot of New Directions in
science and technology and elsewhere so

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819
science and technology and elsewhere so
 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.000
science and technology and elsewhere so
in a sense the mathematics that we have

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010
in a sense the mathematics that we have
 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.160
in a sense the mathematics that we have
today is is very much it's a it's a

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170
today is is very much it's a it's a
 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.020
today is is very much it's a it's a
great historical artifact it's probably

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030
great historical artifact it's probably
 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.520
great historical artifact it's probably
if one looks at the history of

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530
if one looks at the history of
 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.920
if one looks at the history of
civilization mathematics as it exists

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930
civilization mathematics as it exists
 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.960
civilization mathematics as it exists
today is probably the single largest

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970
today is probably the single largest
 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.240
today is probably the single largest
artifact in the sense that more hands

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250
artifact in the sense that more hands
 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.370
artifact in the sense that more hands
have been involved in sort of molding

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380
have been involved in sort of molding
 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.830
have been involved in sort of molding
the particular the intellectual thing

that's been created that than anything

that's been created that than anything
 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.130
that's been created that than anything
else in history but we have to realize

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140
else in history but we have to realize
 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.500
else in history but we have to realize
that it is very much a a human artifact

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510
