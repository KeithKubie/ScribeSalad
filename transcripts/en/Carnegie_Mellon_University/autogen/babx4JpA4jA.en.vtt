at the beginning we we started with the

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:08.600
at the beginning we we started with the
 

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.790
at the beginning we we started with the
premise that most people want to save

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:09.800
premise that most people want to save
 

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.620

energy and next and nobody thinks about
 

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:15.580
energy and next and nobody thinks about
it and so with that in mind we decided

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:15.590
it and so with that in mind we decided
 

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.800

spite of that maybe because we felt some

spite of that maybe because we felt some
 

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:25.560

where have become you know a Costco

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:01.890
where have become you know a Costco
 

00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:04.340
where have become you know a Costco
culture we have big SUVs and they drive

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:04.350
culture we have big SUVs and they drive
 

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:07.070
culture we have big SUVs and they drive
us to Costco and you know when the thing

00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:07.080
us to Costco and you know when the thing
 

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.960
us to Costco and you know when the thing
that's three times as large costs only

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:08.970
that's three times as large costs only
 

00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:11.060
that's three times as large costs only
50 percent more than the thing that's

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:11.070
50 percent more than the thing that's
 

00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:13.430
50 percent more than the thing that's
the size we actually need we can't

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440
the size we actually need we can't
 

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:15.050
the size we actually need we can't
afford not to buy the thing that's three

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:15.060
afford not to buy the thing that's three
 

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.540
afford not to buy the thing that's three
times as large so we buy three gallons

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:17.550
times as large so we buy three gallons
 

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:19.400
times as large so we buy three gallons
of milk when when 1/2 a gallon of milk

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:19.410
of milk when when 1/2 a gallon of milk
 

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:22.430
of milk when when 1/2 a gallon of milk
will do and some of that milk goes to

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440
will do and some of that milk goes to
 

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:27.140
will do and some of that milk goes to
waste and so you know I think some of

paying a flat rate for electricity or in
 

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:23.470
paying a flat rate for electricity or in

they're going to be charging people in a
 

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.000
they're going to be charging people in a
more rational way based on when in the

more rational way based on when in the
 

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:30.609
more rational way based on when in the
day they use it and what the spot prices

00:52:30.609 --> 00:52:30.619
day they use it and what the spot prices
 

00:52:30.619 --> 00:52:33.380

internet and we're going to have a
 

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:50.780
internet and we're going to have a
refrigerator that tells us when we're

00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:50.790
refrigerator that tells us when we're
 

00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:52.529

out of milk
 

00:52:52.539 --> 00:52:55.709

relatively few of our devices are smart

00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:03.130
relatively few of our devices are smart
 

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:05.339
relatively few of our devices are smart
and and relatively few people have those

and and relatively few people have those
 

00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:10.409
and and relatively few people have those
smart devices and that in my opinion has

00:53:10.409 --> 00:53:10.419
smart devices and that in my opinion has
 

00:53:10.419 --> 00:53:14.339

the ability to radically change if if we

00:53:14.339 --> 00:53:14.349
the ability to radically change if if we

it would make sense to replace our

00:53:20.759 --> 00:53:20.769
it would make sense to replace our

it would make sense to replace our
refrigerator maybe not with a

00:53:22.949 --> 00:53:22.959
refrigerator maybe not with a
 

00:53:22.959 --> 00:53:24.209
refrigerator maybe not with a
refrigerator that told us we're out of

00:53:24.209 --> 00:53:24.219
refrigerator that told us we're out of
 

00:53:24.219 --> 00:53:26.309
refrigerator that told us we're out of

00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:26.319
milk but with a refrigerator that made

ice at the times when the electricity

00:53:28.589 --> 00:53:28.599
ice at the times when the electricity
 

00:53:28.599 --> 00:53:33.419
ice at the times when the electricity
was cheap and and and let itself warm up

00:53:33.419 --> 00:53:33.429
was cheap and and and let itself warm up
 

00:53:33.429 --> 00:53:35.519
was cheap and and and let itself warm up
modestly at times when the electricity

00:53:35.519 --> 00:53:35.529
modestly at times when the electricity
 

00:53:35.529 --> 00:53:39.029
modestly at times when the electricity
was expensive and so all of a sudden our

00:53:39.029 --> 00:53:39.039
was expensive and so all of a sudden our
 

00:53:39.039 --> 00:53:42.599
was expensive and so all of a sudden our
homes could become a lot smarter and the

00:53:42.599 --> 00:53:42.609
homes could become a lot smarter and the
 

00:53:42.609 --> 00:53:45.809
homes could become a lot smarter and the
economic value in exchanging your

economic value in exchanging your
 

00:53:45.819 --> 00:53:48.659
economic value in exchanging your
existing appliances the case would be a

00:53:48.659 --> 00:53:48.669
existing appliances the case would be a
 

00:53:48.669 --> 00:53:50.279
existing appliances the case would be a
lot stronger if we had cured

00:53:50.279 --> 00:53:50.289
lot stronger if we had cured
 

00:53:50.289 --> 00:53:52.349

I mean time-of-use electricity pricing

00:53:52.349 --> 00:53:52.359
I mean time-of-use electricity pricing
 

00:53:52.359 --> 00:53:53.609
I mean time-of-use electricity pricing
and that's the kind of thing that can be

00:53:53.609 --> 00:53:53.619
and that's the kind of thing that can be
 

00:53:53.619 --> 00:53:57.120
and that's the kind of thing that can be
pushed for at the state level and that I

00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:57.130
pushed for at the state level and that I
 

00:53:57.130 --> 00:53:58.349
pushed for at the state level and that I
think there's a lot of entrepreneurial

00:53:58.349 --> 00:53:58.359

one final question because we're running
 

00:54:02.439 --> 00:54:03.870
one final question because we're running
out of time and I always ask this

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:03.880
out of time and I always ask this
 

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:07.649
out of time and I always ask this
question to entrepreneurs to answer for

00:54:07.649 --> 00:54:07.659
question to entrepreneurs to answer for
 

00:54:07.659 --> 00:54:10.019
question to entrepreneurs to answer for
aspiring entrepreneurs there's lots of

00:54:10.019 --> 00:54:10.029
aspiring entrepreneurs there's lots of
 

00:54:10.029 --> 00:54:11.279
aspiring entrepreneurs there's lots of
advice that you can give to

00:54:11.279 --> 00:54:11.289
advice that you can give to
 

00:54:11.289 --> 00:54:13.229
advice that you can give to
entrepreneurs but if you had to boil it

00:54:13.229 --> 00:54:13.239
entrepreneurs but if you had to boil it
 

00:54:13.239 --> 00:54:15.479
entrepreneurs but if you had to boil it
down to one priority piece of advice

00:54:15.479 --> 00:54:15.489
down to one priority piece of advice
 

00:54:15.489 --> 00:54:17.839
down to one priority piece of advice
what would that be for entrepreneurs

00:54:17.839 --> 00:54:17.849
what would that be for entrepreneurs
 

00:54:17.849 --> 00:54:23.429
what would that be for entrepreneurs
well the thing that immediately comes to

00:54:23.429 --> 00:54:23.439
well the thing that immediately comes to
 

00:54:23.439 --> 00:54:24.689
well the thing that immediately comes to
mind is maybe something that doesn't

00:54:24.689 --> 00:54:24.699
mind is maybe something that doesn't

we were able to measure and track that
 

00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:39.420
we were able to measure and track that
over time thankfully in our case our

double bottom-line interests were very
well aligned but having that having that
