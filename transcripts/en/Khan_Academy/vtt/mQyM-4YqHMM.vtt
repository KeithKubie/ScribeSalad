00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.770
In the last video, we saw that
despite the fact that Italy

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.770
was an original member
of the Triple Alliance,

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.740
it was a very
awkward relationship.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.040
You fast forward to the
beginning of World War I, Italy

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.750
tried to stay neutral arguing
that the Triple Alliance was

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.170
being on the offense as
opposed to the defense.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.030
And then, as we mentioned,
in the spring of 1915,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.780
it signs the secret Treaty
of London with the Allies.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.750
Then in May, it
actually declares

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.360
war on Austria-Hungary.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.990
It actually wouldn't formally
declare war on Germany

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.280
until 1916.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.260
And so that lays the setting
for the actual combat

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.550
along the Italian
Austro-Hungarian border

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.510
that they share right over here.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.890
And so this next map I'm going
to show you is essentially

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.010
a zoom in of this
part of this map.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.780
So that's this map
right over here.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.700
So we can start in 1915.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.910
So we're going to start
right over here in 1915.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.332
We already saw that in May
Italy declares war on Austria.

00:01:02.332 --> 00:01:04.290
They didn't war on Germany
until the next year.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:15.430
The first combat happens in
June with the first Battle

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.789
on the Isanzo River.

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.080
I'm sure I'm mispronouncing it.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.350
The Isanzo River
contours the then border

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.250
between Italy and the
Austro-Hungarian empire.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.030
So it goes right along
this area right over here.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.730
It's actually a very
mountainous region.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.410
And as we'll see,
the Italian front

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.520
involved many, many battles
along the Isanzo River,

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.430
in fact, 12 battles in all.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.960
June 1915, it was
the first battle.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.550
And these continue into 1916.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.690
We get all the way
until the Fifth Battle

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.117
of the Isanzo River.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:59.450
So actually, let me draw that
arrow a little bit longer.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.950
These continue all
the way into 1916.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.050
And these essentially
end up in a stalemate.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.330
A lot of people die
in these battles.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.580
It's incredibly
difficult terrain.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.970
It favors the defending forces.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.480
And so, nothing really
happens to the border here.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.050
So far, all the offenses
that the Italians had taken,

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.740
nothing really happened.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.840
Then, as we get
into May of 1916,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.260
the Austro-Hungarians decide
to go on the offensive.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.060
And they go on the
offensive in this part

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.920
of the border right over here.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.820
And their offensive
is called the Battle

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.610
of Asiago, which
is right over here.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.670
They are able to get
as far as Asiago.

00:02:47.044 --> 00:02:49.710
But once again, even though they
were able to claim some ground,

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.797
they weren't able
to keep the ground.

00:02:51.797 --> 00:02:53.380
There were spreading
their troops out.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.130
They weren't able to
maintain their supply

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.490
chain, their supply lines.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.240
So by the end of that
battle, the Italians

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.950
had reclaimed that territory.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.780
And the actual front had
not moved dramatically.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.079
So really the first two
years of the conflict

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:07.370
ended up in a bit of stalemate.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.730
In fact, it continues.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.470
We then to pick up in 1916
the Sixth Battle on the Isanzo

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.100
River.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.010
And then these battles
on the Isanzo River

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.749
continue into 1917.

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:17.540
So let me show you.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.880
These are the battles
on the Isanzo River.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.870
These continue all
the way into 1917.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.510
Now, as we enter into 1917,
several interesting things

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.550
are happening.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.744
One, as you might remember,
on the Eastern Front in 1917,

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.410
the Russians are
starting to fall apart.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.150
They are starting to
have revolutions at home.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.110
They're losing on Eastern Front.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.250
This allows the Germans
to redeploy some troops.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.720
Also, at this point,
Italy is formally

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.180
at war with the Germans.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.890
So as we get to October of
1917, the Austro-Hungarians

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.190
are able to get
reinforced by the Germans.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.300
And it was just in time.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.290
Because frankly,
by the 11th Battle

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:06.710
of the Isanzo
River in late 1917,

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.900
the Austro-Hungarians
aren't quite sure

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.730
whether they can handle a 12th
Battle on the Isanzo River.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.480
So the Germans essentially
show up just in time.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.120
In October of 1917, along
with the Austro-Hungarians,

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.300
the Germans then launch
their own offensive

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.420
on the Isanzo River.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.960
And this one is actually
the first dramatic movement

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.950
that we see along
the Italian front.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.850
And this is often
called the Battle

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.521
of Caporetto, which
is right over here.

00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:38.270
But as you could
imagine, it's right along

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.300
the border between
these two states

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.020
and it's along the Isanzo
River, so this is also

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.480
referred to as the 12th
Battle of the Isanzo River.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.780
And this one is a very
successful offensive.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.640
They focused their
troops near Caporetto

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.240
at this point of the front.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.130
They're able to break
the Italian front.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.900
And then push deep
into Italian territory.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.010
So through October
and early November,

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.000
they're able to, over
the next several weeks--

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.660
this is in October,
November 1917-- they're

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.820
able to push the Italians
all the way back to behind

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.667
it the Piave River, so
this right over here.

00:05:21.667 --> 00:05:23.250
You may or may not
be able to read it.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.640
That says the Piave River.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.490
So they're able to push
the Italians roughly back

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.930
to this boundary
right over here.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:37.000
And so this takes us into 1918.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.660
Now at this point, the Germans
are planning their last ditch

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.130
spring offensive.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.960
They say, hey, look
Austro-Hungarians,

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.900
it looks like this war is taken.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.050
We're going to leave
this front to you guys.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.460
You guys should be able
to do the knock out blow

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.800
on the Italians right now.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.020
We're going to go return
to the Western Front,

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.740
so that we can take
care of the Allies,

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.102
especially because if we
don't do it sooner than later

00:06:01.102 --> 00:06:03.060
the Americans are going
to be able to reinforce

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.080
the Western Front.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.410
So the Germans redeploy
to Western Front,

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.240
away from this front.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.190
And essentially leave
the Austro-Hungarians

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.650
to try to essentially
take out the Italians.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:23.040
And so in June 1918,
the Austro-Hungarians

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.360
attempt their final--
what they hope

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.010
is their final-- offensive.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.630
And its along this boundary
right here on the Piave River.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.680
Unfortunately for the
Austro-Hungarians,

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.560
and fortunately
for the Italians,

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.160
the Austro-Hungarians did
not plan that assault well.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.860
Instead of doing
a point offensive

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.280
like they did with the Germans
in the Battle of Caporetto,

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.670
where they were able to break
the trenches, break the lines,

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.010
here it was less planned,
less coordinated.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.140
It was more spread out
along the entire line.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.010
On top of everything,
the Italians

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.312
got word of the
exact time and date

00:06:54.312 --> 00:06:55.770
that the battle
was going to start.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.070
It was literally going to
start 3:00 AM on June 15.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.140
The Italians decide,
well, it the battle's

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.141
going to start at 3:00
AM on June 15, that

00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:04.890
means that all of their
soldiers are going

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:10.260
to be in the trenches ready to
attack at 3:00 AM on June 15.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.410
So they started
lobbing artillery

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.782
into these densely
packed trenches knowing

00:07:14.782 --> 00:07:16.490
that it was likely to
hit a lot of people

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.770
because there were a lot
of people who were waiting

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.200
in the trenches
for an offensive.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.770
And so even before
the battle began,

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:23.310
they were able to
inflict a lot of carnage

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.270
on the soon to be invading
Austro-Hungarians.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.790
The invasion itself
was a bit of a debacle.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.280
When they were able to get
on top of the Piave River,

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.560
it isolated their troops.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.800
The Italians were able to
take advantage of that.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.420
And those troops
that were isolated

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.290
the south bank of
the Piave River,

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.790
they were able to
take care of them.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.680
And they were able to push
the Austro-Hungarians back.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.790
And they secured huge losses.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.530
The Austro-Hungarian army
was incredibly weakened.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.366
And some people believe
that the Italians

00:07:50.366 --> 00:07:52.490
could have just done an
immediate counter offensive

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.329
and taken the
Austro-Hungarians out.

00:07:54.329 --> 00:07:55.870
The Italians, on
the other hand, they

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.400
were still licking their wounds
from the Battle of Caporetto

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.720
and they decided to wait their
chance and regroup a bit.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.890
And so they wait
until October of 1918.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.330
You have a very weakened
Austro-Hungarian army.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:17.070
And this is when the Italians
do their decisive offensive

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:21.400
of the Italian front, the
Battle of the Vittorio Venito.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.160
Vittorio Venito is
right over here.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.440
And once again, I apologize
to all of the Italians

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.240
out there for my
mispronunciations.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.760
But this is what's
essentially able

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.799
to break the back
of the Austrians.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:40.480
The Italians are
able to pour through.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.210
They're able to, essentially,
take out the Austrians.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.210
The Austrians were
already weakened.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.070
They're starting to
have internal strife.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.430
The empire is starting
to fall apart.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.950
And so by November, the
Austro-Hungarian empire

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.690
essentially surrenders.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.730
And not just with the
Italians, but surrenders

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.720
relative to the Allies,
which is essentially

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:07.675
the end of the Italian
front of World War I.
