ANDY SHARPLESS: Thanks
very much.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.550
So, thank you all for coming.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.390
I'm going to speak briefly.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.560
And then, I hope you'll
ask me questions.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.330
We can take advantage of the
fact that we have a group

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.820
small enough to do that.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.420
So, now, in my role as an
author, for the first time, I

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.890
get asked this question, why
did you write this book?

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.830
It's like the starting
question I get asked.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.340
And I wanted to think, in a
genuine way, about where the

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.720
kernel for the book
really comes.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.740
What was the experience that
started us down this path?

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.260
And I think it's a moment in
Geneva, about five or six

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.486
years ago, when I was there
to talk to the World Trade

00:00:41.486 --> 00:00:45.300
Organization about helping to
stop overfishing and stop

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.340
ocean collapse.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.760
And we went to see
the Chinese trade

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.120
representative in Geneva.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.800
And it's quite interesting.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.640
In Geneva, 150 countries of the
world represented there,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.850
for international discussions
about

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.800
managing the world's trade.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.040
The United States Embassy
is surrounded by

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.599
perimeters of fences.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.980
And the Chinese Embassy
is open.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.140
You walk in.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.680
You meet the Chinese ambassador,
then who was about

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.630
35 years old, very distinguished
young man, very

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.630
well dressed.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.520
We sit down with him.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.910
And we said, we have a bad
history as a planet in

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.000
managing the oceans.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.020
They are collapsing.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.350
And he said, we have a billion
people in China.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.640
They're very hungry.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.960
We're going to feed them.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.470
You guys have gotten
your chance.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.040
We need to make sure we
can feed our people.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.240
It was a very sincere and strong
message on behalf of

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.760
the food side of the equation.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.330
And I went away and thought
about it and said, OK.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.190
So there we have two very
morally compelling gulfs.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.980
Protect life on the planet--

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.200
the traditional conservation
agenda, protect biodiversity--

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.230
or feed people.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.420
Make sure people
aren't hungry.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.410
Make sure that in the year 2050,
when there are 2 billion

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.800
more people on the planet, we
don't have children waking up

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.170
hungry everywhere.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.770
We have nearly a billion, 950
million, people, now waking up

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.230
hungry frequently
on the planet.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.680
So this is not an imaginary
problem.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.390
Now, if you think about the
origin of the conservation

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.890
movement, it goes back about
100, 120 years ago.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.980
And it starts on the land.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.610
And on the land, if you ask
the question, what is the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.870
biggest driver of biodiversity
loss on the planet, the answer

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.170
is agriculture.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.060
This is the reason that
we are losing species.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.510
It's the chief reason we are
losing species on the land.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.550
And so, the history of the
conversation movement is--

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.270
because there's a fundamental
moral kind of war between

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.150
feeding people and
protecting life--

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.450
that you kind of choose sides.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.440
And the conservationists' side
is we're going to protect

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.830
biodiversity.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.510
And if that means we have to
stand against agriculture,

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.850
we'll stand against
agriculture.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.340
Because we don't see on
the land that you can

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.330
simultaneously optimize for
food production and for

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.510
biodiversity protection.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.660
So there's a kind of a war in
people's heads that comes from

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.270
the land-based experience
of conservation.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.900
And when we went into the ocean,
when the conservation

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.280
movement went into the ocean,
oh, about 30 years ago--

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.440
and your colleague Jennifer
therefore can date herself to

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.830
being one of the early pioneers
of thinking about the

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.200
ocean, because it's really
only about 30 years old--

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.960
that mindset was
taken with us.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.290
So we went into the ocean,
and we thought the job of

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.830
optimizing food production
at the ocean cannot be

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.560
simultaneously optimized with
the job of biodiversity

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.620
protection of the ocean.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.310
You have to make a choice just
because we're used to making

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.240
that choice on the land.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.630
That framework drove the
conservation agenda in

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.790
opposition to the
food production

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.730
agenda in the ocean.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.240
Now, we are right now on a
path where we are getting

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.180
fewer fish from the ocean every
year despite increasing

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.260
efforts to catch them.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.329
Despite using advanced
technologies of all sorts to

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.370
track down and catch fish, the
world's fishery catch, just in

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.660
tonnage, peaked in the
late 1980s and

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.580
has been coming down.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.510
You've heard of peak oil.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.380
Well, we've crossed peak
fish, wild fish.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.910
At a moment when we have all
of these hungry people, you

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.340
would want that to be going
the other direction.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.940
That opportunity turns
out to be real.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.890
And the message of the book is
that if we will manage our

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.040
oceans well, we can have a
future, by 2050, that is

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.400
different in this very
quantifiable way.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.360
We are on a path to be feeding
about 450 million seafood

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.690
meals a day in the year
2050 if we'll stay on

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.950
the path we're on.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:14.080
If we manage the oceans better,
we can do 800 million

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.180
meals a day.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.140
And if we stopped feeding fish
to pigs and animals, it could

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.440
be a billion people a day
forever being fed healthy

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.850
seafood meal.

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.840
So that's the order of magnitude
of the choice, 450

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.900
million versus on the order of
1 billion people a day, a

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.680
seafood meal every single day.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.750
Now, how do we do that?

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.440
How do we get there?

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.870
Now, the common idea--

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.230
now, in all of your heads,
unless you're way more

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.325
advanced than the typical group
that I've talked about

00:05:46.325 --> 00:05:49.150
it, which you may be, since
we are here at Google--

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.170
is that you're thinking about
the map of the world.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.990
And you're thinking, you know,
the map of the world's oceans

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.990
looks like a pretty
international place.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.910
It looks, to me, as a naive
observer of the world's

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.620
oceans, that we are only going
to manage the oceans well if

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.540
we construct international
committees to collaborate

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.910
around the rules and enforce
the rules for managing

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.590
fishing, because that's
the way the map looks.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.150
And if you are a practical
person, you would be

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.760
discouraged.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.320
Because we don't do a very good
job in the world, sadly,

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.410
at doing international
management of anything.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.570
We don't do a very good job of
international management of

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.550
stopping killing people,
let alone too

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.770
much killing of fish.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.910
So how could you, as a practical
person, get excited

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.720
about the job of producing
all of this

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.065
seafood for the future?

00:06:41.065 --> 00:06:42.860
Here's the very good
news for you.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.630
It turns out that life in
the ocean is not equally

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.550
distributed.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.980
Seven out of eight pounds of
the world's wild fish are

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.700
caught in the coastal
zones of the oceans.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.540
Now, that is a surprising
insight, because the most

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.160
charismatic fish in the ocean
are, like the most charismatic

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.000
creatures on the land, big
predators, lions and

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.170
tigers of the ocean.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.210
And like lions and tigers on
the land, they have big

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:12.570
territories.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.360
And they have the tendency to
spend a lot of their life out

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.900
in the international zone
of the seas, which is

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.910
called the high seas.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.620
And indeed, they do need to be
protected by international

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.610
cooperation.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:30.530
So the tunas, the sharks, that
we think of and we love, are,

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:33.240
in fact, extremely vulnerable.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.750
And the future will struggle to
see many of those, because

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:38.640
they do require us to do
what we don't do well,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.590
international agreements.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.760
But here's the good news from
the point of view of food.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.220
The coastal zones of the world's
oceans are controlled

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.980
country by country, by
the adjacent country.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.610
Every coastal country, out to
200 nautical miles, by itself

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.520
sets the rules for what happens
in that ocean with

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.960
respect to fishing.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.655
Nobody fishes within 200
nautical miles of the United

00:08:03.655 --> 00:08:06.800
States Coast without fishing
under the rules that the

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.810
Americans set.

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:13.320
So they have to fish with
our quota rules.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.190
They have to fish with our
habitat protection rules.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:18.420
They have to comply with
our bycatch rules.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.380
You cannot overfish the American
ocean because the

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.860
Spanish come in and decide they
want to fish our ocean.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.190
It's not a tragedy of the
commons, in that classic way,

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.840
where nobody's in charge.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.750
The Americans are in charge
of their ocean.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.270
The Chileans are in charge
of their ocean.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.299
The Europeans are in charge
of their ocean.

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:38.700
And on and on and on.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.380
And, in fact, by the way,
interesting fact, the country

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.590
in the world with the biggest
coastal territory, by square

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.070
miles, is the United
States of America.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.910
So if you're an American, you
can think of yourself as

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.360
having more opportunity than
the average citizen of the

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.050
world to influence the future
of this part of the world's

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.050
nature, natural systems.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.250
From the point of view of food,
though, we want to ask

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:07.500
the question, how many countries
would it take to do

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:11.220
a good job managing their ocean,
managing their ocean

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.870
fishery, to deliver the ocean
intact and abundant to the

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.370
year 2050, to feed all these
people, that are going to be

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.410
here then, healthy seafood
meals, delicious seafood meals

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:28.340
like we had today in the
Google cafeteria?

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:33.110
So we, at Oceana, made a list,
with the countries with the

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.660
biggest catch from their coastal
zones at the top and

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.270
the ones with the smallest
catch, by

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.210
weight at the bottom.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.250
And we asked the question, if
the top 10 countries on that

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.160
list, just the top 10 countries
on that list, were

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:50.570
to do a good job managing their
oceans, what share of

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.750
the world's wild fish catch
could we deliver in a healthy

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:54.450
state to the future?

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.800
And the answer is 2/3.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.220
Nine countries and the European
Union together

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.240
control the catch of
2/3 of the wild's

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.196
fish catch by weight.

00:10:06.196 --> 00:10:10.486
The tunas and the swordfish
are not.

00:10:10.486 --> 00:10:13.040
You know, they're charismatic
and they're important.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.900
But by weight, they don't
contribute as much as you

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.260
would think.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.080
And from the point of view of
feeding people, weight is what

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.690
we're concerned about, weight
of healthy animal protein.

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:24.450
Yeah?

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.666
AUDIENCE: When you say weight,
do you say weight that goes to

00:10:26.666 --> 00:10:28.834
human consumption or also,
like, farms and pigs and

00:10:28.834 --> 00:10:29.380
everything?

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.990
ANDY SHARPLESS: The question
is, when I say weight, am I

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.950
talking about fish that gets
fed directly to people or

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.480
including stuff that gets
fed to animals?

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.500
And I'm talking about the catch,
no matter where it gets

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.790
delivered to.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:45.010
And so, that question points to
another interesting fact.

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:48.210
And I mentioned it earlier.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:53.500
We have a big opportunity in the
future to feed people by

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.770
stopping or reducing the
practice of feeding fish to

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.120
fish or feeding fish
to animals.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.520
Let me just address
that directly.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:09.270
Very often, people will say,
isn't the solution to

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:13.250
overfishing of the oceans
farming of fish?

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.380
And when I eat a farmed fish,
aren't I doing something

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.820
that's good for the ocean?

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.690
And intuitively, it sounds
like you are.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.870
In fact, you have to ask
the following question.

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:23.840
What does the fish that you are
eating, that is farmed,

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.700
what does it eat?

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.380
And the answer to that question
creates three

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:33.390
categories that are, basically,
good, bad, and

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.530
indifferent, depending upon
what the fish eats.

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:40.720
If the fish eats fish, that's
a problem category.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.330
If the fish eats grain, it's a
kind of a neutral category.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:52.030
If the farmed fish eats algae,
like oysters, clams, mussels

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:56.480
do, that's basically an
unalloyed good thing.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.610
So what's a fish that eats a lot
of fish, that's farmed a

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:01.400
lot, that we see a lot of?

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.240
Salmon.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.170
This is a carnivore.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.140
Salmon eats other fish.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.450
And I've been to the salmon
pens in Chile.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:12.955
And they take wild fish, grind
them up into little pellets

00:12:12.955 --> 00:12:15.640
that look like dog food
but smell like fish.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.720
And they feed them to the
farm salmon in the pens.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.680
And in the process, they convert
four or five pounds of

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.690
wild salmon into one pound
of farmed fish.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.670
So it's a reduction activity.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:29.360
By contrast, by happy contrast,
the farmer of

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.760
mussels, the farmer of clams,
the farmer of oysters, is

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.810
creating a healthy and delicious
seafood out of

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.970
something that eats algae.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:39.940
It's not something human
beings eat or livestock

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.280
generally eat.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.580
And, by the way, in so doing
cleans the ocean, because it's

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:45.930
a filter feeder.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:49.140
And, by the way, it's even
better because it's that

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.710
rarest of things in the world.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:54.850
It's a for profit company with
employees and with profits and

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:56.840
with all of the connections
that profitable businesses

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.360
have to the political
establishment, which must have

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.520
a clean ocean.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.450
Because if you're finding
oysters in a polluted ocean,

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.840
they don't taste good
or they die.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.530
So we, as people who want there
to be an abundant ocean,

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:14.570
encourage you to eat as many
farmed mussels, clams, and

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:17.130
oysters as you can stomach.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.690
Go today, and eat
mussels tonight.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:23.980
There's a recipe for
them in my book.

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.290
And there were some today at
the cafeteria, one of those

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.740
recipes, clams.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.990
So we talked about nine
countries plus

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.540
the European Union.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.410
I want to address an
important fact.

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.520
You're wondering if I slipped
something tricky in there by

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.220
saying the European Union,
because you will know that

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.880
there are 27 countries in
the European Union.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.160
So I didn't, like, finesse this
by getting 9 plus 27 to

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.880
sound like 10.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:57.430
The European Union manages its
fisheries on a continental

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.430
basis out of Brussels.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.460
The rules for all 27 member
states on quotas, habitat and

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.840
bycatch, or on overfishing or
not are set in one place by

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.220
one set of decision makers
in Brussels.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.140
So for purposes of fishery
management, it's authentic and

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:14.500
legitimate to treat the European
Union as one country.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.990
So nine countries plus the
European Union, if they will

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:22.580
stop overfishing, can manage, do
manage, 2/3 of the world's

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.200
fish by weight and can deliver
those in healthy

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.780
state to the future.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.460
If you go to 25 countries,
counting the European Union as

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.130
a country, which is the correct
way to count it for

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:34.490
fisheries purposes, you get the
90% of the world's wild

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:35.800
fish by weight.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:43.170
So this is a very
doable thing.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.060
We can.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:49.280
It comes down to 10 decision
makers doing basically one

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:57.260
thing, stopping overfishing, to
make sure all this natural,

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.920
healthy seafood is available
for the future.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.370
Now, I want to point
out one last thing.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.610
In the forecasts for the planet
between now and 2050,

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:14.920
there is an optimistic plan that
the middle classes are

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.540
going to grow and that there
will be a big expansion in the

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.070
middle class of China,
Brazil, India.

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.260
This is devoutly to
be hoped for.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.750
This is a good thing.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.590
That means, among other things,
that they will be

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:32.140
eating a lot more
animal protein.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:36.810
And if you face up to what the
consequences of expanded

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:41.190
livestock production will be
for the planet, you will be

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:45.510
very worried, because livestock
production is one of

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:47.400
the most intensive forms
of agriculture.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.930
And remember, I talked about
agriculture broadly being the

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:54.130
enemy of biodiversity on the
planet on the land, while

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:57.770
livestock production is a
really tough problem for

00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:00.170
biodiversity on the land.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:03.330
It also is a big producer of
methane and, therefore,

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.780
climate forcing activity
on the planet.

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.380
It also is a huge demander
of fresh

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:13.470
water and aquifer depletion.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.370
So if you care about
those things--

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:20.420
climate change, aquifer
depletion, deforestation--

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.850
you need to care about making
the ocean abundant.

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.740
I assume all of us here
care about feeding

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.735
poor and hungry people.

00:16:27.735 --> 00:16:30.210
But if you are so hardhearted
that that's not part of your

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.170
agenda, and all you care about
is these other things, you

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:36.870
also have a reason to fight
for an abundant ocean.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:41.140
I have had some people
say to me, I

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.050
don't really like seafood.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.530
I don't even understand how
somebody in the middle of

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:50.470
Africa, who lives nowhere near
seafood, is going to benefit

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.620
from an abundant ocean.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.610
Tell me why I should
care about this.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:04.530
My answer is, seafood right
now is equal to eggs as a

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:07.140
source of animal protein
in the human diet--

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.500
A-- so it's bigger than
you think it is.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:16.619
And B, if you're a person
who eats food--

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:17.875
let's imagine that
possibility--

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:26.140
or you're a person in the middle
of Africa who is never

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:30.390
going to see a fish but who
is hungry, and that's your

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:33.100
client-- in your head, you want
to help that person--

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.986
you can help them by making
the oceans be abundant,

00:17:35.986 --> 00:17:41.510
because the price of grain
in the year 2050 will be

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:45.300
different if we have an abundant
ocean or not, because

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:49.850
livestock production is a
big demander of grain.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:53.780
And so, the price of a taco, the
price of a loaf of bread,

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:56.420
will be different in the year
2050, and better and more

00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.000
affordable for that person in
the middle of Africa, if we

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.400
have an abundant ocean.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:07.430
So I really want the world
to see this opportunity.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.210
And I really want us
to capture it.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.810
The last thing I want to say--
and then I'll take questions--

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:16.900
when you think about nature,
and you think about what it

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:22.950
takes to restore nature,
consider that the oceans are

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.960
one of the strongest and most
fertile and most robust parts

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.280
of nature on the planet.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.640
Fish, many of them, lay
eggs by the millions.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.840
You can, and it's proven in
the data, if you will stop

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.210
overfishing and you will allow
spawning stocks to rebuild,

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:41.310
you can, in 5 or 10 years, 5
or 10 years, see measurable

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.000
increases in ocean abundance.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.200
You can get to a point where you
can have a bigger catch, a

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.900
sustainable bigger catch, very
much in the lifetimes of

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.250
everybody in this room.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:55.840
It's not like the longer-term
task of rebuilding a rain

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.260
forest, which can take
100 years, if that.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.670
This is something that
short attention

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:05.410
span theater rewards.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:06.590
We can get there.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:07.790
We can get there.

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.130
And we can get there in a
way that's measurable.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:14.380
We think the blunt estimate
is that the world, if well

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:19.980
managed, if it managed its
oceans well, can increase the

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:23.370
sustainable catch on the order
of 20% to 40% over the

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.100
previous peak.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.870
So I talked at the beginning
of my remarks about the

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.560
world's fish catch peaking
in the late 1980s.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.330
There is upside on top of that
peak on the order of 20% to

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:37.840
40% if we can get these top 10
countries to do a good job.

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:43.710
And then, the fundamental point
here is that the mindset

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:46.640
that I talked about at the
beginning of my remarks, about

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.520
the war between agriculture
and biodiversity, the war

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:53.000
between feeding people and
protecting life that occurs on

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.750
the land, is wrong when
it comes to the ocean.

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.310
Those two things are
actually allies.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.440
Those two enemies
are now allies.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.880
The task of feeding people wild
seafood, we are eating a

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:06.420
wild creature.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.930
So the things that we do to
make the wild creatures

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:12.652
abundant benefit the
biodiversity of the ocean.

00:20:12.652 --> 00:20:15.230
The way you have a really
productive ocean is you have a

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.040
biodiverse ocean.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.330
So you do not have to choose, if
you are managing them well.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:21.730
Indeed, you are doing the things
that are achieving both

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.250
goals at once.

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:24.170
So thank you very much.

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.780
That's my quick overview
of the book.

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:27.750
I hope you will read the book.

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:29.410
It's called "The Perfect
Protein."

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.350
President Clinton was nice
enough to write the forward

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:35.790
for it, partly because he
helped, as Jennifer explained,

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.570
to sign the laws in place in
the United States that

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.800
tightened our regulation of our
oceans and made us one of

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.880
the better ocean managers
in the world.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.640
We are seeing progress
around the world.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:50.100
And I think that this is one
of those problems that the

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.690
world can actually fix.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.366
Thank you very much.

00:20:53.366 --> 00:20:56.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:56.250 --> 00:21:00.682
So I am delighted to take
questions or comments.

00:21:00.682 --> 00:21:06.360
AUDIENCE: So I've been to
Iceland, at the invitation of

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.860
President Grimsson, and seen
how they manage their

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.355
fisheries successfully there.

00:21:10.355 --> 00:21:11.740
They're profitable.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:12.790
They're sustainable.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.190
They do sound science.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:17.760
So, certainly, when the will is
there to manage a fishery

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.760
effectively, it can
be managed.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:23.260
So what do you think the most
important thing that needs to

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:28.670
happen, to inspire the will to
tackle the global issue both

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.600
the United States and abroad,
to actually do

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.530
what Iceland has done?

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.940
ANDY SHARPLESS: Well, there's
good ways for this to happen,

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.410
and there's bad ways
for this to happen.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:39.510
Very often, the way the
world does this is

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.650
that it sees a collapse.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:46.080
It lets things get to the point
of serious difficulty.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.660
Chile, where we have worked
very, very successfully over

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.960
the last 10 years, is an
example of the latter.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.320
They mismanaged their
industrial fleet.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.330
They collapsed their three
biggest fisheries.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.940
The scientists would come in
and recommend the quota.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:03.640
The fleet would say, we
want a bigger quota.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.900
The government would exceed
to the fleet demands.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:06.570
And so, guess what?

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.150
They crashed their fisheries.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:11.820
After about 10 or 15 years of
inability to catch their

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.950
permitted quotas, because they
had overfished so badly, the

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.740
fleet was pretty discredited.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.180
The government regulators were
now in a position to see that

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.180
they needed to do something
different.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.530
And we were successful in
January of this year in

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:29.300
getting the law there changed
from a discretionary regime to

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.220
a mandatory regime.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.320
And this is basically what
President Clinton did in 1995.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.710
And this is what the European
Union is on the verge of doing

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:37.100
in the next few months.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.760
In every place in the world,
where you have a law that says

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.700
to the regulators, if you
would like, you can set

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.170
scientific quotas, if you would
like, you can protect

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:50.990
nursery habitat, you could
choose, the law will allow you

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:56.570
to manage bycatch, if that's
the law, it doesn't work.

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:59.460
And what we did in 1995, and
what the Chileans did in

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.490
January, and what the Europeans
are on the verge of

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:05.650
doing, is making those three
things mandatory.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.070
And so, the law says you must,
if you're the regulator and

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.330
the manager of this fishery,
set scientific quotas, you

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:14.540
must protect nursery habitat,
you must reduce bycatch.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.150
You can get there.

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:19.650
Chiefly, the way the world gets
there is by seeing in the

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.730
numbers collapses and
knowing that they

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:22.800
need to make a change.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.540
That's the bad path the
Chileans traveled.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.585
That's the bad path the
Europeans traveled.

00:23:27.585 --> 00:23:31.660
The Americans didn't let our
Pacific fishery collapse

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:34.750
before we realized that we
needed to make a fix.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:37.410
The New England fishery got
pretty badly ruined here by

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:38.000
overfishing.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.506
So we had examples of
mismanagement of our own.

00:23:41.506 --> 00:23:45.200
You cab also have an upside
story, which is, of course,

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:49.120
what the book is trying to say,
which is that this is a

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.230
great opportunity.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:54.810
There's lots of upside here
from good management--

00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:55.785
people love seafood.

00:23:55.785 --> 00:23:56.820
They like to eat it.

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:57.750
It tastes good.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:58.520
It's healthy for them.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.225
It's good for the planet.

00:23:59.225 --> 00:24:00.900
It's the perfect protein--

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.730
and to try to get people to
focus on the upside, but

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.730
history would suggest that more
often people have to have

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.296
a brush with disaster
to get motivated to

00:24:09.296 --> 00:24:10.533
do the right thing.

00:24:10.533 --> 00:24:13.300
AUDIENCE: Can you speak, just
because we're from the US now,

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.580
a little more about
how you would

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:16.540
actually change our practices?

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.360
So we have quota levels today.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.570
If we were to implement some
of the restrictions you

00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:24.010
mentioned, how different are
they than today's quotas?

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:26.980
Would we be changing the type of
fish we would be gathering?

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.450
What other measures would
you put in place?

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:30.030
Is it the methodology?

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.290
Just speak to kind of where on
the food chain you'd want to

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:33.690
select from, things like that?

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:36.330
ANDY SHARPLESS: So, in the
United States of America, the

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:38.740
good news is, and since we're
on the Pacific here, the

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:41.150
Pacific American fisheries
are pretty well managed.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:43.880
So we don't have big problems
in the Pacific.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.260
We've done a good job there.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.130
New England fishery is a
disaster, as I mentioned.

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:49.900
We need to allow the New England
fisheries to rebuild.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.010
So we need to set and enforce
lower quotas there, protect

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:54.960
some nursery habitat, especially
from bottom

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.570
trawling, reduce bycatch.

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:58.546
AUDIENCE: Well, like, what's
a rough percentage?

00:24:58.546 --> 00:25:00.562
Are we talking about, like,
cut it by 20% or cut

00:25:00.562 --> 00:25:02.310
it by, like, 60%?

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:07.060
What does it take for it to
get a chance to grow back?

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:09.390
ANDY SHARPLESS: It's hard for
me to give you a summary

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:11.680
answer, because as species by
species, it's different.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.990
And I haven't calculated, but
could calculate, like, if you

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:16.920
averaged together the New
England fisheries by weight

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.500
and what the average change
would be there.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.770
And then, you have a decision
about how fast you want the

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:25.640
rebuild to occur.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.370
You know what I mean?

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:27.160
There's a trade-off.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.740
Like, you can do the math
in your head, right?

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:35.610
There's a trade-off between a
lower cut in current fishing

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:39.170
pressure and then a faster
rebound versus a smaller cut

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:40.670
and then a slower rebuild.

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:43.070
And that's, in fact, the
struggle that is happening in

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:44.640
New England right now.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.450
We would have a preference for
a lower cut and a faster

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:50.340
rebuild, because you get
more results and

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.050
more fish that way.

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:53.030
Reasonable question
you're asking.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:55.470
I don't have the summary math in
my head for New England or

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:56.810
the United States.

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:59.330
I do want to shift to two other
things that we ought to

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:01.640
do that your question
asked about.

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:09.200
As an individual, you ought to
guide your fish consumption in

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.970
the following way.

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:12.225
Eat wild.

00:26:12.225 --> 00:26:13.990
Eat small species.

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:17.605
Eat local.

00:26:17.605 --> 00:26:21.370
Eat farmed shellfish
wherever you can.

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:24.900
And I'm sorry to say, don't
eat any shrimp anymore.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:28.990
I can explain these five
simple rules quickly.

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:31.900
Wild, we talked about, as
being better than farmed

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.032
already in my answers, in
my previous remarks.

00:26:35.032 --> 00:26:38.430
Farmed shellfish, we already
talked about why that's good.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:41.180
Local, the American fisheries
are generally better managed

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.400
than the foreign fisheries.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.050
We import 90% of our seafood.

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.080
So if you're eating local,
or domestic might be more

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:52.250
precise, you're likely eating
a fish that's better managed

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:54.320
than something coming from
the rest of the world.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.780
So that's the reason
to do that.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:01.590
And then shrimp, which
is loved by America--

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.940
and I love shrimp--

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:08.030
effectively, there's no way to
feel good about eating shrimp.

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.830
If you're eating wild shrimp,
you're eating something that

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.610
has enormous amounts
of bycatch.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:14.070
Shrimp are appropriately
named.

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:15.750
They're very small.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.070
So that means to catch shrimp,
you have to have

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.740
a small mesh net.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.690
You catch three, four, five
pounds of other creatures

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:25.850
along with each pound
of shrimp.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:29.110
I was on "CBS This Morning" the
week before last, the day

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:32.840
we launched the book, and the
actor who played Bubba Gump

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:33.880
was following me.

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.220
You will all recognize
who that was.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.520
I wanted to make this joke on
TV, but I did not have time

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.000
with Tom Hanks to
make that joke.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.860
So if you're eating wild shrimp,
you have to picture

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.740
that you're also eating three
or four or five pounds of

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:52.720
other things, including, like,
turtles that got caught in the

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.806
shrimp nets.

00:27:53.806 --> 00:27:55.750
If you're eating farmed
shrimp, you're eating

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:58.780
something that's imported
typically from the a tropical

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.890
country, where a coastal
pond was created.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:05.190
A shallow coastal pond was
created, often in a mangrove

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:11.810
forest, filled with shrimp,
fed intensively, so

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.440
intensively packed in there, so
swimming in their own fecal

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.000
matter that high levels of
pesticides and antibiotics are

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.570
applied to keep them healthy
until the point when that gets

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:25.095
so contaminated that they have
to move to a new place and

00:28:25.095 --> 00:28:26.070
create a new pond.

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:28.900
You can fly over Belize, as I've
done, and see these kind

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.920
of strange zones.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.680
And you don't know
what they are.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.660
They're former fish,
shrimp ponds,

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.376
unpleasant things to see.

00:28:38.376 --> 00:28:40.650
The last thing I want to say
about what we could do in the

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.010
United States of America--

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:43.260
and your question is
a very good one--

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:49.140
we have an opportunity, because
we import 90% of our

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:54.680
seafood, to effect the conduct
of the world's fleets by our

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.930
buying practices.

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.800
And if we would pass laws, that
have now been introduced

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.760
into both the Senate and the
House, to require that all

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.110
seafood sold in the United
States is traceable, traceable

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:11.430
to when it was caught, where
it was caught, how it was

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:15.280
caught, we would make it very
hard for illegally-sourced

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.660
fish to get into our
supply chain.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.880
And illegally-sourced fish are
on the order of 10% to 25% of

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.640
the world's catch, fish caught
out of quota, in the wrong

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.070
place, and so forth.

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:30.370
If we had a strict traceability
regime, those

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:32.860
illegal fishermen would have
trouble documenting that their

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.350
catches were legal.

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:35.940
And they wouldn't be able
to sell them to us.

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.690
And they would have a
self-interested reason,

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:41.590
because they want to sell us,
to fix their practices.

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:44.040
Senator Begich from Alaska has
introduced a bill in the

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:45.130
Senate to do this.

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:47.310
Congressman Markey has
introduced a bill in the House

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.700
to do this.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.940
They're called the
Safe Seafood Act.

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:52.500
We would like you to contact
your representatives or your

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.840
senators and encourage them to
cosponsor these bills to get

00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:58.660
them through Congress.

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.220
We've done more seafood testing
than any organization

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:01.800
in the country.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.610
We've tested 1,200--

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:04.330
more than the government--

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:06.690
1,200 different samples of
seafood around the country and

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:10.470
discovered that, on average,
about 33% of the time, what

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:12.410
you bought is not what
they told you it was.

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.580
Now, sometimes, it's a
small mislabeling.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.470
Sometimes, it's a
big mislabeling.

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:18.250
But there's a lot of seafood
fraud going on.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:22.740
So the Safe Seafood Fraud Act
would also bring you benefits

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:23.175
as a consumer.

00:30:23.175 --> 00:30:26.100
It would stop you from being
defrauded while also

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.650
delivering conservation benefits
to the planet.

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:32.110
So, that's one of Oceana's
big priorities this year.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:34.440
And we'd love to have
your help on that.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:39.588
But our fishery management
rules are in good shape.

00:30:39.588 --> 00:30:41.182
Yes?

00:30:41.182 --> 00:30:43.800
AUDIENCE: Could you talk through
an example where a

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.240
fishery collapsed, good
practices were put in place,

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.355
and it actually recovered?

00:30:47.355 --> 00:30:50.280
ANDY SHARPLESS: When I started
developing the argument that

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:55.640
is in the book, I would review
this with Oceana's board of

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.580
directors, the argument,
as we were starting

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:58.980
to figure it out.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:03.540
And they said just what
you said, right here.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.060
They said, Andy, could you give
us some case examples of

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.480
fishery rebounds, please?

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.890
And a scientist on our board,
who's a very distinguished

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:12.070
scientist, said, you're
asking Andy to prove

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.800
that gravity works.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.120
And they said, yes, we are.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.540
Please prove that
gravity works.

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:21.440
So I went out, and I got some
case examples of fisheries

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.620
that had been mismanaged
and wrecked

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.360
and had then rebounded.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.150
And there are many of them.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:29.100
It's not hard to find them.

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.810
There are four of them in this
little pamphlet which we will

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:32.710
hand out to you.

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:35.750
And I can show you these
charts here.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:39.120
We famously call these charts
u-charts, because they go

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.000
down, and then they go up.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.790
And in each of these cases,
which I can call out to you,

00:31:44.790 --> 00:31:48.380
there was, like, a 40 or
a 50-year period of

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.120
mismanagement.

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.690
The first one here is the
Norwegian Arctic cod, which

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:54.970
was badly managed by
the Norwegians.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:58.640
They drove the spawning stock
way down and kept it down by

00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.480
mismanagement.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:04.680
And in the 1980s, they imposed
a discard band.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.500
And it rebounded in
5 or 10 years.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.520
This next example is the New
Zealand rock lobster.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:15.600
From '65 until about '90, badly
mismanaged, catch limits

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.210
imposed in the '90s.

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:19.150
It comes back.

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:22.250
This next example is the
Norwegian herring.

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:23.640
Fishing limits put on.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.550
After bad litmus mismanagement,
it recovered.

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:29.580
And this is US haddock, which
was really, astoundingly

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.860
mismanaged by the United
States, punished badly.

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.330
And in about 1995--

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:38.290
1995, remember that--

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:40.580
President Clinton and Senator
Stevens get together in the

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:43.790
days when bipartisan action
was possible.

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:45.150
And that fishery rebounded.

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:48.830
So 5 or 10 years, in
the scientific

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:50.995
data, evidence of recovery.

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:55.230
I love that question.

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:57.850
I mean, this is not a
theoretical exercise.

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:00.700
This is in the data over
and over again.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.190
Now, there is of famous
counterexample.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:05.802
Do you know what the famous
counterexample is?

00:33:05.802 --> 00:33:07.020
AUDIENCE: Canadian Cod, maybe?

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.900
ANDY SHARPLESS: Yes,
well done.

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:13.620
The famous counterexample is
Canadian cod, which were badly

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:20.380
overfished by the Canadians and
by some European fleets.

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:25.700
The Canadians finally imposed
tight restrictions on it.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.930
And it has not come back.

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:33.620
And it is the classic nightmare
scenario of a

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:37.200
fishery that was once
hugely important.

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.140
Here's huge cod that were five
or six feet long, so important

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.220
to the early development of
the United States that we

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.190
named a part of our country
after them, Cape Cod.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.700
That fishery has
not come back.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.330
Nobody really knows why.

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:52.940
You could speculate that some
other creature came into the

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:56.500
ecological niche that the cod
occupied, and now the cod

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.240
can't get going again.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.490
But that is the exception.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:05.000
It's like what I was talking
about, tunas

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.020
and swordfish, earlier.

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:09.900
Please don't be misled by the
exceptions to the rules.

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:11.790
Happily, this is an
exception, because

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:13.330
it's a nightmare story.

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:14.444
AUDIENCE: Was this an
exception because

00:34:14.444 --> 00:34:16.025
they waited too long?

00:34:16.025 --> 00:34:18.210
ANDY SHARPLESS: Nobody really
knows why it's an exception.

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:19.900
It could be that they
waited too long.

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:23.020
But if you look at these other
examples that I held up here,

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.409
some of them are badly
mismanaged over the course of

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:30.320
20, 30 years and, yet, they
were able to recover.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:35.270
It's probably that there was
some other phenomenon that

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:37.699
people don't fully understand,
like I said, that something

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:40.350
moved in there and was
able to take root.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:45.040
It's also possible that the
heavy trawling in that area,

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.210
bottom trawling, had a really
serious effect.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:50.910
Nobody really knows, because
it is a unusual

00:34:50.910 --> 00:34:52.755
counterexample.

00:34:52.755 --> 00:34:54.400
AUDIENCE: So in your discussion
here, you're

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.730
talking about trying to feed
the global population.

00:34:56.730 --> 00:35:00.530
And you talk a lot about fish.

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:04.170
Is there a role for things like
algae and kelp and things

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:07.120
like that in your vision of
feeding the global population

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:07.820
over the next century?

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:10.990
ANDY SHARPLESS: Short
answer would be yes.

00:35:10.990 --> 00:35:13.940
But the long answer is, I don't
know a lot about that.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:20.890
I mean, from what little I know,
I think that they can be

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:24.970
sustainably and usefully, you
know, managed in a way that's

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:28.630
sensible and doesn't create
huge problems.

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:30.260
You may know more about
that than I do.

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:35.500
But we have to learn to like to
eat algae, which I expect

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:36.740
would be a difficult
challenge.

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:40.555
I don't know about kelp.

00:35:40.555 --> 00:35:42.560
So, short answer is yes.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:43.600
I would be an optimist
on that.

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.330
But that's not based on an
informed study of it.

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:50.050
So the question is-- just
for the microphone--

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:52.340
can I talk more about what
people should be eating and

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:53.940
changes that are
required there?

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:58.030
So you anticipated the answer.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:00.650
Eat lower down on the food
chain where you can, so

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:02.660
smaller species fish,
anchovies,

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:04.490
sardines would be great.

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:07.020
I talked about farmed mussels,
oysters, clams.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:10.330
Eat all those you can.

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:14.490
Don't eat big predator
fish, if you want a

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:17.710
simple rule of thumb.

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.920
If you really have an appetite
for information, you can use

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.100
these food guides.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:23.780
And the Monterey Aquarium and
the Blue Ocean Institute have

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.130
food guides which are
quite helpful.

00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:29.170
There's applications you can
get for your remote device

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:32.370
that'll tell you, in the grocery
store, what to choose.

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:33.760
Many people don't have
the patience or

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.620
the time to do that.

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:35.990
But if you're one of them,
more power to you.

00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:38.350
That's a good thing to do.

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:40.520
Part of the idea of "The Perfect
Protein" was to give

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.610
people these simple rules that
they could kind of apply in a

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:45.280
busy life, like eat small
fish, eat wild fish, eat

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.330
farmed shellfish if you can.

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:48.800
Don't eat shrimp.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:57.780
We have 21 recipes in the book
that show you how to prepare

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:01.260
something you might not
think would be tasty.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:06.290
And I encourage you to try them
and learn, I hope, that

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:07.740
you like these things that
you might not have

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:08.240
thought you'd like.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.540
Sardines might be an
example of that.

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.160
Most people might not think
a sardine would be

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.410
tasty, but it can be.

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:19.120
When I was on this show--

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:22.050
I mentioned "CBS
This Morning"--

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:26.470
Eric Ripert, the famous chef of
Le Bernardin, which is one

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:29.065
of the most prestigious French
restaurants in the country,

00:37:29.065 --> 00:37:30.230
Manhattan, was on with me.

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:33.300
He has a recipe in the book.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:38.400
And he was the poissonnier at
the Tour D'Argent, maybe the

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.080
most famous French restaurant
in the world, in Paris.

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.330
He knows a hell of
a lot about fish.

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:48.730
And I said to him, Eric, I
cooked your recipe on Friday

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:50.060
night, which I had done.

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:52.890
I had gotten the clams and
andouille sausage recipe out

00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:54.970
of it, which is also
served today.

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:57.040
And I prepared it at home,
much to my wife's and my

00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:59.960
daughters' amazement, because
I'm really not very much of a

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.490
cooking kind of guy.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:04.220
And except for the fact that I
hadn't really scrubbed the

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.220
clams to get all of the sand
out, it was quite good.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:13.970
So the last thing on this point
is we live at a moment

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:17.720
in time when there's a lot
of foodieism abroad.

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.970
Chefs have become kind
of heroes of the day.

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:22.760
They are celebrities
on television.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.950
People are interested
in food preparation.

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:29.030
The is an ongoing incentive in
that world for marketing

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:32.170
innovation, for bringing to
people tastes that they

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:36.900
haven't had before, things
to eat that they

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.120
haven't tried before.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:42.460
And so, I think we have the wind
at our back in terms of

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.320
encouraging people to eat lower
down on the food chain.

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:48.470
Because the food industry
likes to innovate.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:50.600
So, when we come to them and
say, try out some of these

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.230
unusual creatures that
are listed in the

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:54.530
book, they say, great.

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:56.880
And so we have 21 famous
chefs, each offering a

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:00.450
different recipe for things
that you might not have

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:01.853
thought would taste good.

00:39:01.853 --> 00:39:05.430
AUDIENCE: This is sort of a
personal challenge that I feel

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:07.500
might get reflected globally.

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.500
So, I'll tell my friends, hey,
bluefin tuna, you should

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:12.990
really not be eating that,
you know, running

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:14.920
out, endangered, etc.

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.920
And their response is, yeah, so
it's all going to be gone.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.390
We better eat it while it's
still here, right?

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:26.115
And I hear rumors about
overfished quotas, in, say,

00:39:26.115 --> 00:39:30.510
Asia, where you have fishermen
stockpiling so that they can

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:33.930
sell it when it's not available,
literally, anymore.

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:35.250
How do we deal with that?

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:38.900
ANDY SHARPLESS: The problem of
the Atlantic bluefin tuna is a

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:41.680
counterexample to everything
I've said here.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.230
It's a top predator fish.

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:46.450
It has the misjudgment to swim
across national boundaries all

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:47.580
of the time.

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:50.880
Maybe we could teach it, you
know, to, like, live its life

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.535
inside national territory.

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:57.670
It is a high-value fish.

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:01.420
And financial incentives to go
catch it and sell it, as you

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:03.650
mentioned in your question,
are huge.

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:07.410
Individual, high-quality
specimens can sell for the

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:13.450
cost of a house, not a house
in Palo Alto, but a house

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:15.160
somewhere else.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.930
They are very vulnerable.

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:22.650
They are in a tough spot.

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:28.500
And I'm worried about them.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:36.360
But I don't want the exception,
which they are--

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:40.940
on a basis of the oceans by
weight, the oceans as a source

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:44.160
of animal protein by weight--
they are an exception to the

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.350
general rule.

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:48.580
And so the problems that we see
with Atlantic bluefin tuna

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.780
management and overfishing do
not apply to most species.

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:56.520
And so, be optimistic about
so many other species.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.760
Meanwhile, if you want to help
on Atlantic bluefin tuna,

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:05.690
there is an international
committee that has all of the

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:10.960
weaknesses that you suspect it
would have, called ICCAT--

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.270
the acronym, which sets
the quotas for

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:16.040
Atlantic bluefin catches--

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:16.616
the International Commission
for the Conservation of

00:41:16.616 --> 00:41:17.866
Atlantic Tuna.

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:23.190
The United States is a member of
that body, along with about

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:24.890
more than 20 other countries.

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:27.020
And they tend to do
a terrible job.

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.960
They tend to have lowest common
denominator outcomes

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.260
that they don't vigorously
enforce.

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.660
And they have allowed this
fishery to be badly managed.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:42.270
And the Atlantic is at about
a 15% of an unfished ocean

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:45.550
number in terms of population
of Atlantic bluefin.

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:47.680
So they're at a dangerous
point.

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.690
I hope they come back.

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:51.560
We, like many other conservation
groups, press the

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.540
governments who are on ICCAT
to lower quotas, to allow

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:56.900
rebuilding.

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.770
If you're a responsible
person, you should be

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:02.720
contacting your government and
getting them to do that.

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:03.650
And I hope they will.

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:09.280
But that's a creature
in a tough spot.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:12.230
Jennifer is suggesting that the
US could ban imports of

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:15.300
Atlantic bluefin tuna
as a contribution.

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:21.680
There might be trade, WTO,
implications to that decision

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:22.800
that would get the
United States in

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.580
trouble with the WTO.

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:23.900
I don't know.

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:24.820
There would be complexity
there.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:25.716
AUDIENCE: We'd picket.

00:42:25.716 --> 00:42:26.966
ANDY SHARPLESS: Yeah.

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:35.100
Since that's a globally-eaten
commodity, that might not be

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:38.330
enough, even that, because the
quota that we didn't take

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:40.590
would go somewhere else.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:42.150
Thank you very much for
your attention.

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.785
I hope this was interesting.

00:42:42.785 --> 00:42:46.340
And I hope you'll buy my book,
our book, promote it.

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:48.950
We would like lots of people
to get the message.

00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:52.240
And I hope you'll enjoy some
of the recipes in the back.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.420
Thanks very much.

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:56.787
[APPLAUSE]
