00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.100
perhaps this will come up in the Q&amp;A at
the present moment this entire way of

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:03.110
the present moment this entire way of
 

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.840
the present moment this entire way of
thinking about it as a discretionary

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:04.850
thinking about it as a discretionary
 

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.810
thinking about it as a discretionary
matter for local decision-makers seems

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:07.820
matter for local decision-makers seems
 

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.000
matter for local decision-makers seems
to have really fallen away and so that's

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:10.010
to have really fallen away and so that's
 

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:11.680
to have really fallen away and so that's
what interests me is the change in the

what interests me is the change in the
 

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.960
what interests me is the change in the
narrative and in particular I'm going to

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:13.970
narrative and in particular I'm going to
 

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.420
narrative and in particular I'm going to
draw on three sources of illustrations

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:16.430
draw on three sources of illustrations
 

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:20.980
draw on three sources of illustrations

that other speakers will get into this

as well so this is really a very general
 

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:48.500
as well so this is really a very general
and that is we might think about two

and what we see is that the court has
 

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:10.090
and what we see is that the court has
taken very seriously its jurisdiction as

00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:10.100
taken very seriously its jurisdiction as
 

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.620

they what that means so far is unclear
 

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:28.370
they what that means so far is unclear
about what if what it means in terms of

move along obviously there are human
 

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.130

and that's an instance where it could
 

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:51.320

think I take this to be one of the most
 

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.770
think I take this to be one of the most
crucial changes and I also take it to be

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:38.780
crucial changes and I also take it to be
 

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.460
crucial changes and I also take it to be
potentially one of the most dangerous

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:40.470
potentially one of the most dangerous
 

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:44.180
potentially one of the most dangerous
areas for transitional justice to go and

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:44.190
areas for transitional justice to go and

00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:59.120
more going on now I had I had breakfast
this morning with Pablo and he said you

00:25:59.120 --> 00:25:59.130
this morning with Pablo and he said you
 

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:00.260
this morning with Pablo and he said you
know the problem with these people who

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:00.270
know the problem with these people who
 

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.670
know the problem with these people who
talk about amnesties is that they don't

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:01.680
talk about amnesties is that they don't
 

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.490
talk about amnesties is that they don't
separate out amnesties are not amnesties

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:04.500
separate out amnesties are not amnesties
 

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.620
separate out amnesties are not amnesties
are not amnesties so what I've tried to

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:06.630
are not amnesties so what I've tried to
 

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.790
are not amnesties so what I've tried to
do is to really look at this and and

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:08.800
do is to really look at this and and
 

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.140
do is to really look at this and and
it's it's a little bit difficult to see

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:10.150
it's it's a little bit difficult to see
 

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.480
it's it's a little bit difficult to see
where you are but if you look at the

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:12.490
where you are but if you look at the
 

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.920
where you are but if you look at the
second slide you can see that actually

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:15.930
second slide you can see that actually
 

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:19.770
second slide you can see that actually
there are the the trend in terms of the

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:19.780
there are the the trend in terms of the
 

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.510
there are the the trend in terms of the
overall trend in the use of amnesties

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520
overall trend in the use of amnesties
 

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.630
overall trend in the use of amnesties
has actually accelerated that's

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.640
has actually accelerated that's
 

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.490
has actually accelerated that's
increased as has trended every other

00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:26.500

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.640

but limited it limited amnesties are
 

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.200
but limited it limited amnesties are
also increasing so there is something

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:34.210
also increasing so there is something
 

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:35.550
also increasing so there is something
that's changing and that's really quite

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:35.560
that's changing and that's really quite
 

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:38.280
that's changing and that's really quite

what's happening when amnesties are

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:48.820
what's happening when amnesties are
 

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.140
what's happening when amnesties are
embraced by domestic actors and what's

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:52.150
embraced by domestic actors and what's
 

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:55.970
embraced by domestic actors and what's
happening when amnesties are embraced by

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:55.980
happening when amnesties are embraced by
 

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:58.920
happening when amnesties are embraced by
international actors and here I think

00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:58.930
international actors and here I think
 

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:01.980
international actors and here I think
it's actually very significant in

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:01.990
it's actually very significant in
 

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.830
it's actually very significant in
demonstrating what I take to be a trend

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:04.840
demonstrating what I take to be a trend
 

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.560
demonstrating what I take to be a trend

to sustained peace or not so what I've
 

00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:59.909
to sustained peace or not so what I've
done is to look at the role of trials

00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919
done is to look at the role of trials

five years out and what the purple shows
 

00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:15.539
five years out and what the purple shows
you are the cases in which if you if you

you are the cases in which if you if you
 

00:28:15.549 --> 00:28:18.539
you are the cases in which if you if you
only look at the blue bars those are the

00:28:18.539 --> 00:28:18.549
only look at the blue bars those are the
 

00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:20.850
only look at the blue bars those are the
cases in which piece holds or piece

two years of conflict beings being
 

00:28:32.409 --> 00:28:35.669
two years of conflict beings being
settled and so what we can see is that

00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679
settled and so what we can see is that
 

00:28:35.679 --> 00:28:37.440

if you if you look at that first bar on
the Left trials were peace holds for a

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960
the Left trials were peace holds for a
 

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:43.200
the Left trials were peace holds for a
minimum of five years the total number

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:43.210
minimum of five years the total number
 

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:46.500
minimum of five years the total number
of positive cases is twenty eight but it

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:46.510
of positive cases is twenty eight but it
 

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:48.889
of positive cases is twenty eight but it
reduces to eleven when you talk about

00:28:48.889 --> 00:28:48.899
reduces to eleven when you talk about
 

00:28:48.899 --> 00:28:51.899
reduces to eleven when you talk about
cases where trials were only eleven

00:28:51.899 --> 00:28:51.909
cases where trials were only eleven
 

00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:55.200
cases where trials were only eleven
cases was peace was only sustained in

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:55.210
cases was peace was only sustained in
 

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:58.409
cases was peace was only sustained in
eleven cases when you look at the timing

00:28:58.409 --> 00:28:58.419
eleven cases when you look at the timing
 

00:28:58.419 --> 00:29:01.680
eleven cases when you look at the timing
so in other words the delaying justice

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:01.690
so in other words the delaying justice
 

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:04.830
so in other words the delaying justice
leads to a much higher correlation with

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:04.840
leads to a much higher correlation with
 

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.950
leads to a much higher correlation with
sustained peace and that's really what

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:07.960
sustained peace and that's really what
 

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.990
sustained peace and that's really what

want to show you one more slide which is
 

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:26.129

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:03.750
for the opposition the worst state of
 

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:06.050
for the opposition the worst state of
events is the dictator doesn't step down

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:06.060
events is the dictator doesn't step down
 

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:09.680

and the author time rule continues the
 

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:11.780
and the author time rule continues the
second best would be the dictator step

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:11.790
second best would be the dictator step
 

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:13.730
second best would be the dictator step
down and who not punished with

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:13.740
down and who not punished with
 

00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:15.620
down and who not punished with
transitional justice but the best

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:15.630
transitional justice but the best
 

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:17.480
transitional justice but the best
outcome for the opposition and that's

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:17.490
outcome for the opposition and that's
 

00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:19.640
outcome for the opposition and that's
represented with the number two is if

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:19.650
represented with the number two is if
 

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:21.290

transitional justice after he stepped
down so what happens in this game it's a

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:27.930
down so what happens in this game it's a
 

00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:30.140
down so what happens in this game it's a
very simple way for solving it because

00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:30.150
very simple way for solving it because
 

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:33.140
very simple way for solving it because
we just start from the end and ask

00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:33.150
we just start from the end and ask
 

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:34.670
we just start from the end and ask
ourselves what would the opposition do

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:34.680
ourselves what would the opposition do
 

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:36.230
ourselves what would the opposition do

their agreement or to renege on it and
 

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:40.670
their agreement or to renege on it and
clearly since it's better off reneging

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:40.680
clearly since it's better off reneging
 

00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:42.800

anticipate that if he steps down he's
 

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:51.950
anticipate that if he steps down he's
going to suffer transitional justice so

00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960
going to suffer transitional justice so
 

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.100

anticipating that they will be punished
 

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:04.700
anticipating that they will be punished
with transitional justice so the

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:04.710
with transitional justice so the
 

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.410

we have found together is that autocrat
 

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:10.040
we have found together is that autocrat
should never step down and we should

should never step down and we should
never observe peaceful transitions this

00:41:27.049 --> 00:41:30.160
because if the opposition had a lot of
collaborators it would suffer after the

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:30.170
collaborators it would suffer after the
 

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:31.930
collaborators it would suffer after the
the electrical consequences of having

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:31.940
the electrical consequences of having

the electrical consequences of having
its skeletons and it's positive sposed

its skeletons and it's positive sposed
so we can actually model the effect of

00:41:38.589 --> 00:41:38.599
so we can actually model the effect of
 

00:41:38.599 --> 00:41:40.930
so we can actually model the effect of
this uncertainty of the opposition about

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:40.940
this uncertainty of the opposition about
 

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:44.380
this uncertainty of the opposition about
the extent of its infiltration by in by

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:44.390
the extent of its infiltration by in by
 

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:46.510

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.490
including one parameter in the payoffs
of our former simple transitional

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:48.500
of our former simple transitional
 

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.250
of our former simple transitional
justice day in this model we would

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:51.260
justice day in this model we would
 

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.829
justice day in this model we would
include an additional parameter I for

00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839
include an additional parameter I for
 

00:41:53.839 --> 00:41:56.380
include an additional parameter I for
infiltration that can take up a value

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:56.390
infiltration that can take up a value
 

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:58.630
infiltration that can take up a value
between zero and one and that determines

00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640
between zero and one and that determines
 

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.130
between zero and one and that determines
whether implementing transitional

whether implementing transitional
 

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:03.309
whether implementing transitional
justice after the transition hurts the

justice after the transition hurts the
 

00:42:03.319 --> 00:42:05.160
justice after the transition hurts the
Communists or the opposition

Communists or the opposition
 

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:06.839
Communists or the opposition
so while all the other relationships

00:42:06.839 --> 00:42:06.849
so while all the other relationships
 

00:42:06.849 --> 00:42:09.599
so while all the other relationships
between the payoffs remain the same the

00:42:09.599 --> 00:42:09.609
between the payoffs remain the same the
 

00:42:09.609 --> 00:42:11.220
between the payoffs remain the same the
players still prefer transition without

players still prefer transition without
 

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:13.789
players still prefer transition without
transitional justice to the status quo

whether or not transitional justice is
 

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:18.779
whether or not transitional justice is
desirable depends on the value of this

00:42:18.779 --> 00:42:18.789
desirable depends on the value of this
 

00:42:18.789 --> 00:42:21.599
desirable depends on the value of this
infiltration parameter so if the

infiltration parameter so if the
 

00:42:21.609 --> 00:42:22.950

opposition has a lot of corrupt

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960
opposition has a lot of corrupt
 

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.870
opposition has a lot of corrupt
collaborators among its ranks it will

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880
collaborators among its ranks it will
 

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.210
collaborators among its ranks it will
prefer to honor their commitment but if

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:27.220
prefer to honor their commitment but if
 

00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:29.309
prefer to honor their commitment but if
it's clean then it will prefer to renege

00:42:29.309 --> 00:42:29.319
it's clean then it will prefer to renege
 

00:42:29.319 --> 00:42:31.620
it's clean then it will prefer to renege
the problems of the Opposition for its

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:31.630
the problems of the Opposition for its
 

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:33.809
the problems of the Opposition for its
calculus is that it does not know its

00:42:33.809 --> 00:42:33.819
calculus is that it does not know its
 

00:42:33.819 --> 00:42:36.809

infiltration the Communists however do

00:42:36.809 --> 00:42:36.819
infiltration the Communists however do
 

00:42:36.819 --> 00:42:39.329
infiltration the Communists however do
and this makes sense because the secret

00:42:39.329 --> 00:42:39.339
and this makes sense because the secret
 

00:42:39.339 --> 00:42:40.799
and this makes sense because the secret
police was working for the Communists

00:42:40.799 --> 00:42:40.809
police was working for the Communists
 

00:42:40.809 --> 00:42:42.870
police was working for the Communists
and not for the opposition so in this

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880
and not for the opposition so in this
 

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.359
and not for the opposition so in this
game called the signaling game the

game called the signaling game the
 

00:42:45.369 --> 00:42:47.759

communists act as the sender after
 

00:42:47.769 --> 00:42:49.799
communists act as the sender after
learning how infiltrated the Opposition

important finding from solving it is
that there exists an equilibrium called

that we had focused on up to that moment

that we had focused on up to that moment
were internal armed conflicts and the

01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160
were internal armed conflicts and the
 

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:26.540
were internal armed conflicts and the

general understanding at that time has
 

01:05:26.550 --> 01:05:28.910

changed today but the general
 

01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:31.790
changed today but the general
understanding then was that the concept

01:05:31.790 --> 01:05:31.800
understanding then was that the concept
 

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.500
understanding then was that the concept
of war crimes only applied to

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:33.510
of war crimes only applied to
 

01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:36.260

States there was Serbia Croatia and
Bosnia Herzegovina we thought the

01:05:49.790 --> 01:05:49.800
Bosnia Herzegovina we thought the
 

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:52.910
Bosnia Herzegovina we thought the
concept of war crimes did apply to that

01:05:52.910 --> 01:05:52.920

that the International nature of the the
armed conflict and therefore that was

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:01.890

01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280
conference at Bard College in 1998 when
 

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.670
conference at Bard College in 1998 when
you talk quite a lot about the deterrent

01:29:55.670 --> 01:29:55.680
you talk quite a lot about the deterrent
 

01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:58.490
you talk quite a lot about the deterrent
effect that the ICTY had had from Bosnia

01:29:58.490 --> 01:29:58.500
effect that the ICTY had had from Bosnia
 

01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:01.250
effect that the ICTY had had from Bosnia

01:30:01.250 --> 01:30:01.260
to Kosovo you know it did you know that
 

01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:05.090
to Kosovo you know it did you know that
wasn't one of our goals but what an

01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:05.100
wasn't one of our goals but what an
 

01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:08.720
wasn't one of our goals but what an
impact happened if you looked closely at

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:08.730
impact happened if you looked closely at
 

01:30:08.730 --> 01:30:12.030
impact happened if you looked closely at
the crimes that were committed in Kosovo

01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:12.040
the crimes that were committed in Kosovo
 

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:13.950
the crimes that were committed in Kosovo
they were essentially not the crimes

01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:13.960
they were essentially not the crimes
 

01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:15.810
they were essentially not the crimes
that were the subjects of the

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:15.820
that were the subjects of the
 

01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:18.060
that were the subjects of the
indictments for what had taken place in

01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:18.070
indictments for what had taken place in
 

01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:21.000
indictments for what had taken place in
Bosnia and Croatia they were they were

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:21.010
Bosnia and Croatia they were they were
 

01:30:21.010 --> 01:30:23.040
Bosnia and Croatia they were they were
different kinds of crimes there was no

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:23.050
different kinds of crimes there was no
 

01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:26.420
different kinds of crimes there was no
counterpart to the siege of Sarajevo

01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:26.430
counterpart to the siege of Sarajevo
 

01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:30.420
counterpart to the siege of Sarajevo
there were no camps in the the Kosovo

01:30:30.420 --> 01:30:30.430
there were no camps in the the Kosovo
 

01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:33.810
there were no camps in the the Kosovo
situation they weren't there wasn't

01:30:33.810 --> 01:30:33.820
situation they weren't there wasn't
 

01:30:33.820 --> 01:30:35.970
situation they weren't there wasn't
anything like the the Schreber needs a

01:30:35.970 --> 01:30:35.980
anything like the the Schreber needs a
 

01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:38.870
anything like the the Schreber needs a
massacre there were some small-scale

01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880
massacre there were some small-scale
 

01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:42.570
massacre there were some small-scale
massacres that took place in Kosovo and

01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:42.580
massacres that took place in Kosovo and
 

01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:46.050
massacres that took place in Kosovo and
my view of those massacres had been that

01:30:46.050 --> 01:30:46.060
my view of those massacres had been that
 

01:30:46.060 --> 01:30:49.200
my view of those massacres had been that
they weren't necessarily centrally

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:49.210
they weren't necessarily centrally
 

01:30:49.210 --> 01:30:52.140
they weren't necessarily centrally
directed they were instances in which

01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:52.150
directed they were instances in which
 

01:30:52.150 --> 01:30:58.320
directed they were instances in which
the KLA had ambushed Serbian troops and

01:30:58.320 --> 01:30:58.330
the KLA had ambushed Serbian troops and
 

01:30:58.330 --> 01:31:02.820
the KLA had ambushed Serbian troops and
then a local commander thought that the

01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:02.830
then a local commander thought that the
 

01:31:02.830 --> 01:31:05.820
then a local commander thought that the
the KLA who were involved came from a

01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:05.830
the KLA who were involved came from a
 

01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:08.340
the KLA who were involved came from a
particular village and committed a

01:31:08.340 --> 01:31:08.350
particular village and committed a
 

01:31:08.350 --> 01:31:11.460
particular village and committed a
massacre a small-scale massacre at that

01:31:11.460 --> 01:31:11.470
massacre a small-scale massacre at that
 

01:31:11.470 --> 01:31:14.310
massacre a small-scale massacre at that
village rather than a sort of centrally

01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320
village rather than a sort of centrally
 

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:20.150
village rather than a sort of centrally
directed effort and so I think in fact

01:31:20.150 --> 01:31:20.160
directed effort and so I think in fact
 

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:23.730
directed effort and so I think in fact
you know even though terrible horrendous

01:31:23.730 --> 01:31:23.740
you know even though terrible horrendous
 

01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:26.820
you know even though terrible horrendous
things happened in Kosovo maybe ten

01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:26.830
things happened in Kosovo maybe ten
 

01:31:26.830 --> 01:31:30.600
things happened in Kosovo maybe ten
thousand people were killed in in Kosovo

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:30.610
thousand people were killed in in Kosovo
 

01:31:30.610 --> 01:31:34.530
thousand people were killed in in Kosovo
the actual crimes committed were not the

01:31:34.530 --> 01:31:34.540
the actual crimes committed were not the
 

01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:37.860
the actual crimes committed were not the
crimes that had become the subjects of

01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:37.870
crimes that had become the subjects of
 

01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:41.040
crimes that had become the subjects of
indictments in Bosnia and Croatia they

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:41.050
indictments in Bosnia and Croatia they
 

01:31:41.050 --> 01:31:43.830
indictments in Bosnia and Croatia they
were different and there was in fact a

01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:43.840
were different and there was in fact a
 

01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:47.400
were different and there was in fact a
deterrent impact but that wasn't what we

01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:47.410
deterrent impact but that wasn't what we
 

01:31:47.410 --> 01:31:51.840
deterrent impact but that wasn't what we
imagined when we we called for the

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:51.850
imagined when we we called for the
 

01:31:51.850 --> 01:31:54.570
imagined when we we called for the
creation of the International Criminal

01:31:54.570 --> 01:31:54.580
creation of the International Criminal
 

01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:57.240
creation of the International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia we

01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:57.250
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia we
 

01:31:57.250 --> 01:31:59.190
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia we
didn't think we didn't know that it

01:31:59.190 --> 01:31:59.200
didn't think we didn't know that it
 

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:09.030
didn't think we didn't know that it
could get to that point and I just a

01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040
could get to that point and I just a
 

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:11.160
could get to that point and I just a
great discussion so my question is sort

01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:11.170
great discussion so my question is sort
 

01:32:11.170 --> 01:32:14.240
great discussion so my question is sort
of a a reaction and then really a

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:14.250
of a a reaction and then really a
 

01:32:14.250 --> 01:32:17.310
of a a reaction and then really a
thought question for all of you or

01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:17.320
thought question for all of you or
 

01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:18.790
thought question for all of you or
anyone who wants to answer

01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:18.800
anyone who wants to answer
 

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:21.370
anyone who wants to answer
and my question is is really sort of you

01:32:21.370 --> 01:32:21.380
and my question is is really sort of you
 

01:32:21.380 --> 01:32:23.350
and my question is is really sort of you
so Rudy you know you started us off

01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:23.360
so Rudy you know you started us off
 

01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:26.910
so Rudy you know you started us off
talking about the normative developments

01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:26.920
talking about the normative developments
 

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:29.580
talking about the normative developments
legal normative developments around

01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:29.590
legal normative developments around
 

01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:32.050
legal normative developments around
transitional justice and how we and how

01:32:32.050 --> 01:32:32.060
transitional justice and how we and how
 

01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:34.450
transitional justice and how we and how
courts are thinking about that and I

01:32:34.450 --> 01:32:34.460
courts are thinking about that and I
 

01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:35.860
courts are thinking about that and I
thought it was a nice actually that are

01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:35.870
thought it was a nice actually that are
 

01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:37.570
thought it was a nice actually that are
you've had a nice book end to that which

01:32:37.570 --> 01:32:37.580
you've had a nice book end to that which
 

01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:40.210
you've had a nice book end to that which
is bringing us back to law as law and

01:32:40.210 --> 01:32:40.220
is bringing us back to law as law and
 

01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:42.520
is bringing us back to law as law and
law as justice and calling for justice

01:32:42.520 --> 01:32:42.530
law as justice and calling for justice
 

01:32:42.530 --> 01:32:45.610
law as justice and calling for justice
sometimes is is all that it's about and

01:32:45.610 --> 01:32:45.620
sometimes is is all that it's about and
 

01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:47.710
sometimes is is all that it's about and
that's all that I thought you give a

01:32:47.710 --> 01:32:47.720
that's all that I thought you give a
 

01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:49.510
that's all that I thought you give a
very strong justification for why

01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520
very strong justification for why
 

01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:51.580
very strong justification for why
sometimes as all it needs to be about

01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:51.590
sometimes as all it needs to be about
 

01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:53.560
sometimes as all it needs to be about
and and isn't that enough and I thought

01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:53.570
and and isn't that enough and I thought
 

01:32:53.570 --> 01:32:56.560
and and isn't that enough and I thought
Leslie that that your slides and and I

01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:56.570
Leslie that that your slides and and I
 

01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:58.270
Leslie that that your slides and and I
saw your discomfort and talking about

01:32:58.270 --> 01:32:58.280
saw your discomfort and talking about
 

01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:00.100
saw your discomfort and talking about
the numbers but knowing that you had to

01:33:00.100 --> 01:33:00.110
the numbers but knowing that you had to
 

01:33:00.110 --> 01:33:03.300
the numbers but knowing that you had to
talk about the numbers and the impact

01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:03.310
talk about the numbers and the impact
 

01:33:03.310 --> 01:33:06.160
talk about the numbers and the impact
ties in I think to the this larger

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:06.170
ties in I think to the this larger
 

01:33:06.170 --> 01:33:09.460
ties in I think to the this larger
debate when we think about that the

01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:09.470
debate when we think about that the
 

01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:12.010
debate when we think about that the
politics and we talk about the politics

01:33:12.010 --> 01:33:12.020
politics and we talk about the politics
 

01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:13.840
politics and we talk about the politics
of transitional justice then what is it

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:13.850
of transitional justice then what is it
 

01:33:13.850 --> 01:33:15.580
of transitional justice then what is it
that we were actually trying to measure

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:15.590
that we were actually trying to measure
 

01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:18.760
that we were actually trying to measure
which goes back to the goals so so my

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:18.770
which goes back to the goals so so my
 

01:33:18.770 --> 01:33:20.620
which goes back to the goals so so my
question really is how should we be

01:33:20.620 --> 01:33:20.630
question really is how should we be
 

01:33:20.630 --> 01:33:23.110
question really is how should we be
thinking about justice in transitions

01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:23.120
thinking about justice in transitions
 

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:26.920
thinking about justice in transitions
and it strikes me that if we want law to

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:26.930
and it strikes me that if we want law to
 

01:33:26.930 --> 01:33:29.650
and it strikes me that if we want law to
act as law and restraining violence and

01:33:29.650 --> 01:33:29.660
act as law and restraining violence and
 

01:33:29.660 --> 01:33:32.830
act as law and restraining violence and
and yet it's we seem to be most

01:33:32.830 --> 01:33:32.840
and yet it's we seem to be most
 

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:34.750
and yet it's we seem to be most
comfortable and maybe its most effective

01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:34.760
comfortable and maybe its most effective
 

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:38.740
comfortable and maybe its most effective
after the transition and that when law

01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:38.750
after the transition and that when law
 

01:33:38.750 --> 01:33:42.820
after the transition and that when law
it becomes a tool of politics during

01:33:42.820 --> 01:33:42.830
it becomes a tool of politics during
 

01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:46.180
it becomes a tool of politics during
conflict and trying to whether law

01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:46.190
conflict and trying to whether law
 

01:33:46.190 --> 01:33:48.850
conflict and trying to whether law
becomes a bargaining chip to negotiate a

01:33:48.850 --> 01:33:48.860
becomes a bargaining chip to negotiate a
 

01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:51.310
becomes a bargaining chip to negotiate a
transition that's what it felt like the

01:33:51.310 --> 01:33:51.320
transition that's what it felt like the
 

01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:52.990
transition that's what it felt like the
panelists were very uncomfortable about

01:33:52.990 --> 01:33:53.000
panelists were very uncomfortable about
 

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
panelists were very uncomfortable about
law acting as law because in fact it

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:55.010
law acting as law because in fact it
 

01:33:55.010 --> 01:33:59.260
law acting as law because in fact it
wasn't it was a proxy for politics so my

01:33:59.260 --> 01:33:59.270
wasn't it was a proxy for politics so my
 

01:33:59.270 --> 01:34:02.530
wasn't it was a proxy for politics so my
question is is really it's part of the

01:34:02.530 --> 01:34:02.540
question is is really it's part of the
 

01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:05.440
question is is really it's part of the
problem that we're using these we're

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:05.450
problem that we're using these we're
 

01:34:05.450 --> 01:34:07.720
problem that we're using these we're
using a lot of both act as law and we're

01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:07.730
using a lot of both act as law and we're
 

01:34:07.730 --> 01:34:09.970
using a lot of both act as law and we're
using law to act as politics and we need

01:34:09.970 --> 01:34:09.980
using law to act as politics and we need
 

01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:12.310
using law to act as politics and we need
to be thinking more concretely about the

01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320
to be thinking more concretely about the
 

01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:15.850
to be thinking more concretely about the
phases in which were actually want law

01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:15.860
phases in which were actually want law
 

01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:17.920
phases in which were actually want law
to act as law and the phases in which

01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:17.930
to act as law and the phases in which
 

01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:20.020
to act as law and the phases in which
we're using law to act as politics and

01:34:20.020 --> 01:34:20.030
we're using law to act as politics and

if that's true would just invite your

01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:22.190
if that's true would just invite your
 

01:34:22.190 --> 01:34:24.400
if that's true would just invite your
reflections about what that means for

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:24.410
reflections about what that means for
 

01:34:24.410 --> 01:34:26.350
reflections about what that means for
the research and the questions we should

01:34:26.350 --> 01:34:26.360
the research and the questions we should
 

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:29.620
the research and the questions we should
we should be asking that scholars should

01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:29.630
we should be asking that scholars should
 

01:34:29.630 --> 01:34:31.230
we should be asking that scholars should

of of conflict and I think today's

01:34:40.299 --> 01:34:40.309
of of conflict and I think today's
 

01:34:40.309 --> 01:34:43.330

responsibilities about guilt and
 

01:35:18.739 --> 01:35:22.509
responsibilities about guilt and
innocence then I don't understand why

01:35:22.509 --> 01:35:22.519
innocence then I don't understand why
 

01:35:22.519 --> 01:35:24.759
innocence then I don't understand why
logically it's necessary to pursue that

01:35:24.759 --> 01:35:24.769
logically it's necessary to pursue that
 

01:35:24.769 --> 01:35:28.020

if it's about something else then we're

01:35:30.669 --> 01:35:30.679
if it's about something else then we're
 

01:35:30.679 --> 01:35:32.709
if it's about something else then we're
in a very different game and what I was

01:35:32.709 --> 01:35:32.719
in a very different game and what I was
 

01:35:32.719 --> 01:35:34.359
in a very different game and what I was
trying to show is that if it's about

01:35:34.359 --> 01:35:34.369
trying to show is that if it's about
 

01:35:34.369 --> 01:35:37.240
trying to show is that if it's about
something else it's not working very

01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:37.250
something else it's not working very
 

01:35:37.250 --> 01:35:42.069
something else it's not working very
well right so all all the evidence and

01:35:42.069 --> 01:35:42.079
well right so all all the evidence and
 

01:35:42.079 --> 01:35:44.229
well right so all all the evidence and
all the argued and arguments suggests to

01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:44.239
all the argued and arguments suggests to
 

01:35:44.239 --> 01:35:46.810
all the argued and arguments suggests to
me that it's it's the wrong domain to be

01:35:46.810 --> 01:35:46.820
me that it's it's the wrong domain to be
 

01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:49.689
me that it's it's the wrong domain to be
and so I'm very you know I think that's

01:35:49.689 --> 01:35:49.699
and so I'm very you know I think that's
 

01:35:49.699 --> 01:35:51.160
and so I'm very you know I think that's
in a sense an answer to your question I

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:51.170
in a sense an answer to your question I
 

01:35:51.170 --> 01:35:57.009
in a sense an answer to your question I
hope yeah I guess where I come in on

01:35:57.009 --> 01:35:57.019
hope yeah I guess where I come in on
 

01:35:57.019 --> 01:35:59.529
hope yeah I guess where I come in on
this is that I just picking up on what

so and I don't distinguish as crisply

01:36:15.490 --> 01:36:15.500
so and I don't distinguish as crisply
 

01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:17.589
so and I don't distinguish as crisply
between what happened in Latin America

01:36:17.589 --> 01:36:17.599
between what happened in Latin America
 

01:36:17.599 --> 01:36:19.060
between what happened in Latin America
and Eastern Europe and partly because of

geopolitical support of certain groups
 

01:36:23.539 --> 01:36:25.660
geopolitical support of certain groups
that were in opposition to what was

01:36:25.660 --> 01:36:25.670
that were in opposition to what was
 

01:36:25.670 --> 01:36:26.649
that were in opposition to what was
called communist

01:36:26.649 --> 01:36:26.659

America and and certain other groups

America and and certain other groups
 

01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:36.050
America and and certain other groups
that were doing the same in South Africa

01:36:36.050 --> 01:36:36.060
that were doing the same in South Africa
 

01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:38.330
that were doing the same in South Africa
and I don't see it as a kind of a

01:36:38.330 --> 01:36:38.340
and I don't see it as a kind of a
 

01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:40.310
and I don't see it as a kind of a
messianic moment that brought all of

01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320
messianic moment that brought all of
 

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:42.320
messianic moment that brought all of
those transitions to come to light but

01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:42.330
those transitions to come to light but
 

01:36:42.330 --> 01:36:44.020
those transitions to come to light but
rather really serious geopolitical

01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:44.030
rather really serious geopolitical
 

01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:45.890
rather really serious geopolitical
changes that happen and then the

01:36:45.890 --> 01:36:45.900
changes that happen and then the
 

01:36:45.900 --> 01:36:47.540
changes that happen and then the
question becomes what to do in the

01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:47.550
question becomes what to do in the
 

01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:50.030
question becomes what to do in the
periphery right who's the we that

01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:50.040
periphery right who's the we that
 

01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:51.500
periphery right who's the we that
decides that there's going to be a

01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:51.510
decides that there's going to be a
 

01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:54.110
decides that there's going to be a
tribunal in one place and illustration

01:36:54.110 --> 01:36:54.120
tribunal in one place and illustration
 

01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:55.610
tribunal in one place and illustration
another so I'm very interested in the

01:36:55.610 --> 01:36:55.620
another so I'm very interested in the
 

01:36:55.620 --> 01:36:58.550
another so I'm very interested in the
discourse that's used in in the panel

01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560
discourse that's used in in the panel
 

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:01.850

and by by scholars and journalists and
 

01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:04.910
and by by scholars and journalists and
and those in the region now one thing

01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920
and those in the region now one thing
 

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:06.290
and those in the region now one thing
that was interesting is that I think

01:37:06.290 --> 01:37:06.300
that was interesting is that I think
 

01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:08.629
that was interesting is that I think
everyone on the panel agreed even though

01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639
everyone on the panel agreed even though

transitional justice is the

01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000
transitional justice is the
 

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.390
transitional justice is the
globalization of it the advent of NGOs

01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400
globalization of it the advent of NGOs
 

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:34.280
globalization of it the advent of NGOs
and other actors that are busy

01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:34.290
and other actors that are busy
 

01:37:34.290 --> 01:37:36.290

mobilizing for different institutions

01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:36.300
mobilizing for different institutions
 

01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:37.820
mobilizing for different institutions
and using a certain language and that

01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:37.830
and using a certain language and that
 

01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:41.750
and using a certain language and that
shift from a political language to the

01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760
shift from a political language to the
 

01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.610
shift from a political language to the
language of war crimes and the law of

language of war crimes and the law of
 

01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:46.129
language of war crimes and the law of
war you know you know it creates a

01:37:46.129 --> 01:37:46.139
war you know you know it creates a
 

01:37:46.139 --> 01:37:47.899
war you know you know it creates a
different space it's a different you

01:37:47.899 --> 01:37:47.909
different space it's a different you
 

01:37:47.909 --> 01:37:49.490
different space it's a different you
know when it relates to the use of

01:37:49.490 --> 01:37:49.500
know when it relates to the use of
 

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:51.320
know when it relates to the use of
transitional justice now when there

01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:51.330
transitional justice now when there
 

01:37:51.330 --> 01:37:53.180
transitional justice now when there
isn't an end right where the piece

01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:53.190
isn't an end right where the piece
 

01:37:53.190 --> 01:37:55.100
isn't an end right where the piece
hasn't arrived and it's in the midst of

01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:55.110
hasn't arrived and it's in the midst of
 

01:37:55.110 --> 01:37:56.959
hasn't arrived and it's in the midst of
conflict so what we're seeing is that I

01:37:56.959 --> 01:37:56.969
conflict so what we're seeing is that I
 

01:37:56.969 --> 01:37:58.700
conflict so what we're seeing is that I
think this really affects the kind of

01:37:58.700 --> 01:37:58.710
think this really affects the kind of
 

01:37:58.710 --> 01:38:01.010
think this really affects the kind of
empirical and normative work because

01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:01.020
empirical and normative work because
 

01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:02.510
empirical and normative work because
there are a lot of different values and

01:38:02.510 --> 01:38:02.520
there are a lot of different values and
 

01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:04.370
there are a lot of different values and
goals on the table right I mean there

it's very difficult to foretell how

01:40:56.050 --> 01:40:56.060
it's very difficult to foretell how
 

01:40:56.060 --> 01:41:02.020
it's very difficult to foretell how
these things were will evolve in in the

these things were will evolve in in the

the Egypt case I'm very skeptical that

01:41:09.810 --> 01:41:09.820
the Egypt case I'm very skeptical that
 

01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:14.290
the Egypt case I'm very skeptical that
Mubarak is worried about the the

01:41:14.290 --> 01:41:14.300
Mubarak is worried about the the
 

01:41:14.300 --> 01:41:18.250
Mubarak is worried about the the
possibility of being put on trial

01:41:18.250 --> 01:41:18.260
possibility of being put on trial
 

01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:22.770

Mubarak before he was president of Egypt

Mubarak before he was president of Egypt
before he was vice president under Sadat

01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:27.290
before he was vice president under Sadat
 

01:41:27.290 --> 01:41:31.270
before he was vice president under Sadat
was the commander of the air force in

01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.280
was the commander of the air force in
 

01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:37.200
was the commander of the air force in
Egypt he has retained his strong

01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:37.210
Egypt he has retained his strong
 

01:41:37.210 --> 01:41:41.729
Egypt he has retained his strong
military connections whatever regime

01:41:41.729 --> 01:41:41.739
military connections whatever regime
 

01:41:41.739 --> 01:41:46.960
military connections whatever regime
comes into being in Egypt the military

01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:46.970
comes into being in Egypt the military
 

01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:54.660
comes into being in Egypt the military
is going to be a decisive force in Egypt

01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:54.670
is going to be a decisive force in Egypt
 

01:41:54.670 --> 01:41:58.660
is going to be a decisive force in Egypt
when he appointed Suleiman as his vice

01:41:58.660 --> 01:41:58.670
when he appointed Suleiman as his vice
 

01:41:58.670 --> 01:42:01.900
when he appointed Suleiman as his vice
president it seemed to me that he was

01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:01.910
president it seemed to me that he was
 

01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:05.080
president it seemed to me that he was
signaling to the military that his son

01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:05.090
signaling to the military that his son
 

01:42:05.090 --> 01:42:07.810
signaling to the military that his son
was no longer in the picture and that he

01:42:07.810 --> 01:42:07.820
was no longer in the picture and that he
 

01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:14.070
was no longer in the picture and that he
was going to a leader of the military as

01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080
was going to a leader of the military as
 

01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:20.470
was going to a leader of the military as
the the person who he wanted as his

01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:20.480
the the person who he wanted as his
 

01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:23.560
the the person who he wanted as his
successor and so it's it's extremely

01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:23.570
successor and so it's it's extremely
 

01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:25.810
successor and so it's it's extremely
difficult for me to imagine that

01:42:25.810 --> 01:42:25.820
difficult for me to imagine that
 

01:42:25.820 --> 01:42:31.840
difficult for me to imagine that
whatever might take place in Egypt

01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:31.850
whatever might take place in Egypt
 

01:42:31.850 --> 01:42:36.250
whatever might take place in Egypt
that there will be a trial that might

01:42:36.250 --> 01:42:36.260
that there will be a trial that might
 

01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:40.120
that there will be a trial that might
involve Mubarak whether there could be a

01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:40.130
involve Mubarak whether there could be a
 

01:42:40.130 --> 01:42:43.270
involve Mubarak whether there could be a
truth commission is a different question

01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:43.280
truth commission is a different question
 

01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:45.660
truth commission is a different question
I also think it's a different question

01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:45.670
I also think it's a different question
 

01:42:45.670 --> 01:42:48.100
I also think it's a different question
as to whether there might be some

01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:48.110
as to whether there might be some
 

01:42:48.110 --> 01:42:50.200
as to whether there might be some
prosecutions depending on how things

01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:50.210
prosecutions depending on how things
 

01:42:50.210 --> 01:42:53.920

to to beat up and in some cases kill the
the demonstrators in Tahrir Square so I

the demonstrators in Tahrir Square so I
 

01:43:03.260 --> 01:43:06.669
the demonstrators in Tahrir Square so I
can imagine something like that in Egypt

01:43:06.669 --> 01:43:06.679
can imagine something like that in Egypt
 

01:43:06.679 --> 01:43:10.870
