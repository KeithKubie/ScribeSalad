00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.594
Right now, the best estimate
of when the Big Bang occurred--

00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:08.010
and once again, I don't like
the term that much because it

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.255
kind of implies some
type of explosion.

00:00:10.255 --> 00:00:12.130
But what it really is
is kind of an expansion

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.540
of space, when space
started to really start

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.420
to expand from a singularity.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.400
But our best estimate
of when this occurred

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.320
is 13.7 billion years ago.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.672
And even though we're used
to dealing with numbers

00:00:26.672 --> 00:00:28.130
in the billions,
especially when we

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.540
talk about large amounts
of money and what not,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.750
this is an unbelievable
amount of time.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.580
It seems like something that is
tractable, but it really isn't.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.830
And in future
videos, I'm actually

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.420
going to talk about
the time scale.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.340
So we can really
appreciate how long,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.170
or even start to
appreciate, or appreciate

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.820
that we can't appreciate how
long 13.7 billion years is.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.510
And I also want to emphasize
that this is the current best

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.010
estimate.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.760
Even in my lifetime, even in
my lifetime that I actually

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.230
knew about the Big Bang and
that I would pay attention

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.360
to what the best estimate
was, this number's

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.260
been moving around.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.320
So I suspect that in
the future, this number

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.989
might become more accurate
or might move around some.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.350
But this is our best guess.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.850
Now with that said, I want to
think about what this tells us

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.740
about the size of the
observable universe.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.320
So if all of the expansion
started 13.7 billion years ago,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.870
that 13.7 billion
years ago, everything

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.320
we know in our
three-dimensional universe

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.270
was in a single
point, the longest

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.340
that any photon of light could
be traveling that's reaching us

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.720
right now-- so let's say that
that is my eye right over here.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.800
That's my eyelashes, just like
that-- so some photon of light

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.890
is just to getting to
my eye or maybe it's

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.840
just getting to the
lens of a telescope.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.800
The longest that that
could have been traveling

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.490
is 13.7 billion years.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:07.320
So it could be traveling
13.7 billion years.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.389
So when we looked
at that depiction--

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.250
this I think was two
or three videos ago,

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.930
of the observable universe--
I drew, it was this circle.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.966
And when we see light coming
from these remote objects--

00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:23.590
that light is getting
to us right here.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.850
This is where we are.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.510
This is where I guess
in the depiction

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.800
the remote object was.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.840
But the light from
that remote object

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.930
is just now getting to us.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.970
And that light took 13.7
billion years to get to us.

00:02:43.887 --> 00:02:45.470
Now, what I'm going
to hesitate to do,

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.720
because we're talking
over such large distances

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.890
and we're talking on such large
time scales and time scales

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.010
over which space
itself is expanding--

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.180
we're going to see in this video
that you cannot say that this

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.990
object over here, this is
not necessarily, this is NOT,

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:13.720
I'll put it in caps, this is NOT
13.7 billion light years away.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.990
If we were talking about
smaller time scales

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.270
or I guess smaller
distances, you

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.060
could say approximately that.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.784
The expansion of the universe
itself would not make as much

00:03:23.784 --> 00:03:24.450
of a difference.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.870
And let me make it
even more clear.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.720
I'm talking about an
object over there.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.055
But we could even talk about
that coordinate in space.

00:03:33.055 --> 00:03:35.430
And actually, I should say
that coordinate in space-time,

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.950
because we're viewing it at
a certain instant as well.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.270
But that coordinate is not
13.7 billion light years away

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.740
from our current coordinate.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.520
And there's a couple of
reasons to think about it.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.186
First of all, think
about it, that light

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:51.760
was emitted 13.7
billion years ago.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.840
When that light was
emitted, we were

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.750
much closer to that coordinate.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.637
This coordinate was
much closer to that.

00:03:57.637 --> 00:03:59.220
Where we are in the
universe right now

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.960
was much closer to that
point in the universe.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.110
The other thing
to think about is

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.060
as this-- let me
actually draw it.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:16.170
So let's go 300,000 years
after that initial expansion

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.079
of that singularity.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.300
So we're just 300,000 years
into the universe's history

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.890
right now.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:30.370
So this is roughly 300,000
years into the universe's life.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.660
I guess we could
view it that way.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.400
And first of all, at that point
things haven't differentiated

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.130
in a meaningful
way yet right now.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.860
And we'll talk more
about this when

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.580
we talk about the cosmic
microwave background radiation.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.650
But at this point
in the universe,

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.900
it was kind of this almost
uniform white-hot plasma

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.400
of hydrogen.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.983
And then we're going
to talk about it.

00:04:51.983 --> 00:04:53.869
It was emitting
microwave radiation.

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:55.910
And we'll talk more about
that in a future video.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.090
But let's just think about two
points in this early universe.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.597
So in this early universe,
let's say you have that point.

00:05:03.597 --> 00:05:05.930
And let's say you have the
coordinate where we are right

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:06.890
now.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.214
You have the coordinate
where we are right now.

00:05:10.214 --> 00:05:12.630
And in fact, I'll just make
that roughly-- I won't make it

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.340
the center just because I
think it makes it easier

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.950
to visualize if
it's not the center.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.080
And let's say at that very
early stage in the universe,

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.090
if you were able to just take
some rulers instantaneously

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.820
and measure that, you
would measure this distance

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:36.150
to be 30 million light years.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.050
And let's just say
right at that point,

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.140
this object over here--
I'll do it in magenta--

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.070
this object over here
emits a photon, maybe

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.787
in the microwave
frequency range.

00:05:45.787 --> 00:05:48.370
And we'll see that that was the
range that it was emitting in.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.216
But it emits a photon.

00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:52.340
And that photon is traveling
at the speed of light.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.182
It is light.

00:05:53.182 --> 00:05:55.140
And so that photon, says,
you know what, I only

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.990
got 30 million light
years to travel.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.790
That's not too bad.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.647
I'm going to get there
in 30 million years.

00:06:00.647 --> 00:06:01.980
And I'm going to do it discrete.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.380
The math is more complicated
than what I'm doing here.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.796
But I really just
want to give you

00:06:05.796 --> 00:06:07.320
the idea of what's
going on here.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.840
So let's just say,
well, that photon

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.870
says in about 10 million years,
in roughly 10 million years,

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.080
I should be right about
at that coordinate.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.960
I should be about one
third of the distance.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.080
But what happens over the course
of those 10 million years?

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.080
Well, over the course of
those 10 million years,

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.240
the universe has expanded some.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.730
The universe has expanded
maybe a good deal.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.690
So let me draw the
expanded universe.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.919
So after 10 million years, the
universe might look like this.

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:42.710
Actually it might even
be bigger than that.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.760
Let me draw it like this.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.570
After 10 million
years, the universe

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.510
might have expanded a good bit.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.470
So this is 10 million
years into the future.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.200
Still on a cosmological time
scale, still almost at kind

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.370
of the infancy of the
universe because we're

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.360
talking about 13.7
billion years.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.310
So let's say 10 million years.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.510
10 million years go by.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.100
The universe has expanded.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:10.980
This coordinate, where
we're sitting today

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.350
at the present time, is
now all the way over here.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:19.350
That coordinate where the
photon was originally emitted

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:24.302
is now going to be
sitting right over here.

00:07:24.302 --> 00:07:26.760
And that photon, it said, OK,
after 10 million light years,

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.100
I'm going to get over there.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.300
And I'm approximating.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.800
I'm doing it in a
very discrete way.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.890
But I really just want
to give you the idea.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.280
So that coordinate,
where the photon roughly

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.340
gets in 10 million light years,
is about right over here.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.760
The whole universe has expanded.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.860
All the coordinates have gotten
further away from each other.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.180
Now, what just happened here?

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.420
The universe has expanded.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.240
This distance that was 30
million light years now--

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.000
and I'm just making
rough numbers here.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.640
I don't know the
actual numbers here.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.690
Now, it is actually--
this is really just

00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:01.130
for the sake of giving you the
idea of why-- well, giving you

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.100
the intuition of
what's going on.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:08.180
This distance now is no
longer 30 million light years.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.240
Maybe it's 100 million.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:16.167
So this is now 100 million light
years away from each other.

00:08:16.167 --> 00:08:17.250
The universe is expanding.

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:20.909
These coordinates, the space
is actually spreading out.

00:08:20.909 --> 00:08:22.700
You could imagine it's
kind of a trampoline

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.866
or the surface of a balloon.

00:08:23.866 --> 00:08:25.490
It's getting stretched thin.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.640
And so this coordinate
where the light happens

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.940
to be after 10
million years, it has

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.179
been traveling for
10 million years,

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:33.824
but it's gone a much
larger distance.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:40.440
That distance now might
be on the order of-- maybe

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.510
it's on the order of
30 million light years.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.100
And the math isn't exact here.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.620
I haven't done the
math to figure it out.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.360
So it's done 30
million light years.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.900
And actually I shouldn't even
make it the same proportion.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.592
Because the distance it's gone
and the distance it has to go,

00:08:56.592 --> 00:08:58.050
because of the
stretching, it's not

00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.714
going to be completely linear.

00:08:59.714 --> 00:09:02.380
At least when I'm thinking about
it in my head, it shouldn't be,

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:02.960
I think.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.340
But I'm going to make a
hard statement about that.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:10.500
But the distance that it
reversed, maybe this distance

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.790
right here is now 20
million light years

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:16.920
because it got there.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.960
Every time it moved some
distance, the space that it

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.020
had traversed is now stretched.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:27.660
So even though its traveled
for 10 million years,

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.640
the space that it
traversed is no longer

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.360
just 10 million light years.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.130
It's now stretched to
20 million light years.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.890
And the space that it
has left to traverse

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:38.570
is no longer only 20
million light years.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.420
It might now be 80
million light years.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.410
It is now 80
million light years.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:47.060
And so this photon might
be getting frustrated.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.880
There's an optimistic
way of viewing it.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.670
It is like, wow, I
was able to cover

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.387
20 million light years
in only 10 million years.

00:09:53.387 --> 00:09:55.720
It looks like I'm moving
faster than the speed of light.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.270
The reality is it's not
because the space coordinates

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.610
themselves are spreading out.

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:01.630
Those are getting thin.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.496
So the photon is just moving
at the speed of light.

00:10:04.496 --> 00:10:05.870
But the distance
that it actually

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:10.090
traversed in 10 million
years is more than 10 million

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:10.590
light years.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.090
It's 20 million light years.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.480
So you can't just
multiply a rate times time

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.090
on these cosmological scales,
especially when the coordinates

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:23.100
themselves, the distance
coordinates are actually

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.690
moving away from each other.

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.430
But I think you see,
or maybe you might see,

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.520
where this is going.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.150
OK, this photon says, oh, in
another-- let me write this.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.430
This is 80 million light
years-- in another 40 million

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:40.190
light years, maybe I'm
going to get over here.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.110
But the reality is over that
next 40 million light years--

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:47.440
sorry, in 40 million years,
I might get right over here,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.650
because this is 80
million light years.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.420
But the reality is
after 40 million years--

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.030
so another 40 million years
go by-- now, all of a sudden,

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:59.750
the universe has
expanded even more.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.710
I won't even draw
the whole bubble.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.680
But the place where the
photon was emitted from

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.630
might be over here.

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.850
And now our current
position is over here.

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:18.250
Where the light got after 10
million years is now over here.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:24.070
And now, where the light
is after 40 million years,

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:27.500
maybe it's over here.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.520
So now this distance,
the distance

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.240
between these two
points, when we started,

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.590
it was 10 million light years.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:36.380
Then it became 20
million light years.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.100
Maybe now, it's on the order
of-- I don't know-- maybe it's

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.140
a billion light years.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.240
Maybe now it's a
billion light years.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.512
And maybe this distance
over here-- and I'm

00:11:45.512 --> 00:11:46.720
just making up these numbers.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.450
In fact, that's probably be too
big for that point-- maybe this

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.010
is now 100 million light years.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:55.390
This is now 100
million light years.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:59.050
And now, maybe
this distance right

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.730
here is-- I don't know--
500 million light years.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.080
And maybe now the total
distance between the two points

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.950
is a billion light years.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.730
So as you can see, the photon
might getting frustrated.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:10.230
As it covers more
and more distance,

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.200
it looks back and says, wow,
in only 50 million years,

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.020
I've been able to cover
600 million light years.

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:16.910
That's pretty good.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:18.701
But it's frustrated
because what it thought

00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:22.510
was it only had to cover
30 million light years

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.050
in distance.

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:25.070
That keeps stretching
out because space

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:26.560
itself is stretching.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:32.190
So the reality, just going
to the original idea,

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:36.050
this photon that is
just reaching us,

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.870
that's been traveling
for-- let's say

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.690
it's been traveling
for 13.4 billion years.

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.180
So it's reaching us is just now.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.690
So let me just fast
forward 13.4 billion years

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.620
from this point now to
get to the present day.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:54.842
So if I draw the whole visible
universe right over here,

00:12:54.842 --> 00:12:56.300
this point right
over here is going

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.340
to be-- where it was emitted
from is right over there.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:04.890
We are sitting right over there.

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.640
And actually, let me
make something clear.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.770
If I'm drawing the whole
observable universe,

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.922
the center actually
should be where we are.

00:13:10.922 --> 00:13:12.630
Because we can observe
an equal distance.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:14.640
If things aren't
really strange, we

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.620
can observe an equal
distance in any direction.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.210
So actually maybe we should
put us at the center.

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:21.650
So if this was the entire
observable universe,

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:26.180
and the photon was emitted from
here 13.4 billion years ago--

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.800
so 300,000 years after
that initial Big Bang,

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:35.620
and it's just getting
to us, it is true

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:41.150
that the photon
has been traveling

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:47.050
for 13.7 billion years.

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:50.900
But what's kind of nutty about
it is this object, since we've

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.970
been expanding away from each
other, this object is now,

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:56.180
in our best
estimates, this object

00:13:56.180 --> 00:14:06.420
is going to be about 46 billion
light years away from us.

00:14:08.785 --> 00:14:10.160
And I want to make
it very clear.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.220
This object is now 46 billion
light years away from us.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:16.781
When we just use light to
observe it, it looks like,

00:14:16.781 --> 00:14:18.530
just based on light
years, hey, this light

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:21.280
has been traveling 13.7
billion years to reach us.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.981
That's our only way
of kind with light

00:14:22.981 --> 00:14:24.480
to kind of think
about the distance.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.740
So maybe it's 13.4
or whatever-- I

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:31.340
keep changing the decimal-- but
13.4 billion light years away.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:36.600
But the reality is if you had a
ruler today, light year rulers,

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.570
this space here has
stretched so much

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:41.702
that this is now 46
billion light years.

00:14:41.702 --> 00:14:43.160
And just to give
you a hint of when

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.100
we talk about the cosmic
microwave background

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.959
radiation, what will
this point in space

00:14:47.959 --> 00:14:49.500
look like, this
thing that's actually

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.010
46 billion light years
away, but the photon only

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.540
took 13.7 billion
years to reach us?

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.120
What will this look like?

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.610
Well, when we say
look like, it's

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:02.340
based on the photons that
are reaching us right now.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:05.350
Those photons left
13.4 billion years ago.

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:07.090
So those photons are
the photons being

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:10.040
emitted from this
primitive structure,

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:16.460
from this white-hot
haze of hydrogen plasma.

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.240
So what we're going to see
is this white-hot haze.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:26.930
So we're going to see this kind
of white-hot plasma, white hot,

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:28.790
undifferentiated
not differentiated

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:32.550
into proper stable atoms,
much less stars and galaxies,

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:33.710
but white hot.

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.220
We're going to see
this white-hot plasma.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:38.640
The reality today is
that point in space

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.190
that's 46 billion
years from now,

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:45.160
it's probably differentiated
into stable atoms, and stars,

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.780
and planets, and galaxies.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.020
And frankly, if that
person, that person,

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.210
if there is a civilization
there right now

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:52.700
and if they're sitting right
there, and they're observing

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.610
photons being emitted
from our coordinate,

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:56.530
from our point in
space right now,

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:57.920
they're not going to see us.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.810
They're going to see us
13.4 billion years ago.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.140
They're going to see the
super primitive state

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.310
of our region of
space when it really

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:09.164
was just a white-hot plasma.

00:16:09.164 --> 00:16:11.580
And we're going to talk more
about this in the next video.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:12.700
But think about it.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.510
Any photon that's coming
from that period in time,

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:17.670
so from any direction,
that's been traveling

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:21.170
for 13.4 billion years
from any direction,

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.720
it's going to come from
that primitive state

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.390
or it would have been
emitted when the universe was

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:29.580
in that primitive
state, when it was just

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.195
that white-hot plasma,
this undifferentiated mass.

00:16:32.195 --> 00:16:33.570
And hopefully,
that will give you

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.480
a sense of where the
cosmic microwave background

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:38.920
radiation comes from.
