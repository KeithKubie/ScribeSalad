Speaker 1:          00:01          So back to business. We're in a really great position here because we've gone from one dimension to three dimensions to get something real, a real Adam. And if you take that table from last time that we got from the old time mathematicians and plug in according to what you can use together, you get the exact wave function that's a solution to the shredding or equation for the hydrogen atom for, or a hydrogen, any Adam that has only one electron. It can have any nuclear charge you want, right? So it's the real thing. People have shown you pictures, which are some kinds of approximations of this, but you have the equation, the actual formula for the, for the true way function. And no one has a better one than you have. That's the real McCoy. Okay? And you can check these pictures that people have drawn to see if there are realistic grafts or whether or whether they're just some kind of artist's impression or somebody who doesn't know anything's impression.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Maybe he's not even an artist, right? So you can actually do these and they're, they're the, the many of them are very simple functions like to the minus are, right. You could hardly get easier than that. Okay. But you can also draw pictures that look just like what you can see if the electron had a color to it. There are done by ray tracing where the computer pretends it's your eye and sees how much density it would go through if it went through this point or that point or that point along a certain ray from your eye and puts a color here that's proportional to how much electron density and sees it's not the wave function, it's the square of the wave function, the electron density, that adamant of box plots. Okay. So that, that's what it would really look like if you could see it.

Speaker 1:          01:51          And if there weren't problems with wavelength and, and uh, and photons knocking electrons to kingdom come and so on, that's what it would look like right now. But it'll be colored, it'll be colored according to the sign. The wave function has, it's not the way functions to square the way functions. So it would be positive, but it's colored to say the way function in this region would be positive or in this region. Negative. And I'll show it to you in just a second, but first let's, or a few minutes, but first let's describe it. So there's lots of information on the screen that you get with Adam in a box. How many of you have tried it?

Speaker 1:          02:28          Okay, all of you should. Okay. Okay. First you have the Schrodinger equation that always appears and it's sort of silly, but if you need the Schrodinger equation for reference, there it is. Uh, then up at the top is the particular function that's being plotted and it's given as an l and M, right? And also the nickname one s for this particular one, which is one zero zero for an l and m. And then there's the formula that that particular wave function has. And you know what it is, it's a bunch of constants, which we can forget, but it's e to the minus R, right? He's not using row here. Notice he uses actual r and puts in explicitly the Z and the eight zero a and the twos canceled. Okay. And then he says what the energy would be in units of electron volts and electron volts.

Speaker 1:          03:25          23.06 times as big as a kilo calorie, which is what we usually talk in. Uh, now you can, uh, you can look at these pictures and ask a question, some fairly simple questions like, where is the electron density highest? The nucleus is in the center of this picture. Not surprisingly. So this is not a hard question. Where's the electron density highest in the middle, right? No big surprise there. Okay. How do you know you take the wave function, you square it and find out where it has a maximum and eat. The minus distance has a maximum. When the distance is zero, the values one falls off from there. Okay. So the, so you just to find where the density is highest, you just square the wave function and maximize it. Okay. Now, but here's a slightly different question. What is the most likely distance?

Speaker 2:          04:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Can you see why that's a different question than where you might think the most likely distances, wherever the density is highest, but that's not quite true. Do you see why?

Speaker 2:          04:35          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:39          Cause what's most, yeah. No, it doesn't have to do with motion. Yeah. Lucas, there's almost no volume in the center. If you take the dis say say if you talk about a point right then there's no volume at all. Okay. But take a little box and put it in the center or, or actually a sphere of a certain radius, a small radius, you know, 0.01 angst from say and put it in the center. Right. And see how much density is inside. Okay. But then you could look at one OnX drum out and now you're looking at a little spherical shell that's 0.01 angst drums thick. Is everybody clear? Cause that would, so there could be different directions in which you have this electron density, which is at that particular distance from the nucleus. And the further out you go, the more volume this shell has.

Speaker 1:          05:37          It's always the same thickness. But as you move out, there's more stuff in it. You see what I mean? More volume in it. What's it proportional to as you increase our, how does the volume of the shell increase? How does the surface of the sphere increase as you go out? Not No volume is r cubed goes with our square. The surface goes with r squared, right? So you have to multiply that, the probability density by r squared to see at what radius you have the most stuff. Is that clear to everyone? Because you want to count everything that's at that radius, not only in that direction, but also in that direction, that direction, that direction and so on. And the sphere gets bigger as you go out. So you'll notice that what's given in this plot here in the bottom right is r squared times the wave functions squared. Okay? So that'll tell you what's the most likely distance. Okay? So you have to do surface waiting by r squared and it's not zero. It's at the unit that we use to measure distance in a zero, which turns out to be a half an angst from 0.53 [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          06:59          Okay, now here's the two s orbital right now, uh, which they're here. Withdraw two different shells of the same thickness, right? We'll number them one and two and we're gonna ask the question, which one has higher density? Is that, is that light too much for Ya? Cause it, can you see? Can you see it? Well, is it better if I do that or not? Not really. Okay. Okay. Which Shell has higher density? One or two? One clearly. Okay. Now here's a different question. Uh, okay. It's shows one which shell contains more electron density, more stuff. Which one has more probability? It's not obvious because one has higher density, but two is much bigger. Okay. And in fact the, the two has about three times the radius of one. Right? So how much more volume does that Shell have?

Speaker 1:          08:07          About nine times more volume. Not of the sphere, but of the shell. Okay. So it's about nine times the volume. So it turns out that actually two has more stuff and you see that in this plot, right? The red for two is bigger than the, than the, uh, than the green for one, right? So depending on what question you ask, you have to decide whether you have to weight it by r squared to get the answer your need. Okay? Now here's another, uh, way of looking at a wave function. This happens to be, uh, uh, the, uh, it's actually a three d wave function as you see, not from here, but from here, right? It's three d. This is the in three dimensions using that ray tracing the way we talk about, but you can do, if you click slice down here, then you get a slice through it.

Speaker 1:          09:05          Okay? So that's a, you know, a two dimensional, more like the contour plots we've been using. It's just a slice through the three d thing. So this is a two d, uh, not a projection, but an actual slice of it. And with this slider here, you can control where the slice is. It's in the middle there, so it goes through the nucleus. But if you want, you can slide it, slide it down and see what the slice would be if it were in front of the screen that you slice this picture. Everybody got it? So you can look at different levels that way if you want to, or you can pretend you're looking at the whole thing so it can be near or far. Uh, okay. Now let's look at at this, uh, at this, these two different, the two d and the three d pictures, and look at the pattern of nodes, the shape and the energy of the three d orbital.

Speaker 1:          09:56          You see here in the, in the that there are diagonal nodes in this three d orbital. Okay, so that's three d. Let's look at this one. Now we still have those two diagonal nodes. In fact, it turns out that they're, that they're, that it's at the nodes are actually cones. This is a slice through a cone right on the top and on the bottom. Okay? So the nodal surface, bear in mind that in in one dimension, a node is a point in two dimensions and node is align in three dimensions. A node is a surface, right? So we're slicing it and seek an intersection of the, of the conical surface here, but the actual node is a cone. Okay, but is that the only node that you see in that picture on the right? Oh, hi. Angela says she sees a circle too, right? So there are two kinds of nodes in this orbital.

Speaker 1:          10:59          There's both, uh, a conical node, which we had in the previous one. The three d orbital had a conical node. That's what makes it a d orbital having a conical node. But this one also has a spherical node, which is a circle when we slice it. Okay? So this is this higher energy or lower energy than the, than the one we looked at before. How do you know it's higher? Has more nodes? Did you ever see a situation before where you can have two different kinds of nodes? Here you have both a certain this, uh, this section, both the circle and blinds. You ever see anything like that before?

Speaker 1:          11:46          Right. Anyhow, it's higher energy. It's four D, Not Three D as You said. And it's, it's like this, right? You have both circular and diameter nodes, but this is three dimensional. So you have both sphere and cone. So what can you guess what a five d orbital would look like? We looked at a three d orbital. This is a 40 orbital. How about a five Dr Bill Lucas, whatever the third layer of notice, not a third layer of nodes. It would have how many more nodes? One more node. And it would be in the, in the section. That would be another circle. Or actually it's another sphere of a different diameter. Okay, so you'll see how you, you can combine cones in this case or it can be planes too. You have planes for P orbitals. You can combine, uh, uh, spheres with, with planes or cones.

Speaker 1:          12:49          And there you can combine them in different ways to get the same energy. For example, you can have a sphere and a cone that has a certain energy that's a four d the One we're looking at here. Or You could have two sets of, of s, forget the sphere, but have another cone. Does that remind you of anything and get the same energy? Or you can have a plane and a cone, or you could have a sphere and a plane, or are you can have a sphere and a cone. I said that already. Or are you going to have two spheres? Or You could have two planes. All those are two nodes. Does everybody see what I'm saying? And they all have the same energy. Does that remind you of anything? It's not exactly the same, but it should remind you of something.

Speaker 3:          13:49          Okay.

Speaker 1:          13:49          That's what Claude Nissan, I remember you could get different combinations in his case of circles and lines and get the same frequency. Right? So that's why the two s and the two p have the same energy or the three ps. The three P and three d have the same energy. Okay. Uh, now let's talk about scaling the h. Like what do we mean by h? Like it's one electron, any nuclear charge, but one electron. Why incidentally, do we want it to be one electron? Zach, uh, that will turn out to be case, but, but even if that weren't the case, there's a good reason to start with one electron. Yeah. Between, yeah, it's, it's true that we don't want, well, we'll get into big trouble when we get Coulombe interaction between electrons. It's absolutely right, but we want to walk before we try to run right.

Speaker 1:          14:51          Work with three variables, not six variables, which you'd have have two electrons or three n if you had an electron's. Right. So we want simple functions at the beginning. So that's what the h like wave function is just one electron, just three variables, Rho Theta feet or the convenient ones. Okay. But now we want to see how we scale it as we changed the nuclear charge. We already started talking about that last time when we talked about Roe, but we're going to talk both about all, we're going to talk about size also about electron density and also about energy and how the energies of these one electron atoms change as you change the nuclear charge. Okay. We, this is what we talked about last time, that if you make the table up the formulas in row instead of in r, then you could use it for any hydrogen like Adam because the distance scale, uh, gets, gets multiplied by the nuclear charge. That is to say if you have a given row that's a given size of the function we're talking about right given row, then, uh, it, you have that value at shorter are if you have a higher z, right? A tradeoff betweenZ and r. If you double Z, you get the same value at half the are, does that make sense that as you get z bigger, the distance is get smaller? Does that make sense? Why?

Speaker 1:          16:23          Because the elect, the nucleus pulls the electron in more and notice that it's linear, right? If you double the nuclear charge, your shrink by a factor of two in the distance. Okay, so increasing z shrinks, the wave function makes are smaller for the same row. That is the same height of the wave function or the same position in the shape of the wave function. Because you have to renormalize if you shrink the wave function. Okay, so let's compare hydrogen carbon plus six and potassium plus 19 right? So the, the distance scale, we'll go one, one sixth, one 19th. So this is what, this is what it looks like. If a hydrogen atom is that big, this is how big the carbon one electron atom is. And that's how big the potassium one electron is. One 19th as as the linear distance that's in, that's in hydrogen. Now how much does the electron density change? I think that's the next thing. Uh, yeah, scaling electron density with z. You can see that just from what we just talked about, if you shrink the distance by a factor of two, how much do you change? The density factor too is the density. You get twice as high if you make the distance half as long.

Speaker 1:          17:51          Right? It's got to be too cute cause your shrink at this way and this way. And also this way. So it goes up with CSI cubed. The density. That means if you have a hydrogen atom, the electrons are every witch away, right? All over. But if you have even a carbon atom, six times the nuclear charge for the same one s orbital, the density is eight is six cubed as big. What's six cube? 36 45 to over 200. Right? So you have 200 times the electron density for the one s electron in carbon compared to the one s electron in hydrogen. Where does that crop up in experiment that you have such a, so much higher electron density for carbon than you do for hydrogen and other things are even more so like potassium. Where does it crop up? Yeah. Of what, what experiment close what?

Speaker 1:          18:51          You can do it by calculation and you'd see much higher density. That's what we're talking about is theory. But where do you see it experimentally? Lucas? Not Well, you can do it in a difference, but if you look at the total electron density, you don't see hydrogens, you know, unless you look work really hard because the density of electrons, which is what you're seeing is so much higher for other atoms. Okay. So the normalization, uh, it has to be one. So if you shrink it, and that's where that comes in. We talked about that z over a zero to the three halves that gets squared before and uh, so that it's the size squared is proportional disease cubed and the density of the one s electron as you go across these Adams goes from one to two, 16 to 7,000 potassium is 7,000 times higher. Remember that what we saw that in X-ray, what a very dark Adam that was.

Speaker 1:          19:50          Okay. So it helps x-ray's find heavier atoms more easily. Uh, now how about the kinetic energy? Right? So Sai is a function of are right, some kind of function of our, but, but it includes a z. Z times are right because Roe is z. Times are so now how does that influence the derivative, right? If you have a function to z of are the derivative of it is z times the function of z by the derivative of, uh, of uh, let's, yeah, rob La, uh, I got that wrong. No, I, or do I have it right? That's right. Yeah, I got it right. Okay. Now how about the second derivative? It's going to have a z squared in it, right? So the curvature is going to be z squared times what the curvature was before, but the value of the wave function is the same at some saint, the corresponding row.

Speaker 1:          20:55          So what's going to happen to the kinetic energy if you have a bigger nuclear charge, what's going to happen to the kinetic energy at any point and a corresponding points, right? It's going to be proportional disease squared. The curvature divided by the value of the wave function, right? So the kinetic energy is going to really zoom up for a hydrogen like Adam when you get a heavier Adam, right? So what, let's summarize what we did so far. So distance will shrink according dizzy electron density will go up according to CSI cubed, and the kinetic energy will go with z squared. Okay. Now how about the potential energy? How will it change as we, as we changed the nuclear charge? Well, if we change the nuclear charge, cool ohms law includes the nuclear charge, right? So at the same distance, right? You'll have z times that whatever it was for hydrogen, right?

Speaker 1:          21:58          Much, much higher or indeed lower potential energy, more negative, further from zero. Okay. But at a fixed that's, that's so at a fixed distance, the potential energy will be proportional to z, but the distance shrinks, right? So if you look at corresponding positions in the wave function or you look at the average, uh, potential energy, it's going to go, it's going to also be, uh, take into account that, that the distance gets smaller or gets smaller, right? Cause of the thing got shrunk, shrunk, and by a factor of z. So what happens to the average potential energy? How is it scale with z? Maria, you got an idea and a given distance. The energy according to cool ohms law will be multiplied by z cause you've got a bigger nuclear charge, but every distance gets shrunk by a factorZ , right? So if you average everything, what are you going to get? There are two factors of z that are increasing or decreasing, making more favorable that the, the energy, the potential energy, you got that two factors. So what's going to be z squared? Right? So the potential energy, well, what did the kinetic energy go with? Do you remember how the potential energies that the health department, how the kinetic energy scaled z squared, how does the potential energy scale?

Speaker 1:          23:42          How about the average potential energy? If I doubled the nuclear charge, how much lower is the obvious? As I increased the charge, the average energy of electrons is going to get lower, but for two reasons, because the nuclear charge is bigger and because of the electron is twice as close.

Speaker 2:          24:02          Okay.

Speaker 1:          24:03          So how does it scale the potential energy? AverageZ squared? So the kinetic energy scales with z squared, the potential energy scales with z squared. How about the total energy? This is a hard one. Z squared, right? Okay. So the potential energy goes to z squared and the total energy, here's a big surprise. It goes with z squared to, it also happens to be one over n squared, right? So the energy gets,

Speaker 2:          24:35          uh, uh,

Speaker 1:          24:39          yeah. So as you go up in, you get less stable. Right? Now, our turns out to be about 300 kilocalories per mole. If you want to really get what the energies are, and here is a plot of the energies. Here's the the the one s two s or two p three s or three p or three d four s pdf and so on, right? But the distance from zero, the amount of stabilization is proportional to one over n squared. And we saw the same thing if we did in the one dimensional Coolum case, the energy was also one over n

Speaker 2:          25:19          x squared.

Speaker 1:          25:22          Okay? Notice it's independent of l and m three s is the same as three p is the same as three d does that square with what you have learned before? What did you learn before Lexi? Did you learn anything about that before? About the energies of three s three p three d

Speaker 2:          25:48          no. Anybody Chai?

Speaker 1:          25:57          Shy. Yes, as lower is lower than p is lower than d. Now how can both of these things be true that you heard something that was true and I'm telling you they're all the same. Aha. What you heard about was real outcomes, things that have many electrons. I'm telling you about. If the Adam has only one electron, then s and p and d are the same, okay. But it'll be different when you have many electrons and we'll see why shortly. Okay? Cause this is one electron atoms, okay? So we've, this just summarizes size goes with one over z. The electron density is proportional, dizzy cubed and the energy goes with z squared. Whether you're talking potential, kinetic or total energy.

Speaker 2:          26:55          Uh, okay.

Speaker 1:          26:57          And it's also one over n squared.

Speaker 2:          27:02          Uh,

Speaker 1:          27:03          and the size happens to be an over Z as well. Okay? Now here's a really pretty one and to do this, to see this, right, you want to see the real thing. So notice that this is a two p orbital, n l m R two, one, one. Everybody see that? I want to show you the real program that does that. Let me just see if I can get it bigger here. Okay, now what I want for the display, this display is just as if electrons were all white, okay? But we want to call them according to the, to the, uh, color of the, uh, uh, this is complicated. Now I've got to get over here. We want to color them with the phase, you know, plus minus.

Speaker 1:          28:05          That's three d. The phase keeps changing. That has to do with time dependence, which we're not talking about. Okay, now that's, that's a three d orbital. We want to have what we have before we had to pee, right? So I'll make this instead of a three, a two. So there's a two p orbital, uh, particular two p orbital two one zero that term, which one is that? Notice you have a coordinate system next door there. And I can rotate this thing. I can grab it and rotate it. The coordinate system rotates. See that? So I can look at it, end on if I want to or look at it from the side. Which p orbital is that? How do you know points along the z axis? Okay, now let's look up the, at another, another two p orbital because we can make em one instead of zero. So the two one zero is two peasy. Now what's two? One, one.

Speaker 1:          29:09          Let me look at it this way. That's time dependence, right? And that's weird. And physicists love this sort of thing because they deal with Adams in isolation and Adams and isolation have angular momentum, things going around. But Adam's, when they're in molecules, when they're with other Adams or in other things that distort it, like in an electric field, they don't behave that way. So use a different way of doing it, right? It's not that physicists are right and chemists are wrong or the chemists are right and physicists are wrong. It's if you're dealing with isolated Adams or you use one thing. If you're dealing with atoms interacting with other items, you should use something else. And the way you do this, dealing with something else, I'll show you here, you do what's called super position. That is you add two functions in order to get a new function. Okay? And the two functions I'm going to add when I click superposition here are two one, one and the other one I'm going to use is to one minus one

Speaker 1:          30:28          and now what's that? That's the two p orbital. Okay? Does everybody see what I did? So I can combine two of the physicists or bottles to get the chemist to p why orbital Dean Boucher who wrote this as a physicist. So he writes physicists programs, right? But we can trick it to be chemistry by adding two of his together or by subtracting them. And when you subtract them, you have to put an I in imaginary. So I'm not going to do it right now. You can do it yourself. You'll see down here or you can, you can do the phase and so on. The phase of Pi makes it imaginary. I won't do that. Now we'll go back to the, uh, did the PowerPoint. Whoops, what happened here? I need to shrink it back again and now do this.

Speaker 2:          31:23          There we go.

Speaker 1:          31:26          Yeah. Here we are. We're back. They look the same. Okay. Uh, so superposition of that kind when you add two functions together to get a new function for whatever purpose is a kind of what's called hybrid ization. Now there are other kinds of hybrids. Have you heard about hybrid orbitals? Right? What that is is adding two orbitals together to get a new orbital and let's look about when that would be. As we said, this is the physicist to p m equals one with orbital angular momentum and it has complex numbers involved and the chemists to p is that some, okay, now multiplying and adding wave functions. We've already seen a case where you multiply functions. Do you remember where we've seen things be multiplied? Alison, do you remember? No. Multiplied which way functions? Let me tell you one place we already multiplied was squaring away functioned as a kind of multiplication. They get probability, but I want a different one.

Speaker 2:          32:31          The different different variables.

Speaker 1:          32:34          Ah, for separating the variables, r theta and fee. We had an ar function to say to function a fee function and we multiply these pieces together to get the total wave function for the electron, the three dimensional wave functions. So that's one place you multiply. Okay. To get a one electron wave function, which is we call an orbital and orbital is a one electron wave function. That's what an orbital is. Now you can add or, but alls to create a hybrid orbital. That's what we just did. We took, we took a two physicists, orbitals added them together and got a new orbital. Okay. 2:00 PM Two p y plus two peasy is a hybrid orbital and orbitals one electron wave function. What's the function of, what variables do you put in in order to get a value out? How many variables? Sovi three. What are they?

Speaker 1:          33:37          The position of that electron. The one electron, if it's a one electron orbital, you can write the orbital as many pieces here. Two pieces, right? But it still is a function of just the position of one electron. It's not a function of six or 18 or whatever number of variables. It's just, uh, it's just a function of, it's an orbital, a one electron function. So it's a position of one electron that you plug in. Now you can change orientation of orbitals by hybridization. Let's look at that. So here's the two PZ orbital, I've rotated the coordinate system. So Z is horizontal. Okay? And here's the two P why orbital, which we already made by adding two physicist orbitals together. Okay. Now what happens? And notice that two p y surprise as pointed along the y axis to Pz was pointed along the z axis. What if I add the two together?

Speaker 2:          34:37          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          34:38          What if I add two Pz and two p y? Now let's go back and look at two Pz a second. Notice it's red on the left blue on the right. Say positive numbers on the left. Negative numbers on the right, everybody with me because it assigns numbers to different points in space. Positive numbers on the left, negative on the right. Let's say. Now this one assigns positive numbers on the top. Negative numbers on the bottom. Suppose I add together, what am I going to get

Speaker 2:          35:11          Andrew?

Speaker 1:          35:13          Ah, it should. They should reinforce in the top left where they're both positive and in the bottom right where they're both negative, but in the bottom left and the top right, they should cancel. So if we add them together to make a weighted sum it, we don't have to add them 50 50, but we'll start by adding 50 50. Okay. So if we add them, uh, 50, 50 mixture, we'll give that just what you said. Okay. So we changed the orientation of the p orbital by, by adding two, okay. Now suppose we didn't use 50%. Suppose we used another mixture. Suppose we use 75% right? Or there's 50% or 25% okay? So you can get any orientation you want by mixing within that plane though, within the, the, uh, y z plane by adjusting the ratio. Okay. There's two pui. Now, what would happen with a two s orbital? If you put it in an electric field,

Speaker 1:          36:26          you're changing the rules. You're changing the potential because now the electron has a, does, doesn't just, it's energy doesn't depend just on assistance from the nucleus. It also depends on where it is in the field is. So we're changing the definition of, of, uh, of, um, of the potential energy. So it's a different quantum mechanical problem. But I don't want you to think about quantum mechanics. I just want you to think about what would happen if you put an electric field on. What do you think? What would it move? The Adam? No, because the Adam is neutral overall where we'll do a hydrogen atom here. Yeah, Adam's neutral so it won't move. But what will happen? The electrons will move one way and the nucleus will move the other and if you preserve the center of mass right, then the nucleus will hardly move at all. I'm the electrons will do most of the moving. Okay, so you can change the shape by hybridization. We can get something that will work in an electric field. Describe Adam an electric field by mixing the ones without electric field. Now let's look how we do that. We make an s p n hybrid orbital. Have you ever seen that? And as a number, can you give me an example to sp two or three SB three R S P or n is one right or s p zero have you ever seen that?

Speaker 1:          37:52          S P zero is just ass. This is how much p there is in it after you square it. That is, it's a weighted psalm. This thing you're using, you've got different values of a and B and it's weighted, uh, such that, so when you square it, you get a squared fraction of two s squared. That's the distribution. Two s would have a B squared of the way P why would be one squared. But you also get across term to a, B times two s times two p. Okay? Now, so n the number you put in to talk about sp two, sp three and so on is the square of be square over a square. So if you have an hybrid, it means equal parts of of s and p. And if you have sp three, it means three times as much p as s after squaring.

Speaker 1:          38:48          Okay? So it's what fraction you have of of something that looks like two es squared and two p squared. And then there's also that part. Okay, so now let's just look at some examples here. Suppose n is zero, then you have just pure ass. Okay? Now suppose you put an electric field that wants to shift the electrons, it wants to shift. It would push a positive charge to the right, but it will push electrons to the left. Okay, so let's here we went to 0.02 just a tiny amount of p. Let's see how it, here's back to s and there's spo point, 0.02 it shifted the electrons to the left. What if I go to a higher value point? 4.0 4.0 6.0 9.11 point 18.2 5.33 so what I'm doing is turning up a dial to make the electron electric fields stronger and the electron is shifting by changing the hybridisation.

Speaker 1:          39:53          Okay, 0.5 uh, one there's an sp hybrid. Now what will happen if I keep on going make an sp two is for example, what do you think will happen? Guess it'll keep going to the right, wrong. Watch this. There's a, that's the maximum extension is sp. That's the most you can extend. Now watch what happens if I make it bigger. Sp Two sp three sp four sp nine s p 24 pure p, right? Cause both pure s and pure p are symmetrical. The 50 50 mixture is the one that shifts the most of the left.

Speaker 1:          40:44          Okay. Now we're going to close here, uh, with, with trying to go beyond what we've already seen. What we've seen is one electron Adams, right? Hydrogen like Adams. So we find that we can multiply pieces are theta fee to create this one electron wave function, the orbital. And we can furthermore add these things to make hybrids that shift things around in useful ways. We can add orbitals to make an sp hybrid, for example, as what would happen in an electric field, but it's still an orbital. So it allows adjusting to new situations, for example, an electric field while preserving the virtues of real solutions of the nuclear potential. Because you never put on a field as strong as the field felt by the electron near a nucleus. Adding the external field by turning up your dial is just a small change. So you want things to look pretty much like what they looked originally with the nucleus.

Speaker 1:          41:44          Just a little change. And you can do that by hybridization. Okay? The big deal is the nuclear potential at small distances. Now let's try to go to a two electron wave function. Okay, so what is it a function of? What's a two electron wave function going to be? A function of how many variables, right? Six, right? X, Y, Z for one electron and x, Y, Z for the other electron or r theta fee of electron one and r theta fee of electron two and they're on the same nucleus. So you measure the distances from the same point, but they're two different distances. One, two, electron, one another to electron to, they couldn't be the same, but they don't need to be. They can be different. Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:36          Now, wouldn't it be neat? That's the question mark. If we could get that by multiplying two one electron wave functions, because we have one electron wave functions cold, we look in the table and we've got the exact thing. If we could take two of those and multiply them together. So orbital a four electron one times or, but it'll be for electron to remember what these things are. Just numbers. If you put in some value of, of position of electron one and some value of position of electron to this first thing, we'll give you a number. The second thing, we'll give you a number. If you could multiply those two numbers together and get the number for the total way function, that would be really great, right? Cause then you'd know how to do it. The question is, can you do that? Remember, an orbital isn't one electron wave function.

Speaker 1:          43:27          So can we multiply orbitals in order to get a many electron wave function? Okay. If we could, and then of course we would square it to get probability density. Now it would be a different probability. In the first case it was probability of electron B one being here. Now it's the joint probability of electron. One is here and electron too. At the same time is here. That's the probability when you have six variables. Okay. Wouldn't that be great? It's just paradise, right? Because if we had many electrons, we could just multiply all those orbitals together. A certain normal for electron one, another robot of electron to another one for electron three. We know how to write those, multiply them together. We get the thing. Uh, we find the total energy is whatever energy electron one had plus written energy electron to head. That's great. Uh, we find the total electron density.

Speaker 1:          44:24          We know how to find the electron density of each individual electron. So the total electron density should be just the, some of, so if we were interested in the total electron density at this particular point, we'd see what the electron density of electron one is at that point and what the electron density of electron to is at that point. And we'd add them together and that would give the total electron density at that point. So the total electron density is a function of x, y, Z. It's whatever this is evaluated at Xyz plus whatever this plus all the others. Absolutely. Wonderful. Right? And then you could write things. Uh, so the whole is the sum of the parts. Right? And you could write things like this at the top that neon has the configuration, two electrons in one s two electrons in two s two electrons and two px to Bwi and right. Things like that. You've seen things like that. So those are the orbitals in which electrons are to describe the Neon Adam.

Speaker 2:          45:22          Right now,

Speaker 1:          45:25          uh, this is a problem in joint probability, so it's like tossing two coins to try to get two heads. So I don't know if I can do these at the same time, but I have two quarters here. I need your back back in your head. Okay, so I got tails. When did you get how often? Half the time that actually, if I get tails and you get heads, that's a quarter of the time, but a quarter of the time you'll get tails and I'll get heads. So heads tails is half the time. How about heads heads? How often or does I now I'll bet you, I'll bet you that I can get head head half the time actually doing the experiment. You want to take the bet? I would advise against it. Here's what I'm going to do.

Speaker 2:          46:30          Okay,

Speaker 1:          46:34          two tails. I lose

Speaker 1:          46:39          book two tails I lost again. But I think you can see that I've been doing a lot of time. I'm going to win half the time. Why? Why was the rule wrong? Cause they weren't independent, right? If they're independent, the probability of both a and B, that is the probability that a will be here and at the same time be, we'll be here is the product of the probabilities. But that if you do this, that's not true anymore, right? So if you have two electron wave function, you square it to get the joint probability, right? That electron one will be here and electron two will be here at the same time. So is that valid to multiply here I'm multiplying the individual probabilities that electron is at a certain position. Electron B is at another position. Do I get the joint probability that way? Under what conditions do I get the joint probability that way if they're independent.

Speaker 1:          47:39          Now here's the big question. Are they independent? Why not positive, cool ohms law. They repel one another. There's no way they can be independent. They repel one another. So orbitals one electron wave functions to express many electron wave functions cannot be right. Orbitals are a fiction except for one electron problems, right? Hydrogen like Adam's find we've got hydrogen atoms cold. But if you got more than one electron, orbitals won't work. But still we're going to use them. Right? And that's what you're going to find out after the exam. Okay, good. Lockton, uh, so that doesn't work. Good luck on the exam.
