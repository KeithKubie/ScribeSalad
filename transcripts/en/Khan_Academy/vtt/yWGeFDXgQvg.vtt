00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.676
- [Voiceover] Let's say that
we know that the circumference

00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:09.653
of a circle is 49 pi.

00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:12.499
Based on that, let's
see if we can figure out

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:16.313
what the radius of that
same circle is going to be.

00:00:16.313 --> 00:00:17.811
And I encourage you,

00:00:17.811 --> 00:00:18.984
and I'll write equals here.

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:20.586
And I encourage you to pause the video,

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:22.481
and see if you can figure
it out on your own.

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:25.893
Let's just draw the circle
to help visualize it.

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:28.987
I'll just do a hand-drawn circle,

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:32.191
clearly not a perfect
circle right over here.

00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:36.257
We know that if its radius is of length r,

00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:38.624
that the circumference

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:42.450
is going to be two pi times r.

00:00:42.955 --> 00:00:44.690
So, I could write the circumference

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.255
is equal to two pi times r.

00:00:48.597 --> 00:00:50.582
In fact, the number pi,

00:00:52.322 --> 00:00:54.104
the standard definition for it,

00:00:54.104 --> 00:00:58.991
is just the ratio between the
circumference and the diameter

00:00:58.991 --> 00:00:59.925
of a circle.

00:00:59.925 --> 00:01:00.843
Now, why is that?

00:01:00.843 --> 00:01:03.222
Well, if the diameter here

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.641
is two r, right?

00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:08.522
We have r and then have another r.

00:01:08.522 --> 00:01:12.594
We see that the circumference
is pi times two r,

00:01:13.122 --> 00:01:16.187
or we can say that the ratio
between the circumference

00:01:16.187 --> 00:01:17.185
and the diameter,

00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:23.100
which is the ratio between c and two r,

00:01:23.686 --> 00:01:26.513
that's just going to be pi.

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:29.702
Anyway, I've gone on longer than I need to

00:01:29.702 --> 00:01:31.248
just to solve this problem.

00:01:32.054 --> 00:01:34.237
We can go to this original formula here,

00:01:34.237 --> 00:01:36.768
saying the circumference
is two pi times r,

00:01:36.768 --> 00:01:39.974
and we can just substitute in
49 pi for the circumference.

00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:42.755
So, we could say 49 pi

00:01:43.446 --> 00:01:45.948
is going to be equal to
two pi times the radius.

00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:51.084
Now, let's see, we can
divide both sides by two pi

00:01:51.084 --> 00:01:52.669
to solve for r.

00:01:53.418 --> 00:01:55.503
So, dividing both sides by two pi.

00:01:55.503 --> 00:01:57.720
On the right-hand side,
the two pis cancel out.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.075
On the left-hand side, pi
divided by pi cancels out.

00:02:01.075 --> 00:02:05.168
49 divided by two is 24.5.

00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:09.585
So, if the circumference
is 49 pi whatever units,

00:02:09.585 --> 00:02:13.068
then the radius is going to be 24.5

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:14.967
of those units.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.609
Let's do one more of these.

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.212
Let's say that we have a circle

00:02:18.212 --> 00:02:19.930
whose circumference,

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.577
I'll just say C, is equal to 1600 pi.

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:26.410
My question is what is the diameter?

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.280
The diameter of the
circle is equal to what?

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.920
Just as we said that the circumference

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.625
could be written as two pi r

00:02:34.625 --> 00:02:37.249
or as pi times two r,

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:38.781
two r is just the diameter.

00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:41.742
So, we could say that the
circumference is equal to

00:02:41.742 --> 00:02:44.263
pi times the diameter.

00:02:44.651 --> 00:02:47.194
Once again, that comes out of
that traditional definition

00:02:47.194 --> 00:02:49.272
of pi as the ratio
between the circumference

00:02:49.272 --> 00:02:50.038
and the diameter.

00:02:50.038 --> 00:02:52.093
You could say that the ratio
between the circumference

00:02:52.093 --> 00:02:55.134
and the diameter is equal to pi.

00:02:55.134 --> 00:02:58.338
Circles are this very fundamental
thing in the universe,

00:02:58.338 --> 00:02:59.673
and you take the ratio

00:02:59.673 --> 00:03:01.972
of the circumference and the diameter,

00:03:01.972 --> 00:03:04.479
you get this magical and
mystical number that we see

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:06.615
that keeps popping up in mathematics.

00:03:06.615 --> 00:03:08.081
Anyway, back to the problem.

00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:11.267
If we say the circumference is 1600 pi,

00:03:13.077 --> 00:03:15.461
and this is equal to
pi times the diameter,

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:17.727
we can just divide both sides by pi

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.453
to get the diameter,

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:23.312
which is going to be 1600.

00:03:23.312 --> 00:03:25.831
The circumference is 1600 pi units,

00:03:25.831 --> 00:03:27.630
whatever units those are, maybe meters.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.033
Then, the diameter is
just going to be 1600

00:03:30.033 --> 00:03:32.799
of those units, or in
this case, maybe meters.

00:03:33.628 --> 00:03:34.679
And we're all done.
