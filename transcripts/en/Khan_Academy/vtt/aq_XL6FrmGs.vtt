00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.470
Identify all sets of
parallel and perpendicular

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.630
lines in the image below.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.160
So let's start with
the parallel lines.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.850
And just as a
reminder, two lines

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.382
are parallel if they're
in the same plane,

00:00:14.382 --> 00:00:16.590
and all of these lines are
clearly in the same plane.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.006
They're in the
plane of the screen

00:00:18.006 --> 00:00:19.200
you're viewing right now.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.560
But they are two lines that
are in the same plane that

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.400
never intersect.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.240
And one way to verify,
because you can sometimes--

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.000
it looks like two
lines won't intersect,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.633
but you can't just always
assume based on how it looks.

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:32.299
You really have to
have some information

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.900
given in the diagram or
the problem that tells you

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.660
that they are
definitely parallel,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.850
that they're definitely
never going to intersect.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.520
And one of those
pieces of information

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.730
which they give
right over here is

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.680
that they show that
line ST and line

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.229
UV, they both intersect line
CD at the exact same angle,

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:52.270
at this angle right here.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.370
And in particular,
it's at a right angle.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.340
And if you have two lines
that intersect a third line

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.317
at the same angle--
so these are actually

00:01:00.317 --> 00:01:02.400
called corresponding angles
and they're the same--

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.489
if you have two of these
corresponding angles the same,

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.280
then these two
lines are parallel.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.220
So line ST is
parallel to line UV.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.830
And we can write it like this.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.650
Line ST, we put the arrows
on each end of that top bar

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.470
to say that this is a line,
not just a line segment.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.850
Line ST is parallel to line UV.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.830
And I think that's the
only set of parallel lines

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.260
in this diagram.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.760
Yep.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.180
Now let's think about
perpendicular lines.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.810
Perpendicular lines
are lines that

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.830
intersect at a 90-degree angle.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.030
So, for example, line ST is
perpendicular to line CD.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.650
So line ST is
perpendicular to line CD.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.650
And we know that they
intersect at a right angle

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.180
or at a 90-degree angle
because they gave us

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.930
this little box here
which literally means

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.910
that the measure of this
angle is 90 degrees.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:08.490
By the exact same argument, line
the UV is perpendicular to CD.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.710
Let me make sure I
specified these as lines.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.705
Line UV is perpendicular to CD.

00:02:15.705 --> 00:02:19.920
So I did UV, ST, they're
perpendicular to CD.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.739
And then after that, the
only other information

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.280
where they definitely tell us
that two lines are intersecting

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.730
at right angles
are line AB and WX.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:38.900
So AB is definitely
perpendicular to WX, line WX.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.760
And I think we are done.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.930
And one thing to think
about, AB and CD,

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.930
well, they don't even
intersect in this diagram.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.620
So you can't make any
comment about perpendicular,

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.080
but they're definitely
not parallel.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.440
You could even
imagine that it looks

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.840
like they're about to intersect.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.200
And they give us no
information that they intersect

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.930
the same lines at
the same angle.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.485
So if somehow they told us that
this is a right angle, even

00:03:01.485 --> 00:03:03.610
though it doesn't look
anything like a right angle,

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.085
then we would have to
suspend our judgment based

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:07.460
on how it actually
looks and say,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.475
oh, I guess maybe those
things are perpendicular,

00:03:13.475 --> 00:03:15.172
or maybe these two
things are parallel.

00:03:15.172 --> 00:03:16.380
But they didn't tell us that.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.796
And that would
actually be bizarre

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:19.272
because it looks
so not parallel.

00:03:19.272 --> 00:03:20.730
And actually then
this would end up

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.654
being parallel to other things
as well if that was done.

00:03:24.654 --> 00:03:26.320
It's a good thing
that wasn't because it

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.550
would look very strange.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.710
But based on the
information they gave us,

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.610
these are the parallel and
the perpendicular lines.
