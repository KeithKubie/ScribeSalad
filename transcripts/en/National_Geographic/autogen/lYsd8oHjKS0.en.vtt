is a huge density of muscles in that
trunk and it also helps to really

so we'll have to do this very quickly
 

01:41:58.579 --> 01:42:04.069
so we'll have to do this very quickly
one of these and then we're gonna have

01:42:04.069 --> 01:42:04.079
one of these and then we're gonna have
 

01:42:04.079 --> 01:42:06.259
one of these and then we're gonna have
one minute sighting like this and then

01:42:06.259 --> 01:42:06.269
one minute sighting like this and then
 

01:42:06.269 --> 01:42:10.729
one minute sighting like this and then
we're gonna have to go I'm afraid no

the way we have found the giraffes we
 

02:39:14.650 --> 02:39:16.020
the way we have found the giraffes we
just had to make a bit of a loop because

02:39:16.020 --> 02:39:16.030
just had to make a bit of a loop because
 

02:39:16.030 --> 02:39:19.321
just had to make a bit of a loop because
our off road and we couldn't quite see

02:39:19.321 --> 02:39:19.331
our off road and we couldn't quite see
 

02:39:19.331 --> 02:39:23.310
our off road and we couldn't quite see
them in range well obviously we were

02:39:23.310 --> 02:39:23.320
them in range well obviously we were
 

02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:25.291
them in range well obviously we were
using infrared so we just couldn't quite

02:39:25.291 --> 02:39:25.301
using infrared so we just couldn't quite
 

02:39:25.301 --> 02:39:26.911
using infrared so we just couldn't quite
get them so I've come around and we're

02:39:26.911 --> 02:39:26.921
get them so I've come around and we're
 

02:39:26.921 --> 02:39:28.291
get them so I've come around and we're
just coming up to the trees that they

02:39:28.291 --> 02:39:28.301
just coming up to the trees that they
 

02:39:28.301 --> 02:39:29.791
just coming up to the trees that they
were hiding away and that was about ten

02:39:29.791 --> 02:39:29.801
were hiding away and that was about ten
 

02:39:29.801 --> 02:39:31.980
were hiding away and that was about ten
of them but of course we have to stop

02:39:31.980 --> 02:39:31.990
of them but of course we have to stop
 

02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:45.871
of them but of course we have to stop
for this cutie

02:39:45.871 --> 02:39:45.881
 
 

02:39:45.881 --> 02:39:48.961
 
they do kind of resemble a very small

02:39:48.961 --> 02:39:48.971
they do kind of resemble a very small
 

02:39:48.971 --> 02:39:53.730

leopard at time Daniel they do they have

02:39:53.730 --> 02:39:53.740
leopard at time Daniel they do they have
 

02:39:53.740 --> 02:39:56.100
leopard at time Daniel they do they have
very large eyes and there is a reason

02:39:56.100 --> 02:39:56.110
very large eyes and there is a reason
 

02:39:56.110 --> 02:39:58.381
very large eyes and there is a reason
for this they are obviously nocturnal

02:39:58.381 --> 02:39:58.391
for this they are obviously nocturnal
 

02:39:58.391 --> 02:40:00.150
for this they are obviously nocturnal
animals so you will see them more often

02:40:00.150 --> 02:40:00.160
animals so you will see them more often
 

02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:03.451
animals so you will see them more often
out and about at night time and this

02:40:03.451 --> 02:40:03.461
out and about at night time and this
 

02:40:03.461 --> 02:40:05.071
out and about at night time and this
obviously means that they have to be

02:40:05.071 --> 02:40:05.081
obviously means that they have to be
 

02:40:05.081 --> 02:40:07.110
obviously means that they have to be
able to see better at night as well

02:40:07.110 --> 02:40:07.120
able to see better at night as well
 

02:40:07.120 --> 02:40:09.930

think it's much better than ours hey

02:46:30.340 --> 02:46:30.350

this is my foot you're gonna come to my

02:46:32.559 --> 02:46:32.569
this is my foot you're gonna come to my
 

02:46:32.569 --> 02:46:35.500
this is my foot you're gonna come to my
foot again so I think it's far better

02:46:35.500 --> 02:46:35.510
foot again so I think it's far better
 

02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:37.960
foot again so I think it's far better
than ours but like other predators they

02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:37.970
than ours but like other predators they
 

02:46:37.970 --> 02:46:40.960
than ours but like other predators they
see in black and white but I think a lot

02:46:40.960 --> 02:46:40.970
see in black and white but I think a lot
 

02:46:40.970 --> 02:46:42.490
see in black and white but I think a lot
of it is movement that they detect they

02:46:42.490 --> 02:46:42.500
of it is movement that they detect they
 

02:46:42.500 --> 02:46:44.319
of it is movement that they detect they
don't really have the necessary ability

02:46:44.319 --> 02:46:44.329
don't really have the necessary ability
 

02:46:44.329 --> 02:46:46.990
don't really have the necessary ability
for depth perception but I think they

02:46:46.990 --> 02:46:47.000
for depth perception but I think they
 

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.870

they can see in the dark which we can't
so I'd say they've got far better

02:46:53.439 --> 02:46:53.449
so I'd say they've got far better
 

02:46:53.449 --> 02:46:55.960
so I'd say they've got far better
eyesight than we do but they lack the

02:46:55.960 --> 02:46:55.970
eyesight than we do but they lack the
 

02:46:55.970 --> 02:46:57.609
eyesight than we do but they lack the
depth perception that color vision

02:46:57.609 --> 02:46:57.619
depth perception that color vision
 

02:46:57.619 --> 02:47:01.420
depth perception that color vision
