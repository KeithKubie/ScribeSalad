00:00:12.944 --> 00:00:17.451
So, I want to talk to you
about the forgotten middle.

00:00:18.325 --> 00:00:24.116
To me, they are the students,
coworkers and plain old regular folks

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.195
who are often overlooked

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:30.415
because they're seen
as neither exceptional nor problematic.

00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:34.164
They're the kids we think we can ignore

00:00:34.188 --> 00:00:38.847
because their needs for support
don't seem particularly urgent.

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:41.355
They're the coworkers

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.616
who actually keep the engines
of our organizations running,

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.791
but who aren't seen as the innovators
who drive excellence.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.886
In many ways, we overlook
the folks in the middle

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.752
because they don't keep us
up awake at night

00:00:57.776 --> 00:01:00.731
wondering what crazy thing
they're going to come up with next.

00:01:00.755 --> 00:01:01.755
(Laughter)

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:07.701
And the truth is that we've come
to rely on their complacency

00:01:07.725 --> 00:01:10.250
and sense of disconnection

00:01:10.274 --> 00:01:12.677
because it makes our work easier.

00:01:14.077 --> 00:01:17.529
You see, I know a little bit
about the forgotten middle.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:22.899
As a junior high school student,
I hung out in the middle.

00:01:23.848 --> 00:01:26.781
For a long time,
I had been a good student.

00:01:27.315 --> 00:01:30.363
But seventh grade was a game changer.

00:01:31.045 --> 00:01:35.585
I spent my days gossiping, passing notes,

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:38.076
generally goofing off with my friends.

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:44.217
I spent my homework time on the phone,
reviewing each day's events.

00:01:44.932 --> 00:01:51.726
And in many ways, although I was
a typical 12-year-old girl,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.534
my ambivalence about my education
led to pretty average grades.

00:01:59.256 --> 00:02:04.414
Luckily for me, my mother understood
something important,

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:10.505
and that was that my location
was not my destination.

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:16.799
As a former research librarian
and an educator,

00:02:16.823 --> 00:02:21.773
my mother knew that I was capable
of accomplishing a lot more.

00:02:22.424 --> 00:02:24.551
But she also understood

00:02:24.575 --> 00:02:28.035
that because I was a young
black woman in America,

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:31.640
I might not have opportunities
out of the middle

00:02:31.664 --> 00:02:35.066
if she wasn't intentional
about creating them.

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:39.394
So she moved me to a different school.

00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:44.557
She signed me up for leadership
activities in my neighborhood.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.172
And she began to talk to me more seriously

00:02:48.196 --> 00:02:52.664
about college and career options
I could aspire to.

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.562
My mother's formula for getting me
out of the middle was pretty simple.

00:02:59.117 --> 00:03:02.545
She started with high expectations.

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:07.958
She made it her business to figure out
how to set me up for success.

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.482
She held me accountable

00:03:12.506 --> 00:03:18.060
and, along the way,
she convinced me that I had the power

00:03:18.084 --> 00:03:20.878
to create my own story.

00:03:22.355 --> 00:03:27.429
That formula didn't just help me
get out of my seventh grade slump --

00:03:27.453 --> 00:03:30.239
I used it later on in New York City,

00:03:30.263 --> 00:03:33.453
when I was working with kids
who had a lot of potential,

00:03:33.477 --> 00:03:38.284
but not a lot of opportunities
to go to and complete college.

00:03:38.882 --> 00:03:41.636
You see, high-performing students

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.326
tend to have access
to additional resources,

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.133
like summer enrichment activities,

00:03:48.157 --> 00:03:49.680
internships

00:03:49.704 --> 00:03:51.776
and an expansive curriculum

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.809
that takes them out of the classroom
and into the world

00:03:55.833 --> 00:03:59.054
in ways that look great
on college applications.

00:03:59.737 --> 00:04:04.070
But we're not providing
those kinds of opportunities for everyone.

00:04:04.712 --> 00:04:08.117
And the result isn't just
that some kids miss out.

00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:10.807
I think we, as a society, miss out too.

00:04:11.582 --> 00:04:15.655
You see, I've got a crazy theory
about the folks in the middle.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.394
I think there are some unclaimed
winning lottery tickets in the middle.

00:04:22.038 --> 00:04:26.260
I think the cure for cancer
and the path to world peace

00:04:26.284 --> 00:04:28.521
might very well reside there.

00:04:29.378 --> 00:04:31.236
Now, as a former middle school teacher,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.497
I'm not saying that magically everyone
is suddenly going to become an A student.

00:04:37.228 --> 00:04:40.974
But I also believe
that most folks in the middle

00:04:40.998 --> 00:04:43.148
are capable of a lot more.

00:04:43.665 --> 00:04:48.180
And I think people stay in the middle
because that's where we relegated them to

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:51.319
and, sometimes, that's just
where they're kind of chilling

00:04:51.343 --> 00:04:53.490
while they figure things out.

00:04:54.609 --> 00:04:56.522
All of our journeys

00:04:56.546 --> 00:05:02.990
are made up of a series of rest stops,
accelerations, losses and wins.

00:05:03.856 --> 00:05:06.522
We have a responsibility to make sure

00:05:06.546 --> 00:05:13.315
that one's racial, gender, cultural
and socioeconomic identity

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:17.932
is never the reason you didn't have
access out of the middle.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.260
So, just as my mother did with me,

00:05:22.284 --> 00:05:26.307
I began with high expectations
with my young people.

00:05:26.815 --> 00:05:28.871
And I started with a question.

00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:32.998
I stopped asking kids,
"Hey, do you want to go to college?"

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.434
I started asking them,

00:05:35.458 --> 00:05:38.192
"What college would you like to attend?"

00:05:38.855 --> 00:05:40.428
You see, the first question --

00:05:40.452 --> 00:05:45.644
(Applause)

00:05:45.668 --> 00:05:50.183
The first question leaves
a lot of vague possibilities open.

00:05:50.585 --> 00:05:52.426
But the second question

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.161
says something about what I thought
my young people were capable of.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.959
On a basic level,

00:05:58.983 --> 00:06:03.242
it assumes that they're going to
graduate from high school successfully.

00:06:03.715 --> 00:06:05.651
It also assumed

00:06:05.675 --> 00:06:08.921
that they would have
the kinds of academic records

00:06:08.945 --> 00:06:13.016
that could get them college
and university admissions.

00:06:13.707 --> 00:06:17.439
And I'm proud to say
that the high expectations worked.

00:06:18.035 --> 00:06:20.435
While black and Latinx students

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:25.147
nationally tend to graduate from college
in six years or less,

00:06:25.171 --> 00:06:28.212
at a percent of 38,

00:06:28.236 --> 00:06:31.029
we were recognized by the College Board

00:06:31.053 --> 00:06:34.696
for our ability not to just
get kids into college

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.853
but to get them through college.

00:06:37.307 --> 00:06:43.395
(Applause)

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.253
But I also understand
that high expectations are great,

00:06:47.277 --> 00:06:49.237
but it takes a little bit more than that.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.860
You wouldn't ask a pastry chef
to bake a cake without an oven.

00:06:54.244 --> 00:06:58.713
And we should not be asking
the folks in the middle to make the leap

00:06:58.737 --> 00:07:04.918
without providing them with the tools,
strategies and support they deserve

00:07:04.942 --> 00:07:07.100
to make progress in their lives.

00:07:08.368 --> 00:07:12.772
A young woman I had been
mentoring for a long time, Nicole,

00:07:12.796 --> 00:07:14.860
came to my office one day,

00:07:14.884 --> 00:07:20.190
after her guidance counselor
looked at her pretty strong transcript

00:07:20.214 --> 00:07:22.921
and expressed utter shock and amazement

00:07:22.945 --> 00:07:26.222
that she was even interested
in going to college.

00:07:26.952 --> 00:07:31.744
What the guidance counselor didn't know
was that through her community,

00:07:31.768 --> 00:07:35.553
Nicole had had access
to college prep work,

00:07:35.577 --> 00:07:39.461
SAT prep and international
travel programs.

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:43.256
Not only was college in her future,

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.093
but I'm proud to say that Nicole
went on to earn two master's degrees

00:07:48.117 --> 00:07:51.037
after graduating from Purdue University.

00:07:51.061 --> 00:07:57.121
(Applause)

00:07:57.145 --> 00:08:02.208
We also made it our business
to hold our young people accountable,

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:07.712
but also to instill a sense
of accountability in those young people

00:08:07.736 --> 00:08:13.492
to themselves, to each other,
to their families and their communities.

00:08:14.117 --> 00:08:18.212
We doubled down
on asset-based youth development.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.759
We went on leadership retreats

00:08:20.783 --> 00:08:24.545
and did high ropes courses
and low ropes courses

00:08:24.569 --> 00:08:28.677
and tackled life's biggest
questions together.

00:08:29.561 --> 00:08:33.169
The result was that the kids
really bought into the notion

00:08:33.193 --> 00:08:38.021
that they were accountable
for achieving these college degrees.

00:08:38.728 --> 00:08:44.700
It was so gratifying to see the kids
calling each other and texting each other

00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:47.789
to say, "Hey, why are you late
for SAT prep?"

00:08:48.135 --> 00:08:51.722
And, "What are you packing
for the college tour tomorrow?"

00:08:53.019 --> 00:08:57.198
We really worked to kind of make
college the thing to do.

00:08:57.734 --> 00:09:02.319
We began to create programs
on college campuses

00:09:02.343 --> 00:09:07.332
and events that allow young people
to really visualize themselves

00:09:07.356 --> 00:09:10.530
as college students and college graduates.

00:09:11.069 --> 00:09:14.379
Me and my staff
rocked our own college gear

00:09:14.403 --> 00:09:20.495
and had lots of fun, healthy competition
about whose school was better than whose.

00:09:21.355 --> 00:09:23.347
The kids really bought into it,

00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:28.437
and they began to see that something more
was possible for their lives.

00:09:28.871 --> 00:09:33.270
Not only that -- they could look around
at that college-going community

00:09:33.294 --> 00:09:36.270
and see kids who came
from the same backgrounds

00:09:36.294 --> 00:09:37.984
and the same neighborhoods

00:09:38.008 --> 00:09:41.150
and who were aspiring to the same things.

00:09:42.046 --> 00:09:45.617
That sense of belonging was really key,

00:09:45.641 --> 00:09:49.619
and it showed up in a remarkable,
beautiful way one day

00:09:49.643 --> 00:09:54.561
when we were in the Johannesburg airport,
waiting to go through customs

00:09:54.585 --> 00:09:57.494
on our way to Botswana
for a service learning trip.

00:09:58.046 --> 00:10:01.048
I saw a group of kids
kind of huddled in a circle.

00:10:01.752 --> 00:10:04.435
Usually, with teens,
that means something's going on.

00:10:04.459 --> 00:10:06.014
(Laughter)

00:10:06.363 --> 00:10:08.649
So I kind of walked up behind the kids

00:10:08.673 --> 00:10:11.093
to figure out what they were
talking about.

00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:14.546
They were comparing passport stamps.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:15.571
(Laughter)

00:10:15.595 --> 00:10:19.466
And they were dreaming out loud
about all the other countries

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.767
they planned to visit in the future.

00:10:22.728 --> 00:10:27.912
And seeing these young people
from New York City

00:10:27.936 --> 00:10:30.783
go on to not just become college students

00:10:30.807 --> 00:10:34.117
but to participate
in study abroad programs

00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:37.007
and to then take jobs around the world

00:10:37.031 --> 00:10:38.871
was incredibly gratifying.

00:10:39.712 --> 00:10:41.482
When I think of my kids

00:10:41.506 --> 00:10:46.133
and all the doctors, lawyers,
teachers, social workers,

00:10:46.157 --> 00:10:48.212
journalists and artists

00:10:48.236 --> 00:10:52.211
who came from our little nook
in New York City,

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:55.132
I hate to think
of what would have happened

00:10:55.156 --> 00:10:57.556
if we hadn't invested in the middle.

00:10:58.076 --> 00:11:01.779
Just think about all
that their communities and the world

00:11:01.803 --> 00:11:03.470
would have missed out on.

00:11:04.673 --> 00:11:08.944
This formula for the middle
doesn't just work with young people.

00:11:09.724 --> 00:11:12.994
It can transform
our organizations as well.

00:11:13.843 --> 00:11:16.058
We can be more bold

00:11:16.082 --> 00:11:20.819
in coming up and articulating a mission
that inspires everyone.

00:11:21.418 --> 00:11:25.775
We can authentically
invite our colleagues to the table

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:29.100
to come up with a strategy
to meet the mission.

00:11:30.157 --> 00:11:34.386
We can give meaningful feedback
to folks along the way,

00:11:35.141 --> 00:11:38.403
and -- and sometimes most importantly --

00:11:38.427 --> 00:11:43.576
make sure that you're sharing credit
for everyone's contributions.

00:11:45.211 --> 00:11:49.742
What happened when my staff
aimed high for themselves

00:11:49.766 --> 00:11:53.012
is that what they were able
to do for young people

00:11:53.036 --> 00:11:55.155
was pretty transformational.

00:11:55.728 --> 00:12:00.879
And it's been so wonderful to look back
and see all of my former colleagues

00:12:00.903 --> 00:12:03.014
who've gone on to get doctorates

00:12:03.038 --> 00:12:07.116
and assume leadership roles
in other organizations.

00:12:08.585 --> 00:12:14.718
We have what it takes to inspire
and uplift the folks in the middle.

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.506
We can extend love
to the people in the middle.

00:12:20.244 --> 00:12:26.450
We can challenge our own biases
about who deserves a hand-up, and how.

00:12:27.982 --> 00:12:33.136
We can structure our organizations,
communities and institutions

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:38.167
in ways that are inclusive
and that uphold principles of equity.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:45.212
Because, in the final analysis,
what is often mistaken for a period

00:12:45.236 --> 00:12:47.569
is really just a comma.

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:49.521
Thank you.

00:12:49.545 --> 00:12:56.545
(Applause)
