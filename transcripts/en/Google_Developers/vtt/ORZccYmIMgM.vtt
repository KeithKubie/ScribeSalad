JENNY MURPHY: Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.100
Welcome to this session of the
Google+ Platform Office Hours.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.880
Today we're doing something
a little bit different.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.170
Instead of presenting some
content and talking about it,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.750
we're going to focus on the
questions and answer section

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.660
that was normally the second
half of our Hangout.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.375
Because there's a lot of
feedback that the people want

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:21.620
to ask their question.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.040
So we want to devote
more time to that.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.220
So just going to do
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.796
You guys want to--

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:30.480
JONATHAN BERI: Well--

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.905
JENNY MURPHY: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:32.295
JONATHAN BERI: Well,
let's do intros.

00:00:32.295 --> 00:00:33.460
JENNY MURPHY: Oh,
introductions.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.800
Good idea.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.570
JONATHAN BERI: I'll start, since
I already waved my hand.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.275
Jonathan Beri, developer
advocate on Google+ Hangouts.

00:00:39.275 --> 00:00:40.650
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm
Wolff Dobson.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.106
I'm a developer programs
engineer on Hangouts.

00:00:43.106 --> 00:00:44.810
JENNY MURPHY: And I'm
Jenny Murphy.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.410
I'm also a developer program
engineer on Google+ platform.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.450
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: I'm
Allen Firstenberg.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.300
I'm a programmer.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.433
I work [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:58.950
or for a Hangout API.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.955
FRASER CAIN: My name's
Fraser Cain.

00:01:00.955 --> 00:01:03.530
I'm the publisher of Universe
Today, and we've been doing a

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.410
lot of sort of cool,
live broadcasts,

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.910
using Hangouts On Air.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.255
NICK GRACILLA: Well, hi.

00:01:09.255 --> 00:01:10.130
I'm Nick.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.630
This is Sonia.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.240
We're at Neoteric Design.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.340
We do web application design
and development, primarily

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.210
Ruby on Rails.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.650
And we're using Hangouts
for training and for

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:21.702
collaboration.

00:01:21.702 --> 00:01:22.910
JENNY MURPHY: Great.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.880
And, last but not least,
just saw that um--

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.040
Charles, you just joined.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.590
CHARLES JAIMET: I did.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.730
I'm Charles Jaimet.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.700
I'm a developer.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.070
I work for CalmSea Media, which
is my own company, and

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.870
I'm building an app in Hangouts
that allows people to

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.160
play games--

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.800
RPG games-- online.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.550
Dungeons and Dragons-type
games.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.480
NICK GRACILLA: Oh, right.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.292
CHARLES JAIMET: To visualize it,
roll dice, do everything

00:01:48.292 --> 00:01:50.100
in a shared environment
that you would

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.370
normally do around a table.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.420
Fraser, actually, is part
of my little posse.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.010
He's the one who dragged
me into this.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.900
Gave me hours and hours
and hours of extra

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.730
work to do every day.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.170
Thank you, Fraser.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.780
JENNY MURPHY: Well, we're really
looking forward to

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.830
seeing what you come up with.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.355
Most of the features are there
to support your goals.

00:02:08.355 --> 00:02:11.000
CHARLES JAIMET: Well,
it's playable now.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.880
We've been using it for
our weekly-- two

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.650
of our weekly games.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.510
So anybody who wants to take a
look at it and give me their

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.850
feedback, I'd be more than
happy to give you a

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.192
walkthrough at some point.

00:02:19.192 --> 00:02:20.016
WOLFF DOBSON: Sure!

00:02:20.016 --> 00:02:21.220
JENNY MURPHY: Very cool.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.980
Yeah, we'd like to see that.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.760
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah,
definitely.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.730
JENNY MURPHY: So I guess we
might as well get into the

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.340
questions, now that
introductions are wrapped up.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.000
So, does anyone in the channel
have a question they would

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.165
like to ask?

00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:38.738
CHARLES JAIMET: I have
about seven.

00:02:38.738 --> 00:02:40.490
JENNY MURPHY: Oh?

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.736
Tell us number one.

00:02:41.736 --> 00:02:44.130
CHARLES JAIMET: Well,
number one.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.250
Is there a limit to the
team size that you can

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.385
have in your app?

00:02:48.385 --> 00:02:51.030
WOLFF DOBSON: There is.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.900
It's not intimate.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.810
I'm actually not sure what the
number is, but it will

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.965
eventually decide that
you've had enough.

00:02:57.965 --> 00:03:00.225
But I think that number is--

00:03:00.225 --> 00:03:01.560
let's see, I'm trying to think
of what the biggest

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.960
ones I've had are.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.830
It's in the--

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:07.380
gosh.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.190
I have to get back to you on
what exactly the number is.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.542
I know, like--

00:03:10.542 --> 00:03:11.000
100-ish.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.650
CHARLES JAIMET: OK.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.100
I had a little error for a
while, where I wasn't quite

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.940
able to correlate it to
anything, but I thought that

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.950
maybe it was the number
of people on my team.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.290
I had around 20, 22, or 23.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.580
And a lot of people were getting
a blue screen, they

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.540
weren't able to join the app.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.080
And then once I dropped it,
the next day or two days

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.280
later, they were
able to get in.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.695
But it might have been tied
to something else.

00:03:34.695 --> 00:03:35.460
I wasn't sure.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.660
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, that's
interesting.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.560
I know that if you add them to
the team while the Hangout is

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.270
running, it doesn't reboot--

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.440
it doesn't reload the ACL.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.200
So I've had that problem,
where I'm like, quick!

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.870
I need you in this Hangout!

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.726
And I add them to the team, and
then I'm like, ah, I've

00:03:50.726 --> 00:03:51.810
got to restart this Hangout.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.720
So that can definitely happen.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.040
But I'm not familiar
with why--

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.170
were they--

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.760
were these people in
distant places?

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.510
Were they in--

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.480
CHARLES JAIMET: Well, it's
probably just a coincidence.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.540
Every week we play a game called
Apocalypse World, and

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.090
one week everybody was able to
get in, and the next week two

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.690
or three people got--

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.240
I think Fraser got in, but then
he couldn't see me, and

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.399
then everybody else couldn't
get in, and we

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:19.480
just got sort of--

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.540
what did you call it, Fraser?

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.300
The white screen of serenity.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.670
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, were you--

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.636
were you in Europe?

00:04:25.636 --> 00:04:27.560
CHARLES JAIMET: One
guy was in Europe.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.415
But he's able to get
in just fine now.

00:04:30.415 --> 00:04:31.630
WOLFF DOBSON: Interesting--

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.960
there was a little bit of a
back-end thing that we kind of

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.820
modified about a week and
a half ago, that made,

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.810
basically, things that are
farther from Mountain View a

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:46.650
little bit faster.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.210
So--

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.130
JONATHAN BERI: We improved

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.790
performance for remote locations.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:51.040
WOLFF DOBSON: Thank you.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.580
So that might have been part
of what you were seeing.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.720
But, like I said, that would've

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.250
only affected Hangouts--

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.330
the Hangout's API stuff,
not the main Hangouts.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.725
JONATHAN BERI: And in terms of
the team stuff, if you work

00:05:06.725 --> 00:05:09.580
with any other Google APIs,
it's all sharing the same

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.400
infrastructure.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.550
So not just the Google+, or
the Hangouts, App Engine--

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.300
they all share that same team
management API quota system.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.250
And the limit on the amount of
team members is across all

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.090
products, it's not
just Google+.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.350
I know 50 is not an unreasonable
team size, but a

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.780
couple hundred would be
breaking the bank.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.770
Again, we're going to look back
and actually find out

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:35.650
what the real number is.

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.685
WOLFF DOBSON: That's
a good thing.

00:05:36.685 --> 00:05:39.570
CHARLES JAIMET: I've only ever
got five or six people using

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:40.990
it at a time.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.200
But because I want to start
running encounters, I want to

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.750
get as many eyes on this as I
can to see what people think

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.630
should be in there.

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:51.740
I'm putting people in, then
I'm taking them out

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:52.280
afterwards.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.350
I guess I'm cycling
through people.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.180
I can work with that
for the time being.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.100
There was one little thing I
noticed, and I mentioned it in

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.570
one of the discussion boards.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.640
When people hit the chat button
or resize the window,

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.118
it seems to trigger the on
participants changed.

00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:08.946
WOLFF DOBSON: Hm.

00:06:08.946 --> 00:06:10.110
Um, yeah--

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.640
CHARLES JAIMET: What
you code in there.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.620
It was messing things up.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.160
I fixed the code now, but it's
still calling that event.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.480
WOLFF DOBSON: That's
interesting.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.850
I know somebody was reporting
on the group that when they

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:26.505
resized the window, they
were getting a

00:06:26.505 --> 00:06:28.850
participants changed thing.

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.390
I wasn't able to
reproduce that.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.142
If you have code that does
reproduce that, please add me

00:06:33.142 --> 00:06:37.440
to the team or send me the XML
link, and I will take a look.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.720
Because again, the chat
thing is interesting.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.395
CHARLES JAIMET: Let
me, actually--

00:06:44.395 --> 00:06:46.050
WOLFF DOBSON: I'll just take
a look while we're talking.

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.380
CHARLES JAIMET: Yeah, in my app
we have a map, and the map

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.480
has a reset button that
puts everything

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.520
back to where it was.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.330
You have tokens that you can
drag and drop to show the

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.690
location of various different
people, and when people were

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.410
hitting the chat button, it
was resetting the map.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.330
Which was good, because it
showed me an error in my code,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.950
because it shouldn't have
been doing that anyways.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.810
It kind of buggered the map
for the whole game.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.160
WOLFF DOBSON: I wonder if
that has to do with--

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.340
well, were you-- did you have a
whole bunch of people and it

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:20.274
was actually resizing the film
strip at the bottom?

00:07:20.274 --> 00:07:22.629
Let me--

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:24.640
CHARLES JAIMET: Yeah, would--
certainly that would have been

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.370
happening, because when you hit
the chat, it changes the

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.080
available space.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.980
And when you resize the window,
it also changes the

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.805
available space.

00:07:31.805 --> 00:07:33.250
WOLFF DOBSON: Wow, you're
totally right.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:33.820
Check that out.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.360
It's on clicking the chat.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.580
I don't see it on the resize,
but it totally

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.610
happens on the chat.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:39.960
That is a great bug report.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.150
I will take that back
to the team.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:43.823
JENNY MURPHY: Thanks
very much.

00:07:43.823 --> 00:07:45.715
CHARLES JAIMET: There you go.

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:47.300
JONATHAN BERI: You said you
have seven questions.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.046
Keep on going.

00:07:49.046 --> 00:07:50.890
CHARLES JAIMET: Well, I
don't want to take up

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.220
the whole time here.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.140
I guess my big thing is-- and
I've asked this question

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.500
again, so I apologize
for asking it twice.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.430
But I'm not sure that I got
an answer the last time.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.130
I think the answer was no,
but I'll ask it again.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.480
One of the things I'd really
like to have in my app is a

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.470
permanent data store for text,
tied to the players.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.840
So there's the chat
window, which

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.180
doesn't seem to be permanent.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.400
I'm not sure about that.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.670
I can't create an activity or
write to an activity from the

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:27.080
app, or write to
the chat pane.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.510
But what I'd like to do is--

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.340
there are a couple things that
people can do in the game.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:35.450
They can write notes about the
game or they can roll the

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:39.909
dice, and I'd like to be able to
store that data so that it

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:42.052
can be pulled up later on.

00:08:42.052 --> 00:08:44.410
JONATHAN BERI: So store data.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:45.090
Interesting topic.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:48.500
A lot of things we
can go into.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.900
First of all, first question.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.690
Does the data from one client
need to be available to

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.026
another client?

00:08:56.026 --> 00:08:59.760
CHARLES JAIMET: The data needs
to persist from game to game.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.890
JONATHAN BERI: Not
persistence.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.590
So the shared state component.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.023
So if I'm typing in text,
does somebody else

00:09:06.023 --> 00:09:08.925
need to see my text?

00:09:08.925 --> 00:09:12.180
CHARLES JAIMET: Yes, but I've
already got that worked out.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.630
So the way that I'm doing
it right now is I'm

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:14.690
dumping it to an--

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:18.750
I'm using JSON and I'm dumping
it to my SQL database, and

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.170
then I'm pulling it
back out again.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:24.050
And that way it persists
from week to week.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.600
I just tag the game and it
doesn't matter if it's a

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.350
different Hangout.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.330
You pick the game that you're
playing at the beginning of

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.090
the session, and you can pull
up last week's notes.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:38.700
JONATHAN BERI: OK, so that's
persisting my own data.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:40.620
So if Wolff and I are playing
together, and I type

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.260
something, and you store that
into my SQL, will he ever need

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.850
to read my data?

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:45.370
CHARLES JAIMET: Yes.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.670
JONATHAN BERI: OK, so you need
also shared state across

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:48.750
multiple participants?

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:49.670
CHARLES JAIMET: Yes.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.760
Anybody who's playing the game
should be able to see anybody

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.020
else's notes.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.030
JONATHAN BERI: So have you
looked at the shared state

00:09:55.030 --> 00:10:00.875
API, which is a JSON-like
feature?

00:10:00.875 --> 00:10:02.120
CHARLES JAIMET: Sorry, yes.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.980
But that only lasts to the
end of the Hangout.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.130
JONATHAN BERI: Right, right.

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:08.540
So in terms of-- so shared
state is one thing, so

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.790
synchronizing across
participants is one piece, and

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.930
then persistence of data
is a second piece.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:13.225
So--

00:10:13.225 --> 00:10:14.050
CHARLES JAIMET: So the
shared state--

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:15.570
sorry, just to interrupt.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.280
My understanding of the shared
state was there was a limited

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.440
capacity, around 10K.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.370
Is that right?

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.410
JONATHAN BERI: Yes,
that's right.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:22.010
CHARLES JAIMET: OK.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.730
So that's why I've
been using JSON.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.940
Because I end up with
too much in that.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.765
And it eventually sort of dumps
data, or I have to dump

00:10:31.765 --> 00:10:33.510
data myself.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.200
JONATHAN BERI: I mean, it sounds
like you're doing the

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:35.790
right option.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:41.570
There's the HTML5 local
storage kind of stuff.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:44.820
It is a simple JSON
storage mechanism.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.850
You can persist that on the
client, but if they're in a

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.590
different client, then it's not
going to be synced across

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.320
different browser sessions.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.080
So, in reality, you're going
beyond the standard use case

00:10:54.080 --> 00:11:00.330
of share state, beyond the HTML5
local storage stuff, so

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:01.245
you gotta store it somewhere.

00:11:01.245 --> 00:11:02.380
CHARLES JAIMET: Right.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:08.360
So my question, I guess, is that
the core of the Google+

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.070
system seems to be that I can
start an activity, people can

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.280
comment back, I can
limit it to just a

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.180
certain group of people--

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.480
but the moment that I go into
the app in the Hangout, I lose

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.490
that functionality which seems
to be core to Google+.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.330
And I understand why you
wouldn't want an app writing

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:25.920
activities.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.960
You end up with--

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.090
I mean, I'm assuming that the
rationale is that you'll end

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:31.710
up like Facebook, where
everybody with a Wordpress

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:35.740
website can post their blog
to their Facebook without

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.570
actually ever having to go into
Facebook, and that kind

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.330
of litters the landscape.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:43.640
But it would be nice to be able
to use an activity that's

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.730
limited to the people who are in
the Hangout, and then pull

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.260
it up session to session.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:49.900
JONATHAN BERI: Oh, OK.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.260
So that's actually a different
question altogether.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.165
You're talking about
write APIs.

00:11:53.165 --> 00:11:55.290
CHARLES JAIMET: Yeah, I'm not
worried about the share state.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:55.830
I've got the share state--

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:56.960
JONATHAN BERI: OK, OK.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.340
So, that's a different story--

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.590
CHARLES JAIMET: Next week, I
want to be able to come back

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:01.800
and look at this data.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.810
Six months from now, I want to
be able to come back and look

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:04.350
at this data.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.670
I want to be able to carry
forward the notes from every

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.660
session into the next session.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:13.230
JONATHAN BERI: Actually, we
can answer the write API

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:15.600
question, but before that--

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.450
it sounds like you're actually
asking for a different thing

00:12:18.450 --> 00:12:20.950
than what you originally
formatted your question in.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.710
If you want to see something
six months, nine months, a

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:26.740
year out, in a format that's
acceptable for your

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.510
application, actually using the
stream is probably not the

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.770
best solution.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:33.770
You want a custom data store,
you want a custom storage

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:34.010
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:36.000
So the way you're going about
it is probably the best for

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.260
your application.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:39.120
Is it--

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.380
CHARLES JAIMET: It
works just fine.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:42.490
I've got it working just fine.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.700
It just seems that I'm kind of
reproducing what Google+

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.175
already does, it seems.

00:12:46.175 --> 00:12:48.215
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah, but if it's
your own app-- so with

00:12:48.215 --> 00:12:50.160
your look and feel-- you're
never going to have that same

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.180
control, because it's-- it'd
be through the Google+

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.510
activity stream, sort
of implementation.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.290
Since--

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:58.720
it sounds like you're doing
it the right way.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.660
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.900
And I just pinged a friend.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.470
It sounds like the team
size is about 50-ish.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:10.400
JENNY MURPHY: Ish?

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.690
WOLFF DOBSON: Ish.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:13.190
JENNY MURPHY: Wonder if you
can add aliases to that?

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:14.320
WOLFF DOBSON: You
can add groups--

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.050
JONATHAN BERI: No, you
can't add groups.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.536
WOLFF DOBSON: You can add
groups, but it doesn't work

00:13:17.536 --> 00:13:19.710
for Hangouts, I don't think.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.570
I will get back to you on
whether groups is a way around

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.360
adding more people.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.976
But the top level is, eh, 50.

00:13:26.976 --> 00:13:30.460
JENNY MURPHY: 50-ish.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.260
JONATHAN BERI: Cool.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:34.770
Anybody else in the Hangout?

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:35.815
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, I think
Nicholas, you mentioned you

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.065
had a question?

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:40.200
NICK GRACILLA: Hi guys.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.100
Can you hear me?

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:41.500
JENNY MURPHY: Yes.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.370
Loud and clear.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.980
NICK GRACILLA: Thanks
for hosting this.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.920
So, we've been using Google
Hangouts primarily for

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.440
training for our clients, and
we have some really basic

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.320
level questions.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.600
The first issue we had yesterday
was with a client

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.040
who's in Beijing and
we're in Chicago.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.600
And the connection just
got really sketchy.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.425
And we had suggested that he
turn off his video, so we

00:14:06.425 --> 00:14:08.660
could continue to
talk through it.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.160
And that didn't really
work either.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.230
So the first question is, like,
when the connections are

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:15.170
a little bit sketchy,
can limiting

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.220
video or limiting audio--

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.345
can that improve
the connection?

00:14:20.345 --> 00:14:24.010
JONATHAN BERI: So, we're happy
to answer user questions, like

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:25.330
brief ones.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.260
This is a developer office hour,
so we'll run through

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.070
your quick questions, and
if you have programming

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:32.410
questions, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:32.950
audience.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:36.240
But for the short answer, we've
enabled a feature called

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.840
Connection Speed.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.160
So within the configuration of
the Hangout itself, either

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.890
when you start up a Hangout or
any time in it, they can

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.095
switch it down to a slower
connection speed.

00:14:46.095 --> 00:14:49.710
So the quality gets lowered,
but then it's

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:50.910
smoother video and audio.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:51.460
JENNY MURPHY: Right.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.650
And that feature's
accessible--

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.102
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:56.270
JONATHAN BERI: Pardon me?

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.147
NICK GRACILLA: That's the other
user's responsibility to

00:14:59.147 --> 00:15:00.600
establish their own
connection speed.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:01.110
JONATHAN BERI: Yep.

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.940
JENNY MURPHY: That is correct.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.410
NICK GRACILLA: Awesome.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.622
Thanks!

00:15:04.622 --> 00:15:09.370
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, and I think,
experimentally, I did

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.470
turn off video from time to time
when I was debugging, and

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:16.985
it does actually improve
your roundtrip time.

00:15:16.985 --> 00:15:18.200
But that--

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.419
I don't think there's science
back there, I just noticed

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:21.320
that myself.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.210
CHARLES JAIMET: We had a game on
Saturday night and one guy

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.800
was dropping in and dropping out
and couldn't get it, and

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.777
he finally turned off his video
and he was fine for the

00:15:27.777 --> 00:15:28.850
rest of the session.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:30.464
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:15:30.464 --> 00:15:34.122
I think we have reports of that
working in the field.

00:15:34.122 --> 00:15:35.160
JONATHAN BERI: Cool.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.830
I think we can now switch over
to some of the comments.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.550
We have two comment streams,
because we have

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:41.960
some questions from--

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.305
JENNY MURPHY: From before
the Hangout began.

00:15:44.305 --> 00:15:45.175
We have some questions that--

00:15:45.175 --> 00:15:47.863
JONATHAN BERI: Which one do you
want to start with first?

00:15:47.863 --> 00:15:49.276
JENNY MURPHY: Your choice.

00:15:49.276 --> 00:15:50.090
JONATHAN BERI: All right.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:50.390
Let's do--

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:51.524
JENNY MURPHY: The
best question.

00:15:51.524 --> 00:15:53.360
The most awesome one.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.910
JONATHAN BERI: I haven't got to
the most awesome one yet.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:55.700
JENNY MURPHY: Oh.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:56.095
You can't sort by awesome?

00:15:56.095 --> 00:15:57.910
JONATHAN BERI: There's no
sort by awesome filter.

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:00.100
That's the-- that'd actually
be a good demo.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:01.830
Does anyone want to
put that together?

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.120
No, let's do the live ones,
because they're the freshest.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:09.990
And the first one is a feature
request. On the product, how

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:15.180
about fixing the Linux hang-up
plugin download link?

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:18.590
Uh, if you could reply with
where the broken link is, we

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:20.300
could get the webmaster
to fix that.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.430
Probably an easy one
for us to satisfy.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:30.450
From Jennifer, will G+ allow
us to create custom URLs?

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:34.774
JENNY MURPHY: So by that
you mean, profile URLs?

00:16:34.774 --> 00:16:36.650
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: I assume
they mean vanity URLs, but

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:37.860
that's a guess.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.620
JENNY MURPHY: Vanity
profile URLs.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.885
That's a great idea.

00:16:40.885 --> 00:16:43.600
I've heard some requests for
that, but that's not

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:43.920
something--

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.720
I don't think any of us
actually know about.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:52.310
In general, we don't really
talk a lot about future

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.220
feature releases, because things
just change here so

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.420
often that if we told you, by
the time the next week rolled

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.020
around, we'd no longer
be accurate.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.010
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, and
we want to give

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:02.910
you accurate stuff.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.270
That is something you can
totally click on Send Feedback

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:08.020
and ask for, down in the
lower left-hand corner.

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:09.710
That is--

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.115
those people totally
read those.

00:17:11.115 --> 00:17:12.530
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, all--

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.099
not all--

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.730
you're not always going to get
a reply, but people do

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:17.523
definitely read everything
that goes

00:17:17.523 --> 00:17:18.140
through the Send Feedback.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.515
JONATHAN BERI: Absolutely.

00:17:19.515 --> 00:17:22.140
And especially on the platform
stuff, which we are more

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.200
tapped to, feedback around
that we actually see.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.210
So not only are the office hours
a great place, but click

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.350
that platform feedback button
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:33.220
yourself when you
come across it.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:34.770
Question from Kyle--

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.320
we had a lot of feature
questions today,

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.520
not a lot on platform.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.530
But happy to answer them.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:41.250
Will strikethrough-- any Google
strikethrough thing--

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:46.740
work in Android iOS G+ apps,
work on web and mobile?

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.750
Yes, eventually.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:51.365
We're working on getting the
feature parity in the web app

00:17:51.365 --> 00:17:52.430
to the mobile app.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:54.460
Obviously, we're working really
hard to give that web

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.900
app the core awesome experience,
and then there's

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:01.185
mobile teams both dedicated to
Android and iOS, making not

00:18:01.185 --> 00:18:04.975
only those cool features work
in mobile, but also making

00:18:04.975 --> 00:18:08.300
them optimized for the
mobile experience.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:11.104
Expect, in general, them to be
catching up to the web app,

00:18:11.104 --> 00:18:12.650
and also making its own
unique spin on it.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.666
People trying to join
the Hangouts.

00:18:17.666 --> 00:18:18.630
Oh, interesting.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.075
Glenn-- can you create a
save-a-post-for-later option,

00:18:21.075 --> 00:18:24.510
so that I can quickly peruse
through and hop back to save

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.122
area, for items that I want to
read but don't have time to do

00:18:27.122 --> 00:18:28.130
right away.

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:32.046
WOLFF DOBSON: Ooh, it's like the
Watch Later for YouTube.

00:18:32.046 --> 00:18:33.040
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah.

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:34.980
Great idea.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.950
I've seen people hack around
some Chrome extensions that

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:40.400
integrate with Google bookmarks

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.250
or other data stores.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:43.330
Interesting idea.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:46.530
We don't have that feature
right now.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:48.490
I haven't seen a lot of
interest, but that's

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:49.970
definitely a cool thing to
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] up to.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:51.790
JENNY MURPHY: What I'm actually
doing to work around

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.360
that right now, since some
people ask some interesting

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.410
questions and it might take me
a while to get back to them,

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:00.603
is I'll just click on the little
date stamp in the top

00:19:00.603 --> 00:19:03.740
of the post, which opens up just
that post in another tab

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.080
or window, and I'll just
bookmark that using my

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.430
browser's bookmark feature
and return to it later.

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:11.915
Which is really crude, but it
works surprisingly well.

00:19:11.915 --> 00:19:15.740
JONATHAN BERI: And actually,
Dan suggested to Glenn.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:17.910
Create a read-it-later circle
with no members, and then

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:19.660
share any post you want
with it, later.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:20.420
JENNY MURPHY: That's
a great idea.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.980
JONATHAN BERI: Pretty cool.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.910
Andre asks, please let me block
users from the comment

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:29.060
right away, instead of having
to visit his profile.

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.330
And please make block user
comments invisible to me, and

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:34.638
please provide an API.

00:19:34.638 --> 00:19:36.230
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.430
WOLFF DOBSON: --three or
four things in there.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:43.410
JONATHAN BERI: Uh, there are
tools around managing spam or

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:44.470
unwanted comments.

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:45.950
We hear that.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:49.020
Well, on the background, there's
bunches of people

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.180
working on the automatic
filtration spam.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.480
So a lot of it you don't see.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.530
In terms of just blocking
people that you're not

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:58.200
interested in, yeah, there's
always room for improvement.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.275
Please use the feedback tool
for that kind of stuff.

00:20:00.275 --> 00:20:01.525
That's exactly what
it's there for.

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:08.040
How do I make a picture
in G+ bigger?

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.450
Can you add an option to
like view in original

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:13.590
size or zoom in?

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.550
Right now, we just have
a download feature.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.160
So if the author or the
photographer allows the

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.160
download feature, that's one
way to get around it.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.850
When you--

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.310
the current UI, it's kind of
nice that it automatically

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:28.390
resizes for different browser
windows, so it

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:30.020
doesn't look funky.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.240
But then you can't zoom
in with the standard

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.370
browser zoom features.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.110
JENNY MURPHY: Right, and at this
time, the pictures are

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.010
actually-- if you use the
download link, if it's

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:39.160
available, the pictures are
actually available in up to

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.910
2048 by 2048 square.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.550
Which is a pretty large size.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.260
So it's not like the original
resolution of a raw image shot

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.110
from a 50 megapixel center,
but it's still a

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:51.340
pretty decent size.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.410
So if you use the download
link you can see a pretty

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.298
detailed version
of that image.

00:20:56.298 --> 00:20:57.986
JONATHAN BERI: Yes.

00:20:57.986 --> 00:20:59.900
Sorry, I lost my spot.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.980
Feature requests.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.800
Would you like the ability to
synchronize a Google+ page

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.750
with an existing YouTube
and Picasa accounts?

00:21:13.515 --> 00:21:15.270
JENNY MURPHY: So by
that you're--

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.650
we're assuming you're asking
you want the content that's

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:21.520
getting posted to a Picasa or
a YouTube channel, that you

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.380
already have established for
your entity, automatically

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:27.020
gets synchronized back to
your Google+ stream.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.270
This is an interesting idea.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:33.020
This is something that would be
great to send via the Send

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.880
Feedback feature, down there
in the lower corner, as we

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.500
mentioned before.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.840
And we'll consider it.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.360
JONATHAN BERI: Now, we don't
have a lot of synchronization

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.400
features across Google, with
regarding Google+.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.940
But we have been adding
the +1 button.

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:52.020
So for example, in YouTube you
can +1 and share a video

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:54.650
directly into Google+.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:56.100
We have that on Blogger.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.110
You mentioned Picasa-- we
have it in Picasa also.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.740
So that allows you to at least
get kind of there, by choosing

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.550
what you want to share into
Google+ pretty easily.

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:07.935
It's not full sync, but--

00:22:07.935 --> 00:22:08.960
JENNY MURPHY: And there's
actually a reason that we're

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.690
taking that approach, is when
you share via the +1 button,

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:14.850
we give you the opportunity to
annotate and comment on,

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:16.580
provide some additional context

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.010
to what you're sharing.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:20.870
And we feel that that provides
the highest quality experience

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:21.870
in the stream.

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:24.500
Because you can provide content
and that comment about

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.890
your video that just gives
people who are on Google+ a

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.280
little more context that they
may not have if they're not

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.530
already on YouTube.

00:22:34.906 --> 00:22:35.980
JONATHAN BERI: I'm--

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.940
we're going to skip over some
of these feature requests,

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.645
because they're repetition--

00:22:40.645 --> 00:22:43.452
WOLFF DOBSON: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:22:43.452 --> 00:22:46.513
JONATHAN BERI: Can you add a
voting app, or integrate +1 in

00:22:46.513 --> 00:22:49.430
a way to make voting possible?

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:52.310
JENNY MURPHY: So voting is
something-- or polls on

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:54.360
posts-- are something I've
seen a few different

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.660
approaches to.

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.175
Some people are sharing external
voting apps, which

00:22:58.175 --> 00:22:58.980
looks pretty cool.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.990
Like they're just including them
in the stream, just by

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:03.491
sharing a link to
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] or

00:23:03.491 --> 00:23:05.660
something like that.

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:09.100
But within the application
itself, one approach I've

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.680
experimented with a few times,
is I'll create a post, comment

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.700
on it a few times myself with
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], and then

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.700
disable comments on that post.
So then people can come and +1

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.470
the ones that they would like to
vote for, and that's-- it's

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:26.040
a simple pooling app, but it's
surprisingly effective.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.210
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah, I've seen
that done numerous times.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:31.990
I use that for my
own questions.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:33.570
We actually just launched
something

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:34.880
kind of cool yesterday.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.710
It went under the radar, but
with Google Docs, we now allow

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:43.130
you to share forms directly
into Google+.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:44.755
And it doesn't--

00:23:44.755 --> 00:23:47.920
it's not like a JavaScript
widget of any kind, but it

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.930
does some of the description
for the form, and that's

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:54.760
another way to do some sort of
polling or question-answer.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:55.100
Cool.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.340
You can share right
from Google Docs.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.910
And we can link to that in the
[INAUDIBLE], the blog that we

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:03.460
talked about.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.370
OK.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:06.270
Oh, take a look at
Google Docs--

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:06.990
somebody.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:09.059
Allen!

00:24:09.059 --> 00:24:09.985
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:09.985 --> 00:24:10.911
JENNY MURPHY: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:24:10.911 --> 00:24:12.546
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: You beat
me to it one there,

00:24:12.546 --> 00:24:13.640
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.120
JONATHAN BERI: What's that?

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:15.990
Yes, that's--

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:17.016
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: You
beat me to it,

00:24:17.016 --> 00:24:20.222
announcing it on the Hangout.

00:24:20.222 --> 00:24:23.230
JONATHAN BERI: This is true.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:23.810
WOLFF DOBSON: All right.

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.888
What we got?

00:24:25.888 --> 00:24:29.460
JONATHAN BERI: We have, why
can't Google+ and GTalk merge?

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:32.350
It is a pain to have
contacts to both.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:42.970
Now, we have been introducing
elements of Google+ into

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:50.010
Gmail, and if you notice in the
Google+ version of Google

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:52.640
Talk-- so if you're logged in to
Google+ and there's a chat

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.330
going on, it shows the
relationships of people who

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.460
are actively in your circles.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.900
And so, if you're in Gmail and
you see all your offline

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:06.020
friends, that's all great, but
in Google+ land, we only show

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.550
the ones who are actually
in circles.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.360
So we're moving in
that direction.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.780
And a comment on all
Google, right?

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:17.660
Google+ is about making Google
a better experience for all

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:19.730
our users by adding
social components.

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:22.930
So Google+ is going to be
part of that Google Talk

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:24.990
experience, it just-- we're
working through how to

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:26.530
optimize that.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:30.620
So we're getting there, and
working on it, too.

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:31.455
Let's see.

00:25:31.455 --> 00:25:33.126
WOLFF DOBSON: What
else we got?

00:25:36.054 --> 00:25:38.080
JONATHAN BERI: Is there an API
that can have the latest

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.220
picture in an album displayed
first, or as a thumbnail for

00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.050
the album automatically?

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:45.300
G Tan--

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.335
do you understand that, Jenny?

00:25:49.335 --> 00:25:51.790
JENNY MURPHY: So it sounds like
you're asking for an API

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:54.380
that will allow you to integrate
the photos and

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.400
albums you have up there
with external sites or

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.830
applications.

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:04.360
The Picasa APIs offer limited
access to the photos now.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.820
I'm not sure about
the details.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:08.780
I don't believe there is the
exact features you're looking

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:12.000
for, but we're always looking
to expand more

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.460
Google+-centric APIs.

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:15.590
Photos are definitely something

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:17.630
we're thinking about.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.830
So this is an interesting
feature that we will consider

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:22.450
when we revisit that later.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:25.090
JONATHAN BERI: Yep.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:26.440
Good question.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.390
Will there be a connection
between Google+ for business

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:30.210
pages, places for business?

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.340
I think we've got this one a
few times already, but it's

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.250
still worth going over again.

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:34.660
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, that's a
very interesting question,

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.910
because you think, Google
places pages and

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:38.960
Google+ pages look--

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.730
there's a lot of similar kind
of content on there.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:45.400
It would be pretty cool
if there was some--

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.920
if those converged eventually.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.210
But this is, again, kind of
a future-looking thing.

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:54.050
We don't really know
a whole lot about

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:54.760
what's going on there.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.170
So not a lot we can tell you,
other than that would be

00:26:58.170 --> 00:26:59.796
really cool.

00:26:59.796 --> 00:27:04.330
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah, and in
general, the Maps business

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.660
pages have a use case, and
it's a different type of

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.580
application.

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.635
And the way it bubbles up in
Search is one way, and the way

00:27:10.635 --> 00:27:13.960
we do the Plus pages and how
you engage your audience

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:18.330
directly through the Plus pages
for businesses, is right

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:18.750
now different.

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:19.680
And for good reason.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.154
But definitely, there's
a world where we

00:27:21.154 --> 00:27:22.404
could see those merging.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:27.850
On-topic question.

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:29.690
From Gerwin.

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:33.510
He reported the discussions
are throwing some errors.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:35.660
On-topic is, can someone explain
what the language

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.360
parameter really does in
activities.search and

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.110
people.search.

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:40.450
I wasn't able to see
a difference from

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:41.700
my last test queries.

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:45.620
JENNY MURPHY: That's
a great question.

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:49.330
It should be filtering by our
best guess of the language.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:54.620
But it-- and you're reporting
that it's showing the same

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.495
results for all of them?

00:27:56.495 --> 00:28:00.180
I"ll look back with you to
see what's up there.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.800
That sounds like an interesting
issue that we

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.430
should probably fix.

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:08.150
Although, in short chunks of
text, sometimes it's difficult

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:09.090
to determine the language.

00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:10.810
So it may be something
related to that.

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:12.060
I'm not really sure.

00:28:16.191 --> 00:28:19.170
JONATHAN BERI: And as I
recall, we added the

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.580
enhancement to Search--

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.010
in the last year?

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:24.725
To allow you to filter
by language?

00:28:24.725 --> 00:28:26.420
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, it's a
pretty recent edition.

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:28.972
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah, and I
believe its exact purpose is

00:28:28.972 --> 00:28:29.890
the way you'd expect
it to behave.

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:32.200
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, so it should
be a filter for the

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.570
content that you're searching,
such that you only load

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:37.970
content and results that match
the language that you specify

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:40.010
in that culture parameter.

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:44.496
But if that's not working, it's
something we need to fix.

00:28:44.496 --> 00:28:46.050
So I'll go back with you.

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:47.300
Great question.

00:28:49.065 --> 00:28:53.180
JONATHAN BERI: G Tan has a lot
of question-related API stuff.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:29:01.292
Is an API to have custom slide
shows from photos in albums?

00:29:01.292 --> 00:29:03.100
JENNY MURPHY: So this is--

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:06.120
it sounds like you're asking
about something similar to the

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:09.260
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] and the old
slide plug-ins that people

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:11.230
would use to do the slide
shows on their sites.

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:12.770
It'd be pretty cool.

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:14.620
We probably wouldn't--

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.410
I don't know that we would
expose a feature like that,

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.250
although we definitely could,
a component that you could

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:22.000
drop into your page or one
of the social plug-ins.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.330
Another option that may exist at
some point in time is kind

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:30.710
of more raw REST APIs to provide
access to that data.

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:34.180
Neither of those exist
right now.

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.240
They may exist in the future
and would be pretty cool.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.080
It'd be a great way to showcase
the content on your

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.532
page and profile.

00:29:41.532 --> 00:29:43.630
But thanks for the idea.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:46.290
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah, and
regarding to creating your

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:49.670
own, Jenny mentioned
the Picasa APIs--

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:53.200
those of you using your
old Gdata spec.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.530
They're still pretty cool
if you're a Picasa user.

00:29:55.530 --> 00:29:55.850
WOLFF DOBSON: You can
do a lot of things.

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:57.600
JONATHAN BERI: And you can do
a lot of things with them,

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.130
like build a slide show
widget from it.

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:03.420
And there's some pretty good
documentation around how to do

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:08.020
that, how to use
the Picasa API.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.170
Let's see.

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:13.680
That was the bottom
of the live--

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.920
WOLFF DOBSON: Wait, Mike G. Is
there a plan to add multiple

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.214
email contacts to the Google
pages, so that every manager

00:30:19.214 --> 00:30:23.495
can be notified about
a post or a change?

00:30:23.495 --> 00:30:26.040
JONATHAN BERI: I think you mean
multiple admins for a

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:30.330
Plus page, because we have
that support now, right?

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.590
JENNY MURPHY: Yep, so if you
go onto your Plus page,

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.580
there's an option to manage
your Plus page.

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:36.930
And there's actually a list
of the pages that are--

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:40.340
the pages that exist. And from
there, you can actually add up

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:43.750
to 50 administrators per page.

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:46.020
And then all of them will have
all the capabilities of any

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.720
other administrator
on the page.

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.900
JONATHAN BERI: That includes
notifications, the little red

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.842
box, all the other fun
stuff we provide.

00:30:53.842 --> 00:30:55.780
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, which is
great for organizations,

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.520
because as time passes, the
people that manage that page

00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.430
will change hands.

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.810
And eventually, none of the
original group may end up

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.230
working on a page.

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:04.370
But the page will live on,
like the rest of the

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:06.090
organization.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:07.814
CHARLES JAIMET: I have a quick
question, if we're at the

00:31:07.814 --> 00:31:13.580
bottom of the list. Is
there a way to--

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.270
I'm getting echo.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.530
Sorry, just getting some
echo on my mic.

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:25.070
Is there a way to see how many
people have circled you back

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:27.020
in the API?

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.560
Or how many people are circled
and circled back to a

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.268
particular user in the API?

00:31:33.268 --> 00:31:35.220
JENNY MURPHY: No, there's
no way to get to that in

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.400
the API right now.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.510
But that's something that
would be really cool.

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:41.620
As you may have discovered,
it's already

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:43.160
on the profile page.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:47.420
So it's something we'd like
to expose, but it's

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.830
just not there yet.

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:52.240
But it's on our list,
it's on our radar.

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.684
Good question, that would
be really cool.

00:31:55.684 --> 00:31:56.960
CHARLES JAIMET: And back
to the Hangouts.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.140
I asked--

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.680
I guess in the first-- well,
the first of these Hangouts

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.970
that I was aware of--

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:06.030
if at any point we were going to
be able to access the main

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:07.130
video window--

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:11.530
or the main video element, and
the thumbnail elements for

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:15.176
each of the people in the
Hangout from the app?

00:32:15.176 --> 00:32:17.820
JONATHAN BERI: In terms of
more media APIs, that's

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.875
definitely an area that
we want to grow.

00:32:19.875 --> 00:32:22.536
WOLFF DOBSON: That's something
we're really interested in.

00:32:22.536 --> 00:32:24.780
JONATHAN BERI: The challenge,
but something we can overcome,

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.205
is the way the film
strip is done.

00:32:27.205 --> 00:32:30.010
We're using the Google Doc
plug-in, which is a pretty

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:31.410
advanced piece of code.

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:34.980
It's C++ code, and we compile
it, we distribute it

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.160
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
release cycles.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.520
What it does is it actually
muxes all the videos on the

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.680
client side, which is why
we're allowed to do some

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.620
really cool multi-streaming
video.

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.200
But that-- the break it up part
and make that efficient

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.325
is something we just--

00:32:50.325 --> 00:32:50.950
we have to work through.

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:52.110
WOLFF DOBSON: I mean, right now
we're rendering the film

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:54.660
strip as one big chunk that goes
plunk, and gets placed on

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:55.580
top of your thing.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.820
So we don't have the ability to
knock those pieces loose.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:03.930
But yeah, that is absolutely
something we're interested in.

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:05.542
JONATHAN BERI: And actively
investigating.

00:33:05.542 --> 00:33:07.690
CHARLES JAIMET: And when
the Hangouts with

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:09.100
the apps come online--

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.120
I know you guys don't talk about
the future, so feel free

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.406
to say I'm not going
to tell you--

00:33:12.406 --> 00:33:13.077
JONATHAN BERI: There is no
future, there is only the

00:33:13.077 --> 00:33:13.140
past.

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.395
CHARLES JAIMET: It would
be really great--

00:33:15.395 --> 00:33:16.532
Pardon me?

00:33:16.532 --> 00:33:17.210
JONATHAN BERI: There's
no future.

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:18.825
There's only the past.

00:33:18.825 --> 00:33:20.730
CHARLES JAIMET: It would be
really great to have them with

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:24.340
extras and with the On Air
capability, as well.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.800
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:26.860
Agreed.

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:30.400
So we could actually demo the
apps during office hours?

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.040
CHARLES JAIMET: There you go.

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.780
That'd be great.

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:36.300
Walk through an app with a
developer would be fantastic.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:36.850
JONATHAN BERI: Yep.

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:38.300
Yeah.

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.400
Yeah, we're totally excited
about On Air.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.190
As you know, it's in a
growing field trial.

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:44.720
It's already in the hands of a
lot of people, some of the

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.340
folks that are in
here have it.

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:47.626
WOLFF DOBSON: President Obama.

00:33:47.626 --> 00:33:49.170
JONATHAN BERI: For example.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:50.850
And as we're building up
infrastructure and the

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:52.640
quality, and we talked a little
bit about moderation

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:56.960
tools and things like that, and
as the platform matures I

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.525
would love to see a day were
they'd just be together.

00:34:00.525 --> 00:34:03.030
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, our plan is
definitely to have kind of

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:05.620
all the Hangout features
to converge over time.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:09.285
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] in the sake of
just getting features out

00:34:09.285 --> 00:34:13.180
to people quickly, things have
kind of gone along--

00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:18.179
WOLFF DOBSON: It's allowed teams
to work quickly, and

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:20.935
integrate quickly, but it does
mean that they have kind of

00:34:20.935 --> 00:34:22.770
diverged a little bit.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:24.510
Obviously you can see that
the UI's different

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:25.699
between the two and stuff.

00:34:25.699 --> 00:34:29.870
So, yeah, but bringing those
together is definitely part of

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:30.460
the future.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.068
JENNY MURPHY: Yep, that's
a big part of our plan.

00:34:32.068 --> 00:34:33.080
JONATHAN BERI: Cool.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.050
So G Tan asks--

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:36.800
it's two questions.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.652
Two separate ones, but
I'm going to answer

00:34:37.652 --> 00:34:38.902
them machine gun style.

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:44.199
The first one is, when will the
G+ games API be open to

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:45.590
the public?

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:50.210
So Google+ games is something
we're still

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:51.080
baking in the oven.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.239
We have about 30-ish games.

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:56.889
You can see that on
the Games tab.

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:59.800
And we're working closely with
partners to really build out

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.450
what we want that API set and
what that platform to be.

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:07.106
It's an awesome part
of our product.

00:35:07.106 --> 00:35:09.910
Millions of people play
games all the time.

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:12.490
And we're getting great feedback
in terms of features

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:13.505
and functionalities.

00:35:13.505 --> 00:35:16.616
But that's a little ways off.

00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:18.390
CHARLES JAIMET: I guess this is
another one of those areas

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:21.260
where you've get two groups of
people working in separate

00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:26.800
rooms, but I'm building a game
app inside the Hangout API.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.900
But it seems like it might fit
better inside the Games API if

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.150
the games had the video
component, as well.

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:34.120
Is that part of the plan?

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.420
JONATHAN BERI: Well, so--

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:35.880
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.285
JONATHAN BERI: We're biased,
because we work

00:35:37.285 --> 00:35:38.410
on the Hangout apps.

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:41.070
WOLFF DOBSON: Hangout
apps are awesome.

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:44.890
JONATHAN BERI: The Hangout apps
and Google+ games are

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:46.700
kind of different beasts.

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:51.130
Games totally work in Hangouts,
but those games tend

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:54.560
to be tailored to utilize the
multi-player, the real time

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.250
component, the video
and the audio.

00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:00.400
So if you're building a game
that leverages that video

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.210
piece, that probably belongs
in Hangout, right?

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.362
It's the other--

00:36:06.362 --> 00:36:08.425
putting a game inside of a
Hangout, versus trying to put

00:36:08.425 --> 00:36:10.241
the Hangout features
inside of a game.

00:36:10.241 --> 00:36:11.960
FRASER CAIN: Yeah, but you
mentioned like a person

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.860
playing chess.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:15.140
Right?

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:17.450
So you could have the video, you
could see your opponent.

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:19.960
You guys could be trashtalking
each other, but also moving

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:21.355
the pieces around on
the chess board.

00:36:21.355 --> 00:36:22.480
JONATHAN BERI: Exactly.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.960
And that's a Hangout
app that's a game.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.305
Perfect use case.

00:36:27.305 --> 00:36:28.510
JENNY MURPHY: Cool.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:32.550
So I see that Mike just joined
the Hangout a few minutes ago.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:33.390
WOLFF DOBSON: And he's typing.

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:34.980
JENNY MURPHY: He's typing.

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.635
So feel free to--

00:36:37.635 --> 00:36:39.700
WOLFF DOBSON: --be a Hangout
gadget for iGoogle.

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:41.330
JENNY MURPHY: So feel free to
turn on your mic and join us

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:41.700
in the conversation--

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:42.660
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, it's OK.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:43.520
He's chatting.

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:44.255
He's cool.

00:36:44.255 --> 00:36:46.230
JENNY MURPHY: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:49.380
So your question is, which
Wolff already read, and I

00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.030
talked over him.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:53.060
WOLFF DOBSON: Will there be a
Hangout gadget for iGoogle?

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:55.390
Hello.

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:57.531
JENNY MURPHY: Hi, Mike!

00:36:57.531 --> 00:37:02.430
JONATHAN BERI: Right now, the
only place to launch a Hangout

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:04.790
on the web is from the
stream, and that

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:06.490
opens up a new IFrame.

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:10.040
And then for mobile, Android
and both iOS now supports

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:12.080
launching it from
Messenger app.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:14.840
And that's all the plans
we have for right now.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:15.766
So, not in iGoogle.

00:37:15.766 --> 00:37:16.725
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:37:16.725 --> 00:37:21.030
WOLFF DOBSON: And the iGoogle
gadget spec is different than

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:24.084
the Hangout app spec, so
they're not really

00:37:24.084 --> 00:37:25.566
overlapping.

00:37:25.566 --> 00:37:28.170
JENNY MURPHY: So it wouldn't be
a core feature of iGoogle.

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:30.106
That's pretty unlikely.

00:37:30.106 --> 00:37:32.280
JONATHAN BERI: So the last
question from G Tan,

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.380
at least for now.

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.790
Can you discuss how Google Apps,
Google App Engine would

00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:39.370
work on G+ APIs?

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:41.422
More examples would
be helpful.

00:37:41.422 --> 00:37:44.970
JENNY MURPHY: So Google App
Engine and the Google+ APIs.

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:47.270
If you've played with any of
our starter projects--

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:49.320
the Python or the Java ones--

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.950
you'll notice that our
examples-- or even the Hangout

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:53.750
one, the Hangout starter app.

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:56.660
Our examples all use
Google App Engine.

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:57.830
And there's a reason for that.

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:02.430
It's because we're familiar
with Google App Engine.

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:04.600
It's free to get started.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.260
And we can give you instructions
that will get you

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:10.700
going pretty quickly, because
of that familiarity.

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.080
Also we're a little bit biased,
because it's Google

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:16.222
App Engine and the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] devpro team,

00:38:16.222 --> 00:38:17.370
they're pretty cool guys.

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:18.045
WOLFF DOBSON: We think
it's nifty.

00:38:18.045 --> 00:38:19.220
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, we think
it's pretty cool.

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:22.900
JONATHAN BERI: Yeah, so if you
haven't checked out the App

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:23.530
Engine stuff--

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:24.980
WOLFF DOBSON: Python or the Java
App Engine starter stuff.

00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:26.160
JONATHAN BERI: It'll get
you started right away.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.030
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, the starter
apps are-- which we'll

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.680
link in the show notes-- the
starter apps all-- they're App

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.500
Engine versions of all of
them, and very cool.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:38.160
But the kind of connection
kind of ends there.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:41.350
Other than the fact that Google
App Engines is in our

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:43.875
cloud, so you're going to get
pretty good response time for

00:38:43.875 --> 00:38:46.910
APIs, it's pretty independent.

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:50.082
You can use the Google+ APIs
from any hosting provider that

00:38:50.082 --> 00:38:52.430
you choose.

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:55.760
You just need App Engine
in our sample location.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.580
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:58.760
Fully independent.

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.160
But App Engine's awesome.

00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.972
Check it out.

00:39:01.972 --> 00:39:03.902
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: I've got a
question about image resources

00:39:03.902 --> 00:39:07.075
and how they're used
in Hangouts.

00:39:07.075 --> 00:39:08.460
WOLFF DOBSON: Sorry, can
you repeat that?

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.310
You're a little blurry.

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:11.565
Audio-wise.

00:39:11.565 --> 00:39:12.967
JENNY MURPHY: A little
bit muffled.

00:39:12.967 --> 00:39:13.881
Please repeat.

00:39:13.881 --> 00:39:16.050
WOLFF DOBSON: Or type your
question into chat.

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:17.820
All's good.

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:19.890
Or your statement into chat.

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:21.300
Your question.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:28.060
He says, "Aaagh!" We'll
emote for you.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.470
Question about image
resources.

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:31.020
This is in the Hangout API.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:36.200
So images-- for those
of you who are

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.290
following along at home--

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:40.520
you can allocate image resources
to use as face

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:42.980
overlays in the Hangout API.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.200
JENNY MURPHY: Which is
a really fun feature.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.480
It's a great way to get-- if
you're just starting with the

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:50.130
Hangout API, it's one of the
most instant satisfaction,

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:50.760
instant joy--

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.350
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, I was going
to say, it's totally fun

00:39:52.350 --> 00:39:53.910
to play with.

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:57.180
There's a nifty sample with
monocles and top hats that I

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.430
strongly recommend
you download.

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:03.695
The question about image
resources-- how much memory do

00:40:03.695 --> 00:40:05.290
they use, since they can't be
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] or cleaned up

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:06.540
at this time.

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:11.124
At this time is an excellent
phrase to use there.

00:40:11.124 --> 00:40:13.086
JONATHAN BERI: And--
keep going.

00:40:13.086 --> 00:40:15.740
WOLFF DOBSON: And I've got an
app in progress that will be

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.080
allocating lots of graphics
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:20.094
and then discarding them.

00:40:20.094 --> 00:40:20.520
Yeah.

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.730
I think it depends a little
bit on how much memory the

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:27.520
plug-in is allowed
to use, because--

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.600
and that depends on your
system configuration.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.240
In general--

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:35.550
I think I ran a test on
my MacBook Pro here.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:40.850
And I allocated about 200 of
them before the plug-in was

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:42.120
like, all right, that's
enough, let's

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:45.170
just stop, shall we?

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:49.750
And right now if you run out
of memory, it actually just

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:52.433
halts the Hangout, which
is obviously not a

00:40:52.433 --> 00:40:54.120
place we want to end.

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:57.360
That is under development.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:58.330
But yeah.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:40:59.870
Yeah, yeah--

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:01.550
it actually halts the Hangout.

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:05.030
Because you will have actually
run out of memory inside the

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:08.300
plug-in, which is what
it's going to do.

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.200
So yes.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.310
Go gently on allocating those.

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:16.230
I think I had one that allocated
one about every

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:19.590
second, and it ran for
about 250 seconds

00:41:19.590 --> 00:41:21.380
and then killed itself.

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.050
So that's not science, that
is field experience.

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:27.540
But yeah, it's in that range.

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.930
JONATHAN BERI: So, with
regarding to why it halts,

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:31.050
it's a pretty simple answer.

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:35.400
A lot of the Hangout API stuff
is handled by the plug-in, not

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.920
just the video stream.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.200
So they're kind of
interconnected.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.850
So as we make the plug-in
better, we make the Hangout

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:42.170
API better.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:44.770
More performance, add
new features.

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:47.780
So one of the things, as a
result of our fun experiment,

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.650
was taking that feedback back
to the plug-ins team--

00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:51.850
WOLFF DOBSON: We were like,
hey, look at this!

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:54.560
JONATHAN BERI: So garbage
collection improved, resources

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:56.450
swapping out improved.

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:59.080
So they're taking that, and
they're going to work that

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.080
into the next plug-in,
which means they have

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.514
more stuff for API.

00:42:05.436 --> 00:42:06.410
NICK GRACILLA: [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:08.520
JONATHAN BERI: You're
welcome, Nicholas.

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.770
Nicholas says thanks.

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.630
Let's go back to the posts.

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:25.780
Blah, blah, blah.

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:26.570
[INAUDIBLE]

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:29.270
translation.

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:32.075
G Tan, you're just full
of questions today.

00:42:32.075 --> 00:42:33.480
I wish I knew your first name.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:36.930
Unless it is G. Is there a way
to call functionality in the

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:40.270
G+ Android app via another
Android app?

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:41.210
Hm.

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:43.425
JENNY MURPHY: So you're thinking
of-- like in Android

00:42:43.425 --> 00:42:45.780
we use intents pretty heavily
to communicate between

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:46.460
applications.

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:50.370
So one of the ways this may
work would be to create

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:52.640
intents that would cause
things to happen in the

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.360
Google+ app.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:57.270
We don't have any
of those yet.

00:42:57.270 --> 00:43:00.385
But it's something we're
actively working on, and when

00:43:00.385 --> 00:43:02.522
we have it ready, it'll
be really cool.

00:43:02.522 --> 00:43:05.670
WOLFF DOBSON: Does our starter
Java project cover--

00:43:05.670 --> 00:43:07.950
it covers basic Android,
right?

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:12.310
JENNY MURPHY: So the Java
starter for the Google+ REST

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:15.860
APIs includes an Android
application, in addition to a

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:20.150
command line, a generic web
application, and a Google App

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:21.570
Engine sample.

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:24.250
And the Android sample shows you
how to interact with the

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:30.300
Google+ REST APIs from Android
in a nice way.

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.330
So you can write neat Android
apps that use the read APIs.

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:37.940
But that does not interact
with the existing Google+

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:39.870
application on the device.

00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:43.830
That would require us to expose
hooks so you could

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:46.400
interact with that, and those
are not available yet.

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.410
But it's something we're
figuring out.

00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:49.280
We're going to have a plan.

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.860
It'll be really cool.

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:53.570
Hang tight.

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:56.134
WOLFF DOBSON: One of the
questions was, do we have a

00:43:56.134 --> 00:43:59.400
way to automatically
shift languages?

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.190
JONATHAN BERI: Translate.

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:01.377
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah.

00:44:01.377 --> 00:44:01.844
Sorry.

00:44:01.844 --> 00:44:03.996
Shift-- it's like magic.

00:44:03.996 --> 00:44:05.820
Drop in another language.

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:07.300
That'd be cool.

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:09.760
You should add that
to Send Feedback.

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.890
And then also, I think there
are Chrome extensions out

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:17.110
there that will let
you shift pages--

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:20.670
translate pages using the
Google translate thing.

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:22.360
If you're getting
hung up right--

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:24.220
send Feedback, but if you're
getting hung up right now, you

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.290
should investigate
some of that.

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:26.900
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, if I
remember right, I believe I've

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.840
actually seen someone playing
with a Chrome extension that

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.720
added translation features
for individual posts.

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:34.930
And it can definitely--

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:36.840
if it doesn't-- if it's not out
there, it could definitely

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.375
be written.

00:44:37.375 --> 00:44:38.110
WOLFF DOBSON: Absolutely.

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:39.930
Yeah, you could write it, too.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.445
JENNY MURPHY: Yeah, this could
be a cool project for you to

00:44:41.445 --> 00:44:42.415
come write and show us.

00:44:42.415 --> 00:44:43.750
JONATHAN BERI: There is one.

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:46.030
I don't have the name off the
top of my head, and there

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:46.840
might be a couple.

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:49.770
One bundled up with a bunch
of other features.

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:51.795
But we can check it--

00:44:51.795 --> 00:44:53.676
I'm sure some people in
the Hangout already--

00:44:53.676 --> 00:44:56.980
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, you guys can
probably go-- probably are

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:58.900
able to use a search engine
to find that.

00:44:58.900 --> 00:44:59.320
JONATHAN BERI: But yeah.

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:02.710
So Google+ is an international
product.

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:03.485
We support a bunch
of languages.

00:45:03.485 --> 00:45:08.590
It's just the cross language,
cross locale piece of it, is a

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:11.050
bigger challenge
in translation.

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:13.205
Especially just words, because
you have other pieces that are

00:45:13.205 --> 00:45:16.590
not translatable, like
GIFs and images.

00:45:16.590 --> 00:45:19.093
So we're working on that, as an
international product and

00:45:19.093 --> 00:45:21.015
an international company,
to make that a priority.

00:45:21.015 --> 00:45:23.270
JENNY MURPHY: I agree, it's
pretty cool when you watch a

00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:24.854
stream, and as the
clock turns--

00:45:24.854 --> 00:45:28.410
you can see the clock passing in
daytime in Asia, and all of

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:30.764
the sudden the posts start
coming up in languages that I

00:45:30.764 --> 00:45:32.180
can't read.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:34.540
WOLFF DOBSON: Definitely.

00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:35.960
JENNY MURPHY: Very neat.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:39.861
JONATHAN BERI: So we're
hitting 12:16.

00:45:39.861 --> 00:45:41.935
That's usually when we try
to wrap things up.

00:45:41.935 --> 00:45:43.630
JENNY MURPHY: So are there
any questions from the

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:44.440
participants?

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.010
WOLFF DOBSON: We don't wrap up
at 12:15 because it's not a

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:48.270
factor of two.

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:49.455
JENNY MURPHY: And
last questions?

00:45:49.455 --> 00:45:51.755
Or is there anything else
on the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:51.755 --> 00:45:54.235
WOLFF DOBSON: I think
actually that's--

00:45:54.235 --> 00:45:55.720
JONATHAN BERI: We--

00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.580
a lot of the--

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:58.280
I think we're good.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.060
JENNY MURPHY: We're good.

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:03.240
So well, we've answered all the
questions we found during

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.765
the duration of the Hangout.

00:46:04.765 --> 00:46:05.830
This was a lot of fun.

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:07.984
Thanks to everyone who
joined the Hangout.

00:46:07.984 --> 00:46:10.360
We will-- oh wait, there's one
quick question that just

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:13.230
showed up in the chat, which
we will address.

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:16.420
One more quick question,
asks Mike,

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:17.620
about the iGoogle gadget.

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:21.120
Can you add a +1 to
a gadget page?

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.410
WOLFF DOBSON: No, to the
add gadget page.

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:23.660
JENNY MURPHY: The
add gadget page.

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:28.260
This is a good question.

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.140
WOLFF DOBSON: I don't know.

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:32.490
JENNY MURPHY: I believe
you've stumped us.

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:34.570
WOLFF DOBSON: We are not
familiar with that.

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:38.790
JONATHAN BERI: So I think the
question is, for the existing

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:42.070
gadgets that we have in our
iGoogle gallery, can we add a

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:44.340
+1 to each one of the
gadget listings?

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:46.620
JENNY MURPHY: Oh, it that
what you're asking?

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:47.955
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah,
like this page.

00:46:47.955 --> 00:46:50.880
JENNY MURPHY: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
the gadget gallery?

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.050
That would be really cool.

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:54.050
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, that's
an interesting idea.

00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:55.720
JENNY MURPHY: We will definitely
relay that feedback

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.784
to the iGoogle team.

00:46:57.784 --> 00:47:01.350
We like the +1 button and we
want it to be more places.

00:47:01.350 --> 00:47:03.510
WOLFF DOBSON: Putting it on our
own product seemed like an

00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:05.340
excellent choice.

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:06.110
JENNY MURPHY: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
that.

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:09.530
JONATHAN BERI: And even today,
we don't have the +1 button

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:12.210
there, but we have the Chrome
extension that allows you to

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:14.790
+1 yourself any page
on the web.

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:18.090
And, of course, if you find
pages in the search results on

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:19.750
Google, you can also
+1 it from there.

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:22.070
So we do collect those
+1s, even if it's not

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:24.224
directly from the site.

00:47:24.224 --> 00:47:26.620
JENNY MURPHY: Great.

00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:29.380
Well, we will be wrapping it
up for this week then.

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:30.460
Thanks to everyone who
joined the Hangout.

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.660
And thanks to everyone who asked
questions, whether you

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:37.830
joined to ask questions or you
asked questions on the posts.

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:40.780
And we will be back next week
to answer questions and show

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.600
you some cool stuff on
the Google+ platform.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:46.110
CHARLES JAIMET: Thanks a lot,
Jenny, and everyone else.

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:46.830
JONATHAN BERI: Thanks, guys!

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:48.080
WOLFF DOBSON: Bye!
