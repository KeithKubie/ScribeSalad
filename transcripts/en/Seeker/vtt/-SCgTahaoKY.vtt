00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.620
What is that?

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.520
Hey DNews listeners, Trace here.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.539
Are you listening on headphones?

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:22.550
Turn up the volume really loud… hear that?
that hissing noise?

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.230
Okay, turn the volume back down.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.230
Sorry ASMR peeps.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.963
Okay, that hissing sound might be annoying,
but it's always there in speakers, headphones,

00:00:28.963 --> 00:00:33.290
and electronics in general, even in your computer
and wifi signals!

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.079
How it gets there is kind of mind-blowing…

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.219
First, etymology time, baby!

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.449
*Sigh,* DNewsPlus.

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.920
The suffix -ics is from Greek -ikos meaning
"pertaining to."

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.809
Or Latin -ic "dealing with" or "denoting."

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.680
It's usually used with a body of facts or
knowledge, like: Log-IC, AcoustICS, mus-IC,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.920
even mag-IC!

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.260
Electron-ICS denotes ELECTRONS.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.179
When engineers design computers or headphones
or whatever, they take electrons and move

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.020
them through a system of wires and switches
to accomplish a task.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.990
Headphones are simply tiny speakers attached
to the end of wires, not unlike the speakers

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.030
in your home theater, computer, or even at
the movies.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.570
The electrons vibrate little cones or drivers
to push air around and make music.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.340
In engineering vernacular, the music, data
(or whatever you’re transmitting) is called

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.640
the "signal," and everything else is called
"noise."

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.159
When assessing a system, engineers use something
called the signal-to-noise ratio.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.320
The goal of headphones is to hear music, right?

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.200
So if you had a signal-to-noise ratio of 3-to-1,
the music is waay louder than the noise.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.200
That's good!

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.420
But, if it's 1-to-1, then no matter how loud
the music was, the noise would still be there.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.509
Okay, so, back to headphone hiss.

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.359
When electrons leave the battery, the charge
hops from atom to atom of the copper wires

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:49.650
of your device.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.820
Every hop introduces a little bit of chaos!

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.619
A little bit of noise.

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.229
Just like molecules in a hot gas, electrons
in the circuitry are constantly jiggling about

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.299
in a random fashion, and the atoms are vibrating
too!

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.409
Plus, the wires are bent here or there, and
the copper isn't perfectly uniform -- those

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.190
little changes cause more interference and
more noise!

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.400
On top of that, wires aren't one continuous
stream, there are connections, chips, plugs,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.180
and solders, each made of different materials
which cause the electrons to stutter or bounce

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.180
chaotically.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.380
When I'm not talking, and you're still hearing
a hiss, that's called the "noise floor" and

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.670
hopefully it's low.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.390
Amplifiers, home theaters, radios, smartphones
-- they all have noise floors.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.810
The noise floor is there no matter what, just
by the system being turned on, but it can

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.090
also be dependent on what you're listening
to!

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.090
For example, CDs have almost no noise floor
because they've been remastered digitally

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.030
to remove any noise frequencies!

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.390
Cassette tapes on the other hand, are analog,
so they have some noise floor because of that,

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.510
and some from the magnetic tape itself.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.760
The pops and cracks you hear when listening
to vinyl also contribute to the noise floor

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.870
but, in that case, some people actually like
the aesthetic.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.860
At the end of the day, we humans perceive
a noise floor in our digital devices as that

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.110
hiss in our headphones.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.810
So, when you turn up the volume, you're pushing
more power through the wires, like adding

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.700
flow to a water faucet… more electrons in
the wires can mean more noise.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.100
Really good headphones can often pick up noise
that cheap headphones simply can't… but

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.480
cheap cables or cheap components can exacerbate
the hiss.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.290
This is why some professional cables and high
end electronics cost so much, they're designed

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.420
to reduce this noise floor… and usually
have a higher signal-to-noise ratio: the signal

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.170
is stronger and clearer.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.880
Most of the time it's not a big deal, unless
you're an audiophile…

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.290
But, in the end, you can't 100 percent escape
electronics hiss.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.500
If it bothers you, swap headphones, turn the
volume down, or try a nicer cable, or better

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.690
audio encoder!

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.891
Sometimes, even using wireless connections
can reduce the hiss!

00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:51.570
Or, you could think of it as you listening
to the sound of electrons moving, which I

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.570
think is pretty rad.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.840
If you listen to music and podcasts and are
looking for a new Bluetooth speaker, try Monster’s

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.930
reimagined boombox, the Monster Blaster!

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.870
It’s available for monthly payments starting
at $25.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.010
The Monster Blaster has the power to bring
music to life indoors and out.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.290

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.070
Do you listen to music when you study?

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.070
Or work?

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:12.070
Does it help you stay focused?

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.810
Let us know in the comments and check out
this video for the science of listening to

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:15.930
music at work!
