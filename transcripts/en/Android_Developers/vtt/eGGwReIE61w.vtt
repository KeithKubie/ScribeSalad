[APPLAUSE]

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.030
ELLIE POWERS: Good
morning, everybody.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.260
Hi, I'm Ellie Powers.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.980
And I'm a product manager
here on the Google Play team.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.290
We have so many
different announcements

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.960
about what's new for all of you
app developers on Google Play

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.370
that we had to
create one session

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.750
with a whole bunch of people to
take you through all of them.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.350
But before we get
into that, I want

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.600
to take a couple
minutes to talk to you

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.760
more about why I'm really
excited to work on Google Play.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.840
I've been on the team
for about 4 1/2 years.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.060
And one of the things that
really gets me excited

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.700
even now is really
meeting each of you

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.150
and hearing your stories.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.990
For every app and game
on the Google Play Store,

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.020
there's a real story behind it.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.210
You know, I love hearing
how did you come up

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.650
with that idea for
that new app or game.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.000
What's really special
about it to you?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.310
And I love trying out
all the different apps

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.119
and seeing how they work.

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:00.660
And I love hearing
about what happens

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.630
after you launch
your app, how it's

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.330
helping you build
a business, and how

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.490
you're using that app to really
transform people's lives.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.742
So before we see what's
new in Google Play,

00:01:11.742 --> 00:01:13.200
we're going to see
a video and take

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.010
a look at some of your stories.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.244
Let's play the video.

00:01:16.244 --> 00:01:16.910
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.350
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.220
-I started running
in marathons to raise

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.937
money for Parkinson's research
in honor of my grandfather.

00:01:22.937 --> 00:01:25.270
I always had this idea that
if I could get enough people

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.200
together, then
collectively, we would

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.320
have the clout of a
celebrity and then

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.800
companies would
want to sponsor us.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.120
Being on the Android platform
has enabled us to reach people

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.925
all over the world.

00:01:34.925 --> 00:01:37.050
They can help raise money
for our charity partners.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.292
And it's helped make our
movement a global one.

00:01:40.292 --> 00:01:42.840
-It's really cool
to take your hobby

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.930
and put it into
your full-time job.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.780
Talk is an Android
app that allows

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.340
you to see all the
sensors on your vehicle

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.720
and to look at the fault codes.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.425
From the way that it's happened
on the Google Play Store,

00:01:54.425 --> 00:01:56.750
I've touched over a million
people with the app.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.807
The community has
dragged me along with it

00:01:58.807 --> 00:01:59.890
and told me what the want.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.164
I've done that for them.

00:02:01.164 --> 00:02:03.351
I'm very grateful
for where I am now.

00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:05.845
And it's staggering
to see that something

00:02:05.845 --> 00:02:08.100
I've written from
my garden shed is

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.129
liked by that many
people across the planet.

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.544
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:12.544 --> 00:02:14.665
-We started right
after university.

00:02:14.665 --> 00:02:17.440
It was myself, my
husband, and his brother.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.730
Making games was
our childhood dream.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.545
And this is what
we wanted to do.

00:02:21.545 --> 00:02:25.330
Since we released Cooking Fever
on Android, it totally clicked.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.790
We realized that
this is the way to go

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.100
and this is the
platform of the future.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.890
We had millions of downloads
within the first months.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.710
When we started, it
was just three of us.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.090
And now, we're a company of
over 100 people making games

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.600
that we decide we want to make.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.055
This has been a very
successful dream.

00:02:42.055 --> 00:02:45.447
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:45.447 --> 00:02:46.030
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.425
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:51.452 --> 00:02:53.410
ELLIE POWERS: I really
love watching this video

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.167
because it really
shares the diversity

00:02:55.167 --> 00:02:57.500
of different developers that
we have here in the Android

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.520
and Google Play community.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.850
So now, let's get on with what's
new on Google Play this year.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.490
Here at Google, we found that
we build the best products when

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.230
we're able to launch and
iterate our products using

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.550
user feedback.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.880
Products like Gmail, Chrome,
Maps, and Google Search

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.610
are all great examples of how
we've been able to do this.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.570
And we want app
developers like you to be

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.510
able to do the same things.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.300
So Google Play has been giving
all of you the biggest user

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.790
base, right, access to a
very wide range of people

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.320
all around the world.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.070
But now, it's also
become the best place

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.940
to optimize your apps,
to take on user feedback,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.120
and to measure how
your app is doing,

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.450
and to make those little tweaks
to make your app truly great.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.070
So I mentioned that I
brought a big team of people

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.820
to help me deliver
these announcements.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.720
So lightning talk style, we're
going to bring each of them

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.680
on to share something new
on Google Play with you.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.870
And with that, I'd like to
bring out our engineering

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.858
director, Miles Barr.

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:56.786
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.070
MILES BARR: Hi, I'm Miles Barr.

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.682
I'm here today to talk to you
about the pre-launch report.

00:04:04.682 --> 00:04:07.140
It's an exciting new feature
that we launched at Google I/O

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.780
this year.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.350
The pre-launch report is built
on the Firebase Test Lab.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.550
The Firebase Test Lab
is our data center

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.230
of real Android devices
where you can test your app.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.650
It allows you to test your app
across a variety of devices,

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.510
Android OS versions,
and languages.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.210
It's already performed
over one million tests

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.201
for developers like you.

00:04:30.201 --> 00:04:32.080
You can run your
own custom tests

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.070
straight from Android Studio
or from the Firebase console.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.580
Beta testing has always
been one most popular

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.490
and powerful features.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.050
But we wanted to make it
even better by performing

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.060
a comprehensive set of tests on
your app before it goes live.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.380
You can now opt in to
generating a pre-launch report

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.140
for every APK you upload to
the alpha and beta channels

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.630
in Google Play.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.710
Releasing a new version of your
app can be an exciting time.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.670
But you want to make sure
everything goes right.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.450
After about an hour, you'll get
a report summarizing any issues

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.950
we found when testing your app.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.580
The first thing we look at
is the stability of your app.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.620
We use the Firebase Test Lab to
run your app on real devices,

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.480
telling you on which devices
your app crashed on start-up,

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.160
or if it crashes after a
deeper crawl of the app.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.440
This means it won't be your
users finding the crashes

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.773
and giving you one star reviews.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.650
We also show you
what your app looks

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:37.644
like on these different devices.

00:05:37.644 --> 00:05:39.810
You get to see how it looks
like in different screen

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.020
resolutions, Android OS
versions, and languages.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.060
This allows you to spot any
problems such as overflowing

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.340
text in your translations before
your app goes live allowing you

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.120
to fix them quickly and easily.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.210
The final part of the report
highlights any security

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.890
vulnerabilities we find.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.410
This includes any versions
of third party libraries

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.540
with known vulnerabilities, or
if you've accidentally followed

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.262
any security ante-patterns.

00:06:08.262 --> 00:06:10.220
Previously, this information
was only available

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.060
after your app had gone live.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.180
The pre-launch report brings
all this information together,

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.090
telling you about
these potential issues,

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.800
allowing you to fix them before
your app goes to production,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.710
ensuring that you
and Google Play

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.580
give your users the best
experience possible.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.430
Now, I'd like to bring on
stage Kobi Glick, product

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.790
manager for Google Play.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:33.290
Thank you.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.146
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.060
KOBI GLICK: Thanks, Miles.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.890
Hi.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.560
I want to talk to you
about beta testing.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.250
Beta testing is the most popular
feature on the Google Play

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.290
Developer Console.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.930
60% of the top 1,000
apps on Google Play

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.370
are running a beta
test right now.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.660
And users notice it.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.980
Apps that run a beta test
have higher rating on average.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.925
Last year, we made it easier
for users to discover and join

00:07:03.925 --> 00:07:05.480
beta programs.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.700
With Open Beta, it's as
simple as clicking the URL.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.520
We know that you love
and use beta testing.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.230
And we often get
developer feedback,

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.410
like the one you
see from Pocket,

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.640
telling us how
beta testing helps

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.510
them connect to their users,
get feedback on new ideas,

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.960
and make sure the app is
ready to go to production.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.310
To make it even easier for
users to discover and join

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.660
beta programs, we will allow
users to join them directly

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.940
from your Store listing
page on Google Play.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:39.560
This will help you grow
larger beta programs

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.490
and connect to more testers.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.080
Now, once you have
beta testers, you

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.689
want to get their
feedback, right?

00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:48.730
You used to get the feedback
from various sources

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.220
and had two parse a
lot of information.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.040
We will allow users to
give you private feedback

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.340
directly from Google Play.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.510
This feedback is private.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.510
It goes only to you.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.920
And you can see it in the
Google Play Developer Console.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.350
"Private" means other
users don't get to see it.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:08.610
And it doesn't impact
your app star rating.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:12.030
Now, we believe that apps should
run an Open Beta test even

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.440
before they go to production.

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.980
This is why we're introducing
a new section called

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.510
Early Access on Google Play.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.260
This section will feature
exciting apps and games

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.070
that are still in development,
are running a beta test,

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.570
and haven't launched
to production yet.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.740
This will allow early adopters
and influencers to discover

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.520
those apps, try them out, and
give you valuable feedback,

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.740
helping you find product
market feet earlier,

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.169
and fine tune your game's KPI's.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.210
In our first collection,
we have 28 apps and games,

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:50.070
as you can see here, with
some pretty cool titles.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:55.960
For example, Read Feed, an
Android first online book club,

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.310
or Eva.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.530
The founder, whose parents
and sisters are deaf,

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.840
created this app to help
deaf people and people

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.317
with hearing disabilities
to participate in real life

00:09:05.317 --> 00:09:05.900
conversations.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.340
We have LEGO, the kids
and family power brand

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.270
with their first ever
in-house mobile game.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:17.036
It's a 3D LEGO set you can
touch, twist, and build,

00:09:17.036 --> 00:09:18.910
just like the brick sets
we all grew up with.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.730
This is not just for
free-to-play tiles.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:26.880
Never Alone, a gorgeous game
developed E-Line Media, who

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.310
researched together
with the Alaska natives,

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.380
is coming to Google Play on
Early Access as a premium

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.882
title.

00:09:33.882 --> 00:09:35.590
We are sure that those
changes that we're

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.630
making to beta testing will
help you grow even bigger

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.270
beta programs, get
feedback from users,

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:45.060
and make your apps and
games even more awesome.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:45.994
Thank you.

00:09:45.994 --> 00:09:49.242
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.270
I'd like to invite Wei
Chai, an engineering

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:53.735
manager on Google Play.

00:09:53.735 --> 00:09:56.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.100
WEI CHAI: Thank you.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.470
Hi.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.630
I'm here to talk about
some new features

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:06.975
for Play apps discovery.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:13.090
Google Play is the
primary destination

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:17.510
for discovering apps
and games on Android.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.920
Today, we provide
various ways in the Store

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.460
to assist users in
finding new apps

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:29.240
and to drive developer outcomes
by helping you get discovered.

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.410
Recently, we've been
developing and experimenting

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:37.840
with a new way for users to
find new apps, contextual app

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.480
discovery.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:44.250
It targets underlying needs
that drive when and why you

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.280
might need new apps.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.750
These needs could be the
ones in our everyday lives,

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:54.900
such as you learn something
new, plan a vacation,

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.230
or eat at a home.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.960
Our user studies show that
most users look for new apps

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.090
at the time they need them.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.770
Therefore, we want to
explicitly target the needs

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.030
by building contextual
collections of apps

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:18.140
so that users can find
complementary apps needed

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.010
at the same time.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.680
It also makes it
easier for users

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.220
to find apps or types of
apps they may not have

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.690
heard of before coming to Play.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.940
For example, imagine a user
is searching for a wallpaper.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.340
We might recognize that the
user is interested in a broader

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:41.980
need, personalize my phone,
and show complementary apps,

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:46.370
including not only wallpapers,
but also personalizable ,

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:49.430
keyboards themes, and ringtones.

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.270
Let's take a look
at how it works.

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.710
We identify the
underlying needs based

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:05.340
on users' searches, views,
context, and interests

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:09.400
and show complementary apps
around the need on search

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:14.350
result pages, app install
pages, or homepages,

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:15.940
where it makes sense to do so.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.310
So another example,
if the user is on app

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:31.410
install page for Trulia, maybe
he or she is buying a house.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.130
And then we'll show
great other apps

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:38.780
for finding houses for sale,
calculating your mortgage,

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:42.610
and doing interior design.

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.860
If a user is traveling
to San Francisco,

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:47.890
we might anticipate
the user's needs

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:52.630
for apps for the upcoming
trip and show a collection

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:57.055
of relevant apps for exploring
San Francisco on the user's

00:12:57.055 --> 00:12:57.555
homepage.

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:06.260
To further demonstrate the idea,
if you look at your Play Store

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:09.140
homepage now, for
some of you, based

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:11.770
on your interest
and the context,

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.950
we're showing a
collection of apps

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.770
called Best of
Google I/O, where you

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:22.460
can find nominees of this
year's Google Play awards.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:23.920
Thank you.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:30.460
Now, I would like to
continue was Fergus product

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.640
manager at Google Play.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:33.765
FERGUS HURLEY: Thanks, Wei.

00:13:33.765 --> 00:13:36.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.240
Hi, everyone.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.360
My name is Fergus Hurley.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.818
I'm product manager
on Google Play.

00:13:39.818 --> 00:13:43.050
I'm here to talk to
you about reviews.

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:45.120
So building on top of
the phenomenal engagement

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.540
that developers have had
with the reply to reviews

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:49.160
functionality, we've made
a lot of enhancements

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.743
to the ratings and
views functionality

00:13:50.743 --> 00:13:53.290
on Play over the
last few months.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.495
We've added being able to see
your ratings over time, being

00:13:56.495 --> 00:13:59.810
able to see ratings breakdown
across country, language,

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:02.510
device, be able
to see the device

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.129
metadata for each
individual review

00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:05.670
so you can be able
to understand what

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:08.440
was the RAM of that
user on that device,

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.520
and even be able to search
within all the reviews.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.910
We've also enabled you
to now be able to now get

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.337
an email notification when
a user updates their review

00:14:17.337 --> 00:14:18.295
after you've responded.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:23.470
We also added Highlights.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:25.840
These are snippets
that users see

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.490
when they come to your app
listing page on the Play Store.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:30.899
And they can be
able to see these

00:14:30.899 --> 00:14:32.690
to be able to make
their purchase decision.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.981
You'll be able to see them
into Play Developer Console.

00:14:34.981 --> 00:14:36.847
And you can be
able to figure out

00:14:36.847 --> 00:14:39.180
which ones are the ones you
want to be able to invest in

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.721
more and be able to respond to
the reviews that are happening

00:14:41.721 --> 00:14:44.650
in those Highlights.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.235
This year at I/O, we
announced reviews analysis.

00:14:47.235 --> 00:14:48.830
This includes two parts.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:50.740
The first part is Topics.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.540
Topics are unique words that are
relevant to your application.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.350
And we surface them.

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.520
For example, for this
language learning app,

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.260
"Klingon" is the topic.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.330
And you can see that there's
the average effect on rating

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.960
of each one these and the
volume distribution for each

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.580
of these topics.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.580
We even tell you what is the
effect that each one of these

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.970
is having on your overall
rating in the Play Store.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:22.960
The next part of the reviews
analysis is Benchmarks.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.900
Benchmarks shows you what are
the common topics that people

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.920
talk about your application and
nearly all other applications

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.470
on the Play Store.

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:35.280
You can be able to see design,
stability, resource usage.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.310
And then you can
be able to see how

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:40.690
you compare to the other apps
in your category in the Play

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:41.190
Store.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:45.810
We also show you
what is the effect

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:47.310
that each one of
these common topics

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.820
is having on your
rating in the Play Store

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.910
so you can be able to
prioritize your investment

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.140
of your resources and even
have your team be able to go in

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:57.490
and be able to read all
the reviews about design.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:00.880
For now, reviews analysis works
for English only and only when

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.902
you have a certain
number of reviews that

00:16:02.902 --> 00:16:04.110
fall within these categories.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:11.432
So when we have all these
reviews on the Play Store

00:16:11.432 --> 00:16:13.140
and we have this
ability to be able to do

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.760
reviews analysis
on all the reviews,

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.820
we said, let's have a
look at all the reviews

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.090
and see what are the
common topics that

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:21.840
are impacting one-star and
five-star reviews to help

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.030
developers be able to
prioritize their investments

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:26.780
and be able to find out how to
get a higher rating on Play.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.230
What we found is that across
all the one-star reviews that

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.540
have a common topic,
50% are about stability.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.970
So really investing in building
a high quality app that does

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.080
not crash is really important.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.820
We also found that
for when you want

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.150
to get your app
to a five-star app

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:44.570
and you fix the
stability issues,

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:47.780
really investing in design,
performance, and usability,

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.960
and speed of your application
is really, really important

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:54.350
because that results in 65%
of the five-star reviews.

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:01.100
We also launched at I/O
this year the reviews API.

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.860
This enables you to
be able to respond

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.210
to your reviews
on the Play Store

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.730
with whatever workflow
you use yourself to be

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.240
able to do custom support.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.349
We partnered with zendesk and
conversocial on this launch.

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:14.670
And you can be able to
use those tools today

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:19.310
to be able to start responding
to your Play Store reviews.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:22.239
I'm now going to hand over
to Riccardo Govoni, who's

00:17:22.239 --> 00:17:23.883
the engineering manager on Play.

00:17:23.883 --> 00:17:26.781
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:28.713 --> 00:17:30.490
RICCARDO GOVONI: Hello.

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:32.500
So today, I'm here
to give you tips

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.980
on how you can better
understand who your users are

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.060
and where they come from.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.090
You're probably familiar with
the use of acquisition reports

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:44.150
that we launched in the Play
Developer Console last year.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:46.990
It tells you how many
Store listing visitors

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.970
installed your app and
converted into buyers.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:52.380
And it does so by breaking
the information down

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.502
by acquisition channel.

00:17:53.502 --> 00:17:55.960
So you know how many people
discovered your app organically

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.740
in the Play Store versus
coming from different channels

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.790
like your website or
AdWords campaigns.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.080
Over the past year, we
received great feedback

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.710
about this feature, like
this one from Trulia.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.590
And it helped many developers
like you optimize your business

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.900
in Play.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.920
So you'll be happy to
hear that we recently

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.880
announced a new feature, being
able to measure your user

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.957
acquisition performance
at the country level.

00:18:20.957 --> 00:18:22.540
And this is great
when you're entering

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.130
new markets, like emerging
ones, like Brazil or India,

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.650
and really optimize your app
experience for all your users

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.540
across the world.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.790
But optimizing your business
performance in isolation

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.060
is not really that helpful.

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:39.630
How do you know,
for example, if you

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:41.910
look at your organic
conversion rate,

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.560
if it is as good as it could be,
if you're leaving opportunities

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.880
on the table?

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.930
So right now, it's
not that easy.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:52.320
But we're about to
make it a lot better.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.540
So soon, we will be launching
another great feature,

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.160
benchmarks against
your peers, so you

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.080
will be able to compare how your
Store listing commercial rate

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:07.850
fares against similar
apps in your category.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:11.010
First, we'll provide
an overall benchmark

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.230
about your organic user
acquisition performance.

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.500
And this will give you an
indication on how your store

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.480
listing is performing globally.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.720
But more, you will be also
able to measure your user

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.880
acquisition performance
at the country

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.160
level against the
benchmark at that level.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.840
For example, here, you
can see that our app is

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.740
getting some traction in Korea.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.330
But at 24%, we are lagging
behind the benchmark.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:37.940
This is a moment
where maybe you want

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.670
to review the quality of your
Store listing translations

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:42.460
or consider localizing
your assets.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:46.690
We'll also give
you an indication

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:49.310
on how you're progressing
against the benchmark.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.740
So you know if you still
have room for improvement

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:57.060
or if you're really among
the best and aim for the top.

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.750
And when you're
ready to take action,

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.490
Play Developer
Console has plenty

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.640
of features to help you
optimize your Store listing

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.050
performance and your
original success,

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.140
such as Store listing
experiments or app translation

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.270
services.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.170
And we'll offer
recommendation about those

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.470
right next to the benchmarking
results when relevant.

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.890
So this everything I have
in Store for you today.

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.410
I believe that with country
breakdowns and benchmarks,

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.430
you will be able to even better
optimize your business in Play.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.805
Benchmarks are going to roll
out over the next few weeks.

00:20:26.805 --> 00:20:28.540
Country breakdowns
is already there.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.200
Go give it a try.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.140
And now, I'd like to introduce
on stage Mona Vajolahi, product

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:34.200
manager on Play.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.087
Thank you.

00:20:35.087 --> 00:20:38.010
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.330
MONA VAJOLAHI: Thanks, Riccardo.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:41.970
I'm here to talk
about what we are

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:46.700
doing in Google Play for
that next billion users.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:49.710
Android is growing really
fast in emerging markets.

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:55.120
By 2018, we expect 1.2
billion new Android users

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.510
to come online in
emerging markets.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:00.170
In Google Play, we've
been working really hard

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.770
to make sure those users have
a great experience, especially

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:08.050
given some of the infrastructure
challenges in those markets.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:11.510
One key pillar is to have
a product and an ecosystem

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:14.760
of apps that work well
on slow connections

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.820
and on low end devices.

00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:19.920
Our user studies have
shown over and over again

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:23.400
that connectivity and data
challenges affect all users

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.360
in emerging markets,
regardless of where they leave

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.250
or how much money they make.

00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:30.780
Connectivity challenges
are here to stay.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:35.075
By 2020, still 300
million users in India

00:21:35.075 --> 00:21:39.260
will be on connection times
that are equivalent of 2G.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.020
And even when
Wi-Fi is available,

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.890
it is often patchy
and unreliable.

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:48.710
So one of the key areas of
focus for us in Google Play

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:53.310
has been to build an experience
that is fast, lightweight,

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:57.300
and reliable, where every user,
regardless of their connection

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:02.430
time, can find and download
apps that meet their needs.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.910
Over the past year,
we have optimized

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:07.070
the performance of
the Play Store app

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:09.630
and made it much faster on 2G.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.750
We have also reduced
the amount of data

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:14.990
used by the Store itself
and for key activities

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:18.080
like downloading apps
and updating apps.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.480
These changes have brought
more users to the Store.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.540
They visit the store more often.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.925
And they download more apps.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.580
We also know that our users
everywhere, especially

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:34.760
in emerging markets, want
a Store experience that

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:38.270
reflects their local interests
and the needs of their country

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:39.720
and their region.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.150
We've been working closely
with local developers

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:44.810
in markets like India
and Brazil to make

00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:48.690
sure those apps reach their
local audience in the Store.

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.740
In addition, we have been
supercharging our editorial

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.800
content in the Store
to make sure users

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.900
are able to easily find
locally relevant apps that

00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.160
meet the needs of
different segments of users

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.020
in the market.

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:04.940
And with that, I'd
like to bring up

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:09.160
to stage Kunal Soni, who is the
head of apps and games business

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.770
development in Southeast Asia.

00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:11.270
Thank you.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:14.066
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:17.100
KUNAL SONI: Thanks, Mona.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:17.870
Hi, everyone.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.140
I'm here to talk to you
about creating great quality

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.280
apps that'll work effectively,
not just for smartphone users

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.870
today, but also for
the next billion users

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:29.490
as they get connected
in the years to come.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.930
We're seeing incredible
momentum in emerging markets

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:33.410
all around the world.

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:37.090
They're expected to account for
80% of total smartphone growth

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.040
globally.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.350
In order to be relevant and
successful in these markets,

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.580
it's important for us
to design the right app

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:50.850
experience aimed at solving
three important challenges.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:57.240
Firstly, while 4G and LTE and
other network technologies

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:01.030
will grow fast, there will still
be one billion mobile internet

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:04.780
users in 2020 who will be on 2G.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:09.220
That's a sizable segment for you
to think about and solve for.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:12.240
Secondly, mobile data
speeds vary a lot

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.410
across markets requiring
you to tailor the app

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:18.390
experience accordingly.

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:22.220
And finally, data is expensive
relative to income levels

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.770
in several markets.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.950
And therefore,
helping your users

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:30.850
manage their data cost should
be an important priority.

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:33.280
In order to help you
tackle these challenges

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.110
and support your
growth, we've identified

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:38.260
a set of tools
and best practices

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.650
that we believe can help you.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:42.150
This is what is
called the Building

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:44.780
for Billions Framework,
focused on three

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:49.890
important areas, connectivity,
device compatibility, and data

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:51.310
cost.

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:52.770
By the way, what
I'm covering here

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:55.100
is by no means limited
to emerging markets.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.510
These principles will apply
equally well across the world.

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:02.350
Let's start by looking
at connectivity.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:05.230
In order to optimize for
unreliable or intermittent

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.400
connectivity, ensure
that your app prioritizes

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:14.060
bandwidth requests, fetching
text before rich media or data.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.920
Ensure that you offer a
great offline experience

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.670
so that all your
users can interact

00:25:18.670 --> 00:25:22.510
with the app at all times,
regardless of connectivity

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:26.250
using cached data.

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:28.300
Let's talk about devices.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:32.370
Many devices in emerging markets
have smaller, lower resolution

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:33.580
screens.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:37.600
In order to ensure a seamless
user experience across devices,

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.630
use density independent pixels
while defining app layouts.

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:44.500
Ensure that your graphics
and text work well

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.540
on low and medium
density screens.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.160
And adjust your memory
footprint dynamically

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.810
to ensure compatibility across
devices with different RAM

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:56.700
configurations.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.890
Finally, let's talk
about data cost.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:02.170
The first cost your
users will incur

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:04.810
will be related to the cost
of installation of your app.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:08.115
And therefore, it's important
to keep a tight focus

00:26:08.115 --> 00:26:11.160
on reducing the
APK size, ideally

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.720
well below 10 megabytes.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.250
In order to accomplish
this, you should

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.780
reduce the number
and size of images

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.540
within the APK using tools
like WebP and scalable vector

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:25.100
graphics or SVG.

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.780
You can shrink the code
size of your APK using tools

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:32.540
like Proguard, which
remove unused code.

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.080
And finally, you can
consider Multi-APK

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.910
as an option to create
APK's split by density

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:41.030
so that users target
the right version

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:46.300
of the app that specifically
targets their device density.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.804
With that, we come to
the end of my session.

00:26:48.804 --> 00:26:50.220
If you're interested
to know more,

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:52.344
do join us for the session
on Building for Billions

00:26:52.344 --> 00:26:55.350
in Android, today at 3:00 PM.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:58.220
Next, I'd like to invite
Milena Nikolic, engineering

00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.480
manager on Google Play.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.420
Thank you.

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.130
MILENA NIKOLIC: Thank you.

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:06.640
Thanks, Kunal.

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:10.540
Hi, I'm Milena, engineering
manager on Google Play.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:13.930
I'm here to talk to you
about Play Console app.

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:17.110
Yes, we have finally launched
an Android app for Google Play

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.940
Developer Console.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:21.740
Thank you, thank you.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.480
We have to admit that
it took us a while.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.520
It took us much longer
than it took you guys.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:26.930
But we've made it.

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:29.980
And we can tell you this
app stuff is pretty sweet.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:33.290
We really like it now.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:37.930
Our new app can help you follow
the performance of your app

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:42.030
on Google Play and do time
critical actions on the go.

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:44.100
When you're rapidly
iterating, you

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.330
need a powerful tool that's
in your pocket all the time.

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:50.890
And we've built Play Console
app exactly with those use cases

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:52.220
in mind.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.370
Whether you're looking to
quickly reply to user review

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.170
or to show off the
performance of your app

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:59.740
when running to a
meeting, Play Console app

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:03.360
should be there to support you.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.410
Regarding an
initial feature set,

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:08.050
obviously, you can check
installs and uninstalls

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:10.030
of your app and you
can break them down

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:11.870
based on a number of
different dimensions,

00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:16.160
including country, device,
app version, and much more.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.990
In addition to that,
you can check out

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:23.160
crash reports, including hourly
data and full stack traces.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.660
You can also follow your
app's ratings and reviews.

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:28.820
And you can reply to reviews.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:30.830
You can also follow the
state of your release

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.750
as it moves from beta
through stage rollout,

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.360
all the way to
production and much more.

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.870
Oh, also, you can get
push notifications

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.320
when something important
happens with your app,

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.680
for example, when your
app update goes live.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.550
App is now available
on Google Play.

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:51.270
In the last 24 hours
since we launched it,

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:55.330
more than 10,000 developers
installed it and rated it

00:28:55.330 --> 00:29:01.720
at 4.85 stars on average.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.830
If you're not among
those 10,000 developers,

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:06.140
please, please go
and install it.

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.940
We think you'll
find it very useful.

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.859
Also, we are very keen
to hear your feedback.

00:29:10.859 --> 00:29:12.900
So please send us an easy
feedback that you have.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.120
We plan to work on it.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.200
We plan to add much
more functionality

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.174
in the next couple of versions.

00:29:19.174 --> 00:29:20.590
And if you're still
not convinced,

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:23.470
please do come visit us in the
Play Sandbox, where you can

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:25.270
see it in action for yourself.

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:26.252
Thank you.

00:29:26.252 --> 00:29:30.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.490
Next, I would like to invite
Suresh Ganapathy and Shobana

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:35.110
Ravi.

00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:38.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.760
SURESH GANAPATHY:
Thanks, Milena.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.970
So we showed you a sneak
preview of Android Instant

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:43.720
Apps at the keynote yesterday.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.930
Today, I want to tell
you a little bit more

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:47.580
about how to build
Android Instant

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:51.610
Apps and the new opportunities
that this could open up.

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:54.330
First, let's do a quick recap
of the announcement yesterday,

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:56.580
for those of you
who weren't around.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.770
So Android Instant Apps
lets you access apps

00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:02.090
by simply tapping on
links, even if you

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:03.980
don't have the app installed.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:07.370
As a developer, this means
that this is just an upgrade

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.120
to your existing Android app.

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.550
This is not a new, separate app.

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:14.160
It's compatible with
Android Jelly Bean and up

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.030
and will reach over
a billion users.

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:19.190
Now, we understand that
this is a big change.

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:20.540
And we want to get it right.

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:22.680
So we're going to be
rolling this out gradually

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:27.280
to both users and developers
over the next year.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:29.570
So let's talk about how
you'd upgrade your app

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:31.810
to run instantly.

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:34.400
As a developer, you
start by telling us

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.860
the links to your domain
that your app can open.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.790
This is really easy to do
with Android App Links, which

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:41.620
we announced last year.

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.090
Next, if your app
is really big, you

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:47.030
may want to consider is
splitting it into modules.

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:49.830
This allows Google Play
to download only the parts

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:52.710
of the app that are
required on the fly when

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.390
the user taps on the link.

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:58.660
Next, we think
that users may have

00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:01.210
slightly different
expectations of what an app can

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.060
do when it's running instantly.

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.550
So Instant Apps will not have
access to some capabilities,

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:08.770
like creating a
homescreen widget.

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.960
Finally, we're building
a whole new set

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:14.220
of features for
Instant Apps that we

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.170
want you to take advantage of.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:18.750
My favorite is run
time permissions.

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.960
Android Instant Apps will
use run time permissions

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.710
going all the way
back to Jelly Bean.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:29.445
Now, I want to talk a little
bit about some new opportunities

00:31:29.445 --> 00:31:32.480
that Instant Apps could open up.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.570
We've hacked together
a couple of fun demos

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:36.280
that I want to show
you as examples.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:40.210
Can we switch to the
demo feed, please?

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:41.910
OK.

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:45.640
So Instant Apps lets you deliver
the same rich and immersive

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:49.170
experiences to both users
who have installed your app

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:51.250
and the ones who haven't.

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:54.540
So the demo here is-- my buddy
Jake created this really cool

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:55.830
photo sharing app.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:57.590
It can capture panoramic
and display them

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:59.270
in a really unique way.

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:01.900
Now, he sent me a picture
that he captured with this app

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.930
when he was on a
trip to Machu Picchu.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:07.340
I really want to see the
picture that he shared,

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:10.350
but I'm not quite sure if I
want to install the app as yet.

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:12.885
With Instant Apps,
this is not a problem.

00:32:12.885 --> 00:32:15.960
All I have to do is tap a link.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:20.090
With one tap, the app
opens up, instantly

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:24.040
deep linked right to the
panorama that Jake shared.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.610
It even uses the
sensors on the phone

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:31.030
to pan the image as
Shobana moves the device.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:32.226
Isn't that amazing?

00:32:32.226 --> 00:32:36.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:37.790
Thank you.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:40.050
At the other end
of the spectrum,

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:43.520
Instant Apps also lets you
create very lightweight apps

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.900
that don't even have to
take the user out of context

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:47.660
to what they were doing.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.242
Shobana and I recently made
plans to go to a concert.

00:32:50.242 --> 00:32:51.200
So I booked my tickets.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.390
It's a Shins concert.

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:55.580
And I sent her a message
asking her to book hers.

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:58.150
Now, she doesn't have the
ticketing app on her phone.

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:02.440
When he taps the link, the
app opens up instantly.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.560
But it didn't open up
as a full-screen app.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.596
It opened up just as a dialogue.

00:33:07.596 --> 00:33:09.595
It has all the information
she needs pre-filled.

00:33:09.595 --> 00:33:11.590
Her seats are
right next to mine.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:14.770
And with Android Pay,
it's one tap to pay,

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:17.090
all of this while
of the Hangouts app

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:18.215
is still in the background.

00:33:18.215 --> 00:33:19.120
[CHEERING]

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.970
Shobana-- thank you.

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.450
Shobana didn't have to leave
her conversation with me

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:28.960
to buy these tickets.

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.780
This can be really
interesting if you

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:33.320
want to help the user
complete a simple task

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.250
with as little
friction as possible.

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:39.147
So those are the two examples
that we have for you today.

00:33:39.147 --> 00:33:40.230
Can we switch back please?

00:33:46.635 --> 00:33:48.010
Can we switch back
to the slides?

00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:00.480
We'll be just a moment.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.460
Perfect.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:04.290
I wanted you to see the
URL so you can learn more.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:07.190
So if you go g.co forward
slash Instant Apps,

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:09.110
you can learn more.

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:10.690
There is a sign-up
form if you're

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:13.929
interested in upgrading
your app to run instantly.

00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:16.810
With that, I'd like to
introduce Purnima Kochikar, who

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:19.341
leads Play's global business
development team, on stage.

00:34:19.341 --> 00:34:19.840
Thank you.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.612
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:24.151 --> 00:34:25.650
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR:
Thank you, Suresh.

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:28.286
How many think that
Instant Apps are amazing?

00:34:28.286 --> 00:34:31.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.330
You know, I have
been so excited.

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:38.050
I was in a Uber this morning
and it was on the radio.

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:40.662
And I was, like,
thrilled to bits.

00:34:40.662 --> 00:34:41.620
Good morning, everyone.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.409
I am Purnima Kochikar.

00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:45.739
And I work for you.

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:48.980
My team and I have
the great privilege

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:51.130
to work with each
and every one of you

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:56.250
to help you build successful
businesses on Google Play.

00:34:56.250 --> 00:35:01.700
Android powers
increasingly new screens

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:06.260
across new markets, empowering
people across the world.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:12.830
And it is this scale that allows
Google Play to provide you

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:17.940
the largest app distribution
platform in the world.

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:20.090
Let's look at some numbers.

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:26.850
In 2015, one billion
monthly active users

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:34.970
across 190 countries
drove 65 billion installs

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:35.740
on Google Play.

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:38.910
Mind boggling, isn't it?

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:46.090
In 2015, the number
of game developers

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:50.680
who had a game with more
than one million installs

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:54.460
grew by over 50%, which
means more people are

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.840
being successful.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.920
And if you look back and you
say, OK, that is installs.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.830
There is more installs per game.

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:03.530
But are we making money?

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:09.310
In 2015, the average
spend-per-user across Play

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:14.580
grew by all over 30%
when compared to 2014.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:19.480
So as you can see, we have a
very thriving community waiting

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:22.040
for the things that you create.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:25.470
These are incredibly
impressive numbers.

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:30.720
But not of it would be
possible without you,

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.720
our developer community.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.620
So where I sit on
a daily basis, we

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:46.610
see developers across
the world, big and small,

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:52.110
creating apps that change
lives and games that delight.

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:57.400
Each day, my team and I
are inspired and humbled

00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.560
by how you are taking
your personal passions

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:04.540
and converting them into
successful businesses.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.870
I hope the video
that Ellie shared

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:13.080
with you was as inspirational
to you as it is to us.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.740
Over the last year, we
connected with one million

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:21.750
of you across various channels
to help you understand

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:24.410
and access the tools
we are building,

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:28.125
as well as to tell you what the
market opportunities that are

00:37:28.125 --> 00:37:29.165
there in front of you.

00:37:29.165 --> 00:37:33.070
You heard today, emerging
markets, new ways

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:35.370
to build your business,
all these tools really

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:37.085
help you build your business.

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:42.840
Now, here's the
interesting thing.

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.240
Each of those
instances we learned,

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.280
we figured out how to
improve our products.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:53.240
So I hope you take the time
to visit us in the Sandbox

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.270
to tell us how we
can do things better.

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:58.270
And I'm also excited
to see what you

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.390
will do with the
new capabilities

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:03.670
that we have announced today.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:05.740
We also use this
opportunity to get

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:07.600
you connected with each other.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:12.220
How many of you are sitting with
people that you already know?

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:14.900
Should you be?

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:18.410
So I hope you take this
opportunity to really step out

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:21.560
and meet each other, understand
what everybody is doing.

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:24.630
There are people from
around the globe here today.

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:27.760
It is a unique opportunity.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:32.880
And therefore, I am
extremely excited to announce

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:39.060
