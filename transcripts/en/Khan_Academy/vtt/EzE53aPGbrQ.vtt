00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.440
"A cylindrical log has
a diameter of 12 inches.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.010
A wedge is cut from the log
by making two planar cuts that

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.630
go entirely through the log.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.100
The first is perpendicular
to the axis of the cylinder,

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.150
and the plane of the second
cut forms a 45 degree angle

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.850
with the plane of the first cut.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.750
The intersection
of these two planes

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.940
has exactly one point
in common with the log.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.440
The number of cubic
inches in the wedge

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.280
can be expressed as n pi,
where n is a positive integer.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.630
Find n."

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.680
So let's think about it.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.040
So let's just draw what
they're describing.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.700
So we have a
cylindrical log that

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.590
has a diameter of 12 inches.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.700
So let's draw that.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.080
So let me draw it like this.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.830
So that is a cross
section of the log.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.880
It has a diameter of 12 inches.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.600
So this is 12 inches.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.410
And it is a cylinder,
so it looks like this.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.130
That is our log.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.740
That is the log in question.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.020
A wedge is cut from the log
by making two planar cuts that

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.200
go entirely through the log.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.330
The first cut is perpendicular
to the axis of the cylinder.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.740
So it would go-- it'd
really just cut it--

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.160
it would just cut it straight.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.701
That's another way
to think about it.

00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:22.180
It's perpendicular to
the axis of the cylinder.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.470
The axis of the cylinder
goes through the cylinder,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.230
like that.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.820
I don't want to do
that; it'll make

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.620
the diagram a little confusing.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.130
If the log was transparent,
our cut would look like this.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.840
This first cut would just go
through the log like this.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.500
It would really just form
a cross section of the log.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.500
So that's the first cut.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.725
The first is perpendicular
to the axis of the cylinder.

00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:47.130
And the plane of the second
cut forms a 45 degree angle

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.920
with the plane of the first cut.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.850
So that thing is going to
come in at a 45 degree angle.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.260
So it's going to cut into
our log something like that.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.400
Something like that,
right over there.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.900
The intersection
of these two planes

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.620
has exactly one point
in common with the log.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.060
That would be this
point, right over here.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.190
So we need to find the
number of cubic inches

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.460
in the wedge, expressed
as n pi, and then we

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.390
have to figure out n.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.080
So let's draw this wedge, this
wedge that we've cut out here.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.080
So this right here is our wedge.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.010
Let me take it out and
kind of flip it around.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.750
So the base of--
I'll make the base

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.000
of the wedge the
perpendicular cut.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.310
This cut right over here.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.950
So that is the
base of the wedge.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.020
That is our base.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.430
And then you can do the top
of our cut to be the magenta,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.230
the 45 degree angle cut.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.200
So maybe I'll draw it like this.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.410
So it would look
something like this.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.780
I'm trying my best to draw it.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.970
That's really the
hard part, here.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.380
So let me draw the
45 degree angle cut.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.930
It's going to look
something like that, where

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.940
this angle right over
here-- so if I were

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.819
to go-- the diameter of this
top thing, it's actually,

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.360
it's not going to
be a normal circle.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.010
It's going to be
more elliptical.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.700
But the diameter
of this top thing

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.270
versus the diameter
of the base, which

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.170
is the diameter of a
circle, this right here

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.720
is going to be a
45 degree angle.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.237
Now when I first
looked at this problem,

00:03:20.237 --> 00:03:21.820
there's all sorts
of temptations here.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.350
Maybe you use some calculus.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.340
Maybe you use some-- you rotate
something around some axis

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.380
to find the volume.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.130
Maybe you can take some
type of average, here.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.299
And you probably could
do something like that.

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.840
But the easiest
thing here-- and this

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.240
is kind of-- whenever
you see these kind

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.790
of competition-type
math problems--

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.000
and this comes from
the 2003 AIM exam--

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.710
is that there should be
a quick way to do it.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.180
And for this exam,
particular, you

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.972
shouldn't have to use
any type of calculus.

00:03:47.972 --> 00:03:49.805
And so, if you find
yourself doing something

00:03:49.805 --> 00:03:51.390
tedious and hairy,
you're probably not

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.230
seeing the easiest way
to do this problem.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.160
And this problem is actually
ridiculously easy to do,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.770
if you just see the trick here.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.130
And the trick here is,
instead of just directly

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.890
trying to solve for the volume
of this figure, right here,

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.540
take another one of these guys,
and flip it over, and put it

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.510
on top of him.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.010
So let's say, if
you did that, you

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.260
would have another thing on
top of it, just like that.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.262
So if I just took
two of these wedges

00:04:15.262 --> 00:04:17.720
and stacked them on top of each
other-- flipped one of them

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.590
and stacked them on top of each
other, it would look like that.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.120
This is another
wedge right here.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.240
So I took their angled
faces and put them

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.300
right on top of each other.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.460
And so if you took two wedges
together, flip one of them,

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.642
and put it on top of the
other, what do you get?

00:04:35.642 --> 00:04:38.100
So the equivalent-- I could
draw the green wedge right over

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.900
here.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.250
The green wedge
would look like this,

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.440
where its base looks like this.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.450
So what would two wedges put in
this configuration look like?

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.850
Well, it's just a cylinder, now.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.475
And it now is a cylinder.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.510
So this is a cylinder
with a diameter of 12.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.100
So that diameter is 12.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.060
But in order to figure out
the volume of a cylinder,

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.214
you still need to figure out
the height of the cylinder.

00:05:03.214 --> 00:05:05.630
You still have to figure out
this length, right over here.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.125
You still have to figure out
what the height is equal to.

00:05:08.125 --> 00:05:10.500
You have to figure out what
this length, right over here,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.540
is equal to.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.545
And that's where the
45 degrees helps us.

00:05:13.545 --> 00:05:15.350
Well, the 45 degrees
already helped us,

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.270
because if you flipped the
thing over and put it on top,

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.751
it forms a nice cylinder for us.

00:05:20.751 --> 00:05:22.250
If it was another
angle, it wouldn't

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.350
have been a nice, clean
cylinder, like this.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.980
But the 45 degrees also
tells us what this height is.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.120
And let's just think about
it, here, for a second.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.203
This triangle that I had
drawn, in the beginning--

00:05:32.203 --> 00:05:35.179
let me draw this in--
well, I already used blue.

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:36.220
Let me draw it in yellow.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.990
So if I were to
take the diameter

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.912
of the angled surface-- and
once again, it's not a circle,

00:05:43.912 --> 00:05:45.620
but it's kind of a
stretched-out circle--

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.360
and I took the
diameter of the base,

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.940
they form a 45 degree angle.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.870
So this is 45 degrees.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.310
This right here is also
going to be 45 degrees.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.350
This length, over
here, we know--

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.690
we know this length, right
over here, is going to be 12.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.130
Now, this right here
is a 45-45-90 triangle.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.390
Let me draw it like this.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.200
I could draw it like this.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.367
This right here is
45-45-90 triangle.

00:06:15.367 --> 00:06:17.200
And you might say, how
did I know that's 45?

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.780
Well, this is going to be a
right angle, right over here.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.120
And the sum of the angles
have to add up to 180.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.170
And then, if you have
45 and 90 already, then

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.570
this one has to be 45 degrees.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.150
And in 45-45-90 triangle, this
side is equal to that side.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:32.816
It is an isosceles triangle.

00:06:32.816 --> 00:06:34.190
The two base angles
are the same,

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.170
so the two sides are
going to be the same.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.890
So if this side, right
over here, is 12,

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.690
then this side, right
over here-- this side,

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.320
right over here is 12.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.020
So the height is going
to be equal to 12.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.650
So let's figure out the
volume of this cylinder that's

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.390
essentially two
wedges, and then we

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.590
can take half of that to
find the volume of one wedge.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.550
And to find the
volume of a cylinder,

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.990
you just have to find the area
of the top of the cylinder.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.450
And to find that, it's going to
be pi times the radius squared.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.770
The radius here is 6, 1/2 of 12.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.090
So the area is pi r squared.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.290
So it's 36 pi--
that's that area--

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:17.720
times the height-- times 12.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.620
And so the whole
volume, our volume

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.810
is going to be equal
to-- what's that?

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.770
360 plus 70.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.960
Let me just multiply it out.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.626
I don't want to make
a careless mistake.

00:07:26.626 --> 00:07:27.660
36 times 12.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.470
36 times 2 is 72.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.070
1 times 36 is 36.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.590
2, 13, 4.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.660
So it's 432 pi.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.110
Now we have to be very careful.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.710
This is the volume
of two wedges.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.300
So this is the volume of
two wedges, I could call it.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.656
So the volume of one wedge,
is going to be 1/2 of this.

00:07:51.656 --> 00:07:53.500
Let me do this in
a different color.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:59.780
The volume of one wedge is going
to be 1/2 of this, or 216 pi.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.350
And so if we want to
find n, because they say,

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:04.170
the number of cubic
inches in the wedge

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.870
can be expressed as n pi.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.380
It's 216 pi, where n
is a positive integer.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.000
