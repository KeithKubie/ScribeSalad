that he's evolving it they want him to
 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.849 align:start position:0%
that he's evolving it they want him to
genuinely<00:03:03.819><c> evolve</c><00:03:04.269><c> but</c><00:03:05.139><c> they</c><00:03:05.439><c> also</c><00:03:05.620><c> don't</c>

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 align:start position:0%
genuinely evolve but they also don't
 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.979 align:start position:0%
genuinely evolve but they also don't
want<00:03:05.980><c> him</c><00:03:06.189><c> to</c><00:03:06.250><c> hurt</c><00:03:06.370><c> himself</c><00:03:06.609><c> and</c><00:03:07.180><c> rightfully</c>

want him to hurt himself and rightfully
 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.259 align:start position:0%
want him to hurt himself and rightfully
so<00:03:08.019><c> if</c><00:03:08.500><c> these</c><00:03:08.680><c> were</c><00:03:08.859><c> real</c><00:03:08.889><c> he</c><00:03:09.730><c> would</c><00:03:09.909><c> be</c><00:03:10.090><c> a</c>

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 align:start position:0%
so if these were real he would be a
 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.789 align:start position:0%
so if these were real he would be a
million<00:03:10.510><c> pieces</c><00:03:10.780><c> by</c><00:03:11.079><c> now</c><00:03:11.230><c> he's</c><00:03:11.409><c> whooping</c>

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
million pieces by now he's whooping
 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.349 align:start position:0%
million pieces by now he's whooping
squash<00:03:12.159><c> he</c><00:03:12.310><c> would</c><00:03:12.459><c> have</c><00:03:12.549><c> made</c><00:03:12.669><c> it</c><00:03:12.790><c> through</c><00:03:13.000><c> up</c>

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
squash he would have made it through up
 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.179 align:start position:0%
squash he would have made it through up
until<00:03:13.780><c> the</c><00:03:13.870><c> spikes</c><00:03:14.109><c> and</c><00:03:14.260><c> yeah</c><00:03:14.620><c> you</c><00:03:14.680><c> know</c><00:03:15.010><c> be</c>

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:15.189 align:start position:0%
until the spikes and yeah you know be
 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
until the spikes and yeah you know be
dead<00:03:15.370><c> so</c><00:03:15.609><c> you</c><00:03:15.699><c> can't</c><00:03:15.909><c> blame</c><00:03:16.120><c> him</c><00:03:16.329><c> but</c><00:03:16.750><c> it's</c>
