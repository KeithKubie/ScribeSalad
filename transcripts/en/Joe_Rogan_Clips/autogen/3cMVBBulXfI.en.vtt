where you're gonna be at anything yeah
 

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.520
where you're gonna be at anything yeah
yeah the problem is if you're training

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:36.530
yeah the problem is if you're training
 

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.640
yeah the problem is if you're training
hard that 8 to 10 is so huge you might

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:39.650
hard that 8 to 10 is so huge you might
 

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.710
hard that 8 to 10 is so huge you might
get hit with a punch if they wake you up

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:41.720
get hit with a punch if they wake you up
 

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.260

after like 6 hours or five hours it's

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:44.270
after like 6 hours or five hours it's
 

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.720
after like 6 hours or five hours it's
possible that a punch might connect on

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:46.730
possible that a punch might connect on
 

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.280
possible that a punch might connect on
you that wouldn't have connected if you

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:48.290
you that wouldn't have connected if you
 

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.080
you that wouldn't have connected if you
got ate that's not precious yeah yeah

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:17.960
yeah I mean I get the testing but I feel
 

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.600
yeah I mean I get the testing but I feel
like the testing so sophisticated you

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:19.610
like the testing so sophisticated you
 

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.540

earlier the better right maybe I don't
 

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:38.920
earlier the better right maybe I don't

they've got these new methods of
 

00:08:47.899 --> 00:08:52.059
they've got these new methods of
detection and EPO s12 that apparently

it's out of my wheelhouse to deal with
 

00:09:36.259 --> 00:09:38.170
it's out of my wheelhouse to deal with
but also it's hard to have an answer

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:38.180
but also it's hard to have an answer
 

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.730
but also it's hard to have an answer
like you said like do we go back and

like you said like do we go back and
 

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.049
like you said like do we go back and
keep testing them when these new things

is just it just get like you said it's

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:27.690
is just it just get like you said it's
 

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.110
is just it just get like you said it's
just gonna take away from what I've seen

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:30.120
just gonna take away from what I've seen
 

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.569
just gonna take away from what I've seen
of as and then and the more I imagine

00:13:32.569 --> 00:13:32.579
of as and then and the more I imagine
 

00:13:32.579 --> 00:13:34.040
of as and then and the more I imagine
about it it's just going to be more take

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:34.050
about it it's just going to be more take
 

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.860
about it it's just going to be more take
away and then anything I could say or

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:36.870
away and then anything I could say or
 

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.629
away and then anything I could say or
think about I can't think of anything

00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639
think about I can't think of anything
 

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:42.680
think about I can't think of anything
that solution or our system yeah yeah

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:42.690
that solution or our system yeah yeah
 

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.620
that solution or our system yeah yeah
yeah I don't think anybody I mean I

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:45.630
yeah I don't think anybody I mean I
 

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.120
yeah I don't think anybody I mean I
think we're in this stage right now

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:47.130
think we're in this stage right now
 

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:48.379
think we're in this stage right now
where they're probably looking at the

00:13:48.379 --> 00:13:48.389
where they're probably looking at the
 

00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:51.290
where they're probably looking at the
data going okay what is this signify and

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:51.300
data going okay what is this signify and
 

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:52.850
data going okay what is this signify and
how many more people should we test

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:52.860
how many more people should we test
 

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.759
how many more people should we test
mm-hmm no once once they develop a new

00:13:55.759 --> 00:13:55.769
mm-hmm no once once they develop a new
 

00:13:55.769 --> 00:13:56.990
mm-hmm no once once they develop a new
method of testing that's the whole

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000
method of testing that's the whole
 

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.250
method of testing that's the whole
reason why they want to keep the old

00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:58.260
reason why they want to keep the old
 

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.319
reason why they want to keep the old
samples anyway in case new more

00:14:00.319 --> 00:14:00.329
samples anyway in case new more
 

00:14:00.329 --> 00:14:02.840
samples anyway in case new more
sensitive methods of detecting right are

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:02.850
sensitive methods of detecting right are
 

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:04.519
sensitive methods of detecting right are
invented and you know about this stuff

00:14:04.519 --> 00:14:04.529
invented and you know about this stuff
 

00:14:04.529 --> 00:14:06.910
invented and you know about this stuff
because I know that you you're a science

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:06.920
because I know that you you're a science
 

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.639
because I know that you you're a science
freak and you're saying dark dark

00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:10.649
freak and you're saying dark dark
 

00:14:10.649 --> 00:14:13.009
freak and you're saying dark dark

especially when it comes to anything
that can enhance the this life that we

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:14.790
that can enhance the this life that we
 

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:17.720
that can enhance the this life that we
have on this earth so yeah sure you know

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:17.730
have on this earth so yeah sure you know
 

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.720
have on this earth so yeah sure you know
a lot about this stuff well I've had a

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:19.730
a lot about this stuff well I've had a
 

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:24.769

people about it and David Sinclair was
 

00:14:27.449 --> 00:14:29.389
people about it and David Sinclair was
one of more recent ones who did this

00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399
one of more recent ones who did this
 

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:31.689
one of more recent ones who did this
discussion about life extension and

00:14:31.689 --> 00:14:31.699
discussion about life extension and
 

00:14:31.699 --> 00:14:35.420
