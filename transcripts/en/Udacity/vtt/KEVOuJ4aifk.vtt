00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
[Norvig] Part of the problem with this approach is that it's not guaranteed to terminate.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Another part of it is that even when it does terminate,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
it's going to take a little bit longer to do so.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And the question is, how long is it going to take?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Assume we have N elements in our deck.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
How long is it going to take for this algorithm to run?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Would it be roughly on the order of N swaps

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
or roughly on the order of N squared swaps

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
or roughly on the order of N factorial swaps?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Which of those do you think corresponds to the time it will take on average

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to execute this algorithm?
