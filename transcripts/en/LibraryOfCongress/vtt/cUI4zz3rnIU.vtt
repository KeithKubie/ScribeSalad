00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.470
&gt;&gt; I'm Jane McAuliffe.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.210
I'm the director of National
and International Outreach here

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.860
at the Library of Congress and the
Poetry and Literature Center falls

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.740
under part of our national
and international outreach

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.350
and I'm delighted to
be able to welcome you

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.630
to this afternoon's event
celebrating our new Witter

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.930
Bynner Fellow.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.480
Let me say a word or two
about the fellowship itself.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.740
It's a program by which the
library's Poet Laureate consultant

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.500
in poetry selects one or two
poets to organize a reading

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.570
in their home states and then
to travel here and participate

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.510 position:56%
in an event and a recording session.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.450
We have a pretty illustrious
list of previous fellows

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.090
in this position including
Heather McHugh

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.640
who was a MacArthur
Foundation awardee,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.200
the Pulitzer Prize winner
Claudia Emerson and Carl Phillips

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.250
who was an Academy of
American Poets Chancellor.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.220 position:56%
Our new fellow Allison Hedge Coke
is a wonderful addition to that list

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.980
and to this fellowship and we
look forward to hearing her read

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.500
and to participate in a moderated
discussion here this afternoon.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.580 position:56%
Also later this spring on April
28th she will give her State reading

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.820
in conjunction with the Oklahoma
State Center for the Book.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.040 position:56%
The 21st Poet Laureate Consultant in
Poetry Juan Felipe Herrera is here

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.340
to introduce Allison
Hedge Coke to you.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.850
Juan Felipe has added
immeasurably to the Laureate ship

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.690
with his tireless travels
across the country

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.940
and his online project
La Casa de Colores.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.740
Thank you, thank you very much
Juan Felipe for breathing new life

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.960
into this position's historic role.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.550
I also want to thank the
Witter Bynner Foundation

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.320
and its executive director,
Steven Schwartz

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.250
because the support
they have provided

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.760
for this wonderful
fellowship is so important

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.480
to the Library of Congress.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.440
Mr. Bynner, the namesake

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.480 position:56%
of the foundation was himself an
influential, early 20th century poet

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.490
and translator and this fellowship
continues his work and that

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.730
of the foundation to
perpetuate the art of poetry

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.360
and to expand awareness of
the very positive effect

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.250
that it has on society.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.050
And finally a word about the
Library of Congress which is,

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.350
as I think many of you know,

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.310
the nation's first federal
cultural institution

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.350
and the largest library
in the world.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.620
Our mission quite simply is to
promote knowledge and creativity

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.070
for the benefit of the
American people and programs

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.870
like this one really
embody that mission.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.540
The library is a home for
literature in so many ways

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.700
with our historic readings,
with books, audio recordings,

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.370
a wealth of manuscript collections,

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.270
collections that also
include the works

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.370
of outstanding American
novelists and innovative poets

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.740
such as Walt Whitman, Langston
Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.570
and Muriel Rukeyser
among many, many others.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.820
Of course you could find
all this on our website.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.010
I urge you to go to the Library of
Congress website and particularly

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.090
to the site of the Poetry and
Literature Center which has worked

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.000
for almost 80 years to foster and
enhance the public's appreciation

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.880
of poetry and literature under
particularly the direction

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.910
of our consultant Poet Laureate.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.730
You know this is the only
federally-mandated position

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.420
for a literary writer and we're
very, very fortunate to have

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.970
that housed within the Library
of Congress and now I would

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.510
like to welcome our Poet
Laureate to the stage, thank you.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:33.760
[ Applause ]

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.990
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] thank
you, thank you so much,

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.730
it's an honor to be here once
again to see good friends

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.720
that I met recently within
the year as Poet Laureate

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.410
of the United States and
once again I'm very humbled

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.990
to be in this position.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.520
It's such an amazing role,
a magnificent role to travel

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.080
around the United States and
to speak to so many audiences,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.840
to meet so many inspired human
beings, to meet so many people

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.660 position:56%
that love poetry and literature and
books at book signings and to listen

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.340
to poetry and also to write poetry.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.510
I've met five-year-olds,
11-year-olds,

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.240
fathers who bring their children
to meet me at the signing table

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.430
and they say, son or daughter,
I want you to meet a poet.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.160
I want you to meet a writer.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.780
I want you to meet the Poet
Laureate of the United States.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.880
And their child is there
and they go, oh hello,

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:39.380
hello and we shake
hands, so it is like that

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.050
and young teachers, young teachers.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:47.050
I just started my teaching
this year, they tell me and I'm

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.260
so excited that we have
poetry that we can use

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.960
and thank you so much for writing.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.440
So then I meet the new teachers,
brand new ready to venture

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:04.260
out to the school to teach and
that is how I also met Allison,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:10.800 position:56%
Allison Hedge Coke, teaching in
Vermont and she was getting her MFA.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:16.510
This is the 90s and I
noticed what a talent she was

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:22.130
and I noticed her deep insight
into things, things that some

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:27.350
of us may not have seen, things
that we have seen and maybe kept

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.580
on driving or walking or just
didn't take notice that they

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.040
and maybe the next day we did.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.130
Perhaps they were tractors.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.430
Perhaps they were tobacco leaves

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.620 position:56%
or perhaps they were just workers
sweating in the fields working away,

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.100
living their lives under that
harsh sun and women covered

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:55.630
in whatever they could put on to
protect themselves from pesticides

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.900 position:56%
and that hard work that we all
value and yet sometimes we don't see

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.360
in books or poetry books.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:08.590
And it's not there for us at times,
and yet Allison has taken the time

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.920
to notice that as a worker in
those particular tobacco fields

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.740
as a worker and those barns where
the tobacco is tied up and hung

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.120
up to dry under flames
and heaters and burners.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.540
She knows that world and it's
the same perhaps in her poetry

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.370
where she burns and
where she lifts things up

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:35.710
and where she unravels leaves,
leaves of time, leaves of family,

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.580
leaves of workers and perhaps
leaves of consciousness.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.310
And it's a beautiful work.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.280
It's a very compassionate work.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:49.130
And I just enjoy it so much because
I notice the colors and I want

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.590
to get on those tractors.

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:54.160
I see those tractors in the
morning, you know painted by dawn.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.900 position:56%
I see those fields the way my father
must have seen them in Cheyanne,

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.540
Wyoming in the early
1900s when we first worked

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.570
in the United States from Mexico.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.960
So there are many landscapes
and also internal landscapes

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.110
as Denise Levertov said 'the
outscape' and 'the inscape'

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.010
and we have both with
Allison Hedge Coke.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:25.260 position:56%
We go out there and we also go
inside and she does it in a keen set

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:31.580
of translations and with
beauty, with great choreography

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:36.020
and with a beautiful voice you
know and I just enjoy the moments

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:41.000
and the materials in her poems
and for me that is good enough.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.330
Of course there is
much more going on.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.960
We were talking this
morning about her horses.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:53.530 position:56%
She has a mustang called Spirit that
she has on a 10-acre piece of land

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:58.340 position:56%
in Oklahoma and then she has
another horse called Sister that's a

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:03.700
Medicine Cap horse, a warhorse
and she has a little house made

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.640
out of rocks and that, where
she lives and I find that,

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:12.480
you know kind of the
way, the way to live.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.080
How can I tell you?

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.040
The way to live, I remember my
own parents' little trailers

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.110
and that my father made with
whatever wood he could find,

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:26.800
built on top of a chassis of a
[inaudible] car that he managed

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.450
to put all together like a puzzle
and it was a very simple life,

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:39.320 position:56%
a life of simplicity and also a life
of warmth, storytelling and of love.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:44.310
And this is what's all in,
for me, in Allison's work

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.030
and she has a big voice,
you know she's been writing

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.170
for decades as you know.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.770 position:56%
I made a note of some of the things.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:53.830
I know that she has seven
books and I'm just going

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:55.580 position:56%
to mention a couple of them for you.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:10:00.250
"Streaming" is her most recent
one, Coffee House Press 2014.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:04.400
And next she has another,
"Rock, Ghost, Willow,

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:10.770
Deer" and that's a Bison
Books 2014 and "Blood Run"

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:15.660
by Earthworks Series,
Salt Publishing 2007

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.840
and "Off-Season City Pipe" and
that's the one, that's the sort

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.660
of poems that I remember seeing
for her MFA thesis I believe

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.700
from "Off-Season City Pipe".

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.210
And you could run into those
fields and those tractors

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.960
and you feel them turn on and
the engines at dawn and the rain

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.320
and the fire in the
burning of the barns

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.600
and the small granules
and the pigsty.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.370 position:56%
And I encourage you to read them and
enjoy them and ride that tractor.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:49.360
She has many awards you know,
lists and lists of awards

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.810
and let me just mention
the Pen Southwest Award,

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:56.940
the Lifetime Achievement Award for
a Native writer from the Circle

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:02.010
of the Americas, Native
Writer Circle of the Americas

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.450
and also the Endowed
Chair in Creative Writing,

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:10.310
the Distinguished Paul W.
Reynolds and Clarice Kingston Chair

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.610
at the University of Nebraska.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.820
And of course she writes in
various journals you know, poetry,

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:21.050
creative non-fiction, song,
lyric and critical essay.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:27.990
And this list ends with this
note, her mom put her poems

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:33.210
in a cedar chest when she was a
child and back in the middle school

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.100
and did you ever get
those poems back?

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.500
And she got those poems back.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.350
&gt;&gt; We found them when she passed.

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:42.790
&gt;&gt; So she found them, we found
them when her mom passed away

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:47.480
so this is how deep and how
beautiful and how meaningful poetry

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:52.060 position:56%
for many a decade and many a working
field under the scorching sun

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.530
and the scorching pen has
been for Allison Hedge Coke.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:57.510
Let's give her a beautiful hand.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:06.500
[ Applause ]

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.360
&gt;&gt; Thank you all for coming
out, it's a real honor for which

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.770
to be here especially
with Juan Felipe.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:24.160
I'm just so happy that
he's here for the country,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.260
thank you Juan Felipe, thank you.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.510
It's a huge honor.

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.900
I'm going to start
with "The Change",

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:38.640
Looking for Anya [phonetic],
okay, "The Change".

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.920
"Thirteen years ago

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.020
and fifth-gear diesel tractors we
rode royal blue tractors big enough

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.460
to hold a six-pack on ice.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.910 position:56%
In the one hundred and fifteen
degree summer heat with air so thick

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.390
with moisture you drink
as you breathe.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:56.440
Before the years that
dusters sprayed malathion

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.330
over our clustered bodies.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.480
We perspire while we prime the
bottom lugs those ground-level

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.790
leaves of tobacco and they
clung to us with a black tar

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:08.420
so sticky we rolled eight-inch
balls off our arms at night

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.290
and Cloroxed our clothes
for hours and hours."

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.990
"Before we were poisoned and the
hospital thought we had been burned

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:20.810
in fires at least to the third
degree when the raw oozing hives

our bodies from the sprays ordered

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.760
by the FDA and spread

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.200
by the landowners before anyone
had seen the automated machines

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.050
that top and prime.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:36.830
We topped the lavender
blooms of many tiny flowers.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:40.370
The blooms gathered
into one, gorgeous.

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:43.910
By grasping hold below the petals
with our bare, calloused hands

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:49.340
and twisting downward quick, hard
only one time snapped them off."

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:54.080
"Before edgers and herbicides took
what they called weeds we walked

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.690
for days through thirty acres and
we chopped them out with hoes.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:01.120
Hoes made long before from
wood and steel and sometimes,

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.140
even longer ago, from
wood and deer scapula.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:08.330
Before the bulk primers came we
primed all the leaves by hand,

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.890
stooped over at the
waist for the lower ones

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:14.800
and through the season gradually
rising higher until we stood

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.890
and worked simultaneously as
married to the fields as we were

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:22.470
to each other, carrying up to
fifty pounds of fresh leaves

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:27.760 position:56%
under each arm and sewing them on
to sticks four foot long on a looper

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:31.240
under the shade of a
tin-roofed barn made of shingle."

poked it up higher in the rafters

to another who held an
even higher position

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.730
and so they filled the barn.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:42.810
And the leaves hung down
like butterfly wings

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:47.360
so sometimes the color of lunar
moths or Carolina parakeets

been laid upon the old wooden cart

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:56.060
trailers pulled behind the
orange Allis-Chalmers tractor

00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:00.490
with huge round fenders and
only a screwdriver and salt

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:05.220
in the toolbox picked by primers so
hot we would race through the rows

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:10.060 position:56%
to reach the twenty-five gallon jugs
of water placed throughout the field

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:15.910
to encourage and to satisfy our
insatiable thirst from drinking air

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:19.010 position:56%
which poured through our pores
without breaking through to our need

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.110
for more water in the sun."

be taken down and the strings pulled

and sold to Philip
Morris and Winston Salem

bright leaf, a golden yellow

early on next to the fields before

to transplant those seedlings to
each hill in the field a space

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:48.820

we watched as they would grow."

a sharecropper in Willow Springs,

North Carolina as were you.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:17:03.350
We were proud and would make camp
in winter and be free of tourists

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:07.140
and filled with snow and those
of us who held out forever

worked shoulder to shoulder

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.640
with descendants of slaves that
they had brought from Africa

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.560
and they sold ancestors as
slaves into the Middle East,

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.030
that the tobacco was sacred to
all the people and all of us

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:29.860
and we prayed when we smoked
and did not smoke for pleasure

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.190
and I was content and free."

things and you left me for a fancy,

whiter girl and I waited on our
land until you brought her back

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.150
in that brand new white
Trans Am purchased

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:51.550
from our crop you gave her,
left her waiting in a motel.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:56.670
The nearest one was forty miles
away but it was near enough for you

00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:02.310
and for her and I knew though I
never spoke a word to you about it,

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:07.520
I knew I kept it to myself until
this day and time and I never let

on our anniversary."

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.630
"I drove the pickup down the
dirt path by the empty fields

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:20.080
and I rented a shack for eighty
dollars one with cardboard windows

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:24.560
and a Gillespie house floor design
and torn and faded floral paper

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.590

weighed a hundred pounds.

no running water of any kind

hilltop where I could see

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:42.600
out across all the
fields and hunt for meat

when I wanted and find peace.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:51.000
I heard you remarried and went
into automated farming and kept

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:58.160
up with America and I watched all
of you from the hill and waited

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.530
for the lavender blooms to
return when it was spring

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:04.470

had turned white."

bedroll remembering before

when the fields were like waves on
a green ocean and I turned away,

away from the change and corruption
of big business on small farms

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:22.360
and of traditional agricultural
people and sharecroppers.

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:03.930
of things that Allison said
were the kind of things

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:08.390
that you know a writer wants to
know what to do with that poem

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:10.980
and make it move on the
stage or how to go about it

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.000
and I thought that was amazing.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.810
And as I was hearing
the great, fabulous,

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:20.420
magnificent musicians I
thought about the kind of work

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:26.000
that Allison does as a person
who encourages translations

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.880
of the First Peoples
throughout the United States

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:34.370 position:56%
and throughout the entire hemisphere
and you know she has translated,

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:39.280
she has led projects and
anthologies with translations

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:41.930
of many indigenous peoples
throughout the entire hemisphere,

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:46.530
an amazing task and I'm
glad you asked that question

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:47.830
because I can bring it up.

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:51.350
And in a sense that's
what this is in a way.

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:53.410
When we hear the music
we hear the sounds.

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:54.710
We hear the shrieks.

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:56.420
We hear the riffs.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.700
We hear the harmonies, the
[inaudible] harmonies and they kind

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:03.720
of go back and they really
go deep and that's one

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:05.330
of your concerns I think.

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:09.790 position:56%
I think that's one of Allison's
concerns in the writing [inaudible].

00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:11.090
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:16.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I want to thank
Juan Felipe publicly as well

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:22.000
because he was one
of the translators.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.080
He translated [inaudible] from
Columbia and so he was part

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.400
of the Project Sing
[assumed spelling] which was

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.370
about 86 poets that we had.

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:33.840
It's multilingual, there's a lot
of different languages and some

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:39.270
of them also could get the
[inaudible] and Spanish as close

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:43.760
as they could and then of
course bringing in somebody

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:48.570
like Juan Felipe, a genius
over here [laughter] to bring

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:52.010
that to our tables, to bring
that to somewhere we could sit

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:56.350 position:56%
with the work no matter where people
are situated and hear that voice.

00:43:56.350 --> 00:44:00.230
So it's a phenomenal honor to
be able to bring those people

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:03.770
to the audience and publish
that in the U.S. and as far

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:06.390
as I know it's the first time
it's ever been done and we did

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:10.700
that together in a way,
yeah so, yeah and a lot

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.700 position:56%
of them are also performers you know

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.660
because poetry has those
older histories with oratories

00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:20.970
with performance, with theaters
you know if you will but also just

00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:25.030
so you could remember the lines you
know, there has to be musicality

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:26.670
and a lot of people
with their instruments.

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:29.510
You got lyrics from that
right so it's all connected

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:34.140
in that way to performance I think.

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:36.690
&gt;&gt; Well I listen to you
read and listen to the sort

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:41.700
of powerful rhythms of your poems I
thought a lot about capaciousness,

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:46.700
about the possibility for what
a poem can contain and the kind

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:51.570
of multitudes it can contain and I
wanted to ask you both about doing

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:53.660
that in a poem but also
shaping that in a poem.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:56.910
I was struck by how your poem
is built up through rhythm

00:44:56.910 --> 00:45:04.400 position:56%
and theme especially imagery, a kind
of force that it then kind of worked

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.910
out in a magical and
mysterious and surprising way.

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:09.800
So maybe both of you could
just talk about that in your?

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.100
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:19.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of the poetry comes
to me as music in my head and I have

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:22.710
to seek the words for it and
there's always some matter

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:27.720
of finding some balance for
tragedies that the memory invokes

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:33.110 position:56%
that [inaudible] invokes and finding
a way to remake that, to flip it

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:39.490 position:56%
and to turn something so that
there's a balance, a harmony reached

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:41.940
to some degree and yet we
still know the disaster,

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:45.060
we still have the tragedy and we
understand the realness of it.

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:49.890
So the strategy then becomes
working for an arc that allows

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:53.620
that trajectory to build so
that the change can exist

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:54.920
and [inaudible] pieces right?

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:58.970
It's that same process
it's just a longer piece.

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:04.190
I'm known for writing long poems
because I think in more of a,

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:08.100
sort of an epic narrative
whenever I'm reaching into ideas.

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.990
I hope that's helpful?

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:15.070
&gt;&gt; I heard people really
responding to that first poem.

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:19.370 position:56%
I heard the audience really enjoying
that, your first poem about working

00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:23.210
as a sharecropper,
working a sharecropper life

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:27.020
and I heard the routine and the
audience really respond to that

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:31.460
and all that, all those details,
kind of the muscularity of

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:33.630
and the tenderness of
it all at the same time.

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:39.240
You know the images, I don't know
you know, for me images are key

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:43.930 position:56%
and it took me a while to get to
leave images but then I sneaked back

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:49.190
into image-land and I grabbed
those images again because they say

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:52.250
so much and what is the
world without images

00:46:52.250 --> 00:46:54.290
and a mind without images?

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:57.790
So, for example Einstein right,
he was trying to work on,

00:46:57.790 --> 00:47:00.510
Einstein was trying to work on
that great Theory of Relativity

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:03.270
and he got stumped at one point.

00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:06.540
What was it 1907 around there?

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:08.840
And he [inaudible] I
can't get it right.

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:10.830
I've got the Theory of
Relativity, it's almost done

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:12.130
but I'm missing something.

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:13.430
What could it be?

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:15.220
And then he said I'm just
going to step out of the room.

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:18.530
I'll step out of the room and
go out here and I'm just going

00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:22.600
to let my mind go, you know just
going to let it go, see what goes,

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:26.920
now I'm very much like what
we do right, artists do

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.810
and musicians do, all
of us and poets.

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:34.630
So he [inaudible] imagine, I want
to get out of this chalkboard room

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:37.860
and I'm going to imagine,
going to step up and I'm going

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:44.690
to imagine an elevator flowing
through space and then it goes shoo

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:47.810
and I'm [inaudible] somebody in
the shoo and it's floating all

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:51.910
of a sudden because of the
forces of gravity, shoo.

00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:53.690
So all of a sudden he's
working with a notion

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:55.350
of acceleration and gravity.

00:47:55.350 --> 00:48:01.950
So he goes what else can I do
here in my little poetic moment?

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:04.800
I'm going to drill a
hole through the elevator

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:07.040
and shoot a beam of
light through it.

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:09.000
Okay, now what is going
into infinite space?

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.530
[Inaudible] floating body
acceleration, gravity okay,

00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:13.830
there's one more move
I've got to do.

00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:15.130
Let's see what could it be?

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:16.650
I'm going to shoot a flashlight,

00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:18.680
a light beam through
those little two holes

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:24.030
in the elevator and it bent.

00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:30.160
Yes, light bends with
gravity in acceleration.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.630
I'm going to run right
back to the chalkboard

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:37.010
and then he solved the Theory of
Relativity so images you know.

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:40.370
And when I was bopping around in
the Mission District in early days

00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:45.910
in San Francisco there was
a bookstore in Spanish,

00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:49.550
a Spanish-language
bookstore and it was one,

00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:52.400
I couldn't afford these things
so I just walked by them

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:56.550
and I saw this big volume of a
burgundy leather covered book

00:48:56.550 --> 00:49:01.950
with gilded gold dusty pages

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:06.370
and it said Federico Garcia Lorca
[foreign language spoken] complete

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:10.150
works so I picked it up and
it weighed like 10 kilos

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:14.380
and it was just beautiful
images and I had

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:21.700
to just follow as best as I could.

00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:25.620
&gt;&gt; Let me just ask you one
final question which gets back

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:30.360
to Jane McAuliffe's introduction
and the Witter Bynner Foundation.

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:33.600
Part of its mission is
to "Help expand awareness

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:37.400
for the positive effects
of poetry on society".

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.640
I wonder if you can
both talk about the ways

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:42.620
that you work towards
that aim in your poems.

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:48.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, everything is about that,
really when it comes down to it.

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:56.710
I mean that's the whole purpose
right, to bring knowledge,

00:49:56.710 --> 00:50:03.110
to bring what's happening in the
world to audience, to the readers

00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:05.570
so that the readers can leave
themselves in their mind

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:07.320
for that time that
they're transfixed

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.610
by the poem, moved by the poem.

00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:10.910
They can learn from it.

00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:14.290
They can understand something,
develop empathy, do something good

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:16.560
in the world, get active,
get up and move

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:19.790
because something has
happened in reading that poem.

00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:22.900
That's why people remember lines
because it helps them to cope.

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:24.380
It helps them to move forward.

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:26.360
It helps them to grow.

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:29.560
So I think it's all about that
really when it comes down to it.

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:34.040
&gt;&gt; I guess so many beautiful
things, so many beautiful things

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:38.310
and you know I was thinking
of playing with the unknown

00:50:38.310 --> 00:50:42.450
and I was also thinking
of one of the early,

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:47.450
one of the ancient
Chinese writers, essayists

00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:50.620
and who said there were five
pleasures of literature,

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:51.920
the five pleasures of literature.

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:58.240
It's back in probably 300 A.D.
around there and so Lu Chi writes

00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.820
about the five pleasures of writing
and literature and he says and one

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:05.650
of them is to task the void
and I was stumped by that.

00:51:05.650 --> 00:51:11.020
That one of the delights of
writing is to task the void

00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:12.920
and I couldn't break
the word task down.

00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:16.110
I mean tasking the void, the void.

00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:20.280
Everything is interconnected
atomically, sub-atomically.

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.140
That's kind of a kindergarten
interpretation

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:26.030
of the void and then to task it.

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:32.730
How do we task totality
if we're in totality, so,

00:51:32.730 --> 00:51:36.720
which is unexplainable except
for Einstein [laughter].

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:46.000
That's it right there,
so, exactly so what again?

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.300
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:48.930

00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:51.530
How's that?

Making the what?

00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:54.130
&gt;&gt; Making the [inaudible] yeah.

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:55.430
&gt;&gt; Making the place?

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:56.730
&gt;&gt; Opening it up.

00:51:56.730 --> 00:51:58.800
&gt;&gt; Opening it up, making it,
yeah making it, making a place

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:00.760
and that's the answer you see.

[ Inaudible Response ]

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:06.260
You know so I couldn't figure
that out and then that's it,

00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:13.890
making the place for the
unexplainable, multiple forces

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:16.470
of the universe of
which we're all one.

00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:18.620
&gt;&gt; I mean I look at a story
like the big [inaudible]

00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:19.920

a little bit at a time and hopefully

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:42.490
by the time when you mature
[inaudible] we have a handle

00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:45.190
of what's going on
around us, you know.

00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:46.490
We're moving through it.

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:49.320 position:56%
We're understanding what's
happening and then we have something

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:52.320
to give back because we can
start to fill in that story.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:55.800
The story of culture
inextricable from one another,

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:58.310
culture builds stories
slowly builds culture.

00:52:58.310 --> 00:53:01.810
They change and transform depending
on the generations [inaudible]

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:05.000
but that sphere is
still there to draw upon

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.110
and so there's always
that return, yeah.

00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:10.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:15.870

come to the moment in this story
