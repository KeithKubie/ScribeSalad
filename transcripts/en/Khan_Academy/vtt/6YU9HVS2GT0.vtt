SALMAN KHAN: I'm here
with Doctor Laurence

00:00:01.749 --> 00:00:03.540
Baker from Stanford
Medical School,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.950
and we're going to talk about
health care costs, or health

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.670
care economics, which
you're an expert in.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.253
LAURENCE BAKER: I like to spend
a lot of time thinking about--

00:00:12.253 --> 00:00:13.850
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.520
SALMAN KHAN: So all
of these charts,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.700
which all seem to have
a similar shape here,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.550
these are, essentially,
measures of how much

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.971
we're spending on health care.

00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:22.720
So this first one right
here, what's this?

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.065
Total health spending 1960-2009.

00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:27.520
And it says, United States.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.570
LAURENCE BAKER: This
is the United States.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.819
This is data that's compiled
by the federal government

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:33.180
every year since, well,
1960 and this figure is--

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.359
SALMAN KHAN: And this isn't
adjusted for inflation.

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:37.400
LAURENCE BAKER: That's
not adjusted for anything.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.722
That's the total dollar
value that the folks

00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:42.180
in the federal government who
like to calculate this number

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.670
have come up with
for the amount we

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.444
spend on health care in a year.

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:46.110
SALMAN KHAN: OK.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.570
So someone looking just at
this data point might say, OK.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.360
Maybe it's not
inflation-adjusted.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.540
Maybe the inflation curve is
also growing at some rate here.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.130
But the absolute numbers
do seem to be large.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.460
By 2009, I guess it's
already-- well, 2009.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.340
We're already several
years passed that.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.980
two and a half
trillion dollars just

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.500
to get people clear to
what we're talking about.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.410
This is in billions.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.750
This is 2,486 billion.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.520
So that's $2.4
trillion, and then

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.390
that's predicted to
almost double by 2019.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.770
And our GDP is on the
order of $15 trillion.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.310
So it's a significant chunk
of everything that we produce.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.810
LAURENCE BAKER: That's a big
chunk of everything we produce.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.721
Yeah, going up rapidly.

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.720
Hard to predict a little
bit, but all the trends

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.370
are up and so we're
worried about--

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.060
SALMAN KHAN: And this is
on a per capita basis.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.559
So I guess there's
two ways to think

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:37.190
about why costs are going up.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.030
One is that maybe we just
have a lot more people

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.610
or, that on a per person
basis, we are spending more.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.740
And this chart seems
to imply the latter.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.050
LAURENCE BAKER: This says,
on a per person basis,

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.883
we're spending more.

00:01:48.883 --> 00:01:51.300
Still not inflation
adjusted in this chart.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.173
But going from
$100 or so in 1960

00:01:55.173 --> 00:01:58.450
to $8,000 in the last
couple of years--

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.260
and you can see the trend
since, say, 2005 in there.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.890
It's up and it's up
pretty steeply just

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.020
in the last little bit.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.130
And headed for maybe
$13,000 or $14,000.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.463
SALMAN KHAN: $13,000 or $14,000.

00:02:07.463 --> 00:02:11.030
That's a nice sub-compact
car one could buy.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.800
Not to say what's
more important.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.564
And so this next
chart right over here

00:02:14.564 --> 00:02:16.730
is actually that calculation
as a percentage of GDP.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.330
And, to me, this is, maybe, one
of the most relevant things,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.310
because that
adjusted for things.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.090
It doesn't directly
adjust for inflation

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.870
but it says, as a percentage of
all of the goods and services

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.162
as an economy that we are
doing, this is a percentage.

00:02:31.162 --> 00:02:32.870
So this is an interesting
one right here.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.680
So in 1960, roughly
5% of everything

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.310
that all the goods and
services Americans produced,

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.690
1 in 20 of that,
of our energies,

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.610
was spent towards health care.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.890
And now it's looking like,
in the next few years,

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.500
it's going to be
approaching 20%.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.230
It's already in the upper teens.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.040
LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah, its past
15%, 16%, and we're headed up.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.597
The last year or so, maybe,
it was a little slower growth,

00:02:57.597 --> 00:03:00.180
but you can see the trend over
the last decade or two decades.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.700
It's up up and up.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.080
So you're right.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.850
When health
economists, when people

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.924
who think about
this more deeply,

00:03:06.924 --> 00:03:08.590
want to think about
health care spending

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.000
two and a half trillion
is an interesting number.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.291
8,000 is an interesting number.

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.000
But this one captures
population growth

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.880
to a large extent,
captures inflation.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.210
And the fact that we're
spending one seventh, roughly,

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.920
of our productive capacity on
health care is interesting--

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.700
SALMAN KHAN: And closely
approaching-- actually, it's

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.241
already one sixth
and approaching one

00:03:24.241 --> 00:03:28.860
fifth of everything that
we do is about health care.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.570
And I guess there's a
couple of things there.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.720
Maybe we're getting healthier,
I guess, is one possibility.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.399
Or maybe we aren't and
then something is weird.

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:39.940
LAURENCE BAKER: Well, that's
the really interesting question.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.440
We can think about
why this is going up,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.815
but at the end of
the day, you're

00:03:42.815 --> 00:03:44.320
happy if we're
spending this much

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.440
and if we're spending
more than other countries,

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.020
we're spending more
than we did last year,

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.710
if we're getting
healthier because of it

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.035
or if we're getting happier.

00:03:51.035 --> 00:03:53.160
Interesting question if we
want to count happiness.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.576
It doesn't make us healthy,
but if we're getting something

00:03:55.576 --> 00:03:57.952
we value, and we're getting
worried, and we get worried--

00:03:57.952 --> 00:03:59.867
SALMAN KHAN: There are
many forms of happiness

00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:01.090
that do not make you healthy.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.327
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:02.327 --> 00:04:03.910
LAURENCE BAKER: At
the end of the day,

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.190
this may be our
biggest question.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.710
SALMAN KHAN: Some will act
directly against your health.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.426
And that goes straight
into this chart

00:04:12.426 --> 00:04:13.550
which you're talking about.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.240
Maybe we should or maybe we
shouldn't compare ourselves

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.275
to other countries.

00:04:17.275 --> 00:04:19.399
And this is comparing
ourselves to other countries.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.648
So this chart right over here.

00:04:20.648 --> 00:04:22.050
This is the blue graph.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.807
So we are this light
blue [INAUDIBLE] same.

00:04:24.807 --> 00:04:25.390
So this is us.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.150
This is the United
States right over here.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.580
That is us, the United States.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.740
And if we compare to other
developed countries with,

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.270
I guess, not too
different demographics--

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.520
LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah, the
overall developed countries,

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.978
industrialized
countries, countries

00:04:38.978 --> 00:04:42.110
where the standard of living
is in pretty good shape.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.990
SALMAN KHAN: They have a
broad-- it's not a homogeneous--

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.698
LAURENCE BAKER: Not
entirely homogeneous.

00:04:46.698 --> 00:04:49.240
Some people will argue the
US is more diverse than--

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.090
SALMAN KHAN: The United
Kingdom is quite--

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.850
LAURENCE BAKER: --pretty
diverse countries, generally.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.350
Certainly countries
with immigration

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.492
issues that the US has,
countries with lower income

00:04:56.492 --> 00:04:58.450
and higher income
populations that the US does.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.533
So they're pretty diverse.

00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:01.750
SALMAN KHAN: Right, I mean,
when you look at this,

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.150
maybe this is the
real chart to look at,

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.000
because this is the
percentage of GDP

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.330
but also puts it in
context of other countries.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.170
And that's where they're all
kind of bundled around in this,

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.540
I don't know, the low end.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.665
What is this, actually,
the UK-- I didn't realize--

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:18.270
is actually at the low end
as a percentage of GDP.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.505
And France is at
the high end of GDP.

00:05:21.505 --> 00:05:23.630
LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah, so
I've done a little picking

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.080
and choosing of the
European countries.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.996
Yeah, there are some
that are a little higher,

00:05:26.996 --> 00:05:28.692
but nobody comes
close to the US.

00:05:28.692 --> 00:05:29.650
These are the big ones.

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.850
UK is the lowest in
the world, really,

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.600
of the developed countries,
the European countries.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.230
And France, Germany,
Canada, are commonly

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.250
compared to the
US at 10% or 11%.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.060
So we're 50% higher,
60% higher than those

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.249
double what's
going on in the UK.

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:47.290
SALMAN KHAN: And do we
know why we're doing this?

00:05:49.747 --> 00:05:50.580
Where is that going?

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.130
Where are we spending money that
these other countries aren't?

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.550
LAURENCE BAKER:
Right, so two places.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.091
Ultimately, the
economics of it would

00:05:56.091 --> 00:05:58.795
say, if you're spending
more than somebody else, how

00:05:58.795 --> 00:06:01.170
much stuff you buying, what
kind of things you're buying,

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.390
and then the price that
you're paying per thing.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.170
So we're talking either
about prices or quantities.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.540
So it's a little bit of both.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.350
If you compare us
across countries,

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.700
we buy more of some
kinds of services

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.210
than other countries buy.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.427
There's some interesting
comparisons--

00:06:18.427 --> 00:06:20.510
SALMAN KHAN: So we might
get more MRI's per person

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.500
or something like that.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.780
LAURENCE BAKER: We certainly
do get more MRI's per person.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.490
It's interesting.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.960
It's not that we have more
doctors per capita, say,

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.660
or more hospital
beds per capita.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.140
It's not that we get more
primary care visits in the US.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.490
It's actually true that,
in many European countries,

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.262
you get more primary
care visits, more

00:06:35.262 --> 00:06:37.636
time with your primary care
doctor then we get in the US.

00:06:37.636 --> 00:06:40.920
But if you were
picking a poster child,

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.450
it might be the MRI or
something more sophisticated,

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.130
something more expensive,
specialists visits,

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.670
lots of tests, and
things like that,

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.450
that we buy in the United States
that they don't buy in Europe.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.320
And that drives up
our health care costs.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.290
SALMAN KHAN: So we
definitely are buying more

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.059
and it's costing us more for--

00:06:58.059 --> 00:06:59.600
LAURENCE BAKER: And
the price is also

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.967
different in the United States.

00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:03.050
There's some people who
have done studies of this.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.390
There's always
little bits of debate

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.240
about how you define
these prices exactly,

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.977
but we pay doctors--
if you're finding

00:07:09.977 --> 00:07:11.560
doctors' annual
incomes, they're going

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.660
to be higher in
the United States.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.868
That is to say, we're paying,
in some sense, a higher

00:07:14.868 --> 00:07:17.540
price for a year of work from a
doctor than they pay in Europe.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.920
We're paying a higher price for
our hospital administration,

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.140
for our staff in the hospitals,
things we tend to pay more.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.970
So we buy more things.

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.040
We tend to buy more of
the more expensive things.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.614
And we tend to pay
a higher price.

00:07:30.614 --> 00:07:32.030
SALMAN KHAN: Do
you know, roughly,

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.100
how much of the
health care dollar

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.060
goes towards salaries
versus drugs versus things

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.470
like MRI's and the kind of fixed
costs like MRI's and hospital

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.620
beds and things like that?

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.995
LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah, so some
of this you can figure out.

00:07:45.995 --> 00:07:49.770
We could almost put another
slide up on there on the screen

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.265
there.

00:07:51.265 --> 00:07:53.620
The US health accounts
will tell you something

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.880
like doctors and hospitals
and drugs-- drugs, 10% or 15%,

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.190
a little less than that.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.070
I would have to go back and
look at the data on physicians.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:09.160
But physicians-- let's say that
hospitals and physicians are

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:14.810
20% or 30%-- I hesitate to
give you look the number.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:15.960
SALMAN KHAN: It's not 90%

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.930
LAURENCE BAKER: It's not 90%.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.070
SALMAN KHAN: When
we say hospitals--

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.180
so that includes
outpatient and inpatient?

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.260
LAURENCE BAKER:
Yeah, so there's lots

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.140
of ways these health
accounts get broken up,

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:29.730
physicians, hospitals, emergency
departments, different kinds

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.360
of equipment and things that
get purchased, there's research

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.919
and there's buildings,
and all that--

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.150
SALMAN KHAN: So just
[INAUDIBLE] none of these things

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.314
do make up the bulk of it.

00:08:37.314 --> 00:08:38.730
We had a video
about drug pricing,

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.659
but drug pricing by
itself is not the reason

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.840
why we're out here.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.780
And physician pay by
itself is not the reason

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.070
why we're out there.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.910
All of these are contributing.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:53.066
All of these we're getting
more of and we're paying for.

00:08:53.066 --> 00:08:54.190
LAURENCE BAKER: It's a mix.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:54.970
At the end of the
day, it's going

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.290
to be a bunch of things like
this all thrown together.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:58.540
We buy more stuff.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.180
We tend to buy more
expensive stuff.

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.150
We buy it from people
who we pay a lot.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.420
We buy more specialist visits.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.240
For example, in the
US, we pay specialists

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.160
a higher annual salary
than we pay generalists,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.840
and that comes
out in the prices.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.200
SALMAN KHAN: They don't
do that in Europe?

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.120
LAURENCE BAKER:
Europe does pay more,

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.790
but everybody is shifted down.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.364
All the physicians
are shifted down.

00:09:15.364 --> 00:09:17.030
And I think the
specialists are probably

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:21.010
shifted down more in Europe
than the generalists are.

00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.930
We pay more for our
prescription drugs here.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.050
We pay more for--

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:25.591
SALMAN KHAN: Now,
what are we getting

00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:27.716
in terms-- other than more
Mercedes in the doctors'

00:09:27.716 --> 00:09:28.257
parking lots.

00:09:28.257 --> 00:09:28.920
I'm kidding.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.775
I'm kidding.

00:09:29.775 --> 00:09:33.260
Although, you do
see a lot of those.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.030
It seems to be the car of
choice when I visit the doctor.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:41.167
And my wife's a physician.

00:09:41.167 --> 00:09:43.000
Obviously we all work
with many, so, they've

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.020
worked very hard
so, I'm not going

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.247
to make any statement about
they're underpaid or overpaid,

00:09:49.247 --> 00:09:51.580
especially relative to some
people I knew in the finance

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.360
world, I would say that
they're definitely underpaid.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.200
LAURENCE BAKER: Possibly, yes.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:54.908
SALMAN KHAN: Yes.

00:09:54.908 --> 00:09:58.150
They're above Mercedes
in that world.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.800
And so are we getting
anything in exchange for this?

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.117
Are we getting less wait times?

00:10:03.117 --> 00:10:04.950
Are we getting better
access to our doctors?

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.030
What are we getting or
what do we know about that?

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.863
LAURENCE BAKER: Well,
so this is the debate.

00:10:08.863 --> 00:10:11.260
This is in, maybe, a microcosm
one of the big debates

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.640
we're having in
the US right now.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.830
We're spending more every year.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.538
We're spending more
than other countries.

00:10:15.538 --> 00:10:18.197
If it was clear we were twice
as well off, twice as happy--

00:10:18.197 --> 00:10:19.780
SALMAN KHAN: And
we're growing faster.

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:20.920
LAURENCE BAKER: And
we're growing-- yes, it

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.503
depends on how you
look at the timing,

00:10:22.503 --> 00:10:24.870
but we're growing a little
faster in some years.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.340
Our health care costs go up 10%.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.580
If we knew we were 10% happier
this year with our health care

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.730
system, we would be happy.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.950
And that's the big debate.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.614
There are some cases
where the US-- there

00:10:34.614 --> 00:10:35.780
are things you can point to.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.790
We have fewer waiting
lines for some services,

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.260
and some of the
countries that keep

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.769
the costs down have more lines.

00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:44.310
It's also not the
case that they have

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.430
waiting lines for everything
and the really serious stuff

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.230
doesn't tend to have
long waiting lines.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:52.390
We get easier access to some
of the high tech stuff, which

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.390
we like it, and so that
drives up our spending

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.159
but maybe makes us happy.

00:10:56.159 --> 00:10:58.450
SALMAN KHAN: It may or may
not lead to better outcomes.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.825
So it makes us
happy that we feel

00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:02.300
like we're getting
better customer service.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.505
Instead of waiting three
months for a procedure,

00:11:03.505 --> 00:11:06.046
we're getting it in three weeks,
which would make me happier.

00:11:06.046 --> 00:11:08.560
I mean, objectively, I would
be much happier about that.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.140
But what happens when we
look at the overall outcomes?

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.700
Life expectancy, and people
dying from heart disease,

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.267
or whatever?

00:11:17.267 --> 00:11:19.100
LAURENCE BAKER: This
is kind of a mixed bag.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.370
Some of the most
commonly cited figures

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.200
are cases where
the US doesn't do

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.727
as well as some
European countries.

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:28.310
We spend a lot more and we don't
do better on life expectancy.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.260
We don't do better
an infant mortality.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.720
There are some cases where
the US does really well,

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.174
especially things where
access to the high end stuff

00:11:36.174 --> 00:11:37.090
can make a difference.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:38.673
And so there are
some situations where

00:11:38.673 --> 00:11:41.545
it looks like we buy the kinds
of things that are really

00:11:41.545 --> 00:11:42.670
going to make us healthier.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.670
But it's not across the board.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.310
And some of the really
interesting ones

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.500
are cases where there's
fairly inexpensive stuff

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.300
that looks like it would work
well and improve outcomes,

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.959
and sometimes we're not
doing the inexpensive stuff

00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:55.250
that other countries are doing.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:59.290
And it's coming out
to maybe hurt us.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.180
We wouldn't be having the debate
if we were clearly better off,

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.680
but it's really the case that,
in only some of the measures,

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.670
do we end up better off.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.336
We don't always
vaccinate our kids more.

00:12:07.336 --> 00:12:09.040
We don't always get
people screened more

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.680
for cancers and
things like that.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.200
But sometimes we do.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.170
So there are success
stories here.

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.830
SALMAN KHAN: Now,
one thing that's

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.470
interesting about looking
at this chart a little bit

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.720
deeper is that it doesn't
look like this is something

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.594
that, you know, since
the American Revolution

00:12:21.594 --> 00:12:24.117
that we've been spending
double as a percentage of GDP

00:12:24.117 --> 00:12:25.200
relative to everyone else.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.210
I mean if I just look at
this chart right here,

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.110
it seems like us and
Canada, we were right along

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:33.180
very similar to each other
to about the early '70s.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.405
And then we're still
in kind of that pack

00:12:35.405 --> 00:12:37.210
with Germany and France.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.680
I guess, relative to the
UK, we actually always

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.570
have been higher.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.010
But then right around
this time period,

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.190
the late '70s,
early '80s-- that's

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:47.290
where we really
started to break off.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.240
Was there some
policy shift there?

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.730
LAURENCE BAKER: So there's not
a tangible, specific policy

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:52.230
shift.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.080
What starts happening in the
US there is we start adopting

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.442
and we start shifting toward
the higher-end stuff more.

00:12:57.442 --> 00:12:58.650
And some of that's the part--

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.649
SALMAN KHAN: That's where
the technology started

00:13:00.649 --> 00:13:01.390
to really get--

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.390
LAURENCE BAKER: I think
that's mainly the story.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.450
We started to
really-- the research

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.040
in things, the development that
went on in the world, really

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.500
from 1940, '50, '60, started
to produce the capacity

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.430
to do new and expensive things.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.060
And the US grabbed those and
other countries in the world

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.325
were less quick to
grab them, maybe,

00:13:19.325 --> 00:13:20.450
you would say more careful.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.560
Maybe you would say
too careful, too slow.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.450
But the US, as you see
there, really quickly started

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.550
to put up specialized
hospitals, started

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.930
to buy the fancy
equipment, and you

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.960
can see what kind
of came out of it.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.070
SALMAN KHAN: And to some degree,
probably, the whole world

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.490
benefited from that because
you're going back to the drug

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:40.210
pricing or the MRI manufacturers
were able to get those returns

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.710
and, hopefully,
much of that they're

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.370
able to reinvest and not spend
too much on other things.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.850
But it is fueling--

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.909
LAURENCE BAKER: Yeah,
the innovation-- there's

00:13:49.909 --> 00:13:52.200
always these kinds of questions
that swirl around here.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.480
If the US pays a lot
of money and that

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.813
comes back into innovation
then everybody benefits from,

00:13:55.813 --> 00:13:57.854
including us, maybe it's OK.

00:13:57.854 --> 00:13:59.770
I think there are people
who debate whether we

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.970
got enough innovation,
enough benefits that's

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:05.960
tangibly related to our spending
to make our spending worth it,

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.230
but there are some cases
where that probably happened.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.490
And so there's some
subtlety to the question.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.030
I always say, if
you're the Yankees

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:16.460
and you're going to pay the
huge amount for the big payroll

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.570
and the big stars, people
expect you to win every time.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:20.890
And that's the US's challenge.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:21.930
If we're going to
pay the big bucks--

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:22.820
SALMAN KHAN: We
should show results.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:23.420
LAURENCE BAKER:
--we really like we

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.080
want to show results every time.

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.790
And sometimes we
do get the results,

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:27.997
but it's not often enough.

00:14:27.997 --> 00:14:29.330
SALMAN KHAN: It's not ambiguous.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.020
We're not winning the
championship every year.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.830
Very interesting.
