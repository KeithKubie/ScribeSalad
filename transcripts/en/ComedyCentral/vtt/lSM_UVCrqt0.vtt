00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:04.070
- NOW, KIDS, IN HONOR
OF VETERANS DAY,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.739
WE'VE GOT A VERY SPECIAL
GUEST SPEAKER.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.342
A REAL, LIVE WAR HERO:

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.511
WOODY JOHNSON.

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:14.414
- HI, KIDS, SHE'S RIGHT.
I AM A WAR HERO.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:16.115
- MY DAD'S A FIREMAN.

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:18.551
- YOUR DAD IS A PUSSY.
- AW.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.553
- WHILE YOUR FATHERS
WERE ALL SMOKING DOOBIES

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:22.454
AND WASHING OUT
THEIR VAGINAS,

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.791
I WAS IN THE SHIT
FIGHTING FOR YOUR FREEDOM...

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:28.261
WHEN I WASN'T GIVING IRAQI
WHORES MY VEINY HUSSEIN-Y.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.596
[laughs]

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.597
- CAN YOU SKIP TO THE PART
WHERE YOU GOT YOUR MEDAL?

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:33.065
- I'M GETTING TO THAT,
BITCH.

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:36.569
I WAS IN AN ELITE SPECIAL OPS
UNIT CALLED THE RED SKULLS.

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:38.271
ONE DAY WHEN WE WERE
ON PATROL,

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.340
A FELLOW SOLDIER,
PRIVATE JACKUBOWSKI,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.541
GOT WOUNDED.

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.442
I SAVED HIS LIFE.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:46.011
I DRAGGED THAT HALF-DEAD BASTARD
OVER THREE MILES

00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:47.647
OF WAR-TORN DESERT.

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:50.083
IT WAS A TRULY BRAVE ACT.

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:52.185
- HOW DID THE SOLDIER
GET HURT?

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:53.553
- WHAT ARE YOU,
THE [bleep] HAGUE?

00:00:53.653 --> 00:00:54.788
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.189
LIKE I CAN REMEMBER
ALL THE DETAILS.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:57.389
[grunts]

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.759
NOW WE ARE BLOOD BROTHERS
FOR LIFE.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.028
WE'LL ALWAYS HAVE
EACH OTHERS' BACKS.

00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:04.864 line:0%
both: RED SKULLS!
RESPECT AND PROTECT!

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:07.033 line:0%
- OH, THERE YOU GO.
- AAH!
