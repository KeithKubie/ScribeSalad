00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.820
An even more elaborate approach to design information was taken by

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:11.230
the Leonardo Project at the MCC in the 1980s. They devoted,

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.680
a whole project to determining what is a suitable set of design information, and

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.580
some of the, elements that they came up with that go beyond these,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.010
we've talked about already are. Explicit lists of the stakeholders involved.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.250
Okay. Most important is what issues were raised during the course of the design.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.460
And for those issues, what were the possible resolutions and why.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.550
Was a particular choice made? That is, design decisions and the reasons for

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.910
making them. Leonardo also stressed various relationships among

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.830
the design artifacts. such as versions. In producing this system you

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.783
actually maybe producing several versions. Like the professional version and

00:00:56.783 --> 00:01:01.360
the free version and so on. And what exactly is in each version,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.780
and what design compromises had to be made in order to accommodate multiple

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.960
versions. There is also the questions of revisions. And the time,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.510
the historical progress of the design. What went into each of the,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:23.390
the revisions along the way. Specific. Descriptions of constraints,

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.730
upon the solution and how they're being dealt with. [INAUDIBLE] important, and

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.340
what groupings or aggregates of, of design, artifacts implementation,

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.070
artifacts configuration files, packaging, components and

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.120
so on, did you decide to use, as far as your solution is concerned.
