00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.710
Time flies when you’re having fun!

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.290
But time is a constant right?

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.029
So, why does it feel like it goes at different
speeds?

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.679
Hey guys Julia here for the last time

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.590
Fascinating research into time reveals just
our fluid our sense of time really is.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.740
Ever been in a car accident and it seemed
to unfold in slow motion?

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.779
Well a study published in the journal Frontiers
in Human Neuroscience found that we feel like

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.369
time slows down when an object is coming toward
us and time speeds up when it’s not moving

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.050
or moving away from us.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.220
The researchers believe this has to do with
threat perception.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.840
Parts of your brain fire that handle how we
think about ourselves in relation to what’s

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.180
going on around us.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.390
So when something comes towards us, we need
to plan what to do.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.610
If something moves away from us, that might
makes us relax, as it’s no longer a threat.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.970
Time slowing down or speeding up is really
all in your head.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.540
Another study published in the journal Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.700
Sciences found that time slows down if the
stimulus is novel.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.030
The researchers think this could be because
you’re taking in more information at once

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.370
than you normally do.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.970
So if something new is heading right towards
you, time might feel like it slows wayyyy

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:08.970
down.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.830
And you don’t have to wait for a life threatening
situation to experience time slowing down.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.270
One study published in the journal PLOS one
found that purposely falling 15 stories does

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.270
the trick.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.480
The researchers had test subjects bungee jump
15 stories and estimate how long they had

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.580
been falling for.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.890
The terrified participants said they fell
for about 4 seconds when really it was only

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:28.890
2.5.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.210
And to test the idea that the slowing of time
perception happens because our brain is taking

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.990
in more information -- like a slower computer
churning through data -- the researchers gave

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.850
the participants watches that flashed numbers
faster than they'd be able to read under normal

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.850
circumstances…

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.500
They figured, if they were sucking in all
this info, then they would read the numbers

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.200
on the watch face, but as the participants
fell, they still couldn’t do it.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.090
So time didn’t reeeaaallly slow down for
them.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.430
It seemed slower in retrospect because of
the emotional charge of the situation.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.100
But time seems to speed up too.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.110
Most of the time shifting we experience happens
when we get older.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.929
We settle into routines and every day just
becomes a familiar blur of work and stress.

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.299
Some researchers believe time picks up speed
as we age because each moment becomes a smaller

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.090
percentage of our lives.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.930
When we’re 10, a year is a tenth of our
lives, when we’re thirty, it's only 1/30th.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.719
This ‘proportional' theory, as it’s called,
was put forth in 1877 by Paul Janet.

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.959
But it doesn’t explain everything.

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.590
Studies like one published in the journal
Acta Psychologica found that time doesn’t

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.510
actually speed up for older people.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.799
When they are asked out count off a minute,
they don’t do it any faster than a younger

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:35.799
person.

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.819
Or when asked about how long the past month
felt to them, there wasn’t much difference

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.680
between people of different ages.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.639
So our perception doesn’t change as we get
older.

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.430
Our memory of time does.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.109
The researchers proposed that novel experiences
are the most memorable and as we get older,

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.230
we have fewer novel experiences.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.400
They also point to a phenomenon called 'forward
telescoping'.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.260
This where you think something memorable feels
like it happened only yesterday, when really

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.519
it was TWENTY years ago, like when Toy Story
hit theaters…

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.590
. Basically memorable events are clearer in
our memories than less memorable ones, so

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.030
we wrongfully assume they happened more recently.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.409
Once you realize your error, man do you feel
old.

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:16.650
Speaking of time flying by.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.909
It seems like just yesterday I joined DNews
for the first time.

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:24.310
But really it was over a year ago!

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.720
But now it’s time to say goodbye.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.639
While I’m saying goodbye to DNews, I’ll
still be around on the internet.

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.480
Come find me on my Tumblr, That’s So Science
and on twitter @julia_sci.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:45.090
Thank you so much for being the best fans
and for all your thoughtful comments!

00:03:45.090 --> 00:04:17.729
Got any other science questions for the 
DNews team?

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:27.220
Thanks for watching DNews.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.039
I’ll see you around.
