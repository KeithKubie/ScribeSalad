00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.939
Now that we have some sense of how traditional journalism approaches creating

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:07.040
stories and crafting narratives.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.860
I wanted to contrast it with the new approaches that data

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.239
journalism takes to create engaging and often interactive visualizations.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.150
Traditionally, journalists have used data and

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.680
charts as evidence to support a claim.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.830
Often in the form of a static image embedded within the larger body of text.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.530
For example, you might be reading a news article that uses

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:37.560
a chart to support some claim it makes in the overall narrative.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.190
I say here data around narrative to refer to

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.310
the fact that the narrative is the focus of the journalist piece and

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.140
the data merely exists in a secondary and supporting role.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.920
Data journalism on the other hand places the data front and

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.840
center and builds a narrative around the data.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.240
For example, a data journalist might have some interesting data set.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.060
And try to tell a story about what's happening in that data set.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.280
In comparison to an article that has a static chart embedded to support claims

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.000
made, a data journalist might have an interactive chart, which they then use

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.770
labels, annotations, and sidebars to add context to the data.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.790
And by adding context to the data,

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.840
they'll create a narrative around the story they want to tell with their chart.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.520
The second difference I wanted to point out is that traditional journalism

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.440
often presents its information as a sequence of events.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.720
A then b then c to create a linear narrative.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.220
Data journalism on the other hand leverages interactivity to

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.660
enable much more complex and varied narrative structures.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.530
Allowing the user to discover their own data story possibly from going

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.340
from event A, to event C, back to event A, maybe going to some

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.480
external article or other information Z, which leads back to conclusion B.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.090
In this case.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.790
The structure of the story and

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.210
the narrative that you tell may be different and customized for every reader.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.290
Whereas in traditional journalism you might write a single story with

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.840
a single linear flow so no matter who's reading it, the story stays the same.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.110
And the last aspect that I want to compare is the method of

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.373
delivery or dissemination.

00:02:36.373 --> 00:02:42.250
Traditional journalism is published either in a physical form like a newspaper

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.110
or magazine or on the web, but often only as static html.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.600
Thought of like a digital book.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.150
The new visualizations coming out of data journalism outlets like

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.650
the New York Times or 538 leverage many of the open web technologies

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.810
that we discussed in lesson one to create both more accessible articles.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.820
And also interactive visualizations then

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.390
enable much richer interaction from the reader.
