00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.160
When you create an application,

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.240
you want to test it before
releasing it to your users.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.700
After all, you want to make sure
the features work, right, and

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.750
make sure they're good quality?

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.340
As your application becomes more
complex, it becomes harder and harder to

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.000
manually check if all the features
of your app are working as expected.

00:00:19.108 --> 00:00:23.080
Using tests and test frameworks can help
make it easier to automate this process.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.640
It will also change how you think
about the app development process.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.230
In this lesson, you'll learn about
how to test Ruby applications

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.910
using a testing framework
called minitest.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.590
Let's get started.
