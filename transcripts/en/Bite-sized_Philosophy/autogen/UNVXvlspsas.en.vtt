people hone in on the same definition is

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640
to define what an acceptable outcome
 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.590

would be to their joint interactions and

would be to their joint interactions and
 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.850
would be to their joint interactions and
then to hone their language until they

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860
then to hone their language until they
 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.109
then to hone their language until they
achieve that outcome and then to

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119
achieve that outcome and then to
 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.100

and his crew basically said that you

could never do anything better than that

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049

so let's say that we're trying to let's

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849
so let's say that we're trying to let's
 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.460
so let's say that we're trying to let's
say we're trying to communicate about

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470
say we're trying to communicate about
 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.000
say we're trying to communicate about
how we're going to move

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010
how we're going to move

basically what we've decided is we've

basically what we've decided is we've

basically what we've decided is we've
communicated good enough if the bricks

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129
communicated good enough if the bricks
 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.500
communicated good enough if the bricks
get moved and so so what you have to do

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510
get moved and so so what you have to do
 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.479
get moved and so so what you have to do
is you have to set up a practical

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489
is you have to set up a practical
 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.479
is you have to set up a practical

conversation and that that practical
 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.300

surround constitutes what you are

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.699

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.170

partly it's complicated it's partly why

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180
partly it's complicated it's partly why

everything so how do you know when your

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159
everything so how do you know when your

everything so how do you know when your
interpretation is good enough and the

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959
interpretation is good enough and the
 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.680
interpretation is good enough and the
answer to that is you agree a priori

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690
answer to that is you agree a priori
 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.900
answer to that is you agree a priori

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540
between males and females but I've never
 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.830
between males and females but I've never
heard a liberal argue and from my

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840
heard a liberal argue and from my
 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.509
heard a liberal argue and from my
perspective I think I could partially

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519
perspective I think I could partially
 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.089
perspective I think I could partially
combat this but it's an argument that

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099
combat this but it's an argument that
 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.580
combat this but it's an argument that
hasn't been raised from the liberal side

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590
hasn't been raised from the liberal side
 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.069
hasn't been raised from the liberal side

which I think should have biological
 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.439

differences in the brain women can see
more shades of color on average and men

more shades of color on average and men
 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.009
more shades of color on average and men

I'm making is that a gender identity is

I'm making is that a gender identity is
 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.390
I'm making is that a gender identity is
strongly influenced by biological sex

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400
strongly influenced by biological sex
 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.030

that's being introduced in Canada argues
that it's not yes and that's just not

that it's not yes and that's just not

for sure there are people live mixed

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460
for sure there are people live mixed

biological sex although there are women

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729

who have some cells in their body that
 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.830
who have some cells in their body that
have male chromosomes yes and then it's

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840
have male chromosomes yes and then it's
 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.570
have male chromosomes yes and then it's
not a trivial number for example and

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580
not a trivial number for example and
 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.860
not a trivial number for example and
there are people who are born with

there are people who are born with

there are more genuine hermaphroditic

there are more genuine hermaphroditic
 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.460
there are more genuine hermaphroditic
types there's no different no doubt that

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.800

women that have a more masculine
 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.570
women that have a more masculine
personality structure and then that's

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580
personality structure and then that's
 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.120
personality structure and then that's
biologically influenced so I would

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130
biologically influenced so I would
 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.089

okay thank you for making I'm making a

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330
biological I'm making a case that sexual
 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.409
biological I'm making a case that sexual
identity is unbelievably powerfully

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419
identity is unbelievably powerfully
 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.480

influenced by biology with certain

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490
influenced by biology with certain
 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.159
influenced by biology with certain
exceptions and that those exceptions

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169
exceptions and that those exceptions
 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:54.870
exceptions and that those exceptions
themselves might be biologically

themselves might be biologically

determined not in all cases but in many
 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.129
determined not in all cases but in many
and so part of the reason I was

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139
and so part of the reason I was
 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.100
and so part of the reason I was
objecting to legislation like Bill c16

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110
objecting to legislation like Bill c16
 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.020
objecting to legislation like Bill c16
is because it insists the gender

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030
is because it insists the gender
 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.390
is because it insists the gender
identity is socially constructed well

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400
identity is socially constructed well
 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.129
identity is socially constructed well
it's gender identity is socially

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.139
it's gender identity is socially
 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:09.839
it's gender identity is socially
constructed then why can't we just take

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:09.849
constructed then why can't we just take
 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.790
constructed then why can't we just take
transgender people and socialize them

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800
transgender people and socialize them
 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.460
transgender people and socialize them
back into their into the normative sex

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470
back into their into the normative sex
 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.159
back into their into the normative sex
roles exactly right exactly so that's

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169
roles exactly right exactly so that's
 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:18.540
roles exactly right exactly so that's
part of the reason I was objecting to

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550
part of the reason I was objecting to
 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.520
part of the reason I was objecting to
the legislation one of the more powerful

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530
the legislation one of the more powerful
 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.790
the legislation one of the more powerful
arguments and I said this I did a

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800
arguments and I said this I did a
 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.469
arguments and I said this I did a
presentation in front of the Canadian

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479
presentation in front of the Canadian
 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:27.240
presentation in front of the Canadian
Senate I don't know if you saw that or

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250
Senate I don't know if you saw that or
 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.189
Senate I don't know if you saw that or
not there's no reason for you to have

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199
not there's no reason for you to have
 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:31.500
not there's no reason for you to have
paid attention to it but if you look up

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:31.510
paid attention to it but if you look up
 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.899
paid attention to it but if you look up
Jordan Peterson then Senate you'll see

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:33.909
Jordan Peterson then Senate you'll see
 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:36.959
Jordan Peterson then Senate you'll see
that oh well

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:36.969
that oh well
 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:39.149
that oh well
with a professor along with a practicing

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:39.159
with a professor along with a practicing
 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:41.729
with a professor along with a practicing
lawyer I made exactly that case to a

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:41.739
lawyer I made exactly that case to a
 

00:06:41.739 --> 00:06:43.919
lawyer I made exactly that case to a
number of Canadian senators telling them

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:43.929
number of Canadian senators telling them
 

00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:45.569
number of Canadian senators telling them
that by supporting this legislation they

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:45.579
that by supporting this legislation they
 

00:06:45.579 --> 00:06:47.339
that by supporting this legislation they
were actually doing a disservice to the

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:47.349
were actually doing a disservice to the
 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:49.079
were actually doing a disservice to the
people that they purported to be helping

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:49.089
people that they purported to be helping
 

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:51.959
people that they purported to be helping
so that's just it isn't that

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:51.969
so that's just it isn't that
 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:53.969
so that's just it isn't that
biologically there are two sexes

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:53.979
biologically there are two sexes
 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:56.159
biologically there are two sexes
although a pronoun is an approximation

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:56.169
although a pronoun is an approximation
 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:58.289
although a pronoun is an approximation
that's true now the days of the

00:06:58.289 --> 00:06:58.299
that's true now the days of the
 

00:06:58.299 --> 00:06:59.609
that's true now the days of the
approximation is true

00:06:59.609 --> 00:06:59.619
approximation is true
 

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:02.519
approximation is true
it gets slightly messy because we're our

00:07:02.519 --> 00:07:02.529
it gets slightly messy because we're our
 

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:05.489
it gets slightly messy because we're our
multiplicity of ways that sexuality and

00:07:05.489 --> 00:07:05.499
multiplicity of ways that sexuality and
 

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:08.309
multiplicity of ways that sexuality and
sex differences manifest themselves and

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319
sex differences manifest themselves and
 

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:10.829
sex differences manifest themselves and
was a fair bit of variability across all

00:07:10.829 --> 00:07:10.839
was a fair bit of variability across all
 

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:13.499
was a fair bit of variability across all
of those different manifestations and so

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:13.509
of those different manifestations and so
 

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:16.079
of those different manifestations and so
as I said you can have feminine man in

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:16.089
as I said you can have feminine man in
 

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:17.759
as I said you can have feminine man in
the masculine male I'm asking a woman

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:17.769
the masculine male I'm asking a woman
 

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:20.249
the masculine male I'm asking a woman
that happens very frequently um it's

00:07:20.249 --> 00:07:20.259
that happens very frequently um it's
 

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:22.889
that happens very frequently um it's
just more often you have a feminine

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:22.899
just more often you have a feminine
 

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:26.729
just more often you have a feminine

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:26.739
woman and a masculine man yes all right
 

00:07:26.739 --> 00:07:29.309
woman and a masculine man yes all right
that perfectly explains my question okay

00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:29.319
that perfectly explains my question okay
 

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:31.859
that perfectly explains my question okay
so next post modernist thought and I

00:07:31.859 --> 00:07:31.869
so next post modernist thought and I
 

00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:34.289
so next post modernist thought and I
think you kind of already talked about

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:34.299
think you kind of already talked about
 

00:07:34.299 --> 00:07:38.279

this when you said the American post

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:38.289
this when you said the American post
 

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:40.889
this when you said the American post
modernist got this right and that I'm

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:40.899
modernist got this right and that I'm
 

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:43.049
modernist got this right and that I'm
going to summarize very quickly because

00:07:43.049 --> 00:07:43.059
going to summarize very quickly because
 

00:07:43.059 --> 00:07:46.519
going to summarize very quickly because
you have already answered but like um

00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:46.529
you have already answered but like um
 

00:07:46.529 --> 00:07:50.459
you have already answered but like um
you say that you see scientific realism

00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:50.469
you say that you see scientific realism
 

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:53.040
you say that you see scientific realism
is nested in Darwinian competition and

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:57.179
is nested in Darwinian competition and
so it's reasonably objective that the

so it's reasonably objective that the
 

00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:59.999
so it's reasonably objective that the
little no that's not quite right okay no

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:00.009
little no that's not quite right okay no
 

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:03.119

I I would say that it hasn't obvious to

conservatives is that's a good ideas
 

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.090
conservatives is that's a good ideas
it's one that you should think about

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:32.100
it's one that you should think about
 

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.930
it's one that you should think about
like it is it isn't if it's a reasonable

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:35.940
like it is it isn't if it's a reasonable
 

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.820
like it is it isn't if it's a reasonable
hypothesis I'd have to think it through

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:37.830
hypothesis I'd have to think it through
 

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.730
hypothesis I'd have to think it through
a long time before I before I because

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:40.740
a long time before I before I because
 

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.290
a long time before I before I because
you're suggesting that a conservative

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:42.300
you're suggesting that a conservative
 

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.380
you're suggesting that a conservative
philosophy is more useful you know in a

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:45.390
philosophy is more useful you know in a
 

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:49.970
philosophy is more useful you know in a
low populated area yes and I live yeah

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:49.980
low populated area yes and I live yeah
 

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:50.690
low populated area yes and I live yeah
it's possible

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:50.700
it's possible
 

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.329
it's possible
I don't know it's worth thinking through

00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:53.339
I don't know it's worth thinking through
 

00:11:53.339 --> 00:11:54.889
I don't know it's worth thinking through
all right that's because I've been

00:11:54.889 --> 00:11:54.899
all right that's because I've been
 

00:11:54.899 --> 00:11:57.019
all right that's because I've been
thinking about that a lot that's my main

00:11:57.019 --> 00:11:57.029
thinking about that a lot that's my main
 

00:11:57.029 --> 00:12:01.130
thinking about that a lot that's my main
the main thing I think about um and I'm

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:01.140
the main thing I think about um and I'm
 

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:04.550
the main thing I think about um and I'm
not saying necessarily directly that but

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560
not saying necessarily directly that but
 

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.680
not saying necessarily directly that but
at least the possibility of that's why

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:06.690
at least the possibility of that's why
 

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.230
at least the possibility of that's why
yeah one thing you can do just to some

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240
yeah one thing you can do just to some
 

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.030
yeah one thing you can do just to some
degree to begin with is just run a

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040
degree to begin with is just run a
 

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.970
degree to begin with is just run a
correlation between sizes community and

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:13.980
correlation between sizes community and
 

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:18.110
correlation between sizes community and
and and political proclivity you should

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120
and and political proclivity you should
 

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.540
and and political proclivity you should
go get that down on the line online yep

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:20.550
go get that down on the line online yep
 

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.090
go get that down on the line online yep
wouldn't be proof because it might be

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:23.100
wouldn't be proof because it might be
 

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.920
wouldn't be proof because it might be
that the more liberal types are also

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:24.930
that the more liberal types are also
 

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:27.019
that the more liberal types are also
more likely to move to the cities right

00:12:27.019 --> 00:12:27.029
more likely to move to the cities right
 

00:12:27.029 --> 00:12:29.000
more likely to move to the cities right
in this case you'll be leaving

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.010
in this case you'll be leaving
 

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.100
in this case you'll be leaving
conservatives behind and it's not

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:31.110
conservatives behind and it's not
 

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.890
conservatives behind and it's not
because they're more well adapted by

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:33.900
because they're more well adapted by
 

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.390
because they're more well adapted by
even it it might be because they're more

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:35.400
even it it might be because they're more
 

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.460
even it it might be because they're more
well adapt into smaller communities it's

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:37.470
well adapt into smaller communities it's
 

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.470
well adapt into smaller communities it's
a good idea we I don't know what think

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480
a good idea we I don't know what think
 

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.150
a good idea we I don't know what think
of it but it is worth thinking about

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160
of it but it is worth thinking about
 

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.150
of it but it is worth thinking about
um and we actually we have that data

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160
um and we actually we have that data
 

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.400
um and we actually we have that data
just through political polls and you'll

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:46.410
just through political polls and you'll
 

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.079
just through political polls and you'll
see whenever I look at a map it's all

00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:48.089
see whenever I look at a map it's all
 

00:12:48.089 --> 00:12:50.420
see whenever I look at a map it's all
red because the red is in the smaller

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:50.430
red because the red is in the smaller
 

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.180
red because the red is in the smaller
areas and the blue looks small it cancer

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:53.190
areas and the blue looks small it cancer
 

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:55.010
areas and the blue looks small it cancer
more people there so it does tend our

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:55.020
more people there so it does tend our
 

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.900
more people there so it does tend our
it's just long as it's a plausible

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:56.910
it's just long as it's a plausible
 

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.850
it's just long as it's a plausible
hypothesis it might be interesting to

00:12:58.850 --> 00:12:58.860
hypothesis it might be interesting to
 

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.340
hypothesis it might be interesting to
look in the red states only and see if

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:01.350
look in the red states only and see if
 

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.040
look in the red states only and see if
it's still true there yes all right

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:04.050
it's still true there yes all right
 

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.019
it's still true there yes all right
so thank you for that and you let that

00:13:06.019 --> 00:13:06.029
so thank you for that and you let that
 

00:13:06.029 --> 00:13:09.740
so thank you for that and you let that
you think of that as a possibility and

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:09.750
you think of that as a possibility and
 

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.810
you think of that as a possibility and
then one last question on religion and

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:11.820
then one last question on religion and
 

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.840
then one last question on religion and
I've been watching your

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:13.850
I've been watching your
 

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:16.629
I've been watching your
your psychological interpretations of

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639
your psychological interpretations of
 

00:13:16.639 --> 00:13:19.150
your psychological interpretations of
the Bible as well as I read maps of

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:19.160
the Bible as well as I read maps of
 

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.680
the Bible as well as I read maps of
meaning mmm

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:20.690
meaning mmm
 

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:25.360
meaning mmm
so I may have missed something there but

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:25.370
so I may have missed something there but
 

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.360
so I may have missed something there but
this question so neuro physiologically

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:28.370
this question so neuro physiologically
 

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.999
this question so neuro physiologically
to my understanding the way the human

00:13:30.999 --> 00:13:31.009
to my understanding the way the human
 

00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:32.889
to my understanding the way the human
brain is constructed is such that

00:13:32.889 --> 00:13:32.899
brain is constructed is such that
 

00:13:32.899 --> 00:13:35.949
brain is constructed is such that
happiness is achieved in the pursuit of

00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:35.959
happiness is achieved in the pursuit of
 

00:13:35.959 --> 00:13:37.900
happiness is achieved in the pursuit of
a noble aim rather than the taming of

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:37.910
a noble aim rather than the taming of
 

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.280
a noble aim rather than the taming of
the goal itself you've talked about this

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:39.290
the goal itself you've talked about this
 

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.530
the goal itself you've talked about this
multiple times yeah yeah yeah that's

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:41.540
multiple times yeah yeah yeah that's
 

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.749
multiple times yeah yeah yeah that's
that you I would it's not even it's not

00:13:43.749 --> 00:13:43.759
that you I would it's not even it's not
 

00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:45.610
that you I would it's not even it's not
happiness precisely but that will do

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:45.620
happiness precisely but that will do
 

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.439
happiness precisely but that will do
it's more like a sense of meaningful

00:13:47.439 --> 00:13:47.449
it's more like a sense of meaningful
 

00:13:47.449 --> 00:13:49.059
it's more like a sense of meaningful
engagement which I think is better than

00:13:49.059 --> 00:13:49.069
engagement which I think is better than
 

00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:50.829
engagement which I think is better than
happiness but that's okay we can go with

00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:50.839
happiness but that's okay we can go with
 

00:13:50.839 --> 00:13:52.480
happiness but that's okay we can go with
happiness for now all right so if

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:52.490
happiness for now all right so if
 

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.819
happiness for now all right so if
there's no noble aim we are limited to

00:13:54.819 --> 00:13:54.829
there's no noble aim we are limited to
 

00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:56.470
there's no noble aim we are limited to
simple pleasures which do not sustain a

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480
simple pleasures which do not sustain a
 

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:58.720
simple pleasures which do not sustain a
popular that's exactly right you're

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:58.730
popular that's exactly right you're
 

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.670
popular that's exactly right you're
limited to impulsive pleasures yes and

limited to impulsive pleasures yes and
 

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.499
limited to impulsive pleasures yes and
those are ones that don't necessarily

00:14:02.499 --> 00:14:02.509
those are ones that don't necessarily
 

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:04.660
those are ones that don't necessarily

is am i right in construing that the

00:14:16.509 --> 00:14:16.519
is am i right in construing that the
 

00:14:16.519 --> 00:14:18.220
