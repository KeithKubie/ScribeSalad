00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.180
So I stopped abruptly 12
minutes into the last video

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.790
because 12 minutes was too long.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:05.840
I needed a break.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.010
But where we left off, we
were in the home stretch.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.160
We were evaluating the
third surface integral.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.618
And we were setting it up as
a double integral with respect

00:00:12.618 --> 00:00:14.350
to r and theta.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.390
And we just had to
set up the bounds.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.380
And we know that r takes
on values between 0 and 1.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.420
And theta takes on values
between 0 and 2 pi.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.380
So r, we're going to integrate
with respect to r first.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.540
r takes on values
between 0 and 1.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.340
And theta takes on values
between 0 and 2 pi.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.460
And so now we are
ready to integrate.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.930
So let's do the first part.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.492
Let's do this inside
part right over here.

00:00:40.492 --> 00:00:42.450
And I'm just going to
rewrite the outside part.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.790
So this is going
to be equal to-- we

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.760
have our square root of 2
times the integral from 0

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.110
to 2 pi of-- and we have
d theta right over here.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.460
So that's the outside.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.770
This inside part
right over here,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.960
we can rewrite it as
if we distribute the r.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.480
It's r minus r squared
cosine of theta.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.670
Now we're going to
integrate with respect to r.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.961
So when we integrate with
respect to r, cosine of theta

00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:15.960
is just a constant.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.540
So if you integrate
this with respect to r,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.140
you get-- and I'll do
it in that pink color--

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.010
if you integrate with respect
to r, the antiderivative of r

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.215
is r squared over 2.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.040
And the antiderivative
of r squared

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.491
is r cubed over 3 minus r
cubed over 3 cosine theta.

00:01:40.491 --> 00:01:41.490
This is just a constant.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.190
And we're going to
evaluate that from 0 to 1.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.080
So when you would
evaluate it at 1,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.160
you get 1/2 minus
1/3 cosine theta.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.550
So you get 1/2-- I'll just
do it right over here--

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.720
1/2 minus 1/3 cosine theta.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.330
And then minus both of
these evaluated at 0,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.190
well those are
just going to be 0.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.280
0 squared minus 0
squared times whatever.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.509
It's all going to be 0.

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:14.050
So this business
right over here just

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.880
evaluates to 1/2 minus
1/3 cosine of theta.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.400
And so we get the integral.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.030
This is all going
to be equal now

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.320
to the square root of 2 times
the integral from theta 0

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:35.380
to 2 pi of 1/2 minus 1/3
cosine of theta d theta.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.820
And this is equal to
square root of 2 times

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.820
the antiderivative
of 1/2 is 1/2 theta.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.480
And the antiderivative of
cosine theta is sine theta.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.860
So minus 1/3 sine theta.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.380
And we're evaluating
it from 0 to 2 pi.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.220
When you evaluate
these at 2 pi, you

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.120
have-- let me just write it all
out-- this is the home stretch.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.786
I don't want to make
a careless mistake.

00:02:59.786 --> 00:03:04.370
We have square root of 2 times--
let's evaluate it at 2 pi--

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.330
1/2 times 2 pi is pi minus
1/3 times sine of 2 pi-- well

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.890
that's just going to be 0.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.480
And when you evaluate it
at 0, 1/2 times 0 is 0.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:15.550
Sine of 0 is 0.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.330
So that all comes out to 0.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.710
So all of this business
simplifies to pi.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.660
And we are done.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.590
We've evaluated surface three.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.070
It is square root of 2, or
the third surface integral,

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.970
or the surface integral
over surface three.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.820
It is square root of 2 pi.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.320
And we are done.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.395
So this part right over
here is square root 2,

00:03:39.395 --> 00:03:42.290
or root 2, times pi.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.400
So this entire surface
integral that we started

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.050
like 80 videos ago, evaluates
to-- the orange part

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.140
evaluates to 0.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.890
The blue part, 3 pi over 2.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.300
And then the magenta part
is square root of 2 pi.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.880
So we're left with 3 pi over
2 plus the square root of 2

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.125
pi is the value of our
original surface integral.
