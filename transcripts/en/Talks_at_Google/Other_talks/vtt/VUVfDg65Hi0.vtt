[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.052 --> 00:00:07.260
BERNIE TELSEY: Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.360
My name is Bernie Telsey.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.750
I'm one of the artistic
directors of MCC Theater.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.820
For those of you
who don't know, MCC

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.420
is a not-for-profit theater
that's been around 33 years.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.990
We just moved into our own new
complex, the Robert W Wilson

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.680
MCC Theater Space
on 52nd Street.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.880
So you all must come by.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.630
We have two new theaters.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.007
And the opening of our
building is our new production,

00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:32.090
which we're here today to
talk a little bit about,

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.590
which is called
"Alice by Heart,"

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.260
by this incredible
creative team.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.920
So welcome.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.810
I'm going to
introduce everybody.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.230
"Alice" is written by Steven
Sater and Jessie Nelson.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.030
And the music is
by Duncan Sheik.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.970
Also lyrics by Steven Sater,
and our director, Jessie Nelson.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.590
So this is our creative team,
along with our two stars.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.840
Molly Gordon is playing Alice.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.750
And Colton Ryan is
playing the White Rabbit.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.900
And we also have Jason
Hart, our musical director.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.221
How is everybody today?

00:01:01.221 --> 00:01:01.846
AUDIENCE: Whoo.

00:01:01.846 --> 00:01:02.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.643
BERNIE TELSEY: All right, you
going to come see "Alice"?

00:01:04.643 --> 00:01:06.560
Yes, all right, very good.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.940
So to start off, we're to do
a little bit of a few songs

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.690
so you can get a sense
of what "Alice" is.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.603
And then we'll do a little Q
and A with our creative team.

00:01:14.603 --> 00:01:16.020
But if we could
start, I was going

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.620
to have Steven just tell us
a little bit about "Alice

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.740
by Heart" so you know
what is this story

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.210
and he can set up our
first song, called "Still."

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.030
STEVEN SATER: OK, is
this working good?

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.853
BERNIE TELSEY: Yeah.

00:01:29.853 --> 00:01:31.520
STEVEN SATER: "Alice
by Heart" is really

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.130
about the power of the
imagination to get us

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.240
through the hardest times.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.270
What a book can mean to
you as a young person

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.820
and how you can carry it
through life with you.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.400
So it feels kind of
increasingly urgent to us

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.840
in what feels like a
culturally challenged time.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.890
And so, it's set during the
bombing of London, known

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.555
as the Blitz, in 1940 and 1941.

00:01:54.555 --> 00:01:55.910
It went on for months.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.250
There were 59 straight
nights of bombs

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.900
being dropped on the city.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.270
And the citizens, to
protect themselves,

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.370
began huddling in
shelters at night.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.750
They were night bombings.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.890
Or increasingly
in tube stations,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.680
in the subway stations.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.130
And there's a young
girl, Alice, who's

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.770
been bombed out of her home.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.410
And she finds
shelter for herself

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.570
in this kind of makeshift
encampment in a tube station.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.470
And what she loves most in the
world is this boy named Alfred.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.480
And he's found.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.130
And he's brought down.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.850
And they reunite in
the tube station.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.780
And it's so dire there.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.980
And they're under the care of
an unfeeling Red Cross nurse.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.970
And she says-- he's
ailing so much.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.040
He's contracted illness,
living on the streets,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.240
drinking out of gutters.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.612
She says, all this, we
can make it disappear.

00:02:49.612 --> 00:02:51.320
You can run there,
you can breathe there.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.310
Let's go back to Wonderland.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.020
He says, I have no
time for all that.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.880
And she starts reading the book.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.090
The book is taken from her.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.580
She says I know it all by heart.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.780
She starts reciting the book.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.940
And lo and behold, this anthemic
Duncan Sheik theme kicks in.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.370
And they're transported
to Wonderland.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.150
And this song, "Still,"
is their first moment

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.920
together in Wonderland.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.550
And it shows their
central conflict.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.182
He feels-- he's
the White Rabbit.

00:03:18.182 --> 00:03:20.390
He's late, he's late, he
has no time, he has no time.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.932
She's not getting it, that what
he's saying on a deeper level

00:03:22.932 --> 00:03:24.470
is he's going to die.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.230
She says, no, we're
in Wonderland again.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.590
We can be in our golden
afternoon, in our garden.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.210
Stay with me, linger with
me, play with me still.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.393
So that's the song.

00:03:35.393 --> 00:03:37.560
DUNCAN SHEIK: So Colton and
Molly, will you join us?

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.060
Great.

00:03:43.696 --> 00:03:50.040
[COLTON RYAN AND MOLLY GORDON
 SINGING "STILL"]

00:06:03.851 --> 00:06:05.312
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.175
BERNIE TELSEY: I love that song.

00:06:11.175 --> 00:06:12.050
COLTON RYAN: One job.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.008
BERNIE TELSEY: One job.

00:06:13.008 --> 00:06:14.050
COLTON RYAN: Oh, man.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.300
BERNIE TELSEY: That is
such a beautiful song.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.200
In fact, all of the music, I
just think about it every day.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.140
And I just love getting to watch
it every night, especially sung

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.140
by the two of you.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.797
So thank you.

00:06:23.797 --> 00:06:25.880
Duncan and Steven, can
tell me a little bit about,

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.963
and tell our crowd, a
little bit about the impetus

00:06:27.963 --> 00:06:30.490
for writing this musical.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.410
DUNCAN SHEIK: I'll
let Steven keep going.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.290
STEVEN SATER: OK, well we--

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.900
I suppose "Alice's
Adventures in Wonderland"

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.850
was proposed to us as
a project to develop.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.120
And I thought that the
form of "Alice" is--

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.360
it's no "Wizard of Oz."

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.300
It's all these
phantasmagorical visitations

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.060
upon this girl of all these
classic characters we know,

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.760
like the Mad Hatter,
and the Mock Turtle.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.950
And there's no beginning,
middle, and end.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.630
So I thought it wouldn't
really make a musical.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.062
And so we began a kind of
music project together,

00:07:03.062 --> 00:07:05.270
where we were going to create
a series of songs which

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.360
could become music
videos, sort of each song

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.690
trying to capture the magic
carpet ride of each chapter.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.440
And then one night, Jessie,
who's my beloved friend

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.390
and writing partner,
invited me to see

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.647
a concert of these young
theater geeks singing.

00:07:21.647 --> 00:07:23.480
And they was singing
Spring awakening songs.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.037
And I just thought,
oh, maybe we really

00:07:26.037 --> 00:07:28.370
could do something with "Alice"
around this theme of how

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.620
to leave childhood behind.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.360
And I talked to
Jessie about that.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.080
And the three of us kind of
pitched our tent together.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.810
And we actually like
used our own money.

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:42.118
And we found a bunch
of friends that Jessie

00:07:42.118 --> 00:07:44.660
knew, young people, including
Molly, who's been with the show

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.740
for nine years.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.100
BERNIE TELSEY: She doesn't age.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:53.900
STEVEN SATER: And we began
workshopping it and discovering

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.580
how much we didn't know.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.360
And continually coming up
against this great gift

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.840
and great challenge of this
book that didn't quite--

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.140
whose narrative didn't
quite add up in a way.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.710
And so infusing it
with this love story

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.830
about this girl and
this boy and her--

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:15.650
I'll say-- this is the
last thing I'll say.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.350
Her, those kind of
iconic characters

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.110
of "Wonderland" that I
mentioned a moment ago,

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:25.100
we kind of go through her
stages of denial and grief

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.095
for this boy she's
going to leave behind.

00:08:28.095 --> 00:08:29.220
BERNIE TELSEY: And Jessie--

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:31.333
oh, do you want to
say something, Duncan?

00:08:31.333 --> 00:08:32.750
DUNCAN SHEIK: Yeah,
I think what I

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:38.090
want to remind everybody of is
that it is a meta narrative.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.429
Molly's Alice is a girl
named Alice Spencer.

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:42.830
She's not actually
"Alice in Wonderland."

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:47.960
So she's-- out of this
coterie of people around her,

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.400
she's creating the "Wonderland"
characters in order to help

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:57.350
tell the story and to
console her dying love.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.000
So that's the complicated thing.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.110
Because it does help to know
the source material really well,

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:05.523
because it is a meta narrative.

00:09:05.523 --> 00:09:07.190
But I still think you
can go to the show

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.190
and enjoy it even if you
haven't read the books.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:10.607
BERNIE TELSEY:
Yeah, that's it was

00:09:10.607 --> 00:09:13.010
like for me, the first
time I saw a reading of it.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.793
I was not one of those
who was knowledgeable

00:09:15.793 --> 00:09:17.210
about every "Alice
in Wonderland",

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.938
but it was so easy
to connect to.

00:09:18.938 --> 00:09:19.730
DUNCAN SHEIK: Yeah.

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.447
BERNIE TELSEY: Because it
really is a modern day story.

00:09:22.447 --> 00:09:24.530
Jessie, I have a question
for you as the director.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.410
What was the most
challenging sort of element

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:29.985
in telling this story?

00:09:29.985 --> 00:09:31.610
JESSIE NELSON: I
think it's what Steven

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:35.330
articulated there,
the book, the source

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.200
material is very episodic.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.300
So getting a narrative flow
and really finding the story

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.830
we wanted to tell
with it, and yet

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.020
still honoring the
source material.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.070
And we would endlessly return
to the book for inspiration.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.920
And as we delved deeper
and deeper into the book,

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.560
you realize it's the
story of this young girl

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.900
also, who's saying,
I've shrunk enough.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.150
I'm not going to
shrink anymore to make

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.160
all you characters happy.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.080
And she's ruled--

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:07.520
Wonderland is ruled
by a Red Queen, who's

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.700
a tyrant, and a dictator,
and everybody fears her.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.260
But she's actually
kind of a fool.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.600
So we began to realize,
oh, there's actually

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.990
a lot of really timely
themes in the book

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:21.400
that we're interesting to mine.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.120
But we kept-- the process was
always going deeper and deeper

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.400
into the story.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.560
And I would like to say
in developing it with MCC,

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:34.880
they constantly encouraged
us to clarify the narrative

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.840
and deepen the storytelling.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.870
And they were right.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.280
That was the real work
that had to be done.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.980
BERNIE TELSEY: Right.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.890
Molly, as Steven said,
you've been with this project

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.870
for many years on and off.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.350
What was it like finally
getting to actually do

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.390
a production of the show?

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.000
MOLLY GORDON: It's
been so wonderful.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.740
I feel like I've gotten to
grow up through this project.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.310
And how incredibly
lucky is that.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:07.520
The music feels like hymns
of my childhood or something.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.930
Yet I still miss them up.

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:10.500
I don't know how.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.160
I should know it by now.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.370
And I think--

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.560
I was 14 when I
first started it,

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.860
and I still feel as
naive as I was then.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.930
And that's beautiful,
because Alice is very naive.

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:27.352
But I also think being
a full grown woman,

00:11:27.352 --> 00:11:28.560
it feels like the right time.

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.980
I feel like I have a greater
understanding of the character.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.650
And just getting to
work with this family

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.600
has been extraordinary.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.660
And like they're saying, it
feels like the right time

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.100
in the world to
be doing something

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.370
about the importance of
a book, or art, or any--

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.960
or the imagination.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.140
BERNIE TELSEY: And this is
maybe for you, or for Duncan,

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.970
and Steven, are there
any songs that you

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:56.010
have had to cut over the life
of "Alice" that you miss,

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.500
or wish was in, or we're all
going to be searching for?

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.215
JESSIE NELSON: We could have
a great night at 54 Below.

00:12:01.215 --> 00:12:02.460
BERNIE TELSEY: At MCC.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:03.877
DUNCAN SHEIK: How
long do you have

00:12:03.877 --> 00:12:06.580
for this Google talk, Bernie?

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.060
BERNIE TELSEY: OK, how about,
what would-- well, "Still"

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.260
was one of the newer songs.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.070
STEVEN SATER: It was, it was.

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:12.090
BERNIE TELSEY: That was
through the production.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:13.080
Tell us a little bit about that.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.310
STEVEN SATER: We were
in Poughkeepsie--

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:15.540
BERNIE TELSEY: That's
the song we just heard.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.160
STEVEN SATER: --with New York
Stage and Film this summer,

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.150
workshopping the show.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.420
And after eight years
talking about this and that,

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.130
and Jessie and I had
talked in the past

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.530
about possibly having a song
for the White Rabbit about time.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.530
And then for one reason
or another, it was like,

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.405
no, we don't have time
for a song about time,

00:12:30.405 --> 00:12:33.315
and he already sings two songs,
you know, blah, blah, blah.

00:12:33.315 --> 00:12:35.480
And then one day, I
came into reherseal--

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.230
JESSIE NELSON: I'm
going to interrupt you.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.560
STEVEN SATER: OK.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.143
JESSIE NELSON: He
is the White Rabbit.

00:12:39.143 --> 00:12:41.333
So I would say, let's
write a song about time.

00:12:41.333 --> 00:12:42.750
And Steven would
say, I don't have

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:44.440
time for a song about time.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.040
I'm running out of time.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.015
But things slowed
down in Poughkeepsie.

00:12:49.015 --> 00:12:49.890
Take it away, Steven.

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.057
STEVEN SATER: So I came in
one morning, bleary eyed,

00:12:52.057 --> 00:12:53.815
as we all were.

00:12:53.815 --> 00:12:55.440
And Jessie said, I
want to talk to you.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.580
I had a dream last night.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.470
She said OK.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.040
She said in my dream You
came to me and said--

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.350
in our dream, there
was this beautiful song

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.598
between Alice and Alfred, and
it was our song about time

00:13:07.598 --> 00:13:08.640
at the beginning of the--

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.500
and they had this moment.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.110
And it was July 3rd.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.360
And I remember we
worked through the day,

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.485
we sort of talked about it.

00:13:16.485 --> 00:13:17.580
She planted this idea.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.780
And then everyone
left Poughkeepsie

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.150
as fast as they could.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:22.350
And I was--

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:23.490
I stayed on campus.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.190
And I remember, this
was the 4th of July.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:27.990
I wrote this lyric.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.730
And I called Jessie
and read it to her.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.430
And she said, you
know, this could

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:34.888
be the song of their childhood.

00:13:34.888 --> 00:13:36.180
So we-- there were parts of it.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.130
So I simplifies in parts.

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:41.550
And then I gave it to
Duncan that next day,

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.460
because he came back July 5th.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.200
And like later that night,
Duncan said, can you come in--

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.230
I have something for that.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:53.190
And we sat together, which is
rare for us to be at the piano

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.150
together.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.630
And he played it for me.

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:57.430
And the next day we taught it.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.730
BERNIE TELSEY: That's rare.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:01.600
DUNCAN SHEIK: But to
answer your question,

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.780
there are a lot of cut
songs, really frankly,

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.320
none of which I miss very much.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.480
But there was, for
example, a song

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.870
for the turtle scene that
was like constantly staying

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:15.210
in the show, staying in the
show, staying in the show.

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.580
And I was like, ugh, can
we cut this bloody song,

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.500
it's like really pissing me off.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:24.090
And then finally, we
wrote a couple versions

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.270
of this new song, which is
really a song about grief.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.610
And to me, it's one of the
best moments in the show.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.670
So I think it's like a
testament to just keep

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.730
on keeping on, and
developing, and developing

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.680
until you got it exactly right.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.760
BERNIE TELSEY: Right.

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.610
And Colton, this is for
you, as the new person

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:43.550
of the group of these five--

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.780
COLTON RYAN: You outed me.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.530
BERNIE TELSEY: What was it
like coming to "Alice by Heart"

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:53.875
at MCC, and what it's like to
work on a brand new musical?

00:14:53.875 --> 00:14:56.250
Because I don't think people
understand what that's like.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:15:01.280
COLTON RYAN: For sure, well,
I would say it definitely--

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.480
and I've reiterated this
to you all many times,

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.260
but it felt like a weird sort
of cosmic gift in some way.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:11.340
Because I tried, I tried
to be a part of the show

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.280
a couple times.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.340
And for probably reasons
unbeknownst to me,

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.830
or I'm trying to
clarify now, I wasn't

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.800
in that kind of state
of honesty with myself

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.890
to work on a piece about this.

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:28.980
Well, I think that the thing
that, and my character,

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.580
and what he carries with
him obviously is a deeper

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.410
understanding of grief.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:37.030
Because he's experiencing
it with his best friend.

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.210
And having already
lost people and then

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.810
losing his own self
at such a young age,

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.750
it's a big maturing
agent, as it is for her.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:51.270
And that meant more
to me than I probably

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.340
would care to share publicly.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:59.340
But when I finally got to it, I
felt like it was this sort of--

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.850
well, it was also done,
which I was very happy with.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.090
It was beautiful.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:06.880
And I was like,
thank you for this.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.740
And so I got to just
kind of jump in and ride

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:14.690
the coattails of this obviously
deep, deep, profound work

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.870
that they'd been
doing for so long.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:20.378
And yeah, I mean, we
did do some new things.

00:16:20.378 --> 00:16:21.420
But it's definitely not--

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.580
I mean, I've worked
on some projects

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.710
where it's, like you said,
it's you come in the next day,

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.148
and it's, we're
presenting today,

00:16:26.148 --> 00:16:27.440
but we have an entire new song.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.160
So let's get in the
trenches and just do it.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.910
And I think-- if you guys
will come see this thing,

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.270
this thing is very visual.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.850
So we had--

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:40.520
I'm sure what you guys, the
work you did was on the page,

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.490
and it was deeply
profound, like I said.

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:46.400
But then it was about
making this thing fly

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.690
and making it wondrous.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:50.645
And that was a process.

00:16:50.645 --> 00:16:52.320
It was a very fun process.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.390
It was a tedious process.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.660
And it was, as I think
you saw in the video,

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.770
and I hope you guys
come to see, it's

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.020
definitely pushed me in ways--

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:00.920
BERNIE TELSEY: Very physical.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.128
COLTON RYAN: Yeah, and pushed
me in ways that I never

00:17:03.128 --> 00:17:04.079
thought I would go to.

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:06.140
So it's been a gift, yeah.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.420
DUNCAN SHEIK: I think
between Jessie's sort

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.760
of amazing use of
just the materials

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.130
that you might have
found in the underground

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.220
and making them really
wondrous and magical,

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:18.180
that takes a ton of work.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.180
And then Rick and
Jeff, the Kupermans,

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.579
the choreographers,
you know, it's very--

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:25.740
like almost every moment of
the show, when I watch it,

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.440
is choreographed in some way.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.230
It's more movement than dance.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:33.410
But it was so much
work for all of them.

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:35.870
And so I was just
like, oh, I'm really

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.513
impressed with their ethic.

00:17:38.513 --> 00:17:40.430
BERNIE TELSEY: I think
every actor has come up

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:43.370
to me on the side and
said, so why was there

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.500
never any dance auditions?

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:49.460
Or why didn't no one tell us
this was about choreography.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.380
You know, it just
sort of happened.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:55.010
And it's quite stunning to watch
what Jessie and the Kupermans

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:56.967
have done.

00:17:56.967 --> 00:17:58.550
I have a question
about collaboration,

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.830
just because I think
people don't really

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.950
know how people work
on these new musicals.

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:06.710
But it's funny when
you say, you're

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.120
not near the piano that often.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:11.390
Or as a producer of
the show, I was always

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:15.027
amazed at how the
silences and the subtext

00:18:15.027 --> 00:18:16.860
in the way the three
of you worked together,

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.370
whether it was you two on this
thing, or you two on that.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.850
And it just seems that
kind of collaboration

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.080
just came so naturally.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.190
And I know it's not.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.590
I know that's one of the
hardest things in the theater,

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.300
of getting everyone
to work together.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.280
Because it's OK to
disagree and all that.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.860
But it felt like
there's a little bit

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.780
of a magic halo over
the three of you

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.332
of how you work together.

00:18:37.332 --> 00:18:39.290
And maybe you can talk
a little bit about that.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:44.310
JESSIE NELSON: I
think collaboration

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:45.840
is all about trust.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.420
And that takes time to develop.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.640
And we had a number
of years together.

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:56.400
But I think over
those years, we began

00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.110
to all feel that on
most levels, we were

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:03.010
moving in the same direction.

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:06.210
But I don't think it's easy to
trust someone with your work.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:08.760
I think that's a--

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:10.120
we're all very protective.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.540
And so opening up to
that is a slow process.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.950
And I just think we had time.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.170
Would you articulate
it that way?

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.860
DUNCAN SHEIK: Yeah,
for me, it is hard.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.170
Because like growing up
as a singer, songwriter,

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:29.670
just being able to
make my own records,

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:32.170
I didn't have to
answer to anybody.

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.560
And then when you're working
with a team like this,

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:40.440
you really do have to allow
different peoples aesthetics

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.520
to sort of come into play.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.410
And sometimes that can
be sort of incredibly,

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.900
like this is not
what I'm into at all.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.300
But then it can be
incredibly galvanizing.

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:54.210
You know, so, I do
think that we didn't

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.020
have the benefit of a decade.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:59.280
And so we finally found
a way to put it together.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.020
But that is tough work.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:05.063
BERNIE TELSEY: Right, I have
a question for the actors.

00:20:05.063 --> 00:20:07.230
I've heard a lot of the
actors in the dressing rooms

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:09.210
and backstage talk about,
because there are so

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:12.540
many wonderful different
characters in "Alice by Heart,"

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:15.360
based on the story of
"Alice in Wonderland,"

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:20.160
if there was another role you
could play, what would it be?

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.510
COLTON RYAN: The queen.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:23.520
BERNIE TELSEY: Why?

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.360
COLTON RYAN: Why?

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.402
Have you seen her number?

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:30.650
Yeah, I mean-- who
would you play?

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:32.400
MOLLY GORDON: Yeah, I
think the queen too.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.090
Or any of the--

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:38.040
I think what I love about
this show, now that it exists,

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.070
is that so many high schools
will be able to do it.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:45.060
I think every single role in the
show is so juicy, and amazing,

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:45.560
and wacky.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.852
BERNIE TELSEY: They really are.

00:20:46.852 --> 00:20:49.320
MOLLY GORDON: And bizarre
in the best way possible.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.220
And it's a piece that you can
do with a lot of people, or not

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:57.100
that many people, because
you can play multiple roles.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.782
So I would love to
be any of the parts.

00:20:58.782 --> 00:21:00.240
That's what I love
about the piece,

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.220
is that they're
all really special.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.000
BERNIE TELSEY: How about
you, Jessie, Steven, Duncan?

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.980
STEVEN SATER: Well I'm pre-cast.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.772
BERNIE TELSEY: Oh,
yeah, yeah, that's true.

00:21:08.772 --> 00:21:09.500
We all know that.

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.917
COLTON RYAN: He's
the under study.

00:21:10.917 --> 00:21:11.950
BERNIE TELSEY: Yeah.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.070
DUNCAN SHEIK: You know,
Noah Galvin, who's

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:18.150
sort of like a big TV star,
he's been with the project

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:19.440
also for a really long time.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.910
And he plays the Duchess.

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:24.450
And I'm just like dying
every time he comes onstage

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:25.380
as the Duchess.

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.920
So I couldn't pull it off.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.383
But if I could, I
would love to do that.

00:21:30.383 --> 00:21:31.800
JESSIE NELSON: You
know, I'm going

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.440
to jump back to your earlier
question about collaboration.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.710
Because this is a
really interesting--

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:40.620
they've had a longtime
collaboration prior to me

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:41.610
joining their world.

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:44.730
And watching the two
of them collaborate,

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.490
I think there's something that
happens when they come together

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:49.140
that's bigger than
the both of them.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.410
They're like a
vessel for something

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:54.840
deeper than either
of them understand.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:59.160
And so sometimes it can be
a cranky, hard, moody day.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.260
And yet, the piece that
will come out of them

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.840
will be so tender,
and heartfelt,

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:06.563
and kind of break
everybody's hearts.

00:22:06.563 --> 00:22:08.730
And that's an interesting
thing about collaboration.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:13.020
Like how your molecules combine
with somebody else's and what

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:13.740
comes out of it.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.880
I remember the day "Afternoon"
was written, in a high school

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.980
music room, that we
had kind of snuck

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.450
into, and were
getting for nothing.

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.818
And we were trying to find
the show and it kind of just

00:22:23.818 --> 00:22:25.860
came through Steven, and
then came through Duncan

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.550
at the piano.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:31.630
And it's kind of bigger than
who you are as human beings.

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.450
It's a bigger thing
that you open to.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.370
And I remember watching
that song kind of move

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:36.870
through the both of them.

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:39.400
So it's-- I don't mean
to be too spiritual.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.550
But it's a very mystical
thing, collaboration.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:44.070
DUNCAN SHEIK: Jessie,
you're getting so mystical.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:44.710
BERNIE TELSEY: OK, but now--

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:45.120
JESSIE NELSON: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.320
DUNCAN SHEIK: Yes.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.870
BERNIE TELSEY: But now what role
do you want to play, Jessie?

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:51.450
JESSIE NELSON: Well in our
creative thing, I'm Alice.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:54.870
I'm like slow down, enjoy the
page, let's explore this scene.

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:56.490
Take a minute, let's
write more lines.

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:59.170
We're moving too fast.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:00.690
But in real life, I'm very shy.

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:02.610
So I think I would
be in the ensemble,

00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:05.343
like lifting people up.

00:23:05.343 --> 00:23:07.260
BERNIE TELSEY: I know a
few of us on the staff

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.260
have been saying the same thing.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.135
We all want to do the
dance number coming out

00:23:10.135 --> 00:23:12.160
of it, before the turtle song.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.850
We all just want to come right
out of the gate and do that.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.800
That was a bad
version of it, but I--

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.260
a few of us are
practicing, right?

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.177
For the closing night.

00:23:20.177 --> 00:23:21.760
JESSIE NELSON: I
look forward to this.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.390
BERNIE TELSEY: Yeah, it's going
to be our gift to the cast.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.490
Can you talk a little bit
about the choreography, Jessie,

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.110
and what it was like
working with the Kupermans

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:28.980
and creating.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:30.967
COLTON RYAN: Yeah,
it was interesting.

00:23:30.967 --> 00:23:32.550
To be honest,
initially, I was sort of

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:34.740
given the mandate of
finding choreographers that

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.840
had some Broadway experience.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.688
And I just kept
meeting with people

00:23:39.688 --> 00:23:41.480
and feeling like they
weren't quite getting

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.990
what was in my head, or that
it might be more normal than I

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.990
had imagined.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.440
And I really felt
committed to this notion

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:52.340
of Wonderland built on gas
masks, and cots, and blankets.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.593
And I met the
Kupermans-- or actually I

00:23:55.593 --> 00:23:56.510
had a Skype with them.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:58.610
And there was everything
going against them.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:23:59.990
They had no Broadway experience.

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.360
They didn't even have
that much experience.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.320
There were two of them.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.580
That's an additional
thing-- everything

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:05.580
was going against them.

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:08.120
And within five minutes
of my Skype with them,

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.980
I realized, oh,
these are the ones.

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.020
So then it was how to
manipulate everybody

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.140
so that we could end up
having the Kupermans.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.300
But again, I think
Steven, and Duncan,

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.322
and I were very
allied in this feeling

00:24:19.322 --> 00:24:21.530
that we wanted something
very original, and something

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:23.197
that hadn't been done
before, and hadn't

00:24:23.197 --> 00:24:25.310
been seen on Broadway before.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.440
And they have
remarkable imaginations.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.330
And they're so
tenacious in their work.

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:32.922
And so--

00:24:32.922 --> 00:24:34.380
DUNCAN SHEIK: And
huge appreciation

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:38.572
to MCC for allowing
us to take that risk.

00:24:38.572 --> 00:24:40.030
BERNIE TELSEY: Oh,
it's been a joy.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:41.483
It's been a joy.

00:24:41.483 --> 00:24:42.150
So we're going--

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:43.190
COLTON RYAN: Can I say
something about them too?

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.560
BERNIE TELSEY: Yeah, please.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:45.910
COLTON RYAN: They're like,
they're very singular,

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.700
because there are two of them.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:52.060
But they're like these
two guys who are like 28,

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:54.610
and like big, and like bro-ie.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.340
And they're like, dude, what if
like we piled a bunch of bodies

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.632
up and then we like jumped off.

00:24:58.632 --> 00:25:00.450
And he's like, yes, and what if.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:02.642
And like they just keep going.

00:25:02.642 --> 00:25:04.600
BERNIE TELSEY: And you
have to see their faces.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.097
COLTON RYAN: Yeah, we're like--

00:25:06.097 --> 00:25:07.930
MOLLY GORDON: No, but
also there are so many

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:11.410
shows on Broadway that
can pay for people to fly.

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:12.950
And we don't have that money.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:16.270
So all my friends
have to make me fly.

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:19.480
And that's a lot and
tiring for them to do.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.910
But I think it's more
beautiful because it's

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:25.030
all these bodies picking
each other up and supporting

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:26.680
each other, rather than--

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.200
JESSIE NELSON: It's'
very hand made.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.270
MOLLY GORDON: Yeah,
it's very hand made.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:29.895
COLTON RYAN: They
never lacked an idea.

00:25:29.895 --> 00:25:32.618
It was always like-- because if
there was an issue, like, oh,

00:25:32.618 --> 00:25:34.660
you know, the very tentacle
thing of like someone

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.480
can't make that, they can't lift
that with just their shoulders,

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.495
they're like no problem.

00:25:38.495 --> 00:25:40.120
And then what if--
and like they always

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.450
had 14 other ideas ready.

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:45.920
Or they just were, they
were so open to just

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.870
to not have an idea and
then come up with one.

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:52.720
I mean, it was very inspiring
for me as not as a dancer.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.190
MOLLY GORDON:
Non-dancer or mover.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:54.790
COLTON RYAN: Who is now--

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:55.120
MOLLY GORDON: Who
has never moved.

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.120
COLTON RYAN: --a dancer.

00:25:58.363 --> 00:26:00.280
Now only exclusively
works in the dance world.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.672
It was very inspiring to see.

00:26:01.672 --> 00:26:03.880
BERNIE TELSEY: Steven, did
you want to say something?

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:04.750
STEVEN SATER: No, I
was just going to say,

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:05.830
but that's our theme.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.570
So that's why it
was so moving to me.

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.858
It's-- they were creating the
wonder of Wonderland really.

00:26:10.858 --> 00:26:11.650
BERNIE TELSEY: Yes.

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.050
STEVEN SATER: The costumes
and Jessie's idea--

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.690
creating it out of
helmets and war materials,

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:19.210
but also this movement
that takes you

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.820
into your imagination
with the music.

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:24.543
And that's, as
opposed to, as Molly--

00:26:24.543 --> 00:26:25.960
we didn't have
that kind of budget

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.400
to have huge flying set pieces
and people flying, you know.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.650
And that was the
beauty of the journey.

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:35.820
And I think it's the
reward of the production.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:36.490
DUNCAN SHEIK: Yeah,
that's ultimately

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:38.630
the benefit is that we
didn't have that stuff.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.290
So we had to make
use of what we had.

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:43.480
STEVEN SATER: The lines, yeah.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.360
BERNIE TELSEY: So we're going to
do one more song from the show.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:50.590
And before I have Jessie set
up this scene, after the song,

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:53.410
we'll take some questions from
the audience, if you have.

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:55.960
So you could-- you guys
know how to line up

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.520
during that applause.

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.970
And then we'll take
some questions.

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:01.720
Jessie, you want to
set up this next song.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.553
JESSIE NELSON: Sure.

00:27:02.553 --> 00:27:04.690
This is a song called
"Another Room in your Head."

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:07.420
And in the screenplay
world, we'd

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.570
say this song happens at the
second act turning point, which

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:13.270
is Alice's has been in
denial about the fact

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:15.310
that her dear friend is dying.

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:17.710
And she finally, in this
scene, after she watches

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:20.830
him cough blood on the
roses of Wonderland,

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:23.140
and they all turn
red, she really

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.390
accepts that he's going to die.

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:28.510
And he says to her,
you have to find a way

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:30.223
to continue on without me.

00:27:30.223 --> 00:27:32.890
And he says, will you be able to
find another room in your head?

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:35.650
He poses that
question in the song.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:39.070
And this is sort of the White
Rabbit's most compassionate

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:41.853
moment with her, of trying
to have her accept this.

00:27:41.853 --> 00:27:44.020
And also realize she's going
to continue without him

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:45.610
and she has to find
a way to do that.

00:28:01.354 --> 00:28:05.094
[COLTON RYAN AND MOLLY GORDON

00:28:05.094 --> 00:29:22.338
HEAD"]

00:31:24.544 --> 00:31:26.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:30.532 --> 00:31:33.072
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:33.072 --> 00:31:34.280
COLTON RYAN: We did it again.

00:31:36.683 --> 00:31:38.600
BERNIE TELSEY: So if
anybody has any questions

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:43.018
for anybody on the creative
team, we welcome them.

00:31:43.018 --> 00:31:43.560
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:43.970
BERNIE TELSEY: Hi.

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:45.360
AUDIENCE: Guys, I saw the show.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.263
It's fantastic, really
visually amazing.

00:31:48.263 --> 00:31:50.430
So congratulations, I mean,
what you've accomplished

00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:51.350
is really stellar.

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:53.480
DUNCAN SHEIK: Thank you.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.750
AUDIENCE: Two questions,
one, Jessie and Molly,

00:31:56.750 --> 00:32:00.413
did I catch the name similarity?

00:32:00.413 --> 00:32:02.330
MOLLY GORDON: We don't
have a name similarity,

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:03.860
but that's my mom.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:07.820
AUDIENCE: Oh, yes, how is
it working with your mom?

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.100
MOLLY GORDON: It's wonderful.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:10.760
AUDIENCE: And second
question, so I don't have to--

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:11.210
MOLLY GORDON: No, please.

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:12.502
AUDIENCE: --ruin the flow here.

00:32:12.502 --> 00:32:14.570
Is there going to
be a cast recording?

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:16.550
DUNCAN SHEIK: We are
attempting to do it

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:18.910
actually like in 10 days.

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:21.740
But, yeah, there's
still a couple things

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:22.670
we need to figure out.

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:23.907
But definitely one.

00:32:23.907 --> 00:32:24.740
AUDIENCE: Good luck.

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:25.620
It'll be compelling.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:26.813
DUNCAN SHEIK: Yeah, thanks.

00:32:26.813 --> 00:32:28.300
AUDIENCE: Wait you didn't
answer my question.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:29.883
MOLLY GORDON: Oh,
working with my mom.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:34.220
I feel incredibly
lucky, because--

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:38.010
so, I've known all of these
people since I was a kid.

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:41.390
So it feels kind of
like this huge family.

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:44.360
And then my mom and I
are incredibly close.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.740
I'm an only child.

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.670
And getting to work with her
has been the greatest gift.

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:52.580
And she sets such
a professional tone

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:54.710
with me and with the whole cast.

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:56.180
But also, it's
wonderful, because I

00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:00.080
think she can shoot
me an eye movement,

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:02.220
and I know a little
bit maybe more quickly

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.100
what she's feeling.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:09.470
But I think we look up to
people, like Cassavetes,

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:10.680
that work with their family.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:12.930
And this is our first real
time working together.

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:15.590
And it's been incredible.

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:18.590
So I hope that I will get
that opportunity again.

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:20.840
BERNIE TELSEY: I would just
say being a witness of it,

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.970
it's that thing that
you were talking

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:26.150
about, what makes a wonderful
collaboration, the trust.

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:29.210
And this, you know,
it's just the silences.

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:31.310
And there's such a trust
that you're willing--

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:32.977
because so much about
working on theater

00:33:32.977 --> 00:33:35.030
is having to trust
the person that you're

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:36.800
taking a direction from.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.690
I mean, because you're
working on your own process.

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:43.910
And once there's that trust,
you just are able to listen.

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:47.420
And I was lucky enough to work
with another father-son team,

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:51.960
Peter Hedges and Lucas Hedges,
on the movie, "Ben is Back."

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.720
But it was the
same kind of thing

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:56.750
that you both had, that
it allows you to go

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.420
that much further, I think.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:03.100
AUDIENCE: I also saw the
show and it was fantastic.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.600
I was wondering, if you've been
working on the show for nine

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.449
years, you talked about
bringing the choreographers on,

00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:11.510
at what stage does that happen.

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:12.942
And like the set design as well.

00:34:12.942 --> 00:34:14.900
I mean, I imagine that
can't have been going on

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:15.817
for nine years, right?

00:34:15.817 --> 00:34:18.639
So what's the timeline of
all that coming together?

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:21.110
DUNCAN SHEIK: It was
late in the process.

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:24.114
I'm trying to remember when
the choreographers came on.

00:34:24.114 --> 00:34:25.989
JESSIE NELSON: These
came after [INAUDIBLE]..

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:26.960
BERNIE TELSEY: Yeah,
the choreography

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.745
came on before the
production at MCC

00:34:28.745 --> 00:34:32.110
in a little bit of a
choreographic lab beforehand.

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:35.000
DUNCAN SHEIK: Yeah, and then
things like the orchestrations,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.480
which you know, Simon Hale did
these really beautiful things

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.510
for just three instruments,
a brass, a reed and a cello.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:43.639
That happened quite at the end.

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:45.710
Jason Hart did the
vocal arrangements.

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:49.580
And he's been working on
it for maybe five years.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:52.940
But a lot of these things
did come together quite late

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.159
in the process.

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:55.909
STEVEN SATER: I think,
Duncan and I always

00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:58.730
joke that we do
workshops for a living.

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:00.620
And part of it is--

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:02.090
MOLLY GORDON: They
pay really well.

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:03.632
STEVEN SATER: That's
what I'm saying.

00:35:03.632 --> 00:35:06.170
It's the state of theater
with new musicals,

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:07.460
you're really on your own.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:10.100
I mean, we began this
literally on our own.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:14.360
But then you kind of go
from shelter to shelter.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.530
Aspen has you out
for two weeks and you

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:18.530
get as much as you can
done, and you try and get

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:19.738
some vocal arrangements done.

00:35:19.738 --> 00:35:21.720
You try and find
casts, like we found

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.930
Noah Galvin to go to Aspen.

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:27.250
But it's really all in
your head is the reality.

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:29.060
It was really Jessie
and I rewriting

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:33.020
stage directions of what we
imagined for those years.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:36.935
And then there's a process
of choosing designers,

00:35:36.935 --> 00:35:40.250
of trying to find the right,
designers, which was months,

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:40.910
you know.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:41.790
That was a long--

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:43.640
and then you're just
in it with them.

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.110
You start designing.

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:46.520
And you know--

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:48.770
I mean, I wasn't part of the
process working with them

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:49.760
like that.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.440
But it's very late in the game.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.830
And suddenly, the
production-- and your casting.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:56.340
We had this rare fortune too.

00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:00.740
Let's just say that our producer
is also the leading casting

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:02.290
director there is.

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:03.500
And so we had--

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.980
we had a lot of rehearsal,
a lot of auditions.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.560
And I think what Bernie and
Jessie managed to do together

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.780
was bring us a cast of stars.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:13.550
So you feel like
everyone in Wonderland

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:16.670
gets their star turn moment.

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:18.110
You really do.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:19.152
BERNIE TELSEY: Thank you.

00:36:19.152 --> 00:36:21.610
AUDIENCE: Actually that was a
great lead in to my question.

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:22.940
So my question is for Bernie.

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:24.440
Being the legendary
casting director

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:27.805
that you are, but a
producer on this show,

00:36:27.805 --> 00:36:29.680
what was it like putting
the producer hat on?

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.610
And how are the differences
from a normal product

00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:34.720
that you work on in
the casting capacity?

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:36.580
BERNIE TELSEY:
Yeah, I mean I love

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:38.440
doing what we get to do at MCC.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.020
And there's a few of
us on the producing

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:42.310
staff and the artistic staff.

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:44.710
But it was just
wonderful to get to be

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:45.940
part of that collaboration.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.770
A lot of times with
casting, you're

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:49.690
done once the
auditions are done.

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:52.600
And then you go and you see
the show at dress rehearsal

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:54.270
or opening night.

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:57.070
And for "Alice," to be part
of that process with the cast,

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:59.527
and with Jessie,
and the authors,

00:36:59.527 --> 00:37:01.360
it's so different and
wonderful, because you

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:05.140
get to have your sort of
hand in the cake, you know,

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:08.440
as you're making
it with everybody.

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:11.770
And seeing it change daily,
you know, from things

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:14.620
that they were doing with
the story, or the staging,

00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.049
or the acting.

00:37:16.049 --> 00:37:16.882
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:22.240
BERNIE TELSEY: Anybody else?

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.632
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:37:23.632 --> 00:37:25.340
I'm seeing the show
in a week and a half.

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:28.540
So I'm even more so
excited than I was.

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.010
Is there anything
you wish people

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:33.947
knew coming into the show
that they might not already?

00:37:33.947 --> 00:37:35.530
BERNIE TELSEY: That's
a good question.

00:37:38.967 --> 00:37:41.050
JESSIE NELSON: I would say
it might be interesting

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:44.980
for you to read the book,
just because it's always

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:48.100
interesting to examine the
source material of what's

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.630
something sprung from.

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:51.150
It's not necessary, as we said.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:55.000
But it is interesting to
see how much of these themes

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.550
exist in the book.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:38:02.140
DUNCAN SHEIK: And I would
say, just know that, you know,

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.240
I'm trying to put this
as politely as I can.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:09.520
But I think Steven comes from a
tradition of Albee, and Pinter,

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.270
and Stoppard.

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:11.980
And so there's a
lot of wordplay.

00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:14.590
And it's not always--

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:17.660
it's something you really
have to sort of lean into

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:20.420
to get what's going
on to some extent.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:21.790
And I think that's a good thing.

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:25.130
Because it's important,
profound stuff.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:30.340
But don't expect an evening's
light entertainment.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:34.080
MOLLY GORDON: Yeah,
I would say also

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:37.940
to really listen to the lyrics,
because they're so beautiful.

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:42.400
And I think so many musicals
have such incredible lyrics.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.900
But I think this
one specifically,

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.170
the word play is so genius.

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:50.470
And if you-- you have to
lean in a little bit more

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:53.150
to pick up on all of them.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:55.360
But if you can, lean,
I would lean in.

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.318
DUNCAN SHEIK: If you can,
it's rewarding, yeah.

00:38:59.248 --> 00:39:01.040
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you so much for coming.

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.310
I think this story of
"Alice in Wonderland"

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:05.650
is really fantastical
and absurd.

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:09.760
And it might relate like to
reality in different ways.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.130
How did you choose
the setting, to be

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:14.950
in London and during
this particular time?

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:18.580
And what other settings could
this story possibly relate to?

00:39:20.728 --> 00:39:23.145
JESSIE NELSON: It could have
related to a lot of settings.

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:31.560
For me personally, my dad
was a pilot in World War II.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.360
He was stationed in
London during the blitz

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.770
when he was 19.

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:36.830
And he spent a lot of
time in the tube stations

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:37.830
while London was bombed.

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:41.258
So I grew up on those
stories of huddled

00:39:41.258 --> 00:39:43.800
together, and the girl that he
got a crush on, named Bubbles,

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.300
while London was being bombed.

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.340
And these amazing
stories of being

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:51.510
a young man with no real
awareness of the situation,

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:53.250
of the soberness of
the situation that he

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:54.360
was dealing with.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.790
And Steven had a real
connection to that time,

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:57.870
more in a literary way.

00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:59.350
You might speak to that.

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:01.080
But we came to--

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.390
that was kind of
effortless, coming together

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:05.700
on the notion of being
in a tube station.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.200
It seemed like the
perfect metaphor,

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.980
because Alice falls
down the hole.

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.420
And so to begin our
story underground,

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:14.850
where she's already fallen
down a really dark hole,

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:17.700
seemed like an
interesting point.

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:20.250
STEVEN SATER: And it
seemed, there was--

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:22.393
just furthering
everything Jessie said.

00:40:22.393 --> 00:40:24.310
There was-- I don't know
if you remember this,

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:28.020
we worked on the show
in London at one point.

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.520
And there was a terrible--
not when we were there,

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:33.060
but prior to our going,
there was a terrible--

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:35.040
there was a terrorist
attack in a tube station.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.910
It's happened repeatedly
around the world.

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:39.930
But bombs went off.

00:40:39.930 --> 00:40:42.330
And there's this
sense of the fragility

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:44.010
of the world, and
our world today,

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:47.850
and the urgency, the
kind of urgent situation

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:49.530
we can be living in.

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:51.360
I think also as the
piece developed,

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.460
because our cultural
landscape changed

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:57.810
a lot over the last nine
years, I think we can say,

00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:00.750
we saw more and more people
living in encampments.

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:03.970
We saw more and more
displaced individuals.

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:10.320
So those themes, we began to
mine and look for within the--

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:13.583
how the material could serve the
story we were trying to tell.

00:41:13.583 --> 00:41:15.000
Now I think "Alice
in Wonderland,"

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.010
part of what's so amazing
about "Alice's Adventures

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:19.302
in Wonderland" and all the
"Alice in Wonderland" movies

00:41:19.302 --> 00:41:23.350
is, it can be reinvented
in so many ways.

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:25.530
DUNCAN SHEIK: Yeah, I
mean for about 20 minutes,

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:29.020
I really thought it should be
set in some dystopian future,

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.980
like where the world has
completely fallen apart.

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:37.470
But I was quickly disabused
of that notion by these guys.

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:40.020
But I do think it's
a story that could

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:43.860
be told in many
different contexts, yeah.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:44.820
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:47.237
BERNIE TELSEY: I think we have
time for one last question,

00:41:47.237 --> 00:41:48.330
if anybody has.

00:41:51.288 --> 00:41:52.760
Oh, come on.

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:55.940
AUDIENCE: One more song.

00:41:58.778 --> 00:42:00.320
BERNIE TELSEY: Yeah,
I wish we could.

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.910
We don't have our piano player.

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:04.950
We have a lot more songs.

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:07.190
DUNCAN SHEIK: Yeah,
just come see the show.

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:09.610
BERNIE TELSEY: Remember,
we run until April 7th

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:12.230
up at 52nd Street
on the MCC Theater.

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:14.670
So come see "Alice by Heart."

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:18.050
And thank you to this incredible
creative team, thank you.

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:20.200
[APPLAUSE]
