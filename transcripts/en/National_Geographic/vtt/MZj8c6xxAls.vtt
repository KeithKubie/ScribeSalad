00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.333
Should I brew more?

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:07.200
Still warm, and
it's been awhile.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.333
But the Law of Cooling
is a decaying exponential.

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.233
But you need a measurement
on the liquid to get the heat

00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:12.533
transfer coefficient.

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.166
Don't worry about the
measurement for now.

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:16.133
We'll find a new way
to think about it.

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.600
All right, so
forget the T entirely.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.300
What if we thought of
molecules like people.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.467
Yes, moving at
impossible speeds,

00:00:24.467 --> 00:00:26.000
bumping into one another!

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.600
And the amount
of pressure people

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.066
feel can be understood by how
frequently these bumps happen.

00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.900
More people, more pressure.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.333
No, not necessarily.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.700
How big is the room?

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.367
Say they're crammed
into a crowded hallway,

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:41.166
jostling and bumping,
late for class.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.033
High pressure, yes?

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:47.100
[laughing]

00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:03.600
Mileva, are you all right?

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.367
I am.

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:10.734
Now let's place them in a grand
ballroom, the same people.

00:01:10.734 --> 00:01:17.700
No more, no less, only
now 10 times the size.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.967
Enough to dance freely
around the room.

00:01:21.967 --> 00:01:22.900
More volume.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.934
Fewer collisions.

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:26.200
BOTH: Lower pressure.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:40.266
[MUSIC - RICHARD STRAUSS, "BLUE
DANUBE"]

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:45.900
Let's write a paper together.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.867
On what?

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:47.867
This isn't a new thought.

00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:49.066
Just a new way of seeing it.

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:50.333
What if this is
the way to prove

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:53.000
the existence of molecules?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.567
Doesn't it sound
like fun, dolly?

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:57.433
You and me writing a paper
that could change the world.

00:01:57.433 --> 00:01:59.867
And probability of chaos.

00:01:59.867 --> 00:02:00.934
Not the title I would
choose, but we can discuss it.
