&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.350
&gt;&gt; Janice Hyde: Good afternoon.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.650
My name is Janice Hyde.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.690
And I'm the interim director of
the John W. Kluge Center here

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.960
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.620
The John W. Kluge Center is
delighted to host today's lecture.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.410
The Kluge Center brings
together scholars and researchers

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.300
from around the world to exchange
ideas and energize one another,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.450 position:56%
to distill wisdom from the library's
rich resources and to interact

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.990
with policymakers and the public.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.640
The center offers opportunities
for senior scholars

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.710
and post-doctoral fellows
to do research

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.400
in the unparalleled collections
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.730
It also offers free public
lectures, conferences, symposia

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.030
and other programs,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.800
and it periodically
confers the Kluge Prize,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.090
which recognizes lifetime
achievement

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.230
in the humanities and
social sciences.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.190
For more information
about the Kluge Center,

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.730

LOC.gov/Kluge.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.030
I also invite you to sign
up for our RSS email list

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.020
to receive information
about future programs

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.940
and opportunities for research.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.880
Today's program is titled Peace
and Concord in the Qur'an.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.130
It features Dr. Juan Cole, the
2016 Kluge chair in Countries

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.280
and Cultures of the South.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.570
Dr. Cole's research at the Library
of Congress examines the concept

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.620
of peace in Muslim scripture.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.500 position:56%
He has traced the evolution of peace
and corollary ideas chronologically

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.120
and contextually through the text
with special attention to sets

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.450
of words grouped together
that reference the topic.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.600
In today's lecture he will provide
a tour of the irenic messages,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.580
those related to peace and
concord embedded in the Qur'an.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.990 position:56%
Juan Cole is the Richard P. Mitchell
collegiate professor of history

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.950
at the University of Michigan.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.360
He has authored or edited more
than ten books on the Middle East,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.740
including The New Arabs:

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.490
How the Millennial Generation
is changing the Middle East.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.880
His informed comment blog
provides historical context

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.230
to modern day events
in the Muslim world.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.900 position:56%
Dr. Cole has appeared on ABC Nightly
News, Nightline, the Today Show,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.180
Charlie Rose, Anderson Cooper 360,
Chris Hayes' All In, Rachel Meadow,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.640
the Colbert Report,
and Democracy Now.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.110
Dr. Cole has agreed to respond

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.610
to a few questions following
this presentation and I ask

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.730
that you wait please until you
receive a microphone before asking

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.620
your question so that we can record
both the question and the response.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.510
It is now my pleasure to invite
to the podium, Dr. Juan Cole.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.360
[ Applause ]

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.220
&gt;&gt; Juan Cole: Well thank
you very much, Janice,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.850
for that warm introduction.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.920
And my thanks to the Kluge Center
whose resources and the staff

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.450
of the center and the
Library of Congress have been

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.920
so incredibly helpful to me
in my research this summer.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:18.210
And for the nice appointment
to the Kluge chair this summer.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.230
My subject as you have all heard
is peace and harmony in the Qur'an.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.790
And I'm aware that I'm swimming
against the tide a little bit here

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.830
with this subject, but let me
see if I can make my case to you.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.500 position:56%
I want to underline that the Qur'an,
like the Bible, has verses in it

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.900
about peace and it has
verses in it about war.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.230
Somehow the latter
get more attention.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.400
And when I first started
thinking about writing this book,

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.370
I became excited at the idea
and then I thought, "Well,

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.670
it must have been done to death."

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.070
And so I went to the bibliographic
literature and did a search

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.020
and I found that there are
some works on the subject,

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.640
but it's not a really
big literature.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.960
And I was surprised actually

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.750
at how little the subject
has been addressed.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.910
Whereas there are lots and lots
of books about war and Jihad

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.430
and so forth in the Qur'an.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.240
I also want to underline
that when I say peace,

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.660 position:56%
of course I'm using an English word.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.660
And words have different
meanings in different languages.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.540
I think of it as a
spectrum, you know.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.490
Typically a word in one language
overlaps with part of the meaning

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.230
of a word in another language,

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.860
but then there are
parts that are left out.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.930
So peace in Semitic
languages, in Hebrew and Arabic,

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.250
scholars have observed is
not just the absence of war.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.620
It's not the absence of conflict.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.090
That's implied.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.870
But it has a positive
meaning of wellbeing.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:14.010
And so it goes along with -- we
say often peace and prosperity.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.520
We use two words to get at
probably what the Hebrew Bible

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.160
or the Qur'an means by one word.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:29.380
And so then not only does
peace mean different things

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:36.640
in different languages, a range
of semantic signification,

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:42.230
but also there are different
kinds of peace even in English.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.370 position:56%
We say that someone has inner peace.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.820
You could imagine saying
that a Marine at the height

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.910
of a battle was possessed
with a kind of inner peace.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:04.640
So inner peace wouldn't necessarily
be contrary to being in war.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.940
There's peace with God.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.530
We say, we have the phrase,
making one's peace with God.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.300
There's peace with
members of your ingroup.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.180
This is a challenge to
achieve every Thanksgiving,

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.840
but we make the attempt.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.480 position:56%
There's peace with members of the
outgroup, which is also challenging.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.840 position:56%
And then there's geopolitical peace.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.700
Peace has broken out, we say
in such and such a region.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.830
So in all of these meanings of
peace and these various places

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.640
that it occurs, it's
not an absolute.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.350
Unlike with pregnancy,
you can have a little bit

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.730
of peace and it's not a spectrum.

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.460
The perspective with which I
am going to approach the text

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:05.200 position:56%
of the Muslim scripture, the Qur'an,
is that of apocalyptic literature.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.900
And apocalyptic literature has a
special meaning in scholarship.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:14.590
We now use the word apocalypse to
mean like the end of the world.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:17.390
An event is apocalyptic.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.330
But the Greek actually
just means revelation.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.970
And so apocalyptic literature
is not primarily about the end

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.260
of the world, although it often
does advert to that subject.

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.020
But it's about a revelation.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.240
It's about a special insight
being given to a seer.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.910
Typically this kind of literature
depicts the seer as ascending

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.860
into heaven or going
on a spiritual journey.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.390
And there's usually
an angel involved.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:55.080
And angels, you know, develop
relatively late in the Bible.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.720
But by the 600's, there everywhere.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:03.810
And the angel will reveal
the secret to the seer

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.360
or will interpret the secret
that has been revealed.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:13.350 position:56%
Often but not always, apocalyptic
literature has a political dimension

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:14.890
as well as a spiritual one.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:19.710
And so the prophet or the
seer will make a prophecy

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:23.020
which has a political implication.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:27.270 position:56%
And it may or may not involve
belief in an imminent judgement day.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:32.730
As I said, that's one of the
frequent occurring themes,

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:34.030
but it's not always there.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.970
And when we think about
apocalyptic literature in the west,

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:41.490
the two biblical books
that would immediately come

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.220
to mind are the book
of Daniel and the book

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.360
of Revelation in the New Testament.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:52.230
It often involves the prediction
of a coming great peace.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.840
Apocalyptic literature
often sees this world,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:01.290
the time that we're living in, as
a maelstrom, but with a promise

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.600
of a very different kind
of world over the horizon.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.090
And so I am going to argue
that the Qur'an shares in some

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:15.510
of the characteristics of
apocalyptic literature of this era.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:21.850
The Qur'an began coming to
the prophet Muhammad in Arabia

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:29.640
in the midst of what I call
the 7th century world war.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:38.190
There was an enormous conflict
that broke out roughly 603-604

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:46.790
of the Common Era between
the Persian or Iranian Empire

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:52.020
and the Byzantine Empire,
the late Roman Empire

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:56.260
which had taken Constantinople
as its capital.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:02.860
And in the course of which
Iran took over Syria,

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.480
much to the dismay
of Constantinople.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:13.120
For those of you who
follow today's politics,

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.790
there is nothing new under the sun.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.760
Istanbul is now unhappy about
Iran's presence in Syria.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:27.220
So Istanbul is what we
now call Constantinople.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:31.440
But this was a very
dramatic set of events

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.410
because the Roman Empire had come

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.620
into the near east in
the age of Hadrian.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:45.430
106, they took Syria and Jordan.

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:50.740
And had had this region
pretty steadily.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:55.400
There were occasional invasions and
so forth, but it had this region

00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:03.370
and administered pretty steadily
since then, from 106-614 or so.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.630
And to have Iran come in and
just take over the whole thing --

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.730
and they took Egypt
as well, by the way.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.220
I mean, this is unprecedented
since the time of the Achaemenids,

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.900
since the time of Cyrus the Great.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.970
I mean, so it's a huge thing.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:22.950
And that's the context for
the emergence of the Qur'an.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:28.340
Historians have increasingly
in recent decades --

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.670
although this is an idea that goes
back to the late 19th century,

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:37.020
but in recent decades especially
in the American academy,

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.630
historians have become particularly
interested in this period

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:44.640 position:56%
that they're calling late antiquity.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.630 position:56%
You know, in the early 20th century,

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:52.490
if you studied the classical world
you would study, the Republic,

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:57.470
the Roman Republic, and then
Julius Caesar and Augustus.

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:02.240
And then, you know, the conversion
of the empire to Christianity

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.150
under Constantine in the 300's.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:11.270
And then you know, the barbarians
show up, the Huns and so forth,

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:16.100
and Rome falls in the
middle of the 400's.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.900
And after that it's the Dark Ages.

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:21.740
And you know, the really bright,

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.540
aggressive graduate
students would want

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.760
to work on the glorious periods.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.180
So who would want to
you know, specialize --

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.420 position:56%
you have to explain to your parents,

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.050
you're in graduate
school for eight years.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.350
"What are you doing?"

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.260
"Well, I'm studying the Dark Ages."

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.820
So nobody wanted to do that.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:48.380
But in recent decades, Peter Brown
at Princeton and others have argued

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:55.500
that if you took kind of 300 or
400 to 800 or so and looked at is

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:01.860
as a period, that it has
certain virtues for historians

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:05.000
in understanding the
world as it was then.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.760
But in order to make
it not the Dark Ages

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.800
and not unglorious,
you'd have to move east.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.620
You know, admittedly,
Spain, Italy, France,

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:22.310
they were a mess you
know, after 450.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:23.610
Britain too.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:29.420
The economy went down the tubes
and people were much poorer.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:35.410 position:56%
They lost technological knowledge
that they used to have and so forth.

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:47.060
But in what is now Turkey, the
Balkans, Syria, Egypt and Tunisia,

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.970
those areas, as far

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.470
as the archaeologists can
discover, they were doing fine.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:53.770
They were still prosperous.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.070
They had a great economy.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:56.370
They had a lot of technology.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.670
Things were going great.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.990
And they were being ruled
from Constantinople,

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:01.730
from what is now Istanbul.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.190
And so if you shifted
your gaze east,

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:09.580
then there's a not
dark age to study here.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:14.370
And admittedly, it's different
from the early classical period

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:18.390
in the sense that they are
Christians now, for the most part.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:23.970
Although you know, remember that
Christianity, they only became kind

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:27.970
of the official religion
of the empire in the 300's.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:33.540
So by the early 600's surely
there were still lots of pagans.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:37.380
They had to kind of be quiet about
being pagans, but they were there

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:41.960
in very large numbers still.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.240
They had their own conflicts.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:51.890
The Christian authorities from the
late 300's started banning public

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.160
pagan rituals.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.560
So one historian said
that, you know,

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.450
they were still there
but they were quiet.

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:05.950
And then you know, there's a
saying in the ancient world,

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:10.110
in the late antique world that
wherever you found 10 Christians,

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:15.060
there would be 11 theological
opinions amongst them.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.610
And they seemed to
have really minded

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.900
if you had a different opinion.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.810
Like to the point of bloodshed.

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:28.120
So there was a very severe
conflict and riots and persecutions

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:33.330 position:56%
over Christology, over how you would
think about the figure of Christ

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:37.500
and his relationship to the Holy
Spirit and to God the Father

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:42.880
and whether he had one nature or
two natures and so on and so forth.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.180
I won't go into the details.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:47.960
It's very complicated, but
apparently it could get you killed.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:54.830
And then as I mentioned,
the Emperor Khosrau II

00:15:54.830 --> 00:16:02.530
of Iran was expanding his empire
quite dramatically at the expense

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:09.190
of the Byzantine or
eastern Roman Empire.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:12.280
There were serious
conflicts with Jews.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.620
Jews of course by that time
demographically, they had lost out.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.870
The Christians had
become much more numerous.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:21.880
There had been a period
earlier on in the Near East

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.960
where maybe the Jews and the
Christians were both you know,

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:30.990
kind of persecuted minorities
and on an equal footing.

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:34.810
But by this time, the
late 500's, early 600's,

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:39.470 position:56%
the Jews were a persecuted minority
at the hands of the Christian empire

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:44.230
and were very frequently
unhappy and mistreated.

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:50.460
And indeed when the Byzantine
Empire did defeat the Iranians

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:55.560
and kick them back
out of the Near East,

00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:59.550 position:56%
they blamed probably hysterically --

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:02.450
but they blamed Byzantine Jews

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.850
for having collaborated
with the Iranians.

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:08.360
And so it is alleged
by later chroniclers

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:15.550
that the emperor Heraclius
actually forced baptism

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:19.150
on many of the Byzantine Jews.

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.950
These communities were in conflict.

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:28.760
Now I want to take you out of the
mainstream, away from the capitals

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.700
of Constantinople and
the Iranian capital

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:36.210
of Ctesiphon to a little backwater.

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:41.840
And that little backwater
is the western coast

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.920
of Arabia along the Red Sea.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.620
Geographically it is
called the Tahama.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:52.480
But the norther part of
it is called the Hijaz.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:18:00.300
And there in 570 or so we think
Muhammad was born, Muhammad the son

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.970
of Abdullah from the
clan of Banu Hashim.

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:09.750
And what was distinctive about the
city in which he was born, Mecca,

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:16.460
was that it had a shrine, that
black cube-shaped building.

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:23.450
It was called the Kaaba and it
was already a shrine at that time.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:28.350
It was a shrine as far
as I can tell to God.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:34.560
That is to say the
Meccans had many deities.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:39.330
They weren't monotheists, but they
seemed to have thought that most

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.580
of those deities were lesser.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:47.370
And the most important deity
was the creator called God.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:49.230
And the Qur'an talks about this.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:55.580 position:56%
It says if you ask them, the
Meccans, you know, about the divine,

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:58.430
they will say it is God, Allah.

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:01.800
Allah is not a personal name.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.390
It just means God.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:05.750
It's like the Greek theos.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:11.290
They will say Allah is
God and he is the creator.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:15.820
So they may have been
developing towards a kind

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:19.000
of monotheism, those
people in Mecca.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.080
And this by the way is a big debate
in the late antique studies field,

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:29.530
some scholars have provocatively
argued that Platonists

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:35.480
and other pagans in the 500's
were tending towards monotheism

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.120
on their own.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:41.690
So that they were saying
theos or God rather than Zeus,

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:46.790
and they were demoting the pantheon

00:19:46.790 --> 00:19:51.720
of Greek gods to only
a kind of angel.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:57.080
So this kind of thing may
have been going on in Mecca.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:02.940 position:56%
And politically what was distinctive
was that Mecca was no man's land.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:07.950
It wasn't in the Iranian Empire and
it wasn't in the Byzantine Empire,

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:13.330
although I think it was
kind of on the fringes

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:15.020
of the Byzantine Empire more.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:19.280
And it had occasionally been
part of the Roman Empire.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:24.090
In fact Mark Antony
gave it to Cleopatra

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:29.060
as I guess dowry or something.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.750
So Mecca had figured
in western history.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.220
But it was a sanctuary.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:42.040
The Arab tribes you know were
fractious and they were fighting.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:47.420
And yet you know, you have tribes,
typically pastoral nomads in places

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:52.300 position:56%
where there's a lot of marginal land
that you can't farm very easily.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.990 position:56%
But if you raise sheep and goats and
camels, you can just go around to

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:59.410
where the grass pops
up and feed them.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:05.360
But marginal land isn't
very productive,

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.370
and so they have to do trade.

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:08.820
And there are things
you can't produce

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.800
in marginal land, like grain.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:16.060
So you know, it's not good
for you not to eat wheat

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.810
and barley and those things.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:25.350
Just to have a Bedouin diet
of milk and kebab, you know,

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.840
it's great, but you need the grain.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.140
So they have to trade.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:33.690
Mecca had to trade in
order to have foodstuffs,

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.720
but the tribe are always
fighting with each other.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.020
There are feuds.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.180
The Hatfield's and the
McCoy's kind of thing.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:45.110
And however, they made certain
places like Mecca a sanctuary.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:47.770
You're not allowed to
fight inside Mecca.

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:51.350
That would get you
thrown out of the town.

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:52.650
And the reason they gave

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:56.090
for it being a sanctuary
is it's a holy city.

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:57.470
Because the Kaaba is there.

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:59.660
That's the shrine of God.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.710
And there probably
already was a sense

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:06.850
that the Kaaba had
been built by Abraham.

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:11.400
That was the Arab story about it.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:17.810
And they also, being the
custodians of the Kaaba,

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:21.870
the Meccans were kind of holy.

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:23.880
So they were holy merchants.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.720
And sometimes they would go trading

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:31.430 position:56%
to other shrine cities wearing a
toga-like outfit that's called ahram

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:32.730
in Arabic.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:36.180
So they were merchant-priests.

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.740
And so the young Muhammad
growing up in this type

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:45.060
of situation would have seen
that religion could function

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.440
to create areas of peace

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.610
where otherwise there
would be feuding and war.

00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:56.540
And that it could make commerce
possible under some conditions.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:23:00.180
Because the coriaceous custodians
of the Kaaba were respected

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:04.160
by the other tribes and so
their caravans were less likely

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.360
to be attacked.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.600
Peace, worship, prosperity,
they were all wrought

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.740
up with one another for a Meccan.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:19.660
There was, according to the early
sources, a movement of people

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:27.410
in Mecca and the Hijaz in this
period of spiritual restlessness.

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:30.380
And people were searching
for the one God.

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:34.300
Some of them ultimately
became Christians.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:38.760 position:56%
Some of them converted to Judaism,
and by the way, most Gemini's seemed

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.650
to have converted to Judaism.

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:47.940
And others were what these late
antique scholars are calling

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:49.510
pagan monotheists.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.410
They were Platonists.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:58.280
Or there was an entire cult of
a god called Theos Hypsistos,

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.380
the High God, Exalted God.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.620
And that was an independent cult.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:08.940
They thought there's just one,
although there might be other gods.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:15.290
They were just lesser beings or
angels or demons or something.

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:21.330
And so that kind of search for
some sort of monotheism seems

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:23.080
to have been common in this period.

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.470
And Muhammad had been --
Abdullah who was a great merchant

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.360
of Mecca had been engaged
in it as well.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:36.550
And so according to his third
wife and youngest wife Iesha,

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:42.150
she related it is said that then he
began liking solitude and he used

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:44.730
to go off alone to
the cave of Hirat.

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:48.340
He would perform devotions which
are a form of nocturnal worship

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:51.530
for many days before
returning to his family.

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:55.590
He would stock up on provisions,
then later return to Hadija.

00:24:55.590 --> 00:25:00.350
That was his wife at the time, and
stock up again in the same way.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:04.280
So Muhammad would routinely spend
a month of every year in this way

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:09.420
in between caravan journeys
up to Syria or down to Yemen.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:11.840
And during that time he
would distribute food

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.260
to the poor and meditate.

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:19.540
And one night an angel visited,

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:23.580
according to the early
Islamic sources.

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:28.240
And there's a chapter of the
Qur'an, Qur'an 97, which comments

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:33.890
on that night when the
revelation first came.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:38.150
You know, traditions say
that Muhammad said it was

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:39.860
like a bell rang in his mind

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.620
and when it stopped
ringing then he heard voices

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.390
and he remembered what
the voices had said.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:50.650
They were verses of the
Qur'an, verses of scripture.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:56.320
But in commenting on this
experience, the Qur'an 97 says

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.480
"In the name of God the
Merciful, the Compassionate,

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.510
behold we revealed it
on the Night of Power."

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:06.200
It being verses of the Qur'an.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:11.010
And it says, "What will make you
understand the Night of Power?

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.600
The Night of Power is
better than 1,000 months.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.390
The angels and the Spirit
descend then with the permission

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:18.840
of their Lord in every affair.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:24.290
And peace it is, until
the breaking of the dawn."

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:27.100
Well remember I said in apocalyptic
literature there's always

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:28.900
angels involved.

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.400
And there's also a revelation
of the meaning of something.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.310
So it says, "What will make you
understand the Night of Power?"

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:37.340
And then it mentions the angels.

00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:40.220
This is an apocalyptic overtone.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:47.460
And then the final verse is --
in my view it's a little bit,

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:52.550
this surah reminds me a little bit
of a haiku, the Japanese poetry.

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:57.110 position:56%
Because in the last verse of the
haiku you're supposed to take things

00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:01.280
in an unexpected direction, but
which builds on what came before.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:05.600
And I think this chapter of the
Qur'an does this "And peace it is,

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.970
until the breaking of the dawn."

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:10.510
Well what's peace?

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:13.010
Peace in the original is feminine.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:19.700
And the only feminine reference
in the verse is night, lihla.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.910 position:56%
So the night of revelation is peace.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:27.770
And the night of revelation
is of course standing

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:30.620
for the revelation itself.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.160
So the revelation is peace.

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.820
And you could interpret this
verse in a Quotidian way,

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:43.520
because Muhammad was staying
up late at night and praying.

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.950
So there was the peace of worship,

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:46.910
the inner peace of
communing with God.

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:49.630
The peace of the revelation coming.

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:53.770
But it could also be
that this is a metaphor

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:55.920
for the coming judgement day.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.780
Peace it is until the breaking
of the dawn could be peace it is

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.560
until the judgement
day, the resurrection.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:07.620
But in any case, I think this verse
is indicating that the revelation,

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:14.760
the Tanzeel that's mentioned
in the chapter is peace.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:19.620
And then as I've said,
the Qur'an expects there

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.890
to be a judgement day,
a resurrection day.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:28.990
And the people will be raised from
the graves and they will be judged.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:36.640
And the wicked will be sent to hell
and that's really a horror story.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.290
I won't go into it this afternoon.

00:28:38.290 --> 00:28:40.080
We may not have the stomach for it.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:46.710
But the good will go to
heaven, will go to the garden.

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:51.450
And when they get there, the Qur'an
says they are admitted to paradise

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:57.000 position:56%
with a greeting, presumably the
angels are saying, "Enter in peace."

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.040
This is the day of eternity.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.800
So the first thing that
happens when you go

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.760
to heaven is peace
is wished upon you.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:10.800
And then the Qur'anic heaven has
been pointed out by many critics

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:15.060
as really a great place,
and you know,

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:21.780
I don't know if I could get
in, but if I had my choice,

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.840
this would be the one
I'd want to go to.

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:31.730
So it says at one point that
the foremost spiritual people

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:33.030
of the past.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:34.330
And it says, by the way,

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:37.300
they're mostly ancients
and only a few moderns.

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:41.590
What that means is they're mostly
Jews and Christians, right?

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.900
And only a few Muslims.

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:48.330
So it's a multicultural
heaven that's being envisaged.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:52.730
And it says that they're
sitting on ornamented thrones

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:55.770
and then reclining
on them face to face,

00:29:55.770 --> 00:30:00.180
and immortal youths are constantly
serving them cups and goblets

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.060
and chalices filled to overflowing.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:08.450
But it will not give them a
hangover or make them drunk.

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:11.760
And there will be fruit
platters from which to choose,

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:16.750 position:56%
and whatever fowl they have appetite
for, and wide-eyed heavenly maidens

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:20.640
like hidden pearls as a
reward for their good deeds.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:25.130
Therein they will hear no abusive
speech nor any talk of sin.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:28.210
Only the saying, "Peace."

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:37.860 position:56%
Peace. So of all of the delectations
of heaven as presented here,

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:41.290
the ultimate one is peace.

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:47.690
In another, chapter 36, it says
only a single cry will ring out.

00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:52.950 position:56%
That's the angel Gabriel blowing
the trumpet on the resurrection day.

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:55.800
"Then behold, they shall
all be gathered before me."

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:57.260
God is speaking.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:01.030
"On that day no soul will
be in any way wronged,

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:05.560
and you will only receive the
just desserts of your deeds.

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:09.630
The dwellers in the garden on that
day will delight in their affairs.

00:31:09.630 --> 00:31:13.030
They and their spouses will
repose on couches in the shade.

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:16.560
They will have fruit and
whatever they call for.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:21.770
Peace. The word will reach them
from a compassionate Lord."

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:25.760
So I would argue this chapter

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:28.880
of the Qur'an envisages
heaven as having levels.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.490
It's kind of like Dante's Pardiso.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:37.940
And that you have bliss, repose,
enjoyment of heavenly fruit,

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:43.240
and then the highest level is
when God says to you, peace.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:47.130
"The word will reach them
from a compassionate Lord."

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:51.060
Scholars have noted that
in this one it talks

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:53.800
about the spouses being
together in heaven.

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:58.610
So those guys you know who
are hoping for the virgins,

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:03.320
they should be reminded
that the wife will be along.

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:16.550
And so let me just make a
suggestion here that these images

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:22.650
of heaven are not unconnected
to earth.

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:27.860
That the Qur'an is modelling
human society for us.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:32.530
And this vision of peace
after the resurrection,

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:36.570
the heavenly community is
a model for earthly life.

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:40.540
So paradise is imagined not
as a solitary experience,

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.500
because people are
talking to each other.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:46.050
The inmates of heaven are
wishing peace upon one another,

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:48.060
and the angels are
wishing peace upon them.

00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:51.360
And God is wishing peace upon them.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:56.990
And they are surrounded by
delectations as a result

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:59.250
of this harmony and peace.

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:02.430
But it seems to me that if
the Qur'an is depicting peace

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:07.620
as so desirable, that it's the
ultimate reward of heaven bestowed

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:13.460
by the very voice of God, it views
peace as an ideal in this world

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:20.660 position:56%
as well and that hell is therefore a
punishment for the unpeaceful life.

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:26.050 position:56%
Beyond that, the gathering,
chapter 59 of the Qur'an has a verse

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:29.410
that says, "He is God, other
than whom there is no God.

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:33.060
The king, the holy, the peace, the
defender, the guardian, the mighty,

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:36.810
the omnipotent, the supreme."

00:33:36.810 --> 00:33:39.730
The peace.

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:42.120
Peace is a name of God.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:47.120 position:56%
The names of God in the Qur'an and
in Muslim tradition are the virtues,

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:49.380
the attributes of the divine.

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.700
So God is peace.

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:56.500
Of course this is something that
occurs in the Bible as well.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.950
Job says, "The dominion
and fear are with God.

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:02.120
He makes peace in his high heaven."

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:08.740
And in Hebrews 13:20 it
speaks of the God of peace.

00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:16.660
So as God is peace, so too is the
fruit, the highest fruit of heaven.

00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:21.630
Fred Donner at the University of
Chicago has argued in a recent book

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:27.900
that the early community around
Muhammad as far as we can tell

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:32.600
from the Qur'an, was not
sectarian in character.

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:36.270
But the people who gathered
around Muhammad and listened

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:39.140
to his preaching and supported him,

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:42.600
some of them were Christians,
some of them were Jews.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:46.760 position:56%
Some of them were pagan monotheists,
and some of them, you know,

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:52.420
were adherents or partisans of him,
what we would now call Muslims.

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:57.430
But the word that's used in the
Qur'an for them is believers.

00:34:57.430 --> 00:35:03.320
Those are the ones who
followed Muhammad's teachings.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:11.520
The word Muslim does
occur, but it's less exalted

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:13.890
as a station than being a believer.

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:15.680
The Muslims acquiesce.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:16.980
They submit.

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:20.950 position:56%
But the believers, you know, commit.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:29.480
And so there's a later verse of the
Qur'an, the Qur'an 262, which says,

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:34.090
"Surely the believers and the Jews
and the Christians and the Sabians,

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:37.860
whoever believes in God in the
last day and works righteousness,

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:39.930
their reward awaits
them with their Lord.

00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:41.520
And no fear shall be on them.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.640
Neither shall they sorrow."

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:49.800
The Qur'an is promising
salvation to all the monotheists,

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:55.870
to the people who believe in the
one God and who do good works.

00:35:55.870 --> 00:36:01.120
The Qur'an is more
Jamesian than it is Pauline.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.240
It thinks that both faith
and works are necessary.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:09.620
And this is -- I can't tell you
how remarkable this verse is,

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:12.620
because that's not how the
late antique world worked.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:18.130
If you went a little bit north from
Mecca up into the Byzantine Empire

00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:21.330
and you were with the patriarch
of Jerusalem or the patriarch

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:26.210
of Antioch or the patriarch of
Alexandria and you asked them,

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:28.270
you know, "Who's going to heaven?"

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:29.940
It wouldn't include this group.

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:34.740
It would only be the Christians
and maybe only a few of them.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.360
You know, not the heretics
among the Christians.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:43.180
So this is very unusual
that the Qur'an talks

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.630
about this kind of
universal salvation.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:49.510
Of course it does exclude
the polytheists.

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:52.540
I would argue, you
know, this word Sabian,

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:56.080
now the Muslims have
forgotten what it meant.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:59.840
Personally, you know, I blame them,
because wouldn't that be important.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:03.550
Like if your scripture said,
"This group is going to heaven,

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:07.600
they're saved," wouldn't you
want to remember who they were?

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:09.730
I mean, that would be important.

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:14.540
But no, the later Muslim tradition
seems confused about this issue.

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:19.330
I think that they were
the pagan monotheists.

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:24.420
And I won't go into
the linguistic details.

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:28.490
But you know, there was no word for
monotheism at that time in Greek.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:35.620
The believers, the people who had
good faith, were called ab sabia.

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:43.730
And the verb to be God-fearing
or to worship was sabo.

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:48.800
And I think it came into
Arabic as a lone word, sabia.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:55.680
And so the people who were
God-fearing were the Sabians.

00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:02.000
And that word occurs in the New
Testament like when Paul talks

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.260
about the good gentiles, the
pagans who worshiped in synagogue

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.380
with the Jews and were God-fearing.

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.180
That's the word that's used.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.640
So I think there's a reason
to think the Sabians were the

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:14.940
pagan monotheists.

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:18.680
But in any case, all of them
are going to heaven apparently.

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:22.030
And so heaven is multicultural.

00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:26.860
You know, aside from our conflict,

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:29.900
it's very much like
the United States.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:35.740
The Christians, Jews, Muslims,
they're eating well, delectations.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.190
They're not always good,

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:42.730
but the Qur'anic heaven
is not just for Muslims.

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:45.660
But there are also
the hostile pagans.

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.960
There were people in Mecca

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.130
who minded Muhammad's
message for various reasons.

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:53.570
One of them was that he
denounced some of their deities.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:58.790
Apparently the Qur'an is all
right with them having deities,

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:01.800
as long as they would agree
that they're just angels.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:06.910
There can't be any independent
sovereign power except the one God.

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:09.390
But they didn't always
agree to say that.

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:12.530
And then the Qur'an
also, it didn't think

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:14.450
that you could have female angels.

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:17.570
So some of the goddesses were
objectionable to the Qur'an.

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:23.110 position:56%
And it has this verse in Qur'an 53,
"Then have you see Allah and Allozah

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:25.120
and Monat the Third, the other one.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.070
Do you have then boys
and God only girls?"

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.590
That would be an entirely
unfair division.

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:33.770
"They are only names you have
given them, you and your ancestors.

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:36.310
God has revealed no
sovereignty thereby.

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:37.980
They only follow their assumptions

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.450
and the seductions of
their carnal souls.

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:43.330
But guidance has come to
them form their Lord."

00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:45.970
So the goddesses were being
denounced by the Qur'an

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:49.850
and the Meccans seemed to have
really liked the goddesses.

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:55.010
The Meccans, the north Arabian
tradition didn't typically

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:56.310
have idols.

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:59.870
They were aniconic, or
they didn't have images.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:01.600
They liked abstract art.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:09.520
So that first image there on the
top is a batal or Lasab stone

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:13.080
which the goddess is
supposed to be in there.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.380
But it doesn't have features.

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:15.690
And sometimes under the Greek

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:21.090
and Roman influence they would
put features on the batals

00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:23.110
as you can see in the second one.

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:25.510
But those are being
denounced by the Qur'an.

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:31.330 position:56%
And at that time there weren't that
many followers of Muhammad and Mecca

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:36.930
as a city was hostile
to the new prophet.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:41.460
And so there were conflicts.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:45.490
I would argue that the
conflicts weren't very severe,

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:48.030
because Mecca was a sanctuary.

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:50.150
No fighting in Mecca.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:52.950
So they couldn't kill each other.

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:56.040
But the pagans in Mecca, according

00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:01.410
to the Qur'anic sources
were just unpleasant.

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:03.490
Like really unpleasant.

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:06.570
They would boycott people,
refuse to marry their daughters.

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:12.650
In fact, Muhammad had two daughters
that were married to a pagan

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:19.660
and his father made them get
divorced, sent the girls back.

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:24.170
And then they would
socially boycott them.

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:27.690 position:56%
And you know, since it was a trading
city, I think it's implied also

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:33.020
that there were economic
deficits to being boycotted.

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.410
And then you know, there are
stories that Muhammad was sitting

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:43.060
in the market one day and one of
the pagans, actually his uncle,

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:47.760 position:56%
came and threw sheep innards on him.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.760
And according to the
Muslim traditions, you know,

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:54.390
he just wiped them off and went on.

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:59.440
So a lot of the traditions, it's
interesting to me, depict Muhammad

00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:05.040
and the early Muslims
as extremely nonviolent

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.450
in the way they replied
to this harassment.

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:13.500
And I find that this supported
by the verses of the Qur'an.

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:19.500
So during this time of
persecution in the 610's in Mecca,

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:23.200
the Qur'an says, "And if
they impugn your voracity,

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:27.420
say "to me my works
and to you your works.

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:30.520
You are not responsible for what
I do and I am not responsible

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:35.490
for what you do."" In other
words, live and let live.

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:41.830
The criteria in Qur'an 25 says,
"So do not obey the hostile pagans.

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:45.610
Rather struggle thereby
steadfastly against them."

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:48.820
So they're not supposed
to put their heads down.

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:50.500
They're not supposed to give in.

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:54.670
But they have this live and
let live kind of attitude.

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:59.930
By the way, this is one of
the first parts of the Qur'an

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:01.580
where the word Jihad appears.

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:07.380
The word struggle here is jihad.

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:12.690
This is [foreign words], struggle
steadfastly with it against them.

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:18.020
And the Muslim commentators are
very frank that with it means

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:22.000
with the Qur'an, with
peaceful discourse.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.230
So jihad went on to
have other meanings.

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:35.150
But the Qur'anic meaning of it
here is disputation in a nice way

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:38.590
with people who don't agree.

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:45.800
Then the Qur'an in 28:50-57
contrasts the hostile pagans

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.690
with those Christians and
Jews who had recognized

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:53.980
that Muhammad was receiving
revelation from God.

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:56.720
The Qur'an doesn't insist
that people believe,

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.870
you know, become Muslims.

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:02.160
But it insists that they not
say that Muhammad is a liar,

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:05.050
that he is deliberately
falsifying things.

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:09.980
So those Christians and Jews who
said, "He seems to be a prophet.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:13.140
He's getting revelations from
God," whether they joined

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.220
or not, they're being praised.

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:18.370
And because they were
associated with Muslims,

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:20.580
apparently the pagans
were bothering them too.

00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:24.000
So the Qur'an says, "These
shall be given their wage twice

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.110 position:56%
over because they patiently endured.

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:29.980
And they avert evil
with good and expend

00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:31.770
of what we have provided them."

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:35.600
So they're generous, they do
philanthropy, and they're patient.

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:41.910
They endure taunting and harassment
with the Muslims from the pagans.

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:45.580
And they avert evil with good.

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:49.200
Does this remind you of anything?

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:53.450
I mean it's very much
like Jesus's principle

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:55.500
of turning the other cheek.

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:59.240
The Qur'an is praising them
for behavior in this way.

00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:03.380
The believers face down evil
by performing good deeds rather

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:06.690
than by committing violence
or returning evil for evil.

00:45:06.690 --> 00:45:11.400
And then in 28:55 it's talking
then about the believers,

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.850
about the people around
Muhammad himself.

00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:17.010
"When they hear abusive talk,
they turn away from it and say,

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:19.560
"To us our deeds and to you yours.

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.480
Peace be upon you."

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:24.110
We do not seek out the unruly."

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:27.650
And again, peace be
upon you is a prayer.

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:30.540
It's calling on God
to give them peace.

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:34.970
This is to the people who are
taunting them and insulting them

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:38.270
and you know, it said that people
would throw thorns in their path.

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:39.900
So you know, if you
were walking barefoot,

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:43.070
suddenly your foot
would be bleeding.

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:48.220
Then Qur'an 25:63 it says, "And
the servants of the all merciful

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:50.040
who walk humbly upon the earth,

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:53.820
and when the ignorant taunt
them, they reply peace."

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:58.880
So in this period when the Muslims
are first starting out and they're

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:02.210
in the city of Mecca,
there is this --

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:05.620
you would have to say a very
Christian-like attitude towards

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:08.660
their persecutors.

00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:14.630
Now later on, from 622, Muhammad
and the Muslims had to relocate.

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:18.920 position:56%
They came under so much pressure
and the Qur'an complains about this,

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:22.740
that the Meccans were
trying to expel them.

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:28.550
That they had to go to a
nearby city, to Medina.

00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:34.750
And once they went there, war
broke out between them and Meccans.

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:38.930
My own interpretation of this is
that actually the Meccans wanted

00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:40.990
to get Muhammad and the
Muslims out of Mecca

00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:43.370
because they couldn't
attack them there.

00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:45.420
It was a sanctuary city.

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:48.660
So there was nothing they could
do to them as long as they were

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.570
in the city, except you
know, put social pressure

00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:53.350
on them, or economic pressure.

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:56.500
But if they could get them out,
then they could attack them.

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.690
And I think they wanted to.

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:07.290
And so once the Muslims went
to Medina, war breaks out.

00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:13.600
The Qur'an you know,
talks about fighting,

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:15.990
and the Muslims were
willing to fight

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:19.450
in what the Arabs considered
sacred months.

00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:23.170
And when criticized for
fighting in the sacred month --

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:28.320
you're not supposed to fight --
the Qur'an says, "Yes, that's bad,

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:34.690
but it's not as bad as expelling
people from the sanctuary city."

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:37.650
And you know, there are some
crimes that are ancillary.

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:43.640
Like in the old west a horse
thief, if caught, would be hanged.

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:47.590
Why? Because if you
stole a man's horse,

00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:48.970
you very likely were killing him.

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.960
I mean in the old west,
a man without a horse

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:54.930
out in the desert, that was death.

00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:58.270
So people frowned on horse thieves.

00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:03.720
In the same way, if you kicked
somebody out of a sanctuary city,

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:06.250
you were exposing them to attack.

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:11.260
And that's what the pagans
had done to the Muslims.

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:14.670
But even in the midst of
the conflict that emerged,

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:19.530
and there were three big
battles and some other raids,

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:26.480
the Qur'an has what I would argue
is a kind of theology of just war.

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:31.340
Similar to what exists in
Christianity, is often attributed

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:33.310
to St. Augustine of Hippo.

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:35.060
But our scholars have argued

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:39.390
that in Augustine it's not a
doctrine so much as some remark.

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:43.640
But later on, you know,
Aquinas and others worked on it.

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.700
But I think it's similar.

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:53.020
So the Qur'an in the second
chapter, 190 verse says,

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:56.420
"And combat in the way of God
against those who initiate combat

00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:59.050
with you, but do not
commit aggression.

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:01.220
God does not love aggressors.

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:06.190
And slay those hostile combatants
wherever you overtake them."

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:09.760
This verse is often
taken out of context.

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:15.200 position:56%
And if you go out on the internet or
you listen to people who have an ax

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:18.460
to grind talking about
Islam, they will say,

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:23.160
"Well see the Qur'an says slay
them wherever you overtake them.

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:28.160
It's commanding Muslims just to
go out and randomly kill people."

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.300
Not what's going on in the verse.

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:35.560
The referent of those is the
ones who attack the Muslims.

00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:38.770
So it's an argument
for self-defense.

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:44.700
And moreover, because it says
fight the ones that fight you,

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:48.560
it implicitly, and Muslim
scholars have noted this,

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:51.510
you are not to fight noncombatants.

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:57.580
So women, children, noncombatant
men are not to be attacked.

00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:00.850
And St. Augustine said, "When
you are arming for battle,

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:04.770
the will should be concerned for
peace and necessity with war.

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:07.050
War is waged in order
to attain peace."

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:09.380
It's very much what
the Qur'an is saying.

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:14.130 position:56%
Because in 861 it says that, "If the
enemy sues for peace on just terms,

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:16.150
the overture should be accepted.

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:19.900
And if they incline to peace,
then you should incline to it.

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.220
And put your trust in God.

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:23.340
He is the all-hearing,
the all-knowing."

00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:25.920
So if the enemy is fighting you
and they come to you and say, "No,

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:29.060
we've decided to call
it off," according

00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:33.440
to the Qur'an you have
to call it off.

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:37.670
And it is worth noting
that in history actually,

00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:41.210
according to Muslim tradition,
the conflict between Medina

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:45.340
and Mecca was resolved
with a treaty ultimately.

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:52.060
Mecca was not actually
militarily conquered in the end.

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:57.010
I think there's probably
an apocalyptic context

00:50:57.010 --> 00:50:59.470
for these Qur'anic
ideas about peace.

00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:06.220
In 614 Jerusalem fell
to the Iranians.

00:51:06.220 --> 00:51:11.630
General Shahrbaraz of
Iran took Jerusalem.

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:16.540 position:56%
And this just -- I mean colloquially
speaking I could say it freaked

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:18.980
people out.

00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:24.370
Because Jerusalem since the
time of Constantine, you know,

00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:28.770
had been in the hands of
the Christian Roman Empire.

00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:30.070
And now it was not.

00:51:30.070 --> 00:51:38.300
And the monks and clerics who
wrote about the Iranian occupation

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.410
of Jerusalem appear

00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:44.550
to have exaggerated
substantially the horrors of it.

00:51:44.550 --> 00:51:47.690
Because the Israeli archaeologists
have been digging quite a lot

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:50.700
in Jerusalem and they
got down to that level.

00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:54.370
And according to the Byzantine
sources, the Iranians burned

00:51:54.370 --> 00:51:57.390
down all the churches and
they killed 90,000 people.

00:51:57.390 --> 00:52:03.260
And you know, there should be bones
down there or ashes and things

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:07.120
like that if the city had been
subjected to that kind of ravaging.

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:10.250
But they don't find that.

00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:12.780
It goes along that
layer is prosperous,

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:15.110
the next layer is prosperous,
seems to go on.

00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:16.410
No sign of the churches.

00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:18.350
The Church of the Holy
Sepulcher doesn't seem

00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:19.650
to have been burned down.

00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:26.030
So the literary sources from the
Byzantine side are just incorrect.

00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:32.340
But it was a big shock for
the Christian Roman Empire

00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:36.780
to lose Jerusalem to the
Iranians who were not Christians.

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:41.620
They belonged to the Zoroastrian
religion, didn't recognize Christ.

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:48.840
And they did carry off the relic
of the True Cross which was

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.440
in the Church of the Holy
Sepulcher in Jerusalem,

00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:56.290
to Ctesiphon in what
is now Amadiya in Iraq.

00:52:56.290 --> 00:53:00.310
And so it was a really kind of --

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:03.790
Khosrau II of Iran
was really sticking it

00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:06.860
to the emperor of Byzantium,
Heraclius.

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:08.750
He was saying, "Take that."

00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:14.060
Now what's interesting is the
Qur'an talks about all this.

00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:17.760
And it says in chapter 30,

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:21.660
"Byzantium lies vanquished
in the nearest province.

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:26.940 position:56%
But in the wake of their defeat,
they will triumph after a few years.

00:53:26.940 --> 00:53:29.760
Before and after, it is
God who is in command.

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:33.460
On that day, the believers will
rejoice in the victory of God.

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:38.160 position:56%
He causes to triumph whoever he will
and he is the mighty, the merciful.

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.880
It is the promise of God.

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:43.900
God does not break his promises,
but most people do not know it."

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:49.630
Now this verse in my view has
been completely misinterpreted

00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:53.350
by the later Muslim commentators.

00:53:53.350 --> 00:54:00.040
Because they don't take
it seriously enough.

00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:03.160
This verse is saying
that the victory

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:14.310
of the Roman Caesar Heraclius
over Iran is God's victory.

00:54:14.310 --> 00:54:19.490
And it says that the believers,
the people around Muhammad,

00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:23.610
will rejoice at that victory.

00:54:24.730 --> 00:54:29.550
Well, two decades later the
Muslim Arabs defeated Byzantium

00:54:29.550 --> 00:54:31.200
and took over Assyria.

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:34.610
So from the point of view
of two decades later,

00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:37.590
this verse is a little
bit of an embarrassment.

00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:40.260
Because it's making
Heraclius a big hero.

00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:42.490
It's saying that God was with him.

00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:46.920
And then by the 630's the
Muslims are fighting Heraclius.

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:51.230
They are saying that Heraclius had
a nervous breakdown about that.

00:54:51.230 --> 00:55:00.270
But I think that in the context
of the 610's, this is a statement

00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:02.470
that the Muslim God is universal.

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:08.180
And you know, this is not
unprecedented, because in Isaiah,

00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:13.820
Cyrus the Great Iranian Achaemenid
king is called the anointed one

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:15.960
of Israel.

00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:21.310
So just as Yahweh is
a universal God,

00:55:21.310 --> 00:55:23.290
so the God of the Qur'an
is universal

00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:29.300
and can acknowledge the Roman
Emperor as his instrument.

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:32.760 position:56%
But that the believers would rejoice

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:35.390
in his victory suggests
to me something more.

00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:40.000
I think at that point
the political theology

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.870
of the Qur'an envisaged
the Muslim Arabs as joining

00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:50.980
in some way the Byzantine
commonwealth.

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:54.520
You know, maybe as citizens.

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:58.620
Because Byzantium did
have claims on the Hijaz.

00:55:58.620 --> 00:56:02.880
Or maybe in the same way
that the Ethiopians did

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:06.470
when the Ethiopians were
generally allied with the Romans.

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:09.020
But it seems very clear to me
the Qur'an is making a stand

00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:15.170
against Iran and the
Zoroastrian empire.

00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:19.630 position:56%
And is being partisan for Byzantium.

00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:22.170
Now the later Muslim
commentators will say things like,

00:56:22.170 --> 00:56:25.330
"Well this is a prediction that the
Muslims will have a great victory

00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:28.410
in the same year that
Heraclius does."

00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:30.480
But that's not what the verse says.

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:36.080
There isn't any reason
to interpret it that way.

00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:42.910
Then in a similar period of time
there is a verse that maintains

00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:48.660
that Muhammad had a vision in which
he travelled by night to Jerusalem.

00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:52.000
And in the context of this
other verse it seems to me

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.620
that in the context of
the apocalyptic literature

00:56:55.620 --> 00:57:00.090 position:56%
about Jerusalem, because it's a
symbol for the afterlife, for peace,

00:57:00.090 --> 00:57:02.610
if you read the Book of Revelation,

00:57:02.610 --> 00:57:08.360
that Muhammad is re-appropriating
occupied Jerusalem spiritually

00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:14.780
from the Iranian Empire
in that night journey.

00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:20.770
Now there's a Jewish piece of
writing from the same basic period

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:27.630
by a contemporary of the Qur'an,
but writing a little bit later

00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:32.240
after Iran was defeated, which
says that in this apocalyptic piece

00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.590
of writing, the [foreign word],

00:57:33.590 --> 00:57:40.090
that a celestial Jerusalem
will descend from heaven.

00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:44.450 position:56%
Its house, gates and thresholds will
be constructed of precious stones.

00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:48.680
And within its restored temple will
be treasures including the Torah,

00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:53.170
the first five books of the
Hebrew Bible, and peace.

00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:59.190 position:56%
Torah and peace will be in the new
Jerusalem that descends from heaven.

00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:03.830 position:56%
And this author sites Psalms, "Great
peace have those who love your law,

00:58:03.830 --> 00:58:06.700
and nothing can make them stumble."

00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:10.130
I haven't completely put
all this together yet,

00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:13.380
but I think that the
Iranian conquest

00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:20.090
of Jerusalem was a big spiritual
crisis not only for the Byzantines,

00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:23.420
but for Muhammad's believers.

00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:25.510
And you know, there was a point

00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:28.900
at which the believers
prayed toward Jerusalem.

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:35.460
And that there's some kind of
apocalyptic expectation of a defeat

00:58:35.460 --> 00:58:39.750
of the Persians and
then what comes next.

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:43.630
And it might even be a kind
of civil millenarianism

00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:46.630
that the Muslim Arabs would
then be able to exceed

00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:52.050
to the victorious Byzantine
commonwealth.

00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:57.100
So in conclusion, I'm arguing
that revelation, Tanzeel,

00:58:57.100 --> 00:59:00.960
is identified with peace
in the Night of Power.

00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:04.740
That members of all religions
revering the one God,

00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:07.900
according to the Qur'an,
will go to paradise.

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:09.640
That Christians and Jews who accept

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:12.700
that Muhammad was a prophet
are praised for fighting evil

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:15.650
through good and through
wishing peace on enemies.

00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:18.430
That the early Muslims are
also praised for wishing peace

00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:19.730
on those who harassed them.

00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:23.150
That they are commanded
to make peace

00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:26.600
with hostile combatants
wherever the hostiles sue for it.

00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:31.460
That the good of all religions
are greeted on arrival in heaven

00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:36.860 position:56%
with wishes of peace and well-being,
both by angels and one another

00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:40.640
and by God himself, that the
highest level of paradise is

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:43.020
when God wishes you peace.

00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:50.010 position:56%
And that the peace is one of the key
attributes, names of God himself.

00:59:50.010 --> 00:59:54.620
And that those people who can
read the Qur'an and see it only

00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:59.140
as a violent document are missing
out on the parts that I read.

00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:01.510
Thank you very much.

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:10.880
[ Applause ]

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:15.320
Well, anybody who talks at
you for 50 minutes ought

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.380
to take some questions
and let you be satisfied

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:21.200
about your objections,
doubts and so forth.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:24.330
Let's have short -- and there
should be a question in it please.

01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:25.630
Short responses.

01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:28.330
And please wait until the
microphone gets to you

01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:30.630
because this is being recorded.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.380
&gt;&gt; My name is [inaudible].

01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:45.670
I'm Iraqi-American.

01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:51.670
And you just mentioned the
vision of the prophet Muhammad

01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:58.940
of his going to Jerusalem.

01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:04.300
And there I've met
many Muslim scholars

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:13.580
who said this verse might have
bene inserted by the [foreign name]

01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:19.460
in order to legitimize the
Islamic conquer of Jerusalem.

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:25.480
Some Islamic conspiracy theorists
blame it on the Jewish conspiracy

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:30.810
to legitimize the Muslim
presence in Jerusalem.

01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:36.830
First of all I'd like you
to comment on this theory.

01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:43.590
And many theories like this which
for example negate the necessity

01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:49.230
for hijab in Islam or alcohol
is not necessarily prohibited.

01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:54.950
Even in [inaudible] which I grow up
and I was born next to in Baghdad,

01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:58.530
they do not prohibit
alcohol for example.

01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:01.470
But the environmental
feel in the Arab world

01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:06.570 position:56%
and the Muslim world refuses for
any idea, even if it's a crazy idea,

01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:11.750
to be proposed and
negotiated or discussed.

01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:14.330
And I'd like your comment
on this issue too.

01:02:14.330 --> 01:02:15.630
Thank you.

01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:16.930
&gt;&gt; Juan Cole: Thank you very much.

01:02:16.930 --> 01:02:19.970
I know your writing,
and thanks for coming.

01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:22.890
Listen, yeah, this is
an important question.

01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:26.230
Because when we talked
about the text of the Qur'an

01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:30.030
from a western academic point
of view, and even as you said,

01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:33.460
among some traditional Muslim
scholars, this whole question

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:36.610 position:56%
of is the Qur'an that we now have --

01:02:36.610 --> 01:02:39.330
how much of it goes back
to the time of the prophet?

01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:43.250
Is it really from his
lifetime and so forth?

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:47.690
And there's a whole school of
academic scholars in the west

01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:54.180
that come out of typically SOAS
in Britain, which doesn't think

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:57.130
that you can trust
any of these sources.

01:02:57.130 --> 01:03:00.270
That the chronicles
and the biographies

01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:05.770
and so forth we have are you
know the earliest manuscripts

01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:10.760
that we can date, and the dates of
the authors are you know, from 150,

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:14.160
200, 300 years after
the time of the prophet.

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:17.640
So that makes a person
nervous as a historian.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:21.450
Because you know, I can't remember
what I had for dinner last week.

01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:26.110 position:56%
And depending on people for a memory

01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:29.180
of 300 years before
is pretty dangerous.

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:37.260 position:56%
And then there's been arguments
that the Qur'an was produced by more

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:39.390
than one hand and over time.

01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:41.780
And for any of the
more pious Muslims

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:43.260
in the audience, I apologize.

01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:47.650 position:56%
I don't mean to offend you, but this
is what the scholars have proposed.

01:03:47.650 --> 01:03:50.770
I am a conservative on this issue.

01:03:50.770 --> 01:03:55.660
I think the Qur'an came
through the prophet Muhammad.

01:03:55.660 --> 01:04:00.540
And I think that the traditional
dating of it, 610-632 --

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:04.030
you could tinker with it,
but it's just about right.

01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:06.460
And I find contemporary
things being referred to.

01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:10.780 position:56%
Like we know when the Byzantines
were defeated by the Iranians and so

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:17.700
that verse which talks about
it must be from 614, 615.

01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:19.640
It must be from that period.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:26.070
So there is now some evidence
for the integrity of the Qur'an

01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:30.130
and for the traditional dating
coming out of manuscript work.

01:04:30.130 --> 01:04:34.820
But in the 1980's I went to Yemen

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:38.580 position:56%
and they have a manuscript
repository in Yemen which, you know,

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:41.790
for any historian it's
just wonderful.

01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:44.620
But they found these old, old, old,

01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:47.280
Qur'ans in the Great
Mosque in Yemen.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:52.140
And they brought in the Germans
to assemble them and study them.

01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:57.400
And I talk to Ursula Dreibholtz
who is in charge of this project.

01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:00.670 position:56%
And she said, "We're quite convinced
that some of these, you know,

01:05:00.670 --> 01:05:06.820
the papyrus, the script,
they look to us 7th century."

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:12.230
And then one of them turned
out to be a palimpsest.

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:17.980 position:56%
Palimpsest is in the old days, you
know, paper or papyrus and so forth.

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.660
Parchment was expensive.

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:22.190
People would write over things.

01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:30.220
So they found one of these
Qur'ans which was in the 650's,

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:33.200
the Caliph Uthman published
a standard Qur'an

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:36.170
which is all the printed
Qur'ans you have are from that.

01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:41.480
That underneath the standard
Qur'an was an earlier one.

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:43.270
And they radio carbon dated it.

01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:47.090
And you know, you don't get exact
figures from radio carbon dating,

01:05:47.090 --> 01:05:49.830
but you get percentage likelihoods.

01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:54.970
Percentage likelihood
of this one, 645.

01:05:54.970 --> 01:05:58.250 position:56%
And it's not the standard recension.

01:05:58.250 --> 01:06:01.440
The order of the chapters
is slightly different.

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.730
Not a lot of -- you know,
there are variations,

01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:06.100
but not a lot of significant ones.

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.930
But if we now have a
Qur'an 645, the likelihood

01:06:09.930 --> 01:06:17.710
of the text we have being integral
is much higher than it used to be.

01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:21.840
There's also been a find
in Paris at Birmingham

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.000
of 16 pages of the Qur'an.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:31.700
Two of them have been carbon
dated and they came back 570-640.

01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:36.350 position:56%
570 would be a challenge because we
think that's when Muhammad was born.

01:06:36.350 --> 01:06:39.190 position:56%
But in any case, that's a parchment.

01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:42.620
The animal that that
Qur'an was written on lived

01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:44.930
at the same time as
the prophet Muhammad.

01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:46.550
We're quite sure about this.

01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:49.890
Now could somebody have
used an old parchment

01:06:49.890 --> 01:06:51.190
and written out the Qur'an on it?

01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:52.490
Maybe. We don't know.

01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:54.010
These things haven't been settled.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:58.360
But I would just signal that the
extreme skepticism and this sort

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:03.150
of SOAS school that wanted to see
the Qur'an as a tradition that grew

01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:07.670
up over maybe two centuries,
that's increasingly implausible.

01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:14.910
The Qur'an we have is I think
ballpark for the period.

01:07:14.910 --> 01:07:17.180
And so I think we can
approach it this way.

01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:22.320
So I don't know if the surah
Isra is in the palimpsest.

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.620
It's been published.

01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:24.920
I should take a look.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:29.110
But I think probably it really
is a vision of Jerusalem.

01:07:29.110 --> 01:07:30.900
And I'm arguing it makes sense

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:36.050
because I think maybe there
was a dialogue in Mecca

01:07:36.050 --> 01:07:40.030
that the pagan Meccans might
have been siding with Iran.

01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:43.570
And Muhammad was talking up
the Holy Land and the prophets

01:07:43.570 --> 01:07:46.100
of Jerusalem and Jesus and Moses.

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:49.230
And the pagans might well have
been saying to him, "Well,

01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:51.210
your Jerusalem is gone, isn't it?

01:07:51.210 --> 01:07:54.850
It's in the hands of the
fire worshipers now."

01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:57.740
And so I think maybe
having a vision of it

01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:02.940
in which Jerusalem inspires
the prophet is a way

01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:05.870
of spiritually pushing
back against that line.

01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:11.140
You guys decide who
gets the question.

01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:14.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you for your talk.

01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:18.380
I don't know if you're read
Graham Wood in the Atlantic,

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:20.770
which I imagine was
very pedestrian for you.

01:08:20.770 --> 01:08:25.020
But he essentially argues
that groups like ISIS try

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:27.750
to hasten the coming
of the apocalypse

01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:29.890
through I guess war mechanisms.

01:08:29.890 --> 01:08:31.780
And you've argued quite
convincingly today

01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:35.230
that the Qur'an is you
know, a text of peace.

01:08:35.230 --> 01:08:40.840
But I guess the question is, is
war and conflict a prerequisite

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.390
to get to an eventual peace?

01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:43.690
And is that allowed?

01:08:43.690 --> 01:08:44.990
Thank you.

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:46.880
&gt;&gt; Juan Cole: Well in
apocalyptic literature of the time,

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:52.300
it's quite frequently the case
that it is the seer foresees a war

01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:55.030
and conflict before peace can come.

01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:58.460 position:56%
And this is the shape of the Book
of Revelation or the Book of Daniel.

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:02.160
And there are a number of
contemporary works both

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:07.350
by Christians and Jews of the time
of Muhammad which have that shape.

01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:08.980
I don't find it in the Qur'an.

01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:10.930
I don't find this expectation

01:09:10.930 --> 01:09:15.730
of a conflict preceding
the outbreak of peace.

01:09:15.730 --> 01:09:24.510
Because even before the
conquest of Jerusalem,

01:09:24.510 --> 01:09:29.400
as the German scholar Noldek
[spelling assumed] dated the

01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:33.630
chapters at least, the Qur'an
is already laying out the schema

01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:37.290
where there's revelation,
there's a warning.

01:09:37.290 --> 01:09:40.900
There's signs of the
coming of the apocalypse

01:09:40.900 --> 01:09:44.690
and then there's the judgement
day and the resurrection.

01:09:44.690 --> 01:09:48.790
And those chapters don't really
bring up anything about war.

01:09:48.790 --> 01:09:53.210 position:56%
The signs of the resurrection or the
judgement day, the end of the world

01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:57.710
in the Qur'an tend to be natural.

01:09:57.710 --> 01:10:03.630
So that will be a day on which you
know, the mountains are like wool

01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:09.070
that you carted from a sheep and
will just be blown by the wind.

01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:12.320
And the stars will fall
and lose their brightness.

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.860
So the signs in the Qur'an

01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:19.610
for the judgement day aren't
typically the marching of armies.

01:10:19.610 --> 01:10:24.600
And one of the early verses which
does have a social content says

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.690
that will be the day on
which the unborn child,

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:32.410
the unborn girls will
ask why was she killed?

01:10:32.410 --> 01:10:36.390
And you know, in premodern
societies --

01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:39.110 position:56%
or the newborn girls I meant to say.

01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:40.410
In premodern societies,

01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:44.530
female infanticide was
a birth control method.

01:10:44.530 --> 01:10:51.900
And archaeologists in Egypt have
found large numbers of you know,

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:56.070
babies basically who
were killed in this way.

01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:59.610
An anthropologist will
tell you that the fertility

01:10:59.610 --> 01:11:03.940
of a group is determined by
the number of women in it.

01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:09.910
And so if a famine has come,
if it's hard days and so forth,

01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:13.630
people at that time would
often kill their girl children,

01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:14.930
their girl babies.

01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:18.210
And the Qur'an remonstrates
with them.

01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:20.430
It think that this is very evil.

01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:24.270
So the feminist corner of the
Qur'an that's defending the girls.

01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:29.850 position:56%
But it says that on the resurrection
day, you know, the babies will ask,

01:11:29.850 --> 01:11:32.020
"What did we do to deserve this?"

01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:37.300
So that's the major social
intervention that I can think

01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:39.430
of with regard to the
apocalypse in the Qur'an.

01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:47.400 position:56%
So no, with regard to ISIL, a lot of
those guys were ex-Bothe military.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:50.460
I don't know if you've ever hung
around with ex-Bothe military,

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:53.500
but I don't think they
know how to pray.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:59.510
And they like a good stiff
glass of whiskey, am I right?

01:11:59.510 --> 01:12:02.100
[ Inaudible ]

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:05.520
Yeah, Abu Bakr, the leader
of ISIL does have a PhD,

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:07.280
but a lot of those guys with him,

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:10.370
they're just dusted
off Bothe officers.

01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:14.910
So I think they're manipulating
you know Islam for their purposes.

01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:18.960
Yeah, I don't think
it's sincere with them.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:22.610
And some of the rank and
file might be sincere,

01:12:22.610 --> 01:12:24.640
but you know we've had a chance now

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.530
to study ISIL a little
bit academically.

01:12:26.530 --> 01:12:31.250
There have been exit interviews,
because you know, people have left.

01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:34.800
Leaving is chancy because
if they figure

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.610
out you're leaving
they will kill you.

01:12:36.610 --> 01:12:38.610
But some people manage to get out.

01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:42.180
And then anthropologists and
researchers have gone and talked

01:12:42.180 --> 01:12:44.940
to them about what was
it like and so forth.

01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:46.750
And they find these
people who have escaped,

01:12:46.750 --> 01:12:50.710
they often didn't know very much
about Islam in a formal sense.

01:12:50.710 --> 01:12:54.330
So the idea that Graham Wood put
forward in this Atlantic article

01:12:54.330 --> 01:12:58.610 position:56%
that you know, ISIL is very Islamic,
I don't know what he meant by that.

01:12:58.610 --> 01:13:01.020
And in fact, that seems
to me very essentialist.

01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:03.800
Like what would it mean
to be very Islamic?

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:05.810
Are some things more
Islamic than others

01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:07.880
in some kind of essential sense?

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.680
Certainly they think
they're Muslims,

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:13.440
but you know those snake handlers

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:17.100
in the south think that
they're Christians.

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:19.830
Most of us, I wouldn't
want to argue with them

01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:22.560
that they're not Christians,
but we don't typically think

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:27.680
that snake handling is in
fact central to Christianity,

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:30.510
even though this group
maintains that that's so.

01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:34.100
So I think that the ISIL
people are more the equivalent

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.220
of the snake handlers than Islam.

01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:38.430
They have a very peculiar
set of ideas

01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:40.990
of what makes for being
a good Muslim.

01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:45.480
And I don't know how you
reconcile the things that they do

01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:47.030
with the text of the Qur'an.

01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:51.700
You're only supposed
to fight combatants.

01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:53.880
Well, they don't just
fight combatants.

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:57.790
They kidnap ordinary innocent
people and behead them.

01:13:57.790 --> 01:14:00.530
That's not Qur'anic.

01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:07.270
So to the extent that I'm
comfortable with putting my finger

01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:10.160
on some normative elements
of the Qur'an,

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.780 position:56%
they don't seem to accord with them.

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:15.110
So you know, I don't know.

01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:17.600
I studied religion
as an undergraduate,

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.910
and in religious studies we
don't typically say things

01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:24.800
like something is very,
very Buddhist.

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:30.420
That seems not to be a
useful way of thinking.

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:36.820
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately because of
timing we can only take one more.

01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:38.120
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:42.340 position:56%
I'd like to get back to the Mirage,
the vision of the trip to Jerusalem.

01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:46.630
And basically in Qur'an
Jerusalem is not mentioned at all.

01:14:46.630 --> 01:14:52.310
The trip was to El Mastrida
Alexa, the furthest mosque.

01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:57.700
And the Alexa mosque in Jerusalem
wasn't even built until after 700.

01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:02.370
So how and when did that
get connected to Jerusalem?

01:15:02.370 --> 01:15:04.180
&gt;&gt; Juan Cole: Well,
that's a good question,

01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:07.980
as of course the Qur'an is often
illusive and we are interpreting it

01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:10.760
to say what we think it means.

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.990
But here's my argument for it.

01:15:12.990 --> 01:15:14.490
You remember that verse I mentioned

01:15:14.490 --> 01:15:21.470
about Byzantium being defeated
in the nearest province?

01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:26.470
It says El Ardna Altna,
the nearest province.

01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:31.620
Then when it's talking about El
Mastrida Alexa, it's the farthest.

01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:33.820
Nearest, farthest.

01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:42.620
Now let me just show you the map.

01:15:44.690 --> 01:15:51.040
If you look at this map,
Mecca is in the Hijaz.

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:57.910
If you go north into Byzantine
Syria, that's the nearest province.

01:15:57.910 --> 01:16:02.510 position:56%
And they used to go up to Gaza which
was the port on the Mediterranean.

01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:03.810
If you keep going up to Gaza,

01:16:03.810 --> 01:16:06.170
that would be the farthest
province you could get

01:16:06.170 --> 01:16:08.320
to before you got to the sea.

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:15.210
So I think the mastrid, which is
the farthest, is in Jerusalem.

01:16:15.210 --> 01:16:20.230
And the word mastrid,
it doesn't mean mosque.

01:16:20.230 --> 01:16:24.430
We're talking 614 here,
or something.

01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:26.170
There were no mosques.

01:16:26.170 --> 01:16:32.730
And it is a Semitic word which
means something like altar.

01:16:32.730 --> 01:16:39.060
The pagans and those blocks that
I showed you would sacrifice

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:40.360
at the bottom of the block.

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:43.930
There would be a mastrid
or an altar.

01:16:43.930 --> 01:16:47.870
My guess is that what's
being referred

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:57.290
to is the Basilica I Essene,
the Church of Holy Zion.

01:16:57.290 --> 01:17:01.080
Which was the only religious
structure anywhere near the temple

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.990
mount at the time Muhammad
was talking.

01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:07.750
Because of course the temple itself
had been destroyed by the Romans

01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:09.900
and then there were
some synagogues up there

01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:12.140
which were destroyed
by the Christians.

01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:17.860
And so the only religious edifice
anywhere near the temple mount

01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:23.610 position:56%
on the western hill was the Basilica
of Holy Zion which was a place

01:17:23.610 --> 01:17:25.720
of pilgrimage and was
associated with some

01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.120
of the events of Jesus's life.

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:31.530
And I think -- a little
bit speculative on my part,

01:17:31.530 --> 01:17:37.870
but I'm going to put it forward --
that the Qur'an sees a connection

01:17:37.870 --> 01:17:43.260
between the Kaaba in Mecca
and the Basilica in Jerusalem.

01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:47.360
And that this is an
axis and that's why

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:50.970
for a while they prayed
towards Jerusalem.

01:17:50.970 --> 01:17:56.520
And then they switched to
praying towards the Kaaba.

01:17:56.520 --> 01:18:02.770
But both of them are worthy
of being the point of prayer

01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:05.650
and have a spiritual
connection between them.

01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:13.550
And I think the Qur'an refers
to Jerusalem as the Holy Land,

01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:17.150
and it also obviously feels
that Mecca is the Holy Land.

01:18:17.150 --> 01:18:20.820
So I think there's a kind of
sacred geography at work here.

01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:24.000
And that's how I would see it.

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:31.340
&gt;&gt; Janice Hyde: I just
want to remind everyone

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:33.870 position:56%
that this program will be available.

01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:35.300
There's lots of food
for thought here,

01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:37.000
so I think we'll all want
to look at this again.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:38.890
So in a few weeks, make
sure you check back

01:18:38.890 --> 01:18:40.510
on our website to see this program.

01:18:40.510 --> 01:18:42.930 position:56%
But you can visit it in the meantime

01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:45.640
to see other programs
similar to this.

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:48.340
I would like to thank you all
