00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.033
Today, I would like to
talk to you about something

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:07.400
other than relativity.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.967
I wish I could just move
beyond the damn theory.

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:13.266
This is the idea I've been
missing to complete relativity,

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:16.233
acceleration and gravity
are the same thing.

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:18.000
And an astronomer can prove it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.967
I found you an astronomer.

00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:20.600
Name is Freundlich.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.266
I will never feel anything
but love for you, Mileva.

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.500
You had plenty to say
to that chesty brunette.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.667
I have never been
unfaithful to you.

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:31.166
Professor Haber, have I
ever mentioned that my cousin

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.867
is Albert Einstein?

00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:34.367
Haber, he's legendary.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:37.133
Mileva makes life
at home unbearable.

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.400
Not every marriage is
meant to last forever.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.300
He's just the kind of
man we want in the Academy.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.433
He's a dreamer, not
a rigorous scientist.

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:45.066
It's an official offer.

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.233
The Prussian Academy.

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:47.600
I don't know if I can accept.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.066
I can't go back to
Berlin without and answer.

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:52.066
I can't move to Berlin, Elsa.

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.867
There are other
people to consider.

00:00:53.867 --> 00:00:55.266
Most importantly, my sons.

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.900
It would only be because
I want to be with you.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.166
Is that so terrible?
