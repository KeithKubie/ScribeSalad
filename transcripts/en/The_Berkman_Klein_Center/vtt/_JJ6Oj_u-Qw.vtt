Hi my name is Mimi Onuoha.

00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:02.860
I'm an artist and researcher.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.270
I'm based in Brooklyn.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.820
Most of my work has to do with missing data,
and the data that goes into these algorithmic

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.709
and artificial intelligence systems.

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.920
I think if we ever want artificial intelligence
to go down a more inclusive path then we have

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.210
to make sure the public is more involved in
decisions and conversations that we have about

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.210
it.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.650
And so a lot of the art that I create is about
translating these concepts into things that

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.170
the public can respond to.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.220
For example, one of the main projects I work
on is around missing datasets.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.119
And it's about all of the data that isn't
being collected.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.860
And so what I do is I look at the patterns
behind why certain things aren't collected

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.590
and talk about what it means that we live
in a society where the systems that we're

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.329
creating are based on data, but we can't ever
collect everything that we need.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.690
I think that the only way that we can engage
more people is if we focus equally on translating

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.079
and communicating these issues â€” put as
much focus on that as we put on actually talking

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.970
about them within our more academic, legal,
policy based communities.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.960
I think art is important because it has the
ability to change the narrative and shift

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.000
the framework of the way that we actually
think about these things.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.330
It allows us to imagine different possibilities
and different futures for how we can be using

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.280
these technologies, instead of getting caught
up in this trap of constantly responding to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.780
the harms that we see.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.970
Going forward we need more funding for artists
and other people who are doing this kind of

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:20.970
work.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.110
Especially, there are a lot of creative people
who are working with code and working with

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.400
machine learning, and know the language and
know the tools, but there's not very much

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.590
incentive for them to stay and create this
kind of work, and instead there's so much

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.140
more incentive for them to go into working
for these corporations and actually helping

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.130
reinforce the systems that we might be against.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.340
So I think we need more funding, we need more
incentives for people to keep on creating

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.950
this sort of work.
