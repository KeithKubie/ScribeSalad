RADHIKA MALPANI: Welcome
to the second

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.810
Women Techmakers series.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.590
This series highlights stories
of women in technology,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.650
especially women focused
on social good.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.090
Our goal is to inspire women
to get into technology.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.870
And here at the Google
Developers network, we have

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.490
tools to help you
do exactly that.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.950
We are very excited to have with
us today Julie Hanna, the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.180
chairman of Kiva.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.160
My name is Radhika.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.640
I'm an engineer and director
here with Google.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.410
And I have been here
for over 13 years,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.320
working mostly in search.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.960
I was responsible for Google's
image search and have lately

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.030
been working on travel.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.433
My co-host today is Anita.

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:37.200
Anita?

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.570
ANITA YUEN: Yes.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.040
Hi, everyone.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.110
My name is Anita Yuen.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.360
I have been at Google for
six and a half years.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.770
I spent my first four years
leading our marketing

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.800
initiatives around Google's
consumer search products, as

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.720
well as our homepage products.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.410
And I spent the last two years
now leading our marketing

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.360
initiatives around Google's
technology for good, which

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.250
includes things such as crisis
response, energy and

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.680
sustainability, elections,
as well as our giving

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.076
initiatives.

00:02:02.076 --> 00:02:03.800
RADHIKA MALPANI:
Thanks, Anita.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.910
And Julie--

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.229
Julie Hanna is a serial
entrepreneur.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.750
You have a wonderful,
illustrious career, including

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.130
being an adviser to our startups
and working on

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.260
several boards.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.240
Could you tell us a little
bit more about yourself?

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.220
JULIE HANNA: Hi.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.910
First of all, it's wonderful
to be here.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.650
I find, at my age, talking about
yourself feels like a

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.390
long laundry list of things.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.810
So forgive that.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.890
I'd say, first and foremost,
I'm a technologist.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.130
I'm an entrepreneur.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.470
I'm a former CEO executive.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.020
And what I do today is I use
those experiences to help my

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:50.030
fellow entrepreneurs and
companies kind of go from that

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.750
early conception stage into
building companies at scale.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.970
And I do that in a number
of capacities.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.170
Increasingly, the most
meaningful, I'd say,

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.910
manifestation of that for
me is in working with

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.940
mission-driven entrepreneurs
and companies, particularly

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.030
ones that sit at the
intersection of

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.910
technology and meaning.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.930
And meaning, for me, kind of
what I define by that, is an

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.280
entrepreneur or culture or
company that are driven by a

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.500
purpose, by a mission, by a
certain kind of way of wanting

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.850
to change the world.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.660
And that really defines my
relationship to technology,

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.930
which is really viewing
it as--

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.090
I've always been most interested
in the way that

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.270
technology impacts our lives
as human beings, how it can

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.590
move a human ecosystem forward,
how it can benefit us

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.620
both individually and at a group
and on a global level.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.730
And one of the things that I'm
particularly driven around, I

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.860
realize, because of having had
the experience of starting and

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.730
building a series of five
companies in an operating

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.690
capacity, was that doing that in
the Silicon Valley context

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:18.370
allows you to understand how to
go from the earliest stages

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.430
to building a company
at scale.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.910
And I think we do that here in
Silicon Valley in a more

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.540
highly optimized manner than
anywhere in the world, taking

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.140
those skills and harnessing them
and kind of saying, OK,

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.040
what are the world's
biggest problems?

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.650
The "boil the ocean" problems
that we've tended to

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.120
historically think are
intractable, now, with

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.550
technology, I believe they're
actually quite

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.050
accessible to us.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.204
And so that's really what drives
and motivates me today.

00:04:48.204 --> 00:04:49.520
RADHIKA MALPANI: Thank you.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.855
So you're the chairwoman
of Kiva.

00:04:51.855 --> 00:04:55.110
Could you tell us a little more
about Kiva, what it does,

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.290
what was the basic
idea behind it?

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.500
JULIE HANNA: Yeah.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.760
I think the best way to explain
what Kiva is is by

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.620
talking about Kiva's
first borrower.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.560
Seven years ago, Kiva's first
borrower was a woman named

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.280
Elizabeth Omala.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.270
She was a fishmonger living in
Uganda and had five children.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.920
And she sold fish
by the roadside.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.790
But she wasn't able to make
enough money to send her

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:23.600
children to school.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.740
She was a single mother of
five young children.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.300
And with a $500 Kiva loan, she
was able to make enough money

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.360
to buy bus fare to go to Lake
Victoria, which was about four

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.420
hours away.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.970
And that allowed her to buy
fish directly from the

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.220
fishermen and cut out
the middleman.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.120
And it also allowed her to buy a
small refrigerator where she

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.230
could buy larger quantities
of fish.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.160
And with that $500, that one
refrigerator, that one bus

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.520
ride, she was able to
scale her business,

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.870
increase their profits.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.280
And that allowed her
to begin sending

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.230
her children to school.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.610
And from that first borrower
seven years

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.080
ago, which was really--

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.330
the way that the money was
gathered for that loan, it was

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.250
crowd-sourced, but in
a very analog way.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.910
Matt Flannery and Jessica
Jackley, the founders of Kiva,

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.300
were on the ground in Uganda.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.390
And they wrote home to friends
and family, because they

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:27.880
believed if anybody had a chance
to meet someone like

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.460
Elizabeth and hear her story,
that they would absolutely

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.540
want to fund that loan.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.290
And they were overwhelmed
with friends and

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.300
family sending in checks.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.620
And from there, Matt, who was
a programmer at TiVo--

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.080
and as he often says, I was
spending my days and nights

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.410
figuring out how people could
click through movies and TV

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.740
much more efficiently--

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.070
he sat down, and he developed
this website one night and

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.040
thought, how do I scale this up
so we can put more people

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.480
like Elizabeth online?

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:08.660
Fast forward seven years, and
today, Kiva has made--

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.190
and if you look at it, you can
go to our website, or I think

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.650
it's being displayed, maybe,
on the screen--

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:23.130
we have now made about $380
million in loans.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.860
And we'll probably get
to $400 million by

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.320
around the year's end.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.950
December is a big part
of our growth.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.960
And that represents about 1
million people having made

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.590
loans into 222 countries.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.680
And those loans have gone
to about a million

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.170
people in 66 countries.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:48.860
81% of them are women,
like Elizabeth.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:55.580
And that represents about half
a million unique loans.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.910
The average loan size
is about $400.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:04.190
But our biggest loan, which we
had last year, is $50,000.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.940
So they run quite the gamut.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:11.500
The repayment rate hovers at
about 99%, so very high

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:12.760
repayment rate.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.070
One of the things that I had
someone from the banking

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.970
industry recently point out to
me is that it's a repayment

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:28.920
rate that any bank is sort of
lusting after or envious of.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.300
And so that's a little bit about
Kiva in terms of the

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.530
speeds and feeds.

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:36.070
But really, I would say the
most important achievement

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:43.100
that Kiva has made, which is not
as talked about, is that

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.150
when you look at the loans, it's
easy to sort of look at

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.760
the numbers and say, well, this
is money going from this

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.150
person to that person.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:55.380
But really, the money is just
a symbol of something.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.840
There's something far more
important going on in terms of

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.220
our humanity.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.790
And one of the greatest impacts
is that when people

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:08.590
have access to capital and are
able to be self-sufficient, it

00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:10.640
restores their dignity.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.550
And that's really, I would
say, one of Kiva's most

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:18.090
important achievements, is
seeing the level of dignity

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.980
that is restored with people
when you meet the borrowers

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.630
and you see how their lives
have been impacted.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.380
One of the first loans I made,
which is sort of my own

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:32.270
emotional favorite, was
a loan to a young

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.590
group of women in Cambodia.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:35.945
And you look at their
picture--

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.810
they've formed a sewing
cooperative.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:45.270
And they're raising $730
for sewing machines.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:50.940
And so what I realized in
reading their story was that

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.430
these young women were survivors
of human sex

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:56.790
trafficking.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.270
And all of a sudden, it makes
you think about a loan

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:00.260
completely differently.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.160
This isn't just $700 and
sewing machines.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:09.000
The sewing machine is a symbol
for how this person is moving

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.740
away from a life of slavery
to a life of freedom and

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.570
empowerment and dignity.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:19.770
And when they repaid their loan,
it wasn't, oh, great,

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.800
Kiva has a high repayment
rate.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.420
It was a symbol, evidence, a
marker, of the fact that these

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:33.320
women now were that much
closer to that life of

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.370
self-sufficiency and dignity.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:39.980
So that, to me, is really kind
of underlying it all, one of

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:42.450
Kiva's most profound
achievements.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.630
RADHIKA MALPANI: That's
a lovely story.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.180
JULIE HANNA: So many
stories like that,

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.470
so many Kiva stories--

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.710
almost a million, to be exact.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:53.196
RADHIKA MALPANI: Are there some
more stories you'd like

00:10:53.196 --> 00:10:55.870
to tell us about the
entrepreneurs?

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.880
JULIE HANNA: Well, I think
what I would say is that,

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:08.200
probably in terms of stories,
the thing that is really,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.200
again, maybe not talked about--
but we kind of say

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.720
this idea for Kiva is
so counterintuitive.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.670
So if you think about really
what a Kiva pioneer, Muhammad

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.860
Yunus was the inspiration
for Kiva.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.940
He proved out that microfinance

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.020
could work at scale.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.710
And really, what he was
doing was proving

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:27.820
two important things.

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:30.200
One is that a tiny amount
of money can have a

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.040
disproportionate impact on
the lives of the poor.

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.050
The other is that the poor were,
in fact, an excellent

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:41.315
credit risk, because the
conventional wisdom in banking

00:11:41.315 --> 00:11:46.450
since it's been
institutionalized has been to

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:51.360
exclude the poor and favor
those with money, because

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.610
they're considered to be
good for business.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:58.030
So in a way, you're a good
borrower from a bank when you

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.010
don't need the money,
essentially.

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.770
And that's been the conventional
wisdom.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:03.550
And he flipped that
on its head.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.110
Now, what Kiva did was it
brought microlending to the

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.830
internet and made it
person-to-person.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:12.630
So here's where technology's
taking something that was

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:16.880
working on the ground level, but
amplifying it across the

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.130
globe, as we know that
technology, and particularly

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.380
with the internet, can do.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:26.580
So seemingly overnight, Kiva
became a global phenomenon

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.680
because of the power
of technology.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.320
Making it person-to-person also
had a very subtle but

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.950
profound effect, because what
it did is it took people

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:41.870
closer, and it humanized
something.

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:43.830
And it caused us to think about

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.440
people living in poverty.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.360
Half the world lives on
less than $2 a day.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:51.210
And we tend to think of people
living in poverty largely

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.530
through the lens of victimhood
and people that need to

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:57.110
handout and need our help.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:01.970
What Kiva has slowly done is
changing people's perceptions,

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:04.440
that these are entrepreneurs.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.560
They are resourceful
businesspeople.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.630
They are partners.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.550
When I make a loan to you,
it's not a handout.

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:12.550
You repay me.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:14.240
You're my business partner.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.580
So that shift, that
person-to-person connection,

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.010
is quite profound.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:23.390
The other part of it is the
idea that, gee, someone's

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:25.500
going to want to make a loan to
somebody they've never met

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.390
halfway around the world, that
they think that $25 could make

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:33.890
a difference, that that person
would actually want to repay

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:37.450
that back to that random
stranger, just doesn't seem

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:40.270
like an idea that would work,
and certainly not at scale.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:41.080
And yet, it does.

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.910
So you ask yourself,
why is that?

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:45.330
Why does this work?

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.500
And why does it keep working?

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.370
And I think it fundamentally
has to do with the

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:53.410
person-to-person element, that
we fundamentally want our

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:56.560
lives to matter in small
ways and in big ways.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:01.560
And part of that is one of the
ways that we instinctively

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:05.790
matter is by being a part
of each other's stories.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.010
We want to be a part of
each other's stories.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:12.710
And so when I make a loan to
someone, when I made a loan to

00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:16.510
that Cambodian sewing
cooperative, in my mind, I

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.350
became a part of their story.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.630
And when they repaid their loan,
it told me that in some

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.230
small way I played a
small role in their

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.580
story getting better.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.060
And I think that's really what
propels Kiva at scale.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.680
RADHIKA MALPANI: Can you tell
us a little bit more about

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.450
your lenders?

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:35.780
How often do they get the
money back and reinvest?

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.810
You told us some stories about
your entrepreneurs.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:42.030
Can you tell us any stories from
the lenders' perspective?

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:43.980
JULIE HANNA: Yeah, that's
really a great question.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.600
And it's where some of the
insights around being a part

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.910
of each other's stories has
come, from hearing the lenders

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.920
talk with great enthusiasm.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:00.390
I think the things that I kind
of hear from lenders and some

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:08.490
of the lender stories are the
realization that our sense of

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:15.040
the impact that a small amount
of money can have changes.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:20.530
Sometimes I go to schools and
talk to fifth graders.

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:22.140
Kiva's very big in schools.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.190
And they raise money
to make loans.

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.100
And the way they raise money,
oftentimes, is by having a

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.290
lemonade stand.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:38.840
And to hear those lenders
connect the dots, that a woman

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.390
in Nigeria who has the vegetable
stand that she's

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:46.050
raising a loan for, that
vegetable stand is not a lot

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:51.590
different from my lemonade
stand, except that $25 or $100

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.910
makes a whole lot more
difference for her than it

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:58.110
does for me, because what
does a video game cost?

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:02.160
So even as a young child,
those are the

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.380
kind of impacts [? you ?]

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:06.610
[? have ?], the similarities,
the universality

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.520
of the human condition.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.950
When you read the borrowers'
stories, I hear a lot of

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:12.880
lenders say, gee, they have
the same hopes and

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.130
dreams that we do.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:21.060
I can't believe how they
can stretch the money

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:22.450
as far as they can.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.170
I can't believe they're able
to repay those loans.

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:32.790
And again, there is a change
from "these are victims" to

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:36.460
"these are really powerful
people that, once they get to

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.790
the access to the resources that
they need, can take it a

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:43.340
lot further than any
of us could."

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.590
RADHIKA MALPANI: It's funny you
used that example, because

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.140
the first time I really looked
into Kiva was when my

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.140
daughter's brownie troop had
some money left over.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.370
And they were trying to
figure out what to do.

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.460
And they said, instead of
throwing a party, let's just

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.070
open Kiva accounts.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:57.350
So that's what they did.

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.420
And my daughter today still
goes back in and

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.115
reinvests and reinvests.

00:17:03.115 --> 00:17:03.870
JULIE HANNA: That's great.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:04.790
RADHIKA MALPANI: It's
really funny.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:08.210
JULIE HANNA: I love hearing
stories like that.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:12.000
They get a lot better
a lot more quickly

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.030
than we do as grownups.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.150
It's really interesting
to see.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:15.369
RADHIKA MALPANI: Yeah.

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:16.829
That's true.

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:19.880
So let's talk about
Kiva's API.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.060
You guys are very unusual.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.500
Most nonprofits don't
go into that space.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.560
And I'm sure most people aren't
aware of the fact that

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.170
Kiva actually has a developer
program and an API.

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.050
And I think that might be
very interesting to

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:32.280
our community here.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.860
Could you tell us a little
bit more about it?

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:34.480
JULIE HANNA: Yeah.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:39.510
First, I'll start by saying that
I think what Kiva does,

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.890
the impact it has is so
powerful, the story of it is

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:47.160
so powerful, that oftentimes
what's missed is that, at its

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.610
heart, Kiva's a technology
company in a lot of ways.

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:50.380
It's a startup.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.580
It's like a tech startup
with a social mission.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:18:00.940
And so when you look at the
culture of Kiva and you look

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:04.300
at the engineering team and
the way that it was built,

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.140
there's a lot of
that DNA there.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.770
Then you overlay the fact that
Kiva would not be where it's

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:11.830
at without the community.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:17.520
The community effect is
incredibly powerful.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.890
For example, I think we have
around 400 translators around

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:27.290
the world that translate
the loans for our site.

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:30.070
And so there is this really
powerful community network

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:35.020
effect, that from the beginning,
I think everyone at

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:39.650
Kiva understands, appreciates,
is so vital to Kiva's success

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:41.810
and to its ability to thrive.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:46.520
The API is really kind
of born out of that--

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.080
what would the community
want to do?

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.180
We think of Kiva
as a platform.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.330
It's a marketplace.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:55.050
It's a person-to-person
marketplace.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:59.020
Our community probably has a lot
more ideas and imagination

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.520
about ways of extending
than we do.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:05.300
How do we just unleash that and
let 1,000 flowers bloom?

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:10.330
So maybe to bring that to life
through an example, one of the

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:15.800
more powerful examples of that
is the data visualization of

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:20.370
the Kiva loan activity that
was done last year.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.860
And I think we have-- do you
have a video of that that you

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.260
want to play?

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.280
This might be a good
time to show that.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:37.110
So what you'll see here is this
is a data visualization

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:41.970
of Kiva's loan activity from
January 2005, when we had the

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:45.204
first loan, into June
of last year.

00:19:57.012 --> 00:20:02.424
And each light missile is an
actual loan [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:02.424 --> 00:20:03.900
data points [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:06.852 --> 00:20:07.836
It's time-lapsed.

00:20:07.836 --> 00:20:14.190
You can see over time, as the
activity increases, that's

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:18.300
when PBS Frontline did
a documentary--

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.410
Nightline--

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.640
and that really told Kiva
about the world.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:27.650
Oprah discovered Kiva.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.260
Bill Clinton wrote about it
in his book on giving.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:36.391
And that also drove a lot of
awareness, a lot of activity.

00:20:36.391 --> 00:20:41.420
The loans are color-coded
by type of loan.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:45.010
So you can see the hotspots
starting to form.

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.345
And as the loans get repaid,
the light missiles go back.

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:33.125
Crossed the $100 million mark
in November of '09.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:35.460
ANITA YUEN: It's interesting
which regions seem to pick up

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.960
the lighting activity, or the
missile [INAUDIBLE], as well.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.210
JULIE HANNA: Yeah,
the hotspots.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:49.638
$200 million in March
of last year.

00:21:49.638 --> 00:21:51.998
RADHIKA MALPANI: That's an
exponential growth there.

00:21:51.998 --> 00:21:53.890
JULIE HANNA: So you can see,
those are where all the

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:54.910
borrowers are located.

00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:58.370
These are the lenders.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.950
So that's an example of
the API in action.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:08.390
And you know, this is
the kind of thing--

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:11.520
this is power in technology.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:17.290
Before that video was developed,
we all had a sense

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:18.730
of the numbers.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:21.010
But seeing it brought to life
in this way, you kind of

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:22.060
realize, OK.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:28.260
In Kiva's first year, we had
3,000 lenders and reached

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.610
about a million.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:34.890
And today, a loan is made
every 7 to 11 seconds.

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:40.550
So far this week, we've
already had I

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:46.330
think it's 1,500 lenders.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:50.320
Every three days, we grow
by 1,000 lenders.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:56.190
We hit $1 million in loans
in less than a week.

00:22:56.190 --> 00:23:02.240
And there's just so much insight
you can gather from

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.510
seeing the information
visualized that way.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:10.090
So there's a mobile app that
someone did through the API.

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:13.770
So a lot of fun, interesting
examples.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.450
RADHIKA MALPANI: So here at
Google, we obviously deal with

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:17.010
a lot of data.

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:18.820
And so visualization tools
are something we've

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:20.030
really focused on.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.840
So we totally get the
value of that.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.940
So what's are the plans for
Kiva going forward?

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:26.770
What are you hopes,
aspirations?

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:28.210
Where do you see it going?

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:30.010
JULIE HANNA: It's a
very exciting time

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:32.360
right now, very exciting.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.460
We have several exciting
initiatives.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:42.550
The thing that we lose sleep
over is growth is impact.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:45.340
So the more people we can reach,
the more lives that are

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.450
being impacted.

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:51.870
The growth of Kiva has been
impressive and largely kind of

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:53.820
fueled by technology
and the community

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.790
and the network effect.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:59.830
And at the same time, the
numbers are massive.

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.955
Nearly three billion people
in the world don't

00:24:01.955 --> 00:24:03.430
have access to capital.

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:05.700
So our mission of--

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:06.840
I always say, Kiva has

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.790
democratized access to capital.

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:13.170
That's the lens I look at it
through, because that's the

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.630
way I look at technology, is
it's a democratizing force.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:23.330
So what we think about now is we
expect to reach $1 billion

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:26.770
in loans in the next
two to three years.

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:30.120
That's a very exciting kind
of important mark for us.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.960
Our goal is to have a

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.940
self-sustaining model at scale.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:40.710
So Kiva is a nonprofit, but
I often refer to Kiva as a

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:44.440
not-for-profit or for-revenue
company, because we have a

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.000
model of sustainability.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.690
We're still investing in
growth, just like young

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:54.490
companies do, because we have
a big market to address.

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:57.350
So self-sustainability
at scale we see

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:59.680
kind of on the horizon.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.430
In terms of strategically,
there's some very interesting

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.300
and exciting things underway.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.530
We have had a pilot for the past
year doing mobile loans.

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:15.970
So our pilots between San
Francisco and Kenya, where you

00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:20.410
can make a loan, and the
borrower gets the loan on

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:22.560
their mobile phone, as they
repay their loan, they can do

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.820
that on the mobile phone.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.500
And so one of the things we're
always thinking about is, how

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.630
do we make that lender-borrower
connection as

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:31.360
strong as possible?

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:36.130
And Matt, the founder/CEO of
Kiva, expresses it really

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:40.030
nicely, because we've gone into
the field and spent time

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:40.880
with the borrowers.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.390
And you have an experience and
say, how do we take this

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:46.000
experience we're having right
now, real-time experience with

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.750
this borrower, and export
that to the world?

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.800
How do we get every Kiva
lender that experience?

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.120
That's what we're always
trying to use

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.900
technology to recreate.

00:25:55.900 --> 00:26:00.120
The mobile lending brings them
one step closer to that.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:04.480
And we also think it's how we're
going to reach the next

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.570
billion people.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.460
So we talk about $1
billion in loans.

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.950
But how do we reach a billion
people around the world?

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:16.550
And the phone is the way that
those populations are coming

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:19.300
online in a big way.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:24.290
The other thing that's very
exciting on the horizon is we

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:30.570
have begun partnering with
organizations that are just

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:32.310
traditional microfinance
organizations.

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:35.850
So we have about 150
microfinance

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:37.020
partners around the world.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:42.770
And they're vital to Kiva's
ability to scale, to kind of

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:43.770
be in the field.

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:46.310
And we work very closely
with them.

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:50.420
We've begun to partner with
other types of organizations,

00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:57.310
organizations like Soul Sisters,
I believe, in Uganda.

00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:02.030
And what they do is they are
basically a distributor of all

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:05.370
kinds of energy products.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:11.140
And they are really working with
women on the ground to do

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.360
that last mile of
distribution.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:17.330
So now, what you have is a model
that enables women to

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:22.060
increase their incomes and also
serve energy-poor parts

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.240
of the world.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.640
And so partners like that are
very exciting to me, because a

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.050
lot of these amazing
organizations, amazing

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:32.860
products in the field, having
a hard time really finding

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.220
their market, because they
still lack the capital.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.980
Their buyers still
lack the capital.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:42.730
RADHIKA MALPANI: So you talked
about the receivers.

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:44.910
You've had programs, pilots,
in the past, where you've

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:48.040
tried to get more people to try
out Kiva, to pull them in.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.785
Do you have more plans
like that to reach a

00:27:49.785 --> 00:27:50.690
wider range of donors?

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:51.440
JULIE HANNA: Yes.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.430
I'm so glad you asked about
that, because, actually, one

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.030
of the things I'm most excited
about, I forgot to talk

00:27:56.030 --> 00:27:57.060
about, which is--

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.960
so when you think about what
Kiva has done effectively is

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:06.900
kind of at the grassroots level,
people loaning $25 or

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:11.000
more at a time, and then kind
of the scale of that.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:20.140
The world kind of sees, hey,
there's hundreds of millions

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:24.930
of dollars being lent here at
a very high repayment rate.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:28.520
The trust and the credibility
and the proof points are there

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.210
in terms of repayment.

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:33.870
We increasingly have had
individuals and organizations

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:36.800
say, we'd like to lend larger
amounts of money.

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:42.990
And so our first major loan we
did with a fellow Kiva board

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:46.740
member, Reid Hoffman, who's
the founder of LinkedIn.

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:50.970
And he did a $1 million
loan with Kiva.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:54.700
And so what we did with that, we
said, rather than just lend

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:58.510
that directly, we will actually
allow people to have

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:01.590
the loan experience using
Reid's money.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:07.640
And we called it free
loan trials.

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.620
So what they did is not only
did it put the $1 million--

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:10.920
[INAUDIBLE]

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.280
$1 million reaches 40,000
borrowers--

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:17.820
but we actually brought a
whole bunch of new Kiva

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:22.370
lenders online, giving
that first loan

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:23.420
funded by someone else.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.680
We just did that with
TripAdvisor last week, a

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.900
really fun, exciting
announcement--

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:32.200
if you do a review on
TripAdvisor, you can make a

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.600
loan, and TripAdvisor's
footing the bill.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:40.240
So there's sort of a real
leverage effect there, because

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:43.250
we can expose Kiva to more
people, and then we're putting

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:46.720
larger amounts of money into
the system in more

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.520
concentrated fashion.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.420
The way I think about Kiva is we
all get kind of trained, in

00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:55.960
terms of financial management,
to have these diversified

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.840
portfolios.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:59.510
You put some money in fixed
income and in cash and in

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.900
stocks, et cetera.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:08.900
And so I dream of a world where
people think about Kiva,

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:13.300
or what we sometimes call
connected capital, as an

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:16.690
investment class, an asset
class, where you say, we're

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.850
parking tens of thousands of
dollars or hundreds of dollars

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:21.540
in the bank, and the
bank benefits.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:22.700
No one else really benefits.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.260
We don't benefit.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:27.860
What if we put that money to
work lending to others?

00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:31.610
And we can withdraw that money
any point in time.

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:33.760
Why wouldn't we want
to do that?

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.140
ANITA YUEN: And I think many
people would agree

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:35.770
with you, as well.

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:38.560
I think there have been studies
today that talk about

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:42.150
at least 75% of people have the
intention of giving, but

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:46.650
don't for some reason, whether
it's due maybe requiring

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:48.092
research or needing to
understand a little

00:30:48.092 --> 00:30:48.880
bit more about it.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.820
But I think what Kiva does
is really simplify the

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.440
experience, make it easy for
people to understand what

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.120
they're contributing to.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.430
And even things like the mobile,
I think there's a

00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:59.730
great opportunity there, as
well, in terms of opportunity.

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.110
So that's great that
you guys are

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:02.910
thinking along those lines.

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:03.500
I want to--

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:04.930
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:06.480
ANITA YUEN: --to talk a little
bit more about you.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.920
So we'll shift gears a bit.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.120
You have an incredible
background and career.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.510
And you've worked on products
that have reached over tens of

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:16.220
millions of people.

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.000
And you've worked on consumer
internet, as well as

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.950
enterprise, email communication,
social

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.190
networking, gaming.

00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:22.750
What drove you to Kiva?

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:28.320
JULIE HANNA: What drove me to
Kiva, I think, was stepping

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:33.380
back a number of years ago at
the height of my professional

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:41.640
success, privately feeling a
personal failure or kind of an

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.780
emptiness and a questioning.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:47.330
And that started me on this
journey of kind of saying, OK,

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:50.080
what really matters most?

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:54.810
Rather than doing this again,
the satisfaction that I

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:57.850
realized that came with just
sort of pure professional

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:02.140
achievement, at best,
was fleeting.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.300
And it left me sort of
wondering, gee, is

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.310
this all there is?

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.870
And I was pretty exhausted
and burned out.

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:11.540
And so I took that time to
really step back and say,

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:12.690
really, what's driven me?

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:15.040
What's my relationship
to technology been

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.470
all of these years?

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:19.780
And in that, I discovered
a few things.

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.530
One of those was, when I
connected what I've done

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:28.380
professionally with my own
personal history, you mention

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:32.210
my bio, all the things
that my bio says,

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:33.420
I'm all those things.

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:36.050
I'm a Silicon Valley
entrepreneur who's benefited

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:41.310
disproportionately from being
in this thriving ecosystem.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:43.050
It's one of the most successful

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:44.640
ecosystems in the world.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.700
And we call it the tech bubble
a lot of the times.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.680
I also have come to think of it
as a bubble of privilege.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.450
And it's easy to forget that,
because bubbles are clear, and

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:55.420
you don't know that you're
in a bubble often, and we

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:57.670
normalize our environments.

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:01.050
But because of my personal
history, in addition to being

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:04.240
all of those things, my journey
to the front lines of

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:08.480
the tech revolution started
on the front lines of war.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.270
I'm an Egyptian immigrant,
and I'm a refugee of war.

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:15.480
And I spent the first many
years of my life kind of

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:21.820
fleeing or living in pretty
adverse circumstances, living

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.330
in poverty, and watching
my parents struggle

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:27.940
to make ends meet.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.640
And that instilled in me--

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:36.490
I think it sensitized me to
issues of injustice, seeing

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:42.490
what a lack of access it does
to a person, how it defines

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:47.360
people, how people treat you
when you don't have access.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:53.240
I remember, in my mind, we were
just a family sort of

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.610
getting those through things.

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:57.540
We were no different
from anyone else.

00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.770
But we had our own kind
of challenges.

00:34:01.770 --> 00:34:07.240
But what I would notice is the
way other people looked at us

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.630
after we immigrated to
the United States.

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:13.670
And one of my most vivid
memories is that they would

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:16.330
look at us often through
the eyes of pity.

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:21.429
And they would, in a very
well-meaning way, offer us a

00:34:21.429 --> 00:34:24.219
handout, because they thought
charity was the

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:25.790
best way to help us.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:28.570
And charity did help us
at crucial times.

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:32.350
But what it also did was it
chipped away at our dignity.

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:35.840
And after a while, what happens
with that is you start

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:41.889
to internalize that lens of how
people are looking at you.

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:44.670
And then that can be incredibly
disempowering.

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:50.600
So all of those things really
instilled in me a sense of

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.580
being very driven around issues
of fair access, wanting

00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:57.020
to bring justice to the world.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:00.400
I was lucky enough to have
gotten a sense from my father

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.260
that there was nothing
I couldn't do.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:07.580
So I felt a drive about that,
despite my circumstances.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:13.260
And that's all kind of a long
way of saying that I kind of

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.900
walked around feeling this thing
that we sometimes hear

00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.390
about, which is that talent is
universal, but opportunity

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:25.100
isn't, and that it's not a level
playing field, even in

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:28.320
the land of equal opportunity.

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:30.710
And so when I came out of
college, when I looked at

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:33.750
technology, I really viewed
technology as a democratizing

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:36.880
force, as a great leveler.

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:40.860
And it did give fair access
to people who

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.280
didn't have it before.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.860
And that's really been what
drove me in my career, first

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:49.270
around digital communications
and email.

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:52.440
When I looked at email in the
'80s in the lab, I kind of

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.100
said, you know, I think one
day we're all going to

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.010
communicate this way.

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:57.960
This is going to be
like the phone.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.450
But in searching for that deeper
meaning and bringing

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:07.600
alignment to my work, in terms
of what I held most dearly,

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:13.120
that really led me towards the
work that Kiva was doing and

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:16.890
looking at empowerment and
democratizing forces.

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:19.320
I think technology is the most
democratizing force the

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.910
planet's known.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:24.550
I also came to believe that
entrepreneurs are the biggest

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:26.800
change agents in the world.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:35.460
And so how could I help
technology entrepreneurs have

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.990
a greater impact in the world?

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:42.640
And that's really sort of what
led me towards Kiva and some

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.850
of the philosophical threads
underpinning that.

00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:47.500
Probably a longer answer than
you wanted to know.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.420
ANITA YUEN: No, that's great.

00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:50.090
You've touched on
a few points.

00:36:50.090 --> 00:36:52.880
When I heard as soon as you
mentioned how your father

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.820
said, there's nothing you can't
be doing, and then you

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.160
mentioned the level playing
field, immediately I thought

00:36:57.160 --> 00:36:58.180
of the baseball story.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:00.560
And you can share with our folks
here a little bit more

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.940
about the baseball story.

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:04.130
JULIE HANNA: Yeah.

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:05.930
Megan must have had something
to do with this.

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:08.240
I don't know how that
secret got out.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.620
Yeah, so my family
moved to the US.

00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:14.310
As a young girl, I was

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:16.700
discovering everything American.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.570
And nothing more American
than baseball.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:23.320
And I loved baseball,
was deeply

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.760
passionate about baseball.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:29.550
And my family moved to a small
Southern town, really small,

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:32.400
and so small that we were known
as the foreign family,

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.690
because we were basically
the only

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:36.840
non-American family in town.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.570
And I discovered baseball.

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:40.760
And I said, this is great,
I want to play.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:43.990
And I was quickly told that I
couldn't play baseball because

00:37:43.990 --> 00:37:46.190
it's a boys-only support--

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:47.910
Little League baseball,
I guess, was and

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:50.080
probably still is.

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:53.190
And that just seemed deeply
unjust to me.

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:57.290
And I was kind of determined to
appeal my case to someone.

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:00.320
And largely, a bunch of
adults were apathetic.

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.320
Nobody really cared.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.370
They're like, yeah, get over
it, you can go play in the

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:04.800
backyard, kind of thing.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.875
And so I was really
determined.

00:38:06.875 --> 00:38:10.490
The idea that someone could or
couldn't do something based on

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:15.070
who they were really hit me
and probably because of

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:17.280
everything that I'd experienced
to that point.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:22.070
Doing it because the fact that
someone could or couldn't do

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:25.070
something because of whether
they were a boy or a girl

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:26.550
really got my back up.

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:28.450
And I was determined to
prove girls could do

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:30.040
anything boys could do.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:33.555
And somewhere along the way, I
learned about Title IX, which

00:38:33.555 --> 00:38:34.510
had just been passed.

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:36.940
And for those of you who don't
know, Title IX was the Equal

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:41.560
Opportunity Act that basically
said that if a sport was being

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.400
offered to one gender, it had to
be made available to both.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:44.980
It was very new.

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.410
Not many people knew about it.

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:51.490
And if it were today, I would
have gone on the internets and

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:55.160
found the Google and looked
it up and said,

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.470
how do I play baseball?

00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:58.350
And all this great information--
well, then, that

00:38:58.350 --> 00:38:59.080
wasn't the case.

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.420
So it took a little
detective work.

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.610
So on the day of baseball
registration, I'd decided I

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:05.940
had the law on my side.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:09.800
And I marched to City Hall,
which is where you register

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.710
for baseball.

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:14.240
And to this day, I remember
walking up and really being

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.060
terrified--

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:17.750
because it was all a bunch
of grownups, and I

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:20.470
was 12 at the time--

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:22.680
and walking up to the window.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:26.880
And they said, well, what
are you doing here?

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.820
And well, I'm here to register
for baseball.

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:36.010
And this elderly Southern woman
looks down at me, and I

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:38.960
can see that look of pity.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.590
She's like, oh, bless
your heart, hon.

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:44.870
Girls don't play baseball.

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:46.570
Now run along.

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:50.160
And so I gave her a filibuster
on Title IX.

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.340
And I don't know if they
eventually relented because I

00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:54.160
wouldn't shut up or if
they saw the light.

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:56.360
But they let me play baseball.

00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:02.140
And it was a pretty horrific
thing for a small town to have

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:03.630
a girl play baseball.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:05.820
It really kind of upset
everybody's ideas about the

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.110
way things were supposed
to be.

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:12.620
But what I think was really
interesting in hindsight was I

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:15.130
like to think that I changed
those attitudes just a little

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:19.500
bit about the fact that girls
can do anything boys can do.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:23.740
And in hindsight, I actually
realized that it taught me

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:27.160
almost all the vital things that
I needed to know about

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:27.980
entrepreneurship.

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:32.410
And I think of entrepreneurs
as activists, really.

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:33.700
It was activism.

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:35.500
But activists and entrepreneurs

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.450
have a lot in common.

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:40.860
And so I draw a lot on that
experience to this day.

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:41.010
ANITA YUEN: Great.

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:42.690
Well, maybe you can talk about
that a little bit more.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:45.270
So you've been a CEO.

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:47.960
Clearly, you're a board
chairperson, a founder,

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:48.530
entrepreneur.

00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:50.460
What are other ingredients
that you apply

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:51.710
to secrets of success?

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:57.020
JULIE HANNA: I always feel
like an impostor when I'm

00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:03.000
asked that question, because I
can't say that I've really had

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.320
a methodical way of looking
at my career.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:09.250
And I don't walk around and say,
well, here's my secret

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:11.890
sauce, let me pull some
out of pocket and

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:13.470
add it to this meal.

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:16.346
But if anything, I
would attribute--

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.210
I think, one, there's
the definitions of

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:22.980
success that I challenge.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:27.010
They're social, societal
definitions of success.

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:30.270
And the question is, can we
define our own personal

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:35.230
definition of success that
isn't entirely defined by

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:38.380
external things?

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:48.090
The other is that not worrying
about success would be my

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.180
secret sauce if I had one.

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:54.380
I never thought about whether
I'd be successful or not.

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:55.870
And I don't mean that
make in a glib way.

00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:58.160
I kind of imagine someone
watching who's going, oh,

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:02.110
yeah, easy for you to say at
this point, because, gee,

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:03.880
you've been fortunate.

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.900
And I have been fortunate.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:11.030
But I think part of not worrying
about success is not

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:13.180
having goal orientation
and all that.

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:16.020
It's not that you're not clear
about why you do what you do.

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:17.560
It's not that you're
not driven.

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:21.810
It's just that you don't have a
predisposed idea about what

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:24.060
the outcome is going
to be like.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:29.600
And I meet young people and
entrepreneurs all the time who

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.070
are so with it, so together.

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:34.630
And they come up to me, and they
say, here's what I did.

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:36.170
And they're well educated.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:38.520
And I look at them and think,
god, you're way more together

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:42.660
than I am now, much less
when I was your age.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:47.160
But sometimes, I think what's
happened is we have fallen

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:49.820
prey to thinking we can
codify everything.

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:52.040
So talking about technology,
right?

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.790
It's like, what's the
program for success?

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:56.100
And I think there are

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.850
definitely markers for success.

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:00.050
But I think we can become
slaves to those.

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:03.690
So a gift for me is I had no
idea about any of that.

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:11.530
And what that did is I thrive
on learning and not thinking

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:13.210
about the outcome.

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:15.950
I was driven by what
my values were.

00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:16.870
What am I trying to do?

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:18.090
I want to do something
important.

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:19.400
I want to have impact.

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.790
I want to do something
significant.

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:22.870
I want to learn.

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:25.170
And that created sort
of just an openness

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:26.850
and a sense of adventure.

00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:30.110
Whenever I took a new job, I
never thought about whether I

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:31.130
can be successful or not.

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:35.340
What I thought about is, can I
do what they need, and can I

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:39.000
have an impact, and this
is going to matter?

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.840
Actually, one of the things that
came out in a reference

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:44.990
check years ago that someone
did on me was--

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:47.640
which I was deeply hurt by at
the time, and I realized is

00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:49.390
absolutely true about me--

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:51.360
when I'm motivated
around something,

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.260
there's no stopping me.

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:55.080
And if I'm not motivated, I'm
like a different person.

00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:58.330
And so, really, what has always
propelled me is that

00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:03.920
passion and that desire to
learn, and then being driven

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:08.940
by the value, the meaning, the
what's this for, the why--

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.440
why am I doing this?

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.650
Not what do I do.

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:12.660
Why am I doing it?

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.550
Do I deeply believe in this?

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:16.740
And that's how I think
about startups.

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:19.890
Startups are all about, we're
going to go change the world

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:20.490
in this way.

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:23.530
So that just has always
really propelled me.

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:24.215
ANITA YUEN: Wow, that's
wonderful.

00:44:24.215 --> 00:44:28.030
And I imagine you'd be a role
model for many of us watching

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:29.170
it or around us here.

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:31.630
Maybe you can tell us a bit more
about your role model?

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:34.080
You mentioned your father
earlier in terms of what you

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.300
sort of go back to, in terms
of not accepting the status

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:38.870
quo, and there's nothing
you can't do.

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:41.083
Are there other role models
that you look

00:44:41.083 --> 00:44:43.450
up to in your life?

00:44:43.450 --> 00:44:44.420
JULIE HANNA: This is
the other question

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:46.012
I really hate getting.

00:44:46.012 --> 00:44:48.086
ANITA YUEN: Well, I'm glad I
can ask you these questions

00:44:48.086 --> 00:44:49.336
that you don't like.

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.370
JULIE HANNA: There
are so many.

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:58.970
I didn't grow up saying, this
is one person I'm going to

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:00.820
really model after them.

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:04.360
I think our role models, in many
ways, are people that we

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:07.170
don't know who they were until
much later and look back and

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:09.030
say, that person has
such a formative--

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:11.840
because it's more implicit
than explicit.

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.620
And I certainly have those
people in my life.

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:17.840
I think one of the things
I realized I do is--

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.150
and this probably comes out
of the curiosity and the

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:22.560
learning; back to, gee,
secret sauce--

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:27.240
I think I'm kind of just
naturally a learning machine.

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.400
And I always find something
to learn from

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.370
everybody that I meet.

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:34.420
Now I try to make
it conscious.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:37.060
But it was just always
sort of who I was.

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:40.090
And so there's nothing that--

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:44.500
everyone has something
to teach us.

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:45.400
I really believe that.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:51.980
And I could look back on people
that I didn't like

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:56.330
working with, people
I struggled with.

00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:58.810
Everybody has something
to teach you.

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:04.350
And so in many ways, everybody
I've ever come in contact with

00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:07.340
is a role model in one
way or another.

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:13.650
But I would say the other thing
is I always look at who

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:16.250
am I surrounding with myself
that's a source of

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:17.620
inspiration for me.

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:21.770
And I think we need that to be
our best as human beings,

00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:23.500
which is why it's such an
important question, even

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.090
though I'm giving you a
hard time about it.

00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:30.350
And I would say, maybe, since
we're talking about Kiva,

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:33.650
there are three people
that come to mind.

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:40.080
One of them, a longtime hero,
who I'm pleased to say is now

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:43.050
a friend, is Muhammad Yunus.

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:48.550
And the reason he's a role model
for me is because he

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:58.840
connects very tangible
on-the-ground humanity to the

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:00.680
broadest principles.

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.410
And he is an agent of
change in that way.

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:07.360
But he's not lost his humanity
and his capacity to

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.830
connect in that way.

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:12.920
And that's really what fuels
his power, and he has been

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.370
doing and is able to do, is
he takes that, and he can

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:18.710
abstract that into very broad
and important powerful

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:20.270
principles to change
the world.

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:21.410
And I deeply admire that.

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:24.140
It's something I aspire to.

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:28.770
I would say that another source
of daily inspiration

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:33.900
for me is Matt Flannery, the
founder and CEO of Kiva.

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:40.440
Matt brings such an integrity
and a commitment in his work.

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:47.720
And I would say that we never
always live from our "why,"

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:51.670
but he, maybe as much
as anyone I know, is

00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:52.670
connected to that.

00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:54.330
It's easy to do that
when we do the work

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:55.130
that we do at Kiva.

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:57.460
But I see a lot of people doing
mission-driven work,

00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.890
where you get disconnected from
the "why." And he has

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:03.440
that compass of integrity.

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:05.730
And he is very human.

00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:10.410
Again, he brings his humanity to
his work and to the way he

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:11.030
is in the world.

00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:13.040
And I deeply admire that.

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:15.860
And then, the last person that
comes to mind, somebody I

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:19.870
mentioned earlier, who's a
fellow board member and also a

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:22.980
dear friend and colleague,
is Reid Hoffman.

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:30.120
Reid has found a way to manifest
what he values on a

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.130
large scale.

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:33.820
And he retains that kind of
integrity and humanity.

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.880
So I guess integrity, humanity,
and values, maybe,

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.170
are the things that are really
inspiring to me.

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:40.640
ANITA YUEN: Well, those are
amazing people to be

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:41.595
surrounded by.

00:48:41.595 --> 00:48:43.740
RADHIKA MALPANI: So before we
run out of time, we have a few

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:44.775
questions from the audience.

00:48:44.775 --> 00:48:45.590
Do you want to read it?

00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:47.160
ANITA YUEN: Sure.

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:49.230
So the top one is,

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:50.640
"Self-sustaining model at scale--

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:53.330
can you talk about how you are
intending to make the mobile

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:56.670
loans self-sustaining
and at scale?

00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:57.750
JULIE HANNA: Oh, just
start out with

00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:00.370
a really hard question.

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:08.150
So the mobile loans-- so Kiva's
this model is that, in

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:10.720
terms of how we support
ourselves, when you make a

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:15.760
loan, 100% of the lender's money
goes to the borrower

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.090
that they've chosen
to lend money to.

00:49:18.090 --> 00:49:21.100
And then, when you check out,
when you sort of say, OK, I

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:24.730
want to make this loan, we give
you the option to make a

00:49:24.730 --> 00:49:25.640
donation to Kiva.

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:28.770
We call it a tip, basically, to
tip us like you would in a

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:29.930
restaurant.

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:32.180
And that's our revenue model.

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:34.160
That's our earned
income model.

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:38.220
So it's the same with mobile
loans as it is with if you

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:41.550
make a loan on a
website today.

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:45.330
How we're going to make mobile
work at scale is something

00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:47.830
we're still figuring out.

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:50.310
It's one of the biggest
strategic questions on the

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:52.050
table right now.

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:54.770
So I can't really elaborate
on that right now.

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:57.660
But if you have any great
ideas for us, we'd

00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.380
love to hear them.

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:02.140
RADHIKA MALPANI: So before we
close, do you have any advice

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:04.507
for young entrepreneurs,
especially young women trying

00:50:04.507 --> 00:50:07.710
to get into technology?

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:08.710
JULIE HANNA: Yeah.

00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:12.330
I would say the thing that
helped me the most--

00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:16.230
and it's so much easier to do
this today-- is I would

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:20.300
connect the dots, connect the
dots on what is it about

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:24.680
technology you love, connect
the dots between technology

00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:28.730
and something you're really
passionate about, because I

00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:33.040
think that when you do that,
that will tap the creativity,

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:36.680
the innovation, the passion
for your work.

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:41.320
So today, technology is so much

00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:45.130
about, what can we enable?

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:47.810
What parts of our lives, of
the world, is it going to

00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:49.130
change, enable?

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:53.400
What are the things that
you care about?

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:57.370
And then think about, what role
can technology play here,

00:50:57.370 --> 00:50:59.430
rather than just looking at
things through a pure

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:00.230
technology lens.

00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:01.610
That really helped me.

00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:05.560
My only way of being able to do
that when I was in college

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:09.485
was by the co-op program, where
you could go figure out

00:51:09.485 --> 00:51:13.700
an applied way of using
computer science.

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:16.060
And I became a programmer and
learned a lot about what my

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:17.840
day-to-day life was
going to be like.

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.530
And I quickly realized that
really what I care most about

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:22.960
is how it's going to
affect our lives.

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.660
And that guided the first job
I took out of college, and

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:28.270
that got me going
on a trajectory.

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:30.714
So it's really sort of
connecting the dots.

00:51:30.714 --> 00:51:31.690
RADHIKA MALPANI: OK.

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:32.060
ANITA YUEN: Great.

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:32.640
RADHIKA MALPANI: I think
we're out of time.

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:33.760
ANITA YUEN: Yeah, I think
we're out of time.

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:36.300
So thank you so much for
joining us today.

00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:40.950
It's been great learning about
Kiva, as well as hearing about

00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:42.545
all the inspiration that you
bring to everyone around

00:51:42.545 --> 00:51:45.840
through Kiva, as well as all the
CEOs, entrepreneurs that

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:48.060
you helped coach today.

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:50.870
We want to thank you for joining
us for the second

00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:52.830
series of Women Techmakers.

00:51:52.830 --> 00:51:56.560
We're here again tomorrow, 2:30
PM, PST, with Jen Pahlka

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:57.750
for Code for America.

00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:00.225
And stay tuned to learn
more about tech

00:52:00.225 --> 00:52:01.690
women for social impact.

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:02.940
Thanks.
