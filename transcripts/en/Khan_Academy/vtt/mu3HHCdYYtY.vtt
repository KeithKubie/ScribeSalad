00:00:01.536 --> 00:00:03.921
- [Voiceover] This
square is 1 square unit,

00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:07.385
so what is the area of Rectangle A?

00:00:07.385 --> 00:00:08.739
The first thing we're told is that

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:13.264
each of these little
squares equal 1 square unit,

00:00:13.264 --> 00:00:17.431
and then, we're asked to
find the area of Rectangle A.

00:00:18.755 --> 00:00:22.922
Here's Rectangle A, and area
is the space that it covers.

00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:28.025
So how much space does Rectangle A cover?

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:33.196
How many square units
does Rectangle A cover?

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.369
One way to answer that would be count

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:38.159
how many square units it covers,

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:41.242
except they've covered
up our square units.

00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:44.026
So, one idea's we could draw them back.

00:00:44.026 --> 00:00:47.551
Say you cover'em up,
we'll draw them back in.

00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:50.931
So goin' like this, connect all these,

00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:54.465
and then, we should be able
to count our square units.

00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:58.048
So we have one, two,
three, four, five six,

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.032
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12.

00:01:04.694 --> 00:01:06.027
12 square units.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.182
Rectangle A covers 12 square units,

00:01:12.182 --> 00:01:15.126
so it has an area of 12 square units.

00:01:15.126 --> 00:01:18.575
But this isn't the only way
that we could've solved this.

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:21.173
We could've also said, we
could've also looked at this

00:01:21.173 --> 00:01:25.340
and said, okay, this top row
is four square units long.

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.146
One, two, three, four, has
a length of four units.

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:36.973
So that means the top row will have

00:01:36.973 --> 00:01:41.407
one, two, three, four
square units inside of it.

00:01:41.407 --> 00:01:45.137
And then we coulda looked
over on the side, over here,

00:01:45.137 --> 00:01:49.142
and said, well, how many
rows of four will they'll be?

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:52.309
It'll be one, two, three rows of four.

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:56.171
So we'll have this row of four,

00:01:56.171 --> 00:01:58.989
and then a second row
of four, and a third.

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:02.906
So three times, we will
have four square units.

00:02:04.435 --> 00:02:05.925
There's four square units at the top,

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:07.869
another in the middle,
and another at the bottom.

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.393
Three times, we will
have four square units.

00:02:11.393 --> 00:02:15.461
Or, we could go even farther than that.

00:02:15.461 --> 00:02:20.343
So we coulda done three times
four, or we could look at this

00:02:20.343 --> 00:02:23.093
and say, okay, here's one column.

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.116
This column has three square units.

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:31.460
It has a length of three.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.793
One, two, three.

00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:37.901
How many of these columns
like this will there be?

00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:40.734
There'll be one, two, three, four,

00:02:43.061 --> 00:02:45.615
'cause our length here at the top is four.

00:02:45.615 --> 00:02:50.348
So, this time, four times, we
will see three square units.

00:02:50.348 --> 00:02:53.628
One, two, three, and we'll see that

00:02:53.628 --> 00:02:55.961
one, two, three, four times.

00:02:59.628 --> 00:03:02.257
So, no matter which of these we solved,

00:03:02.257 --> 00:03:05.778
whether we counted the square
units like in the beginning,

00:03:05.778 --> 00:03:09.524
or we multiplied the side
lengths, the three and the four,

00:03:09.524 --> 00:03:11.882
in every case, we're gonna find

00:03:11.882 --> 00:03:15.219
that this equals 12 square units.

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.680
The area of Rectangle A is 12 square units

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.174
because it covers 12 square units.
