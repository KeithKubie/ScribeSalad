1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,900
At the end of the day,

2
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,930
everybody wants comradery
and love and friendship.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,560
That's why like what's the worst shit
that can happen today? You get canceled,

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,210
everybody wants to cancel people. You're
out. Get out of here. You're done.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,260
Pits over.
There's a weird strange,

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:22,220
it's also like I want you to not be
able to make money but it's signed.

7
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:25,300
I want you to starve or go home, be
homeless. I don't really understand.

8
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:26,370
Is that specific?

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,100
It's not specific in terms of like they
don't want you to be able to make an

10
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:30,180
income.
They want to hurt you.

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,520
That's what it is because they're
scared of someone doing it to them.

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,660
This is the a big part of why people
pull the trigger on that stuff.

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,740
Whether I just, people are calling for
people to get canceled for like nothing,

14
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,780
like little tiny things.
Never again.

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,260
It's because they're scared of it
actually happening. So this is like,

16
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,290
you have this ultimate power to just
like get upset at someone for virtually

17
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:56,380
anything. Pick it, pick a cause,
whatever it is you can get. Also,

18
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:01,450
it's sort of intoxicating and it's fun
and most people don't have real opinions

19
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:05,190
on anything. And then you
have this, this, you know,

20
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:08,040
on on Facebook or Twitter or
whatever social media platform,

21
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,990
you have an immediate
gratification of like,

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,130
I just got 20 likes on a thought of
mine. Yeah, that's addictive as fuck.

23
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,550
It's super addictive. You know that
that right there would, you know,

24
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,990
I understand why people continue to
come back and nobody really cares.

25
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,090
As soon as you put your computer
down at your phone down,

26
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,090
nobody gives a fuck about any of these
issues at the supermarket or at the

27
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:29,790
bowling alley or in the library.
But that's not what's important.

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,300
What's important is the
Internet is essentially,

29
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:38,301
the whole world is a big
window and everyone has a
rock and people just look at

30
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:41,880
it, throw rocks. And if you find
a thing to throw a rock about,

31
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:44,680
whether it's throw rock about politics or,

32
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:49,740
or gender or race or social
justice or you know what,

33
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:55,260
fill in the blank. The environment,
the saving, the animals,

34
00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:00,180
everyone's thrown rocks, you
know? And very few people
are actually communicating.

35
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:05,040
It's a strange time for you would think
that you would want, in an ideal world,

36
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,870
you would want people that have differing
ideas to come together, sit down,

37
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,380
have an honest conversation. Yes. And
Go, awesome dude. Go live your life.

38
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:15,330
I'll live my life. I learned
a little bit just now. Yeah.

39
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,650
And then you go off and you go,
yeah.

40
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,990
That's how you learn
from different cultures.

41
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:22,880
That's how we ultimately got to
a place. You know, I think I, I,

42
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,950
I think it's a great country.
I, in a weird way, I think it's,

43
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,480
I'm proud to be an American, you
know, I'm proud. Um, you know,

44
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,820
I don't think all the things that people
think they're are awful about this

45
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:36,630
country or necessarily
awful. Um, you know,

46
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:37,860
I think the opportunity to make money.

47
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:42,660
I did grow up on wealth and I grew up poor
and, you know, you know, I'm, you know,

48
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,680
for all intents and purposes,

49
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:48,030
I'm living my dream right now and I
get to kind of do what I want to do.

50
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,720
Um, and I look at that and I say yes
because I live in a place where that

51
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:54,180
Opportunity's there. Of course,
look, America is amazing.

52
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:55,550
It doesn't mean it's perfect.
No,

53
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,310
certainly it gives you more opportunity
than anywhere that I've ever heard of.

54
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,110
And it's a fun place, man. I like it
here. Yeah. Fucking country is fun.
