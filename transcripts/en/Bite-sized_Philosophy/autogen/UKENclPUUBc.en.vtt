thing right because there's a very very
 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.149
thing right because there's a very very
very interesting idea here it's it's

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159
very interesting idea here it's it's
 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.130

certainly one of the most profound ideas

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140
certainly one of the most profound ideas
 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.850
certainly one of the most profound ideas
that I've ever encountered and the idea

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860
that I've ever encountered and the idea
 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.999
that I've ever encountered and the idea
is this is that if you configure your

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
is this is that if you configure your
 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.090
is this is that if you configure your
life so that what you are genuinely

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
life so that what you are genuinely
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.700

that's a hypothesis and it's not some

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130
that's a hypothesis and it's not some
 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.039
that's a hypothesis and it's not some
simple hypothesis right because it what

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049
simple hypothesis right because it what
 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.109
simple hypothesis right because it what
it basically says is if you dared to do

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119
it basically says is if you dared to do
 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.490
it basically says is if you dared to do
the most difficult thing that you can

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500
the most difficult thing that you can
 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.770
the most difficult thing that you can
conceptualize your life will work out

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780
conceptualize your life will work out
 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.990
conceptualize your life will work out
better than it will if you do anything

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000
better than it will if you do anything
 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.209
better than it will if you do anything
else well how are you gonna find out if

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219
else well how are you gonna find out if
 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.190
else well how are you gonna find out if
that's true well it's a Kierkegaard

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
that's true well it's a Kierkegaard
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.450
that's true well it's a Kierkegaard
ian's leap of faith there's no way

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460
ian's leap of faith there's no way
 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.560
ian's leap of faith there's no way
you're gonna find out whether or not

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570
you're gonna find out whether or not
 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.109
you're gonna find out whether or not
that's true unless you do it so no one

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119
that's true unless you do it so no one
 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.199
that's true unless you do it so no one
no one can tell you either because just

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209
no one can tell you either because just
 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.760
no one can tell you either because just
because it works for someone else

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
because it works for someone else
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.860
because it works for someone else
I mean that's interesting and all that

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870
I mean that's interesting and all that
 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.450
I mean that's interesting and all that
but it's no proof that it'll work for

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460
but it's no proof that it'll work for
 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.400
but it's no proof that it'll work for
you you have to be all-in in this game

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410
you you have to be all-in in this game
 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.490
you you have to be all-in in this game
and so the idea is seek ye first the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500
and so the idea is seek ye first the
 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.900
and so the idea is seek ye first the
kingdom of God and His righteousness

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910
kingdom of God and His righteousness
 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.360

it's like that's actually a fairly

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370
it's like that's actually a fairly
 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.990
it's like that's actually a fairly
important caution when you're talking

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000
important caution when you're talking
 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
important caution when you're talking
about not having to pay attention to

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010
about not having to pay attention to
 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.290
about not having to pay attention to
what you're going to eat or what you're

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300
what you're going to eat or what you're
 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.630
what you're going to eat or what you're
going to wear it's like what it's

going to wear it's like what it's
 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.950
going to wear it's like what it's
essentially saying is that those

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960
essentially saying is that those
 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.200
essentially saying is that those
problems are trivial in comparison and

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210
problems are trivial in comparison and
 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.480
problems are trivial in comparison and
the probability is that if you manifest

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490
the probability is that if you manifest
 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.850
the probability is that if you manifest
yourself properly in the world that

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860
yourself properly in the world that
 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.910
yourself properly in the world that
those things will come your way is

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920
those things will come your way is
 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.050
those things will come your way is
extraordinarily high and I believe I

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060
extraordinarily high and I believe I
 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.150
extraordinarily high and I believe I
believe that that's exactly right I mean

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160
believe that that's exactly right I mean
 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.550
believe that that's exactly right I mean
I I've watched people operate in the

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560
I I've watched people operate in the
 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.200
I I've watched people operate in the
world and I would say that there is no

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210
world and I would say that there is no
 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.120
world and I would say that there is no
more effective way of operating in the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130
more effective way of operating in the
 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.310
more effective way of operating in the
world than to conceptualize the highest

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320
world than to conceptualize the highest
 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.190
world than to conceptualize the highest
good that you can and then strive to

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200
good that you can and then strive to
 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.910
good that you can and then strive to
attain it there's no more practical

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920
attain it there's no more practical
 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.150
attain it there's no more practical
pathway to the kind of success that you

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160
pathway to the kind of success that you
 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.950
pathway to the kind of success that you
could have if you actually knew what

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960
could have if you actually knew what
 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.260
could have if you actually knew what
success was and so that's what this

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270
success was and so that's what this
 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.100
success was and so that's what this
that's what this sermon is attempting to

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110
that's what this sermon is attempting to
 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.940
that's what this sermon is attempting to
to posit it's like in in the story of

that Geppetto wishes on a star we talked
about that a little bit and so what

about that a little bit and so what
 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.770
about that a little bit and so what
Geppetto does is align himself with the

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780
Geppetto does is align himself with the

Geppetto does is align himself with the
metaphorical manifestation of the

have an aim well let's say your aim is
 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.060
have an aim well let's say your aim is
the highest possible aim well then so

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070
the highest possible aim well then so
 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.450

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690
motivations so you organize yourself
 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.630
motivations so you organize yourself
around that aim and then what happens is

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640
around that aim and then what happens is
 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.180
around that aim and then what happens is
the day manifests itself as a set of

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190
the day manifests itself as a set of
 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.820
the day manifests itself as a set of
challenges and problems and if you solve

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:27.830
challenges and problems and if you solve
 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.250
challenges and problems and if you solve
them properly then you stay on the

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260
them properly then you stay on the
 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.020
them properly then you stay on the
pathway towards that ape and you can

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030
pathway towards that ape and you can
 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.880
pathway towards that ape and you can

concentrate on the on the eight on the
 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.560
concentrate on the on the eight on the
day and so that way you get to have your

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:35.570
day and so that way you get to have your
 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.899
day and so that way you get to have your
