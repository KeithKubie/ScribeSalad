00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.529
Farm workers and anything related to farm work is really dear to my heart.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.860
My roots and my background are being  of the child of migrant farm workers and I

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.709
spent all my summers actually here in this very farm.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.949
We would go from Florida to Georgia to Kentucky, just alternating crops and that was my background.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.339
Both of my parents worked out in the crops and in the field.

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:33.159
So another thing that impacted me the most is that though we worked in the farm work, picking vegetables,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.539
harvest, and putting food on the table for others, we ourselves could not afford that food.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.840
So that led to more chronic illnesses down the road.

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.448
I still remember grown men passing out in the middle of the day due to so much heat and dehydration.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.230
But there was we never had an access to health care.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.859
I can't remember a single time as a child ever going to the doctor.

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.428
It was just simply too expensive to to go and if you were sick,

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.378
we would go to Walmart or any local store and bought the liquid ibuprofen

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.920
or the liquid anything to help with your symptoms,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.520
but that was as far as it got. We never had access

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.190
to health care or dentist or like blood pressure, none of that.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.779
So it's amazing how far we've gotten. For example, these free services are amazing.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.489
I am awed and so thankful that these services exist to be able to provide some healthcare to the field workers.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.020
My parents have been able to step away from farm work and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.219
they are currently working in factories. So it's a transition but they're still here in Moultrie, Georgia.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.400
My goal is to be able to one day provide for them, just to be able to get them out of the work that they do.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.819
For example my mother, she works at a meatpacking company,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.800
and she constantly gets bronchitis -- constantly -- and her bones and her body hurts because

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.499
inside is the temperature that keeps meat frozen. We are made out of meat.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.620
So that is very hard. And my father works in lumber, and every day he coughs because of all the dust particles.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.279
So it's still hard work, but one day I hope to be able to help them leave their jobs
