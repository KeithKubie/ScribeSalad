Now thinking back to the soda machine part of our story, can we make a similar

00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:08.304
statement about the quantities we wanted to connect in that case? Which one of

00:00:08.304 --> 00:00:12.516
these choices do you think makes the most sense? Is it that the number of sodas

00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:16.676
the machine spits and the amount of money that Athena puts in are not related at

00:00:16.676 --> 00:00:20.070
all? Is it that the number of sodas the machine spits out depends on the amount

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.122
of money that Athena puts in? Or is it that the amount of money Athena puts in

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:28.576
depends on the number of sodas the machine spits out. Think about how cause and

00:00:28.576 --> 00:00:32.633
effect, or input and output play a role in this part of the story.
