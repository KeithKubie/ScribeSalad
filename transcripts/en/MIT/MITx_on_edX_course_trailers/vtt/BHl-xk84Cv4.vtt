00:00:01.446 --> 00:00:02.985
SPEAKER: Structures.

00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:06.990
You're thinking, like bridges, and
columns, and beams, and shafts?

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.750
This stuff goes back
to the Middle Ages?

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.510
This is so old and boring and stuffy and
desperately dull, like chartered

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.260
accountancy.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.570
You want something exciting
in your life.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.090
Maybe you dream of being a lion tamer.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.690
But wait.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.140
[POPPING SOUND]

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.040
SPEAKER: Give me a second.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.330
This class is not just about
buildings and machinery.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.680
Say you make guacamole.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.780
Should you have triangle
chips, strips?

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.360
Well, triangles, of course.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.950
They better support the bending
moment distribution.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.960
You will learn about it in 2.01x.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.920
Or you may be an inventor like
Amos Winter here at MIT.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.606
To make a wheelchair with
levers, you need 2.01x.

00:00:41.606 --> 00:00:44.610
Or you may be walking in the streets
in Rome and spot a guy

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.040
levitating in mid-air.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.260
Look, it's magic, your friend says.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.850
Not really, you say.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.940
It is just a structure.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.680
I can tell you.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.940
I learned it in 2.01x.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.440
Or say that you want to measure
how stiff cells are.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.370
You need an atomic force microscope.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.050
Guess what.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.810
You need 2.01x to measure the cells
that make up your brain.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.232
And in this brain, 2.01x will put all
kinds of new concepts, like stress and

00:01:07.232 --> 00:01:09.640
strain, and consider the
laws that connect them.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.500
And you will learn about equilibrium
and compatibility.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.960
2.01x gives you the foundation of
structural mechanics and gives you the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.080
power to design wheelchairs, measure
cells' thickness, build bridges, and

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.360
figure out magic tricks.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.850
That's pretty exciting.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.020
Come with us on this 2.01x journey, and
we promise that you will see the

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.910
world with different eyes.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:37.940
