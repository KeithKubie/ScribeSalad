00:00:00.208 --> 00:00:02.391
- [Narrator] As we've talked
about in multiple videos,

00:00:02.391 --> 00:00:03.809
Christianity is a religion

00:00:03.809 --> 00:00:06.724
that grew out of the
fringes of the Roman Empire.

00:00:06.724 --> 00:00:11.465
It starts as a Jewish
sect in Judea and Galilee

00:00:11.465 --> 00:00:15.126
with the teachings of Jesus
and his early ministry.

00:00:15.126 --> 00:00:16.363
But it's important to keep in mind

00:00:16.363 --> 00:00:18.909
that at the time of Jesus's crucifixion,

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:21.992
around 30 C.E., he only had, at most,

00:00:23.584 --> 00:00:27.439
we're talking about in
the hundreds of followers.

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.863
But in other videos, we
talk about his apostles

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.340
who start spreading the faith,

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.378
not only to other Jews,

00:00:33.378 --> 00:00:36.211
but also to non-Jews, to gentiles.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.441
We talked about Emperor Nero

00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:42.212
and his famous purges of Christians,

00:00:42.212 --> 00:00:44.711
in particular, you have
the famous Roman Fire,

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.372
or The Fire of Rome in 64 C.E.

00:00:47.372 --> 00:00:49.123
that Nero blames on Christians,

00:00:49.123 --> 00:00:52.102
and he uses this to do
significant purge in Rome.

00:00:52.102 --> 00:00:55.760
Many historians believe that
the apostles Peter and Paul

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.919
were killed during those purges.

00:00:57.919 --> 00:01:00.778
This is a painting of
Nero using Christians

00:01:00.778 --> 00:01:05.361
lighting them alive to
punish them for that fire.

00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:08.012
Now, other imperial acts that continue

00:01:08.012 --> 00:01:09.929
to have a significant effect

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:12.246
on this very early Christian church.

00:01:12.246 --> 00:01:16.090
We talked about the destroying
of the second temple

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.090
in Jerusalem in 70 C.E.,

00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:22.064
and that's under the reign of Vespasian.

00:01:22.064 --> 00:01:24.826
And this of course is a
very significant event

00:01:24.826 --> 00:01:26.540
for the Jewish people,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.166
but it also has a significant
effect on Christianity,

00:01:29.166 --> 00:01:31.053
because remember Christianity was really

00:01:31.053 --> 00:01:32.373
centered at Jerusalem.

00:01:32.373 --> 00:01:34.836
It was a sect of Christianity,

00:01:34.836 --> 00:01:37.233
or it was, it got its start

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:38.772
as a sect of Christianity,

00:01:38.772 --> 00:01:41.156
but now, with the
destruction of the temple,

00:01:41.156 --> 00:01:43.233
the Jews were dispersed from Jerusalem,

00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:46.737
and so were many of
these early Christians.

00:01:46.737 --> 00:01:48.430
And so the centers of Christianity

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.544
became throughout the empire,

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:52.895
places like Antioch.

00:01:52.895 --> 00:01:56.674
And you continue to have a
discomfort with Christians

00:01:56.674 --> 00:01:59.338
especially as they became
more and more in number,

00:01:59.338 --> 00:02:01.213
and they started to have
more and more power.

00:02:01.213 --> 00:02:02.650
And here you have these people

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.131
who refused to obey the Roman gods,

00:02:06.131 --> 00:02:08.878
to do their rituals, to
worship the Roman gods,

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:11.808
and remember, even, there
was emperor worship here.

00:02:11.808 --> 00:02:15.984
And the issue was more so
than even the Jewish people,

00:02:15.984 --> 00:02:18.179
who, to a certain degree,
kept to themselves,

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.631
these Christians were missionaries.

00:02:19.631 --> 00:02:23.567
They were spreading their
faith to Roman citizens.

00:02:23.567 --> 00:02:25.451
Families were being split apart,

00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:27.081
where some decided to become Christians

00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:29.686
and no longer follow
these Roman practices.

00:02:29.686 --> 00:02:31.940
And so you have these
various persecutions,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.706
and these various purges,

00:02:33.706 --> 00:02:36.071
and they get more and more significant

00:02:36.071 --> 00:02:37.175
as you go into the second

00:02:37.175 --> 00:02:39.561
and even to some degree
in the third century

00:02:39.561 --> 00:02:41.626
as Christians become
more and more prominent

00:02:41.626 --> 00:02:42.971
and more and more in number.

00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:45.454
Remember, they have this missionary zeal,

00:02:45.454 --> 00:02:48.085
and it really becomes a significant purge

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:50.680
under the reign of Diocletian.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.948
In previous videos, we
talk about Diocletian.

00:02:52.948 --> 00:02:55.635
He's the one that
famously split the empire

00:02:55.635 --> 00:02:57.027
between east and west,

00:02:57.027 --> 00:03:00.461
but he's also famous for
his purge of the Christians.

00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:04.912
The most extreme state-sponsored
purges of Christians

00:03:04.912 --> 00:03:06.626
in the Roman Empire.

00:03:06.626 --> 00:03:09.231
But what's interesting is right after,

00:03:09.231 --> 00:03:11.091
or shortly after those purges,

00:03:11.091 --> 00:03:12.725
we're talking a few decades here,

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:14.501
the next empire that would,

00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:16.803
the next emperor who would have reign

00:03:16.803 --> 00:03:18.387
over the entire Roman Empire,

00:03:18.387 --> 00:03:19.781
would be Constantine,

00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:21.941
and at least relative to Christians,

00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:24.950
he would be the opposite of Diocletian,

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.011
because as he's trying
to consolidate his power

00:03:28.011 --> 00:03:29.011
in 312 C.E.,

00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:33.532
you have the famous battle
at the Milvian Bridge

00:03:33.532 --> 00:03:36.365
outside of, or entering into Rome.

00:03:37.611 --> 00:03:40.084
And in this battle, Constantine,

00:03:40.084 --> 00:03:42.278
he sees a vision of the Christian cross

00:03:42.278 --> 00:03:43.504
centered on the sun,

00:03:43.504 --> 00:03:45.437
and he thinks that that is a sign

00:03:45.437 --> 00:03:47.522
that he should fight under the cross.

00:03:47.522 --> 00:03:51.688
And he gets the symbols painted
on his soldier's shield,

00:03:51.688 --> 00:03:53.009
and he's victorious.

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.592
This date, 312, Milvian Bridge,

00:03:56.872 --> 00:03:58.567
The Battle at Milvian Bridge,

00:03:58.567 --> 00:03:59.900
is viewed as the beginning

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.252
of Constantine's
conversion to Christianity,

00:04:02.252 --> 00:04:04.835
viewing it as his chosen faith.

00:04:05.793 --> 00:04:09.429
In 313, the Roman emperor, or the empire,

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:11.303
issues the edict of Milan,

00:04:11.303 --> 00:04:13.926
which officially makes Christianity OK.

00:04:13.926 --> 00:04:16.402
It legalizes Christianity,
which is a big deal,

00:04:16.402 --> 00:04:18.645
because these folks have been
persecuted all this time.

00:04:18.645 --> 00:04:21.549
They haven't been
worshiping the Roman gods.

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.078
Then in 325, Constantine
goes even further,

00:04:25.078 --> 00:04:27.599
and he convenes the council of Nicea,

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:28.920
where he brings the bishops

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.617
from all of Christendom together,

00:04:31.617 --> 00:04:34.562
to start having a more
unified belief system.

00:04:34.562 --> 00:04:36.565
They come up with a Nicean creed.

00:04:36.565 --> 00:04:38.808
A lot of the debate is whether Jesus,

00:04:38.808 --> 00:04:41.929
as son of God, should be
considered equal to God

00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:44.747
or as God or a little less,

00:04:44.747 --> 00:04:45.757
as being the son,

00:04:45.757 --> 00:04:46.969
maybe if he is the son,

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:48.416
maybe there was a time
where there wasn't a son,

00:04:48.416 --> 00:04:49.290
and there was just God,

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.254
but the Nicean Creed says no,
they are one and the same,

00:04:52.254 --> 00:04:54.529
these two things are equivalent.

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:56.517
And then Constantine, on his death bed,

00:04:56.517 --> 00:04:58.589
famously gets baptized,

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:00.229
and becomes a Christian,

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.616
the first Christian emperor

00:05:02.616 --> 00:05:05.116
of this gigantic Roman Empire.

00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:08.174
And so you can imagine,

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:09.979
you have more and more
followers of Christianity,

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.830
but now, this is, so to speak, prime time.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.776
The emperor of the Roman,

00:05:14.776 --> 00:05:17.456
the emperor of the Roman Empire

00:05:17.456 --> 00:05:19.266
has converted to Christianity,

00:05:19.266 --> 00:05:22.394
and it's a legalized religion.

00:05:22.394 --> 00:05:24.654
And then that gets even more momentum

00:05:24.654 --> 00:05:27.256
when we get to the end
of the fourth century.

00:05:27.256 --> 00:05:29.454
Emperor Theodosius, who is Christian,

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:32.056
under him, it becomes
the official religion

00:05:32.056 --> 00:05:32.978
of the Roman Empire,

00:05:32.978 --> 00:05:34.893
the same empire that at one point,

00:05:34.893 --> 00:05:36.629
Christianity was illegal,

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:38.031
and it was being persecuted,

00:05:38.031 --> 00:05:40.731
now it was the official religion

00:05:40.731 --> 00:05:41.866
of the Roman Empire.

00:05:41.866 --> 00:05:43.829
Theodosius, I mention him in other videos,

00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:47.036
he was incidentally also the last emperor

00:05:47.036 --> 00:05:51.203
to rule over both Eastern
and Western Roman Empires.

00:05:52.061 --> 00:05:55.650
So you have this empire that
starts off very anti-Christian,

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.749
actually in the beginning,

00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:58.911
they don't really take much
note of what's going on

00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:00.413
in Judea and Galilee,

00:06:00.413 --> 00:06:02.460
but more and more, they
start to persecute them.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.662
But we go a few hundred years into this,

00:06:04.662 --> 00:06:07.495
and it becomes a Christian empire.
