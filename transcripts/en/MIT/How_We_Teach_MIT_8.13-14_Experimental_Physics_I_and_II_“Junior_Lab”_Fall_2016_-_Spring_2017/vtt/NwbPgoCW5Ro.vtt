SEAN ROBINSON: For us, in
practice, in the teaching lab,

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.540
we try to get the
students the information

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.140
they need at the time when
they're most ready to learn it.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.510
Let's take one example
of one of the skills

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.920
which takes some
time to develop,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.470
which is analyzing data.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.950
Data analysis is hard.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.500
Nobody has good
intuition for it.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.840
It involves mathematics.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.060
It involves somewhat of
a dark art of skills.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.660
So everybody requires
practice at it.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.240
Several years ago, our approach
to teaching data analysis

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.720
in Junior Lab was we
would have a few lectures.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.470
We would take the first hour
and a half of each lab session

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.540
on the first couple of
days of the semester,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.914
and just lecture
to the students.

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:53.060
We would give a blackboard talk
or a PowerPoint presentation,

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.710
and tell them
everything there is

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.430
to know that would get them at
least through a semester or two

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.920
of Junior Lab.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.420
Now of course,
nobody would remember

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.340
any of that by the time
it came to actually do

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.744
data analysis sometime in the
next few weeks after that.

00:01:08.744 --> 00:01:10.910
And given everything we
know about how people learn,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.437
that is not at all surprising.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.160
So the way we do
this now is there

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.110
is a little bit of instruction,
either by some reading

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.670
or a video on the web, which is
mediated through the open EdX

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.100
platform on MITx.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.560
They do a little
bit of what amounts

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.220
to a reading quiz on MITx.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.250
But that's when--
we don't necessarily

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.870
believe that watching someone
give a lecture on a computer

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.080
screen is much better than
giving a lecture in person,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.780
not necessarily.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.680
So we believe the
real learning is

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.259
going to happen
the next day when

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.800
they come to the
classroom, and we're

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.190
going to do some sort
of very active exercise

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.220
on this very same material which
they just learned overnight.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.030
So the direct
instruction that happens

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.950
as part of the
preparation, we really

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.395
are treating it as
the preparation.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:10.520
It's not the main learning.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.061
The main learning is going to
happen with the active exercise

00:02:13.061 --> 00:02:14.804
that happens in class.

00:02:14.804 --> 00:02:16.220
But we just need
to have some sort

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.890
of priming so that
when they arrive,

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.750
they are ready to
start that learning.
