00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.540
The Chiles-Witted sighting
takes place July 24, 1948,

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.040
during a red-eye flight
actually from Houston to Atlanta

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.330
on a DC3 passenger plane.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.920
The pilots of this
aircraft were Clarence

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.170
Chiles and Charles Witted.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.000
These are both
experienced pilots.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.750
And what they saw
was a very rapid

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.080
flight of an object
that flew apparently

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.080
close to the airliner.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.880
RICHARD DOLAN: I mean, you're
talking maybe 100 feet,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.580
maybe 200 feet away.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.040
In the air at that altitude,
that's really close and enough

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.420
to frighten any sane,
rational pilot as to wondering

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.420
what this thing was.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.250
It happened very quickly.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.540
One of the pilots thought that
he saw illuminated windows

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.250
across the object.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.920
RICHARD DOLAN: It's interesting
that both of these pilots

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.250
drew what they saw,
and what you find

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.880
is they are remarkably similar.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.380
They both show this elongated
object, like a rocket

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.120
or like a missile, except
it's got a little kind

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.290
of a tail thing that they
depict and those layers

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.460
of windows, which are
very, very distinctive.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.290
And was followed
by a trail, which

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.620
led to the official explanation
that this might be a meteor.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.040
The problem with the explanation
is that they described

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.920
the object as turning up and
flying up into the clouds

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.580
and up into the sky.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.790
Meteors don't do that, and
balloons don't do that, either.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.580
So we can no go
back and say the Air

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.620
Force explanation for that
particular case in 1948

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.500
is a wrong one.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.500
