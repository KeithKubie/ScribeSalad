TAMZIN TAYLOR: My
name is Tamzin,

00:00:01.415 --> 00:00:04.930
and I'm a partner development
manager for the UK and Nordics.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.500
Now, I've been involved in
mobile content since 2001,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.770
and I can tell you I'm
so excited about how

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.750
well the industry's grown.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.110
And it just makes
me really happy

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.160
to see the rich
potential that we're

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.092
building for partners
like yourself

00:00:20.092 --> 00:00:21.133
in the Android ecosystem.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.630
So I think we've heard a
lot today about monetization

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.480
and improvement.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.470
Monetization is not just
about pricing, obviously.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.820
I think we've heard today
some great tips from people,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.210
like Illya Michael,
about quality

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.990
being the cornerstone of
success, things like design,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.200
using the platform
tools, like beta testing

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.920
and staged rollouts.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.820
And if any of you
attended Mateo's session

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.970
on engagement techniques,
it was absolutely fantastic.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.520
So things around
understanding your users

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.140
to drive engagement retention
and understand lifetime value.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.760
So-- let's see, is
that-- so let's look

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.680
at the growing opportunity now.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.880
I know that we touched on
this earlier in the day.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.890
So in Mark's welcome
speech, he gave you an idea

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.352
of the growth of the Android.

00:01:16.352 --> 00:01:18.310
And I guess, what I'm
trying to get across here

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.460
is there is a massive
capacity to earn,

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.892
and there are increasingly
more ways for people to pay.

00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:29.320
I know we touched
on this earlier,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.260
but local forms of payment,
like direct carrier billing,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.400
gift cards, and PayPal, are
opening up new audiences

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.680
for you to target.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.910
And I've actually
seen with my own eyes,

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.090
when we launched a new form
of payment in New Zealand,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.750
we actually got new users
in incremental sales.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.070
So we're actually opening
up new audiences for you

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.450
to sell to in New Zealand.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.540
They buy content.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.500
So we're seeing
great success today.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.150
Just a couple of key pointers.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.410
We've unlocked the
domestic market of Germany.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.490
When we launched a
new local payment,

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.497
we saw a 70% growth in
year-on-year buy growth.

00:02:08.497 --> 00:02:11.080
And one thing I'd like to call
out as well is just to show you

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.020
that the capacity of
play to earn money.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.610
We had 38% year-on-year
growth from primarily

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.480
international sales.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.360
So given this increasingly
global market,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.440
how should you price
your quality application?

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.940
Note, I said quality, because
you've heard everything today.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.090
And I know you're going to
go out and implement it.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.220
So the global market is
ready for your products.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.150
Your application is built.
You've improved the design.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.020
You're using all the
platform features.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.070
Pricing for globalization
is very important.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.800
And my esteemed
colleague, Yashi,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.060
who's getting
mocked up somewhere,

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.254
is talking after
me about go global.

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:52.670
So he'll tell you
more information

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.080
about other factors on that.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.800
But I'd like to start
with a few key points

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.580
on setting and
managing your prices.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.550
Now, you may say to me, ah,
Tamzin, that's common sense.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.470
And some of it is
common sense, but you'd

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.070
be surprised how few developers
actually implement it.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.520
So I'm going to call them
out today really quickly,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.290
and you can tell me to
sit down if it's boring.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.760
And these will include matching
the model to the market,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.090
taking into consideration
purchasing power parity, which

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.542
is how much consumers
can afford, local price

00:03:22.542 --> 00:03:24.125
preferences, as
[INAUDIBLE] mentioned,

00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:27.460
will be the $0.99 not going
well in Japan, audience

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.270
segmentation, and just checking
in on your pricing strategy

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.990
regularly.

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.680
So to kick things off, matching
the model to the market.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.590
So we know that there are
multiple ways to bill customers

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.080
at Google Play-- free, freemium,
premium, subscriptions,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.839
et cetera.

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:44.380
So it's really
important to make sure

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.530
that you carve out a
pricing model that's

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.650
going to meet the cultural
and economic factors

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.976
within that country.

00:03:51.976 --> 00:03:53.600
So if you were
targeting a country that

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.620
has very high prepaid
penetration and perhaps very

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.490
low credit card
penetration, you might

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.490
want to consider more
transactional type of payment

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.560
models, like in-app
billing or premium,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.160
to take into account perhaps
the less regular cadence

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.689
of top apps they might
have on their phone.

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.230
And of course, the model should
support the value proposition

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.360
of your content.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.810
For example, if you have
a subscription offering,

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.140
make sure that the content
or the functionality

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.680
is refreshed regularly, or
that the user has a reason

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.890
to go back into it daily
to get value out of it.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.160
Hands up here.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.880
Who has heard about the minimum
price reduction in India?

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.880
Excellent.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.260
And who actually did lower
their price and go into India?

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.466
Fantastic.

00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:38.215
If I had a fruit basket,
I'd give you one.

00:04:38.215 --> 00:04:41.560
So what we did recently is
we lowered the minimum price

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.230
that you could charge out on
the Google Play Store in India,

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.430
from 50 rupees to 10 rupees.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.120
Now, I guess, to put it in
context, a can of Coke in India

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.390
costs about 10 rupees,
but it costs $1 in the US.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.330
So OK, that's fine.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.010
That's fine.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.820
But we know that, actually,
$1 US equals 66 rupees, if you

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.992
take yesterday's exchange rate.

00:05:04.992 --> 00:05:05.950
So then, hang on a sec.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.107
So they're charging 10 rupees in
India, but 66 rupees in the US?

00:05:11.107 --> 00:05:12.940
So what we're seeing
here is a clear example

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.640
of Coca-Cola basically pricing
to what the market can afford,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.780
purchasing power parity.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.790
So that's kind of what
we were trying to get at,

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.110
is we know there's a
market exchange rate,

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.490
but there's always a soft
consumer price that kind of

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.880
will get you more conversions.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.840
So some results after we
launched the minimum price was

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.600
that, after four
weeks, we had 560

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.829
titles across 220
developers that

00:05:38.829 --> 00:05:40.120
changed their prices for India.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.540
So you're one of 220, sir.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.290
And as a result, we've seen
an 800% increase in revenue.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.985
I mean, that's outstanding.

00:05:48.985 --> 00:05:50.860
And the great thing that
we like to point out

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.904
is-- are you're based in
India, or the UK, or EMIR?

00:05:53.904 --> 00:05:54.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.569
TAMZIN TAYLOR: UK.

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:59.640
So you're one of the 75%
of those 220 developers

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.880
who actually changed their
prices for the Indian market.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.840
So it's a very international
market we're happy to see.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.820
One call-out I'd
like to make is Nova.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.360
So Nova do a browser launcher.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.130
And they originally
were priced at $499 USD,

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.093
which equated to
about 325 rupees.

00:06:21.093 --> 00:06:24.020
That's like 32 cans of Coke.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.960
So they took advantage
of this offer,

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.030
and they changed their price,
I believe, to 15 rupees.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.270
And you can see
the impact there,

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.840
a 136% increase in orders
and 27% increase in revenue.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.332
So again, a very
happy developer.

00:06:40.332 --> 00:06:41.410
Oh, and it's live.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.620
So if you haven't done
it yet, and you still

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.964
want to target India,
you should get in there.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.370
And we know that many
of our top partners

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.090
are doing their own testing
on prices across the world.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:00.700
One amazing learning
application did some ABCD tests

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.060
in the US and Russia recently.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.280
And they found
that, for the USA,

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.390
they tested four
different price points,

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:11.080
and the optimal one was 23%
lower than their original.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.290
And that generated them
95% increase in conversion

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.310
and 52% increase in RPU.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.430
Similarly, for the Russian
tests, it was a 12% drop.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.470
You can see the stats there.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.320
So I guess the caveat here
is, don't take these price

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:30.740
drops as what you should do,
because your content is unique,

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.100
and your markets will
be the ones you choose.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:36.040
But if you can find a way
to test different prices

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.282
across your markets,
we recommend

00:07:38.282 --> 00:07:39.990
this is the way to
find the optimal price

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.550
to help you increase conversion
and gain incremental revenue.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.170
Now again, we touched
on this earlier a bit.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:54.480
So you know, I'm from
Australia, not New Zealand.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.290
And one thing that
really annoyed me is I'd

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.264
go into the Play Store and
I'd go in looking for an app,

00:07:59.264 --> 00:08:00.180
and then find the app.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.140
Fantastic.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.622
And it would say, you'll
be charged $1.16, or $3.74.

00:08:04.622 --> 00:08:05.550
I'm like-- [GROANS].

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:06.990
I kind of feel
like the developer

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:09.990
doesn't care about me.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:11.740
And we know from what
we discussed before,

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.960
that in Japan, they prefer
whole figures, like 700 yen,

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.060
not 701 yen.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.330
So in the Developer
Console, we actually

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.040
enable you to
customize the prices

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.730
of your in-app SKUs, or premium
prices, or subscriptions,

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:28.960
by country.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.380
And the great thing about
that is you do it once,

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.370
and then we will, on
our side, convert that

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.360
to the local currency
so that, when

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.220
users see an optimized price
and a value offering that

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.484
works for them,
they're more likely to,

00:08:40.484 --> 00:08:42.442
if they like the content,
to make the purchase.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:50.060
And who here attended Mateo's
talk about engagement?

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:50.560
Excellent.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.779
OK, so this may seem
familiar territory,

00:08:53.779 --> 00:08:55.320
but I just want to
touch on it again,

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.360
because it's so important.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.130
So we know that users
are not homogeneous.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.610
It's best practice to know
who your customers are,

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.754
what their behaviors are
like, and what they'll pay.

00:09:07.754 --> 00:09:10.170
If you can do this, you can
carve out different strategies

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.460
to help them along
the purchase journey.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.890
Mateo talked a lot
about Google Analytics,

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.800
but any analytics are important.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.370
And really, if
you can find a way

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:22.190
to differentiate your
segments to then identify

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.277
who are the spenders and who
are the non-spenders, who

00:09:25.277 --> 00:09:27.110
are the engaged and who
are the not engaged,

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.350
and then present them
different offers,

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:30.810
we've seen good success.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:34.630
So Wish, for example,
used this system.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.710
And for those of you who
weren't in Mateo's speech,

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:41.760
Wish basically created
different product offers,

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.030
so cheaper offers for
less engaged users,

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.060
and more expensive product
offers for the more engaged,

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.700
and saw a 10% increase
in conversion.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.390
Anyone sell to Russia here?

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:55.020
A few.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.450
So you're probably
familiar with this graph.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.906
But essentially, one of
the last best practice

00:10:00.906 --> 00:10:03.280
pricing initiatives is really
to check in on your pricing

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.150
regularly.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.190
For example, if a
developer set their price

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:11.534
in 2014, February 1st, and
didn't change it for a year,

00:10:11.534 --> 00:10:13.200
they would have seen
their gross revenue

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.870
from Russia nearly half,
because of the four exchanges.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:19.060
So we recommend going in
and checking your pricing

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:22.740
regularly, so you can see where
you are versus your competitors

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.270
and versus the exchange
rate fluctuations.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:29.160
So we've just touched on
all the best practices.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.340
And I'm running slightly late,
so I'm going to continue on.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.140
The running theme here is that
not all users are the same.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.150
They've got different
price sensitivities

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:38.510
and different needs.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.420
So how can you deal
with this, when you're

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.200
talking about a global market?

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.000
So I'm going to
touch now on AdMob,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.330
and then give you a bit
of an update on what we're

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:47.371
doing with subscriptions.

00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:51.930
Clicker, come on.

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:52.430
OK.

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:55.130
So anyone here use AdMob?

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.841
And I won't be
upset if you don't.

00:10:56.841 --> 00:10:57.340
Great.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:57.947
Excellent.

00:10:57.947 --> 00:10:59.780
So AdMob, for those of
you who don't use it,

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.550
is our industry leading
ads and mediation platform.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.500
It's earned over 650,000
developers over $1 billion

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.800
in the last two years.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.850
And as you can see here,
the growth statistics

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.260
are very, very impressive.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.790
And it tells us a
bit AdMob, of course,

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.530
but it really tells us
something about the ecosystem.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.120
And what it says
is that advertising

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.380
is a very important part
of that monetization,

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.130
and it's growing each year.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.890
In fact, Gartner
predicted-- and this

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.080
is Gartner-- that
by 2017, they'll

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.260
be nearly 270 billion
app downloads.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.210
And the majority of these they
think will be free in premium,

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:35.370
or freemium.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:37.710
And with the growth in free
and freemium, of course,

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:41.130
is the growth in
mobile advertising.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.270
So we talked about consumers
differing between markets

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.900
because of disposable income
and cultural differences,

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.560
but we believe
that you shouldn't

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.690
be forced to choose
between only monetising

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.440
through in-app advertising,
or through ads.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.870
But to date, we haven't
really given developers

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.450
the option, until now.

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:05.410
So AdMob actually is
trying to help you find

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.540
the right monetization model.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.710
It feeds in the opportunities,
processes the information,

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.600
looks at your ads,
your app, your users,

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.180
and your advertisers,
and then will deliver

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:16.840
the right experience to them.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.890
So what this means,
in a nutshell,

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:23.970
is that you can have
it set up in your apps

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:26.400
so that either users,
who we identify

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.390
being as high spenders,
will see an in-app purchase

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:30.580
ad for your product.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.840
And those who we identify
as being low spenders,

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.210
will simply see an AdMob ad or
one of your third-party ads.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.862
In this way, we try and help
you monetize all users, not just

00:12:39.862 --> 00:12:41.570
the high spenders,
and not just those who

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:42.972
are not going to spend.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.520
So this is another example of
a tool called, Audience Builder

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.330
within AdMob that
allows you then to go in

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.730
and, I guess, fiddle and
create deeper segmentation

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.000
for your audiences, to
give them different offers.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.040
And one example here is that,
if you do have very high paying

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.800
users, you might not want
to show them ads at all.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.590
And the AdMob platform
allows you to do this.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:11.530
So in-app purchasing and adds,
two great ways to make money.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:12.830
But there's a third one.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.700
Who here likes
recurring revenue?

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:17.570
Excellent.

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:20.520
So let me tell you a
bit about subscriptions.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.030
Another question for the team.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.940
Who has a Netflix account?

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:25.980
Fantastic.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.227
Who's got a mobile plan?

00:13:29.227 --> 00:13:30.810
So you can see here
that subscriptions

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.230
are tried and tested model
that people are quite used to

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.842
and they like.

00:13:33.842 --> 00:13:36.300
From a user's perspective, it's
great, because then there's

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:37.120
no bill shock.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.690
Once you've signed
up, you can expect

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.780
to get free access to
the content, ongoing.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.040
Furthermore, it builds
trust in the brand.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.490
For developers,
recurring revenue

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:48.710
gives you greater certainty
around your cash flow

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.450
and helps you forecast
your investment in Android.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.860
And did you know that
subscriptions are actually

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.540
the fastest growing
business model in play?

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.900
You see the statistic here.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.620
We had 2 and 1/2 times
growth in subscriptions

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:05.610
between 2013 and 2014.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.661
And we think this is due
to a couple of factors.

00:14:07.661 --> 00:14:09.910
The first factor is that
people are becoming more used

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:10.990
to paying.

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.530
And the second factor is
that leading developers,

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.119
like yourself, are improving
the quality of the applications

00:14:16.119 --> 00:14:17.410
that you put on the Play Store.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.775
So a big thanks to you.

00:14:20.775 --> 00:14:22.400
A couple of case
studies I'll call out,

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.040
because I know I'm over
time, is that Busuu,

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.920
one of our good
partners, actually

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.100
has invested so much in
their Android application

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.150
over the last year.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:35.380
And their focus has really been
about improving the onboarding

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.220
flow of users to sign
up to subscriptions.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.250
And what they've done is they've
overhauled their design so

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:44.470
that users can really see
the value that they're

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.810
getting for signing up.

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:47.360
So there's a large
portion of free,

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:51.630
and then it's a
graduated call to action.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:54.020
"New York Times"-- I have
to say this is fantastic--

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.270
but they were using a payroll,
and moved across to Google Play

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.050
billing.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:01.780
And they actually reduced their
sign-up flow from two minutes

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.370
to three seconds.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.550
And this speed of sign-up
has been due to the fact

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.750
that all the customers
signing up already

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.870
had a form of payment
on the Play Store.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.110
And that resulted
in 125% increase

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:18.450
in subscription conversion.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:21.450
So it takes a functionality to
build a successful subscription

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:22.350
business.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:23.880
There's grace periods
to help people

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:27.740
who may be run out of-- there
might be a prepaid top up,

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.830
and their DCB, Direct Carrier
Billing, doesn't work.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.330
Or it might be someone
who simply has not

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:34.550
paid their credit card bill.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:37.150
So with grace periods, you
can give them a chance to fix

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.170
their form of payment, without
cancelling their subscription,

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.330
which works for the user,
and also works for you,

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.130
because you've got less churn.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.530
Goodwill credits are really
great for rewarding people

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.480
who've done a good-- customers
who've given you good feedback.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.770
And upgrades and downgrades
are one way to, again,

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:56.950
ease people up the
purchaser uphill journey.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:58.450
And of course, this
is the one slide

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:00.000
I was really keen to
share with you today.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.680
But I'm really,
really, really pleased

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.330
to announce that,
as of tomorrow,

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:06.460
we'll be launching quarterly
and six-monthly subscription

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.014
periods.

00:16:09.014 --> 00:16:12.650
[AUDIENCE APPLAUSE]

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.990
And you can use these to do
many, many different things.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.900
I mean, the first one is
psychological pricing.

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.736
So you can look at the way
that you price your packages,

00:16:20.736 --> 00:16:22.360
and make it more
attractive for someone

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.760
to sign up to a six-monthly,
versus a quarterly.

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.180
And again, what we hope
to do is, in this way,

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:33.060
give you more flexibility on
your monetization options.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:34.590
So thank you, very much.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.330
I'm sorry I went
over, but I just

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.530
want to touch on the wrap
up, which is, number one,

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.270
Google Play is a growing market.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.520
And I think we've touched
on that many times today.

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.090
Pricing is one lever
for monetization,

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:48.550
but quality is one of the
key elements to consider.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.320
And you can achieve success by
following some best practices.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.720
And please consider
the subscription models

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.690
that you can now use.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:56.210
Thank you.
