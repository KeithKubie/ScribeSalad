1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,730
Paul founded several,

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,590
probably small house churches
in the area of Galicia.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,850
Uh, there's some debate about exactly
what part of Asia minor he's referring to

4
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:18,090
because there are different parts.
They were called Galicia. Uh,

5
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,780
and of course the word
Galicia you recognize probably
just comes from the word

6
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:26,010
for gall. That is the people
who occupied France later.

7
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:27,630
The Gauls,
uh,

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,930
were tribes that tended to be in different
parts of Europe at different times.

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,840
So there's part of Asia minor
that is modern day Turkey,

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,770
the central part of it that was
called Galicia after the goals.

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,230
So Paul was there at some point.

12
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:43,410
We don't know exactly when he
founded some churches there.

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,740
These were all gentile churches.

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,240
There's no record at all that he had
any contact in the area with Jews

15
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:56,180
themselves. And there's no record in the
letter of glow to the Galatians that, uh,

16
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,500
he's addressing Jews at all in the letter.
It's,

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,580
if you notice from the letter also,
it's not directed simply to, um,

18
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,110
one house church are even one town.

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,670
Galicia refers to an area that
included different towns. And so it's,

20
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,120
this is something like a circular letter
that would have been gone around to

21
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:16,050
different parts of that.

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Other traveling teachers obviously have
come along and at some point and quite

23
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:23,370
reasonable enough,

24
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,400
they may be themselves be Jewish
followers of Jesus or they may be gentiles

25
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:33,360
themselves, but who became law observant
when they started following Jesus.

26
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,300
And this will be natural. I mean,
if you come along and say, well,

27
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,100
you're now worshiping the god of Israel,

28
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,760
now you're sort of claiming
to be followers of Abraham,

29
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:43,230
your claim to be children of Abraham.

30
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,200
You're claiming to be followers
of a Jewish Messiah. Well,

31
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:48,810
it's okay that your followers,
and it's okay that you were baptized,

32
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,650
but if you really want to be
a full citizen in this group,

33
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,540
you need to get circumcised like, uh,
other Jews do. You need to keep kosher.

34
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,260
You need to follow the Jewish law,
this,

35
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,880
the Jewish ethnic laws or are written
for Jews. They're still in force.

36
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,610
And if you want to be a part
of the people of Israel and,

37
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,810
and follow the god of Israel,

38
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:11,190
then keep the Jewish law
a perfectly natural idea.

39
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,340
But it sends Paul way over the edge.

40
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,760
So he writes Galatians two,
this group,

41
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,760
trying to convince them
not to accept this,

42
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,160
what he calls a new teaching
or a different gospel.

43
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,460
And this is where Paul is in his most
angry and most vituperative of just about

44
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,870
all of his letters.

45
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,020
And we're going to go through several
parts of it because what I'm going to

46
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:37,200
point out right now is how
did Paul try to convince them?

47
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,510
So look at Galatians with me.

48
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,550
We're going to skip around in several
parts at two. Galatians two 15,

49
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,100
the first part,
first two chapters you've already read,

50
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:51,840
because we read at the very
beginning of the semester.

51
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,070
This is when Paul tells the story
of where he was in Jerusalem,

52
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:59,040
where he was in Damascus. He
how he got his own Gospel. He,

53
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,270
his independence from the leadership
of the Churches in Judea. Uh,

54
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,980
Peter, James, John,

55
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,340
precisely because it may well have
been that the people who came to the

56
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:12,250
relationship after he did,
and we're teaching these people,

57
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:14,740
otherwise they might have
said, well, you know, Paul,

58
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,570
sure he told you some of the Gospel.

59
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,790
But Paul's not really one
of the original apostles,

60
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,340
the original apostles or
Peter and James and John,

61
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,170
and we represent their point of view.

62
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,520
So Paul initially set separates
himself from that, uh, at all and says,

63
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:29,560
I didn't get my gospel from Peter,
James and John.

64
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,570
They are not the core apostles.
I'm just a much in a possible as they are.

65
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,910
I've got my gospel straight from
Jesus. But then he goes on to say, uh,

66
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,840
to talk about the law to 15 we ourselves
are Jews by birth and not gentile

67
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:48,340
sinners. Gentile centers was just like a
two words that almost automatically went

68
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:50,710
together in some Jewish
rhetoric and propaganda.

69
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:54,440
This period that being outside of
Israel, being outside the people of, of,

70
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,510
of God was made you a center
practically in itself,

71
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,010
at least according to some points of view.

72
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,110
And then g and Paul tends to share that
point of view because he uses gentile

73
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,030
sinners himself more than once.

74
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,000
Yet we know that a person is
justified not by works of law,

75
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,330
but through faith in Jesus Christ.
We have come to believe in Jesus Christ,

76
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,960
that we might be justified by faith in
Christ and not by doing the works of the

77
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:19,060
law because no one will be
justified by the works of the law.

78
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,250
But if in our effort to
be justified in Christ,

79
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:24,580
we ourselves have been found to be
sinners. Is Christ then a servant of sin?

80
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,880
Certainly not. But if I build up again
the very things that I once tore down,

81
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,000
then I demonstrate that I'm a
transgressor for through the law.

82
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:35,860
I died to the law so that I might live to
God. I have been crucified with Christ.

83
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,520
It is no longer I who live,
but it is Christ who lives in me.

84
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,910
The life I now live in the flesh.
I live by faith in the son of God,

85
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,620
for if justification comes through
the law, then Christ died for nothing.

86
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,560
It's a pretty big
statement. If CR, if you're,

87
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,370
if the law get you anywhere than
Christ didn't need to die at all.

88
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,980
Notice what he says in three 12, he
gets even worse. Um, with what he says,

89
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,310
three 12. The law does not
rest on faith. On the contrary,

90
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:05,290
whoever does the works of
the law will live by them.

91
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,490
So notice he's separating out faith and,
and law.

92
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,470
That's not something that almost any
Jew would do. The idea that somehow,

93
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,250
uh,

94
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,930
you don't have faith in God because
you keep kosher is ridiculous too.

95
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:22,420
A lot of Jews, right? In
fact, you're keeping kosher.

96
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:25,720
You're keeping the law is an
expression of your faith in God.

97
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,870
And so Paul is saying this is,

98
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,980
it might sound almost commonsensical if
you've been raised in a Christian Church,

99
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,400
but if you put yourself in the mind of a,
of a Jew in the first century,

100
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,050
hearing this somehow that the law and
faith are opposed to one another is just

101
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:45,220
very shocking.
Look at three 15 brothers.

102
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,930
I give an example from daily life.
Once a person's will has been ratified,

103
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,270
no one adds to it or a nose.
It,

104
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,240
the promises were made to
Abraham and to his offspring.

105
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,370
It does not say and to offsprings.
And what he's doing,

106
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:03,140
he's playing on the Greek word seed is
what is translated here, his offspring.

107
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,270
And he's saying this was
given to Abraham seed.

108
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,840
And the Greek word is singular seed.
It doesn't say seeds.

109
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,420
So that means that, uh, it has to refer
to Christ. Christ is the seed of Abraham,

110
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,150
not all the people of Israel.
My point is this,

111
00:06:17,151 --> 00:06:21,440
the law which came 430 years later,
does not,

112
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:24,170
and all a covenant
previously ratified by God.

113
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,620
So as to nullify the promise for if
the inheritance comes from the law,

114
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,280
it no longer is from promise, but God
granted to Abraham through promise.

115
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,630
Notice what he's doing here.
He differentiate, differentiate
the law from promise,

116
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,780
which would be very odd
coming from a Jew at the time.

117
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,940
So separating off the law firm faith,

118
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:44,750
separating off the law firm promise is
counterintuitive in Jewish theology at

119
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:45,980
the time.
Uh,

120
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,040
and then what he also says is the law
came 350 years after God made his first

121
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:56,390
covenant with Abraham. Abraham just, I
mean, God justified Abraham by faith,

122
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,840
although he was circumcised
later with a circumcision,

123
00:06:59,841 --> 00:07:04,100
was not what justified him. Uh, it was his
faith that justified them, even Abraham.

124
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,980
So he takes all the way back to
the father of the Jews and says,

125
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,760
God made a covenant with Abraham.
The law came 350 years later.

126
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:15,350
So the law is a late comer in the whole
s and the whole system of how God was

127
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,650
dealing with people. Then look at what
he says in three 19 right after that.

128
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,070
Why then the law, in other words, if
you had the covenant with Abraham,

129
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,010
why did the law come about anyway?

130
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,550
You didn't need the law to have the
covenant according to his theology.

131
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,750
So he says, why then the law, it
was added because of transgressions,

132
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,350
until the offspring would come to whom
the promise had been made and it was

133
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:40,700
ordained through angels by a mediator.
Now this is really weird.

134
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,280
The law came about for transgressions.
Now there's a way to,

135
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,790
uh, to a couple of days you
gotta understand this, did the,

136
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:54,110
and the way most modern Christians read
is the law came about to keep people

137
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,590
from sinning. You know what you're
not supposed to do by reading the Law?

138
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,140
So they'll all comes back to
keep you from transgressing.

139
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:04,490
But I don't think that's what Paul's
doing because price precisely in Romans

140
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:07,400
five 20 when he makes a similar statement,

141
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,900
it's very clear there that the law
came in to increase transgressions.

142
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,790
What he's saying here is somehow the law
came in after the comment was already

143
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:21,791
established and it was precisely brought
in through a much later and it was

144
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,790
added to increase sin in the world.

145
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:30,680
It's a very odd thing to say. Notice what
he also says. It was ordained by angels.

146
00:08:30,681 --> 00:08:33,710
I've talked about this before when
we talked about the speech of Steven.

147
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:38,600
Paul is saying that God even wasn't
the one who gave the law to Moses.

148
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,530
It was given by angels. What
he says, look guys, his, um,

149
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:49,100
it was ordained through angels by a
mediator will, who is the mediator? Moses.

150
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,290
Right now a mediator involves more
than one party, but God is one.

151
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,033
That's odd,

152
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,780
but it seems to express what would
have been sort of a legal theory in the

153
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:03,090
ancient world. For example, if you have,

154
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,750
if I want to sign a
contract with all of you,

155
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,970
we don't have to have a mediator.

156
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,900
You basically just choose one of you
or a committee of you to represent you.

157
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,850
And I represent myself. If I want
to sign a contract just with Jude,

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,640
then we don't need a mediator.
We just signed a contract together.

159
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,530
But if you have two groups of people
wanting to come to some kind of agreement

160
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,120
to have a contract,
a covenant,

161
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,200
you need a mediator who can be in the
middle and not represent either of their

162
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:36,150
interests, but be neutral.
So what he's saying is that
there's a mediator here, eh.

163
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,790
All the Jews know that,
that Moses was the mediator.

164
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,940
But if the contract was between God,

165
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,340
if the law was between
God and the Israelites,

166
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,310
you didn't have to have a mediator.
And he says,

167
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,530
that's precisely why they
had to have a mediary.

168
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,700
It wasn't between God and Israel.

169
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:53,670
That's it was between the
angels and the Israelites.

170
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,050
Notice how demoting this is
of a certain piety of the law.

171
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,840
You believe the law came 350
years after the covenant.

172
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,370
It was given by angels to Moses,
not even directly from God,

173
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,010
and it was given in
order to make sin worse,

174
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,500
not to make,
not to get rid of sin.

175
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,300
Look what he says in three 23 he's
digging himself deeper though he's saying

176
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:21,750
more and more negative
things about the Jewish law.

177
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,290
Three 23 before faith came,

178
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,340
we were imprisoned and guarded under
the law until faith would be revealed.

179
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,520
Now the law becomes a prison guard that
keeps humanity and he sees me talking

180
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:37,710
about all of humanity, not
just Jews. Somehow the law,

181
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:42,270
the Jewish law in put all of humanity
in prison and kept it there all those

182
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:45,240
years.
Look what he says in three 24 therefore,

183
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:48,030
the law was our disciplinarian
until Christ came,

184
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:50,460
so that we meet about might
be justified by faith. Well,

185
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:54,060
the word disciplinary
in there is that word,

186
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,500
the Greek word pedagogue.

187
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,040
Does anybody have pedagogue in your
Greek translation there at three 24

188
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,720
does anybody have a different translation
at three 24 then disciplinarian?

189
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,840
Yes, sir. In the back,

190
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:13,690
what does three 24
therefore the law was our,

191
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,310
okay. Was put in charge. So if someone
in charge it were first to the slave,

192
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:27,140
because these were almost always slaves
who took care of young boys when they

193
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:29,900
were going to school.
That a child would,

194
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,790
up to a certain age
would be into the care.

195
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:35,720
And obviously you were talking about upper
class people who had slaves and could

196
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,120
and would put their children in
the care of nurses and slaves.

197
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,270
The child had a very young age
would be under the care of a nurse,

198
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:46,070
but at a certain age, maybe five or
six, the child, the boy especially,

199
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,480
they would be put in charge of a slave
who basically was assigned to watch over

200
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:55,060
the kid. The pedagogue, contrary to the
way this has come English as pedagogue,

201
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,470
didn't refer primarily to the teacher
of the child. That was a different term.

202
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,790
The pedagogue was a slave who just
basically took care of the boy,

203
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,740
made sure the boy, uh, carried the kids,
uh, uh, books to school, had the tablets,

204
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:12,380
the wax tablets they wrote on and
that the blocks they wrote on, uh,

205
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,710
kept the kids stuff in a little Satchel.

206
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:19,360
And watch the kid took the kid to school
to make sure the kid got there safely

207
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,150
and make sure no older boys were bullies
or make sure the kid didn't get any

208
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:25,480
trouble and then stayed in school and sat,
maybe sat in the classroom.

209
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:28,540
I sat outside the classroom until school
was over, then took the kid back home,

210
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:32,350
make sure the kid did his homework. And
according to a lot of Greek literature,

211
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,560
pedagogues are not only are they slaves,
they're ugly.

212
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,970
We have lots and lots of artistic
representations of pedagogues in ancient

213
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:43,120
terracotta and that sort of thing.
And they're usually depicted as ugly,

214
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,830
stumped slaves and they're often depicted
as mean and cruel and they beat the

215
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:51,910
kids all the time.
So by calling the law a pedagogue here,

216
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,670
I don't think Paul is saying
that the law was our teacher.

217
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,510
I think what he's saying is
the law is that slave, uh,

218
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:02,830
surviving who kept us basically enslaved.
Remember he just said we're prisoners.

219
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,980
Look what he says in four three.

220
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,570
So with us,
when we were minors,

221
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,700
we were enslaved to the elemental
spirits of the cosmos of the world.

222
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,660
This term, elemental spirits goes back
to something I talked about previously.

223
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:25,780
I think it was in my lecture when I
talked about Steven's speech and x.

224
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,260
This is that Greek word strike chaos.

225
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,940
Okay, is a very, very big major Greek
word. It can use in all kinds of ways.

226
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,880
For one thing,
it just referred to ranks of soldiers.

227
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,700
If soldiers were lined
up in different ranks,

228
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,200
those ranks were strike Kia rose.
It could refer to all kinds of other rows.

229
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,670
It could refer to letters of an alphabet
that could be talked about is star k

230
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:54,690
because what you do,
you put them,

231
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,550
you put all the letters of
the alphabet in a row and you,

232
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,660
and there are different elements.

233
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:02,100
So Start Kia also can refer to what
we would call a chemical elements.

234
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:06,780
The element, the table of elements. Those
will be called star, Kia, and Greek.

235
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:09,870
So for example, they took wind, fire,

236
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:14,580
water and air are sometimes
there were other for earth.

237
00:14:14,581 --> 00:14:16,620
Sometimes you've heard this a theory,
right,

238
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:20,310
that the Greeks believed and ancient
people believe there were four fundamental

239
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,750
elements of all matter.
And those are sometimes they said six,

240
00:14:24,751 --> 00:14:27,090
sometimes eight, sometimes
others, but quite often they'd,

241
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,540
they'd settled on for classical elements
and they believe that everything was

242
00:14:30,541 --> 00:14:34,170
made up of some combination of
earth, fire, water, and air.

243
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,920
And so everything's some matter.
Those are the thicker stuff,

244
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:39,420
has more earth in it and less air.

245
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,550
The lighter stuff has more
air in it and less earth,

246
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,160
but all matter is made up
of these four elements.

247
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:48,150
So these elements
constitute the whole cosmos.

248
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,100
But what's really interesting is at least
a lot of people in the ancient world

249
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,580
believe that these also,

250
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,620
this term also referred to this sort of
angelic or demonic or godlike beings who

251
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:02,120
constitute the universe also.
And their words,

252
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:05,930
they didn't believe necessarily
that air was simply an ERT material.

253
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:10,100
It also was a god or some
kind of demonic being.

254
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,510
So,

255
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,620
or some people would say that each of
these different layers of the universe say

256
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:20,120
the layer that is earth or the layer
that is water or the layer that is air or

257
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:22,220
the top layer that is fire or ether,

258
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,610
that those are all
divine beings themselves.

259
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:28,730
Or they could talk about them as
being not divine beings themselves,

260
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:32,120
but being ruled by divine beings.
So they, even Jews for example,

261
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:36,890
would think that there were certain angels
who were in charge of different rows

262
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,040
of the universe. So for example, if
you, and this is what we talked about,

263
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:44,480
gnosticism, if you want it to go
to God according to some, uh, uh,

264
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,070
magical texts,
for example,

265
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:51,020
you had to figure out the tricks to go
through the different ranks of demons or

266
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:53,960
angels that lived in the
sky between you and God.

267
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,900
And one way to do that is to
learn secret pass a passwords.

268
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,650
So magical text I'll sign often will
give you what it looked like, passwords,

269
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:04,040
because we had this password.
And when your soul is flying up to God,

270
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:07,940
you can give the password to whatever
demon or angel is guarding different gates

271
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,050
between you and God.

272
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,550
So these steroid Kayah refers to elements
of the universe in a physical sense,

273
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:18,380
but it also refers to these spiritual
beings that rule the cosmos or even make

274
00:16:18,381 --> 00:16:20,990
up the stuff of the cosmos
and a lot of ancient thought,

275
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,760
but now notice what Paul is saying here.
When we were under the law,

276
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,550
we were enslaved to the elemental spirits
of the universe being under the laws

277
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,970
being enslaved to these and he says,

278
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,490
you want to go back to that
slavery but wait a minute,

279
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,810
what are the Galatians doing?

280
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:38,030
They're not saying we want
to go back and serve idols.

281
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,060
What Paul is saying is
when you serve idols,

282
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,690
you are actually serving the
strike chaos of the universe.

283
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,200
They weren't real gods, they were
fake gods. You just don't kind of,

284
00:16:48,201 --> 00:16:50,510
angelic beings are demonic beings.
Paul,

285
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,880
I think believed they were
real beings behind idols,

286
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,560
but they were demons or something like
that and the store k out were those the

287
00:16:57,561 --> 00:17:00,470
Galatians are not wanting to go
back to idol worship apparently.

288
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,360
What are they wanting to do?
They're just thinking, well,

289
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:05,150
we're going to keep the Jewish law,
but Paul,

290
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,080
not they equates keeping the Jewish law.

291
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:13,340
If you're a gentile with
going back to idolatry,

292
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:18,940
that is radical for any Jew in the
first century to equate law observance,

293
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:26,060
keeping kosher, being circumcised
with actually worshiping idols.

294
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:31,220
That's radical. And yet that's what
Paul is doing here in Galatians.

295
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:36,500
Noticing what he does know. I'd say
that because in four, eight he says,

296
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:38,690
formerly when you did not know God,

297
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,410
you were enslaved to beings
that are by nature are not gods,

298
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,680
that is your Insulite to demons or some
kind of other like being like that.

299
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,200
Now I have, or that you've come to
know God or rather to be known by God,

300
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,950
how can you turn back again to the
weak and beggarly strike chaos.

301
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,491
So he's,

302
00:17:56,491 --> 00:18:01,080
he's equating their attempt to keep
kosher or be circumcised with their

303
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,290
returning to idolatry. And then look
what he says in his little exit.

304
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:08,230
Jesus in for 21 here he has a
good 10 verses that are important.

305
00:18:08,231 --> 00:18:12,930
So I'm gonna read the whole 10 versus
tell me this is Galatians four 21 you who

306
00:18:12,931 --> 00:18:16,470
desire to be subject to the law.
We'll do not listen to the law.

307
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,060
So he's going to give you a little exit.

308
00:18:18,061 --> 00:18:21,690
Jesus here for it is written
that Abraham had two sons,

309
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,120
one by a slave woman and
the other by a free woman.

310
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:27,450
One the child of the slave was born
according to the flesh. The other,

311
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:30,120
the child of the free woman
was born through the promise.

312
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,410
Now this is an allegory.
These women are two covenants.

313
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:39,450
One woman in fact, his Hagar from Mount
Sinai bearing children for slavery.

314
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,733
Wait a minute,

315
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,370
Mount Hagar and Hagar
is the slave of Abraham,

316
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,600
not his wife.
Sarah is the wife of Abraham,

317
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,920
not as slave Isaac,
who then had Jacob,

318
00:18:55,921 --> 00:19:00,921
who had had Joseph and all the brothers
from whom the people of Israel came came

319
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:04,140
through Sarah,
not Hagar.

320
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,900
According to Jewish mythology, who are
the descendants of Hagar and Ishmael?

321
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:12,863
Pardon?

322
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,430
Who? Who are the, uh,
not Muslims but Arabs.

323
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,390
Yes. Cause not all Muslims, but
according to Jewish mythology,

324
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,690
Arabs are the ones who descend from
Hagar and Ishmael, not the Jews,

325
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,430
but Paul Equates Hagar with Mount Sinai,

326
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:35,590
which is the mountain from
which God Moses got the law.

327
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,580
Why does he see neck Hagar who
represents the non Jews with Sinai,

328
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,600
which represents the law. You would think
it would represent Sarah with Sinai.

329
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:48,760
Yeah.

330
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,250
Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia.

331
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:52,840
Okay.

332
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,950
And corresponds to the present Jerusalem.
The Jerusalem.

333
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,310
Sarah should correspond to Jerusalem.

334
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:02,390
Yeah,

335
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,790
for she is in slavery with her children,

336
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,680
but the other woman corresponds
to the Jerusalem above. Oh,

337
00:20:09,681 --> 00:20:13,490
and now he gets another Jerusalem. Now
there's some kind of heavenly Jerusalem.

338
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,760
That's what represented by Sarah.

339
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:22,370
She is free and she is our
mother for it is written.

340
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:23,900
Rejoice you child is one who bear.

341
00:20:23,901 --> 00:20:26,300
No children burst into song
and shout you who endure.

342
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:29,570
No birth pangs for the children of the
desolate woman are more numerous than the

343
00:20:29,571 --> 00:20:30,890
children are the one who was married.

344
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,250
Now you my friends are
children of promise like Isaac.

345
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,130
Now he's talking to gentiles
here he's not talking to Jews.

346
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:41,270
He's saying you gentiles are children
of promise. You're connected to Isaac.

347
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,760
But just as that time,

348
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:47,060
the child who was born according to the
flesh persecuted the child who was born

349
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:50,440
to the spirit. So it is
now also, wait a minute,

350
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,980
it seems like he's accusing the
Jews of persecuting non Jews.

351
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,840
Followers of Jesus.
What does the scripture say?

352
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:05,230
Drive out the slave and her child for
the child of the slave will not share the

353
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:07,900
inheritance with a child of
the free woman. So friends,

354
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:10,240
we are children not as a slave,
but other free woman.

355
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,840
Drive out the slave woman if
he's equated the slave woman,

356
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,850
Hagar with Mount Sinai,

357
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,970
with Jerusalem in Judea,

358
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,400
it seems like he's equating
the Hagar with the Jews,

359
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,320
at least the law observant Jews.
And he says, drive them out.

360
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,310
That is very radical now.

361
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,280
And then finally he ends up
later in chapter five, verse
four. Then I'll move on.

362
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:49,350
You who want to be justified by the law
have cut yourselves off from Christ.

363
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,320
You have fallen away from grace.

364
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,950
Notice he's not saying that you're going
to fall away from grace if you sin.

365
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,720
That doesn't seem to be the
problem. He's saying, if you,

366
00:22:04,721 --> 00:22:09,721
even if you gentile followers of Jesus
even attempt to keep the Jewish law,

367
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,370
you'll be cut off from the grace of God.
That's radical

368
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:22,030
and it's no wonder that all this
stuff got Paul into trouble. Now,

369
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:24,520
we don't know what happened with
Paul's letter to the Galatians.

370
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,120
We don't know whether he convinced them
that he was right and the other people

371
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:33,520
who are coming, uh, telling them, teaching
them to obey the law. We're wrong.

372
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,880
We don't have second Galatians
unfortunately, or any other letters.

373
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,010
It has been pointed out by some
scholars that Paul never talks about the

374
00:22:42,011 --> 00:22:45,910
collection that he later takes up,
which among his different churches,

375
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:49,360
which I'll talk about in a minute,
he never talks about that in Galatians,

376
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,500
nor does he ever mentioned the area
of Galatians again to any of his other

377
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:57,400
churches in other areas, and that's
led some people to suggest, well,

378
00:22:57,401 --> 00:23:02,401
maybe Paul lost the battle in the
churches of Galicia and therefore he just

379
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:06,220
didn't deal with him anymore. After that.
We have references in his other leg,

380
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,640
in his letters to churches
in a Kia like current.

381
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:11,770
We have referenced to his leg
to his churches in Macedonia.

382
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,630
We have referenced to churches in Ephesus.

383
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:16,720
We have referenced at different churches
that we know Paul founded churches,

384
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,320
but we don't ever have any reference
elsewhere to Galician so somebody would

385
00:23:20,321 --> 00:23:23,520
have said maybe he lost the battle.
Maybe he lost the argument in.

386
00:23:23,521 --> 00:23:26,110
That's why we don't hear any more about
it, but we don't know that for sure.

387
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:30,190
The letter though, if he Paul winter
on teaching this kind of stuff,

388
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:34,870
it clearly though got him in trouble with
other people who just thought not only

389
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,480
was this wrong,
but it sounded antinomian.

390
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,100
It sounded anti law in general.
And that leads us to Romans.

391
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,660
So now turn over to Romans.

392
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,600
Romans isn't written in a
very different situation,

393
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:52,601
but let's first just see what just Paul
tell us what does Romans tells us about

394
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,750
Paul's reputation with regard to the law.

395
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,170
Look in Romans three eight

396
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:01,783
okay.

397
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,760
Now in chapter three he's talking
about a lot of different things about

398
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:14,990
justification by faith, apart
from law, but just in verse eight,

399
00:24:14,991 --> 00:24:15,920
I'm just going to take a clue at her.

400
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:20,921
But why not say as some people
slander us by saying that we say,

401
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,330
let us do evil. That good may come.
Their condemnation is deserved.

402
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,660
Ah,
Paul denies the charge,

403
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,950
but is it very hard to imagine why some
people who may have heard about the

404
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:35,510
kinds of stuff he says about the law,

405
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,800
the law was brought into increased
transgression and then transgression

406
00:24:39,801 --> 00:24:42,110
increased so that God could
have more grace and mercy.

407
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,340
Doesn't that sound like Paul is saying,
let us do evil. So that good may come.

408
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,380
Apparently some people thought it did.

409
00:24:48,381 --> 00:24:51,410
So Paul brings up the
charge and denies it,

410
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:54,320
but it shows that Paul had
already developed by this time,

411
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,460
some kind of Antinomian reputation.
Notice what he says in Romans six

412
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:03,560
six chapter.
What then are we to say,

413
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,010
should we continue in sin in
order that Grace May abound?

414
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,770
It sounds like that would be
the logical outcome. Paul,

415
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,660
you've just said several times
that as sin increased in the world,

416
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:17,870
grace increases more.
So let's send,

417
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,190
we're not saved by doing good anyway.
We're not saved by following the law,

418
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,950
so let's just ignore the law
and sin and grace will abound.

419
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,850
Paul again seems to be echoing something
that could have been very logical

420
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,290
charge against him. How does he
answer it? By no means, how can we,

421
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:36,860
who have been heck, can we who
died to sin, go on living in it.

422
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,820
But here he goes on to answer the charge
and the rest of chapter six by saying,

423
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:42,920
by coming,
by being bed peasant to Christ,

424
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,340
you have so vacated
the whole realm of sin,

425
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:50,720
that it's inconceivable that you could go
back to it as long as you're in Christ,

426
00:25:50,721 --> 00:25:53,360
you can have nothing to do with
the whole world of sin. So he,

427
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,650
he gets rid of that charge.

428
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,700
But we can see that some people saw that
there was a logical connection between

429
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,070
some of the things did and
said in places like Galicia.

430
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:06,350
So he has to deny he does the same thing
in six 15. What then should we sin?

431
00:26:06,351 --> 00:26:09,530
Because we are not under law, but under
grace. He says, no, no, no, no, no,

432
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:11,840
no by no means.
That's not what I mean.

433
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,080
But you can see how he got the accusation.

434
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:18,650
And then, uh, in three 20,

435
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:20,600
some of the other places he
talks about the law in Romans,

436
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:29,200
for no human being will be justified in
his sight by deeds prescribed by the law

437
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,340
for though the law for through the
law comes knowledge of Sin. Ah,

438
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,610
so you can hear Paul's gears working.

439
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,480
He's trying to nuance some of the
things he's saying about the law to too.

440
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:47,550
So doesn't sound quite as radical as
he had sounded in Galatians entity may

441
00:26:47,551 --> 00:26:50,730
likely have sounded elsewhere. So right
here say he admits there for that.

442
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:54,540
Well the law is good for some things
through the law came knowledge of Sin.

443
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:59,580
So that's, that's a good thing. Look what
he says in three 21 right below that.

444
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,800
But now apart from law,
the righteousness,

445
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,120
righteousness of God has been disclosed
and it is a tested by the law and the

446
00:27:09,121 --> 00:27:13,080
prophets. Ah, so both the
Torah, the law and the prophets,

447
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:16,920
at least bears witness to
the righteousness of God.

448
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,760
Because if you'll notice throughout
both Galatians and Romans,

449
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:25,800
Paul quotes Jewish scripture more than
it is in any of his other letters is

450
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:29,440
precisely when Paul's dealing
with problem of what is the name,

451
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:34,470
what is the relationship between non
Jews to Jewish law that Paul actually

452
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:38,730
quotes Jewish scripture the most?
And that's in Galatians and Romans.

453
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,800
So here he's saying,

454
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:44,810
he's saying we can look at the law and
the prophets to learn about this doctrine

455
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:49,740
of righteousness that I'm now saying to
you, because the law will attest to it.

456
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,870
It's a much more positive view, the law.
And he also says, we uphold the law,

457
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:58,560
uh, by this, by doing
this, uh, look at, um,

458
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,480
yes, it's three 28. Uh, look at three
27. Then what becomes a boasting?

459
00:28:08,481 --> 00:28:11,180
It is excluded by what law? By that
of works. No, but by the law of faith,

460
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,310
for we hold that a person
is justified by faith,

461
00:28:13,311 --> 00:28:16,620
apart from works prescribed by law or
as God that [inaudible] Thee is God the

462
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:20,420
God of the Jews only is he not got
her gentiles. Yes. Also gentiles,

463
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:22,580
since God is one,
but the last verse of that chapter,

464
00:28:22,581 --> 00:28:24,980
do we then overthrow
the law by this faith?

465
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,460
You would have thought from things that
he said in Galatians that the answer to

466
00:28:28,461 --> 00:28:33,450
that would be yes. By no
means. On the contrary,

467
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,500
we uphold the law.
And then look,

468
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:41,460
one more place here. Seven,
12, Romans seven, 12.

469
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,053
Okay.

470
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,080
Uh, he says backup one,
verse two, verse 11, for sin,

471
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:55,240
seizing an opportunity in the commandment
deceived me and through it killed me.

472
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,700
So notice what happens here.

473
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,660
Sin Is talked about this as
this agent of the cosmos.

474
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:04,090
Sin is almost like one of
these sort of strike kr,

475
00:29:04,091 --> 00:29:05,770
kind of like an intelligent being.

476
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,350
This is actually a debate
among scholars of Paul.

477
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:13,530
Some people really believe that sin is
a high pasta ticed intelligent being of

478
00:29:15,761 --> 00:29:19,090
some sort in the cosmos.
Other people say, no, no.

479
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:22,270
Paul's talking metaphorically when
he talks about sin and these words,

480
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,540
and we need to see sin,
uh,

481
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:28,720
not as this actual hypothesize being,
but simply a metaphor.

482
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,310
Metaphorized as of being.

483
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:35,230
So scholars themselves debate about what
Paul means when he talks about sin as

484
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,064
this agent,

485
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:40,840
but at least he talks about sin as the
agent who uses the commandment uses the,

486
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,840
um, where was I at? Seven. 2012.

487
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:51,940
Yep. Okay. Where was
I? We're just reading.

488
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,790
Okay.

489
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,820
Seven 11. Yes. Sin. Seizing an
opportunity. The commandment.

490
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,320
So sin uses the commandment to,
to see the human beings and kill them.

491
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,810
Paul's not talking about
himself personally. Here,

492
00:30:03,811 --> 00:30:07,620
he's talking about himself
as representative. All
human beings today says,

493
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:11,550
so the law is holy and the
commandment is holy, ingesting good.

494
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,360
Doesn't it strike you that that is that
little addition of verse 12 doesn't seem

495
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,910
to follow so logically from verse 11

496
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,520
how can the lobby holy ingesting
good if it's deceiving people?

497
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:34,260
That part clearly going on as Paul is
backing off the more radical things he

498
00:30:34,261 --> 00:30:38,160
said about the law and trying to nuance
this, and that's the question I'll ask.

499
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:41,340
So let's read the rest of that for
we know that the law is spiritual,

500
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,890
but I'm of the flesh is verse
14 sold into slavery under sin.

501
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:51,090
I didn't understand my own actions
for I do not do what I want.

502
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,210
I do the very thing I hate.
Now, if I do what I do not want,

503
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,750
I agree that the law is good,
but in fact it is no longer I that do it,

504
00:30:57,751 --> 00:31:01,770
but sin that dwells in me for I know that
nothing good dwells within me that is

505
00:31:01,771 --> 00:31:05,370
in my flesh. I can will what is
right, but I cannot do it for,

506
00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:09,690
I do not do the good I want, but the
evil I do not want is what I do. Now.

507
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:12,330
If I do what I do not want,
it is no longer I that do it,

508
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:13,770
but sin that lives within me.

509
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:17,640
So I find it to be a law that
when I want to do what is good,

510
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:22,790
evil lies close at hand for I delight
in the law of God in my inmost self.

511
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:26,730
But I see in my members another law
at work with the law of my mind,

512
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:30,720
making me captain for the law of
sin that dwells in my members. Well,

513
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:33,810
all of that is very confusing
and if you want to get a phd,

514
00:31:33,811 --> 00:31:36,570
you can do the x Jesus off
it for the rest of your life.

515
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:41,460
But the main thing I'm pointing out here
is that Paul is being very careful to

516
00:31:41,461 --> 00:31:46,461
nuance a straight forwardly negative
depiction of Jewish law and say that,

517
00:31:47,551 --> 00:31:50,790
well, it's still good. In
a sense it still is true.

518
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:55,910
It's still holy and he's doing this
because I think he knows that he's got a

519
00:31:56,941 --> 00:32:00,390
reputation as being anti
law and being antinomian.

520
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,830
So why these differences between
Romans and Galatians? Well,

521
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,950
we need to understand a little more
about the Roman situation first.

522
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,070
Paul did not found the church in Rome.

523
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:15,510
It grew up on it's own by other people.
According to church tradition, Pete,

524
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,830
according to Roman Catholic tradition,

525
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:19,470
Peter the Apostle Peter
founded the church in Rome.

526
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:24,210
But that's tradition and we don't have
any historical data to really prove it.

527
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,320
But, and I personally believe that
probably the church in Rome was started by

528
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,810
anonymous Jews who happened
to hear about Jesus and,

529
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:36,050
and went to Rome and then started a
little house groups of Jesus' followers on

530
00:32:37,621 --> 00:32:41,840
their own. And then apostles later, just
like Paul seems to have gone there later.

531
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,090
But the Roman church at the pint time,

532
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:49,091
Paul is writing this letter is by this
time no longer a purely Jewish group.

533
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,670
They now seem to be predominantly Jen
pile with some Jews in the churches in

534
00:32:55,671 --> 00:32:56,570
Rome also.
And remember,

535
00:32:56,571 --> 00:32:58,910
we're not talking about one church
building or even one house church.

536
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,610
We're talking about probably several
different house churches that met in

537
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:04,730
different people's houses or in their
apartments and tenements and these sorts

538
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:08,210
of things. So maybe some of them
had more Jews in them than others.

539
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,230
But the overall church in Rome
is by now apparently gen pile.

540
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:17,210
And when Paul writes Romans,
he directs his rhetoric to gentiles.

541
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,740
He does say hello to some Jews in
the last chapter. He greets them, uh,

542
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:25,490
Jews who are there that he knows. But if
you look through the rhetoric of Romans,

543
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:29,750
more and more of US scholars are convinced
that the main recipients of Paul's

544
00:33:29,751 --> 00:33:33,320
rhetoric is supposed to be
gentile believers in Jesus.

545
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:38,570
So what, why does Paul write this letter?
Letter? Several different reasons.

546
00:33:38,571 --> 00:33:40,070
Not just one.
For one thing,

547
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,640
he can't write like he's written most of
his other letters as talking to a group

548
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:48,080
he founded. He can't talk about himself
as their father in the faith in that way,

549
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:53,200
he can't set his ups up as their apostle
in a straightforward way because he's

550
00:33:53,391 --> 00:33:56,900
never been there at this point.
He didn't found the churches there.

551
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:00,730
So he's writing a letter. This one of the
very, very few things we have of him. Uh,

552
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,020
the only a letter perhaps
where he writes to a church,

553
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:07,820
a letter to a church that he himself
didn't found. So that's important.

554
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:12,800
So what do we find out? Why is he
writing it? Look at 15, Romans 15,

555
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:13,634
22.

556
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:24,030
This is the reason I have so often
been hindered from coming to you.

557
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,560
So he's wanting to go to Rome,

558
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,070
but now with no further place
for me in these regions,

559
00:34:29,071 --> 00:34:34,071
I desire as I have for many years to
come to you when I go to Spain for,

560
00:34:34,591 --> 00:34:38,460
I do hope to see you on my journey and
to be sent on by you once I have enjoyed

561
00:34:38,461 --> 00:34:39,810
your company for a little while.

562
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:43,740
Paul sees himself as the
apostle to the gentiles,

563
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:48,420
as Peter was the apostle to
the Jews. So why not? I mean,

564
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:50,520
he didn't found the church there,
but if he,

565
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:54,300
he believes that he's already done
all this missionizing in Asia Minor.

566
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:57,330
And Greece is kind of ironic for Paul
to say this because what did he actually

567
00:34:57,331 --> 00:35:00,630
done? Christianity wasn't
this big movement with
thousands of people everywhere.

568
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:03,030
It wasn't even like there was a
Christian Church and each city or town,

569
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,620
but Paul seems to act like these, he's
done everything you can in the east. Yep.

570
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:11,580
Everything in Greece and you know, Asia
Minor. My churches are all doing great.

571
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:16,530
I gotta get Outta here. My work here is
done. And so he's taken off to the west.

572
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:21,210
It's kind of exaggerating, I think just
exactly what he's, he's accomplished.

573
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,620
But in his mind, by planting a few, you
know, house churches in major cities,

574
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:30,360
he's sort of done the first
job of evangelization that
he saw himself called by

575
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:32,280
God and sent out to do.
So.

576
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:35,970
Now he's looking to the west
and he wants to go to Spain. Uh,

577
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:40,620
and so he's gonna stop in Rome. No
sizes. I want you to send me on that.

578
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:43,080
Greek actually means
that he's asking them,

579
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:46,950
he's going to ask them for
financial contribution.
Sending him along is not just,

580
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:51,070
Hey Paul, don't let the door hit
your butt on the way out. It's a,

581
00:35:51,071 --> 00:35:54,360
it's sitting him along with money.
So what he's doing is saying,

582
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,060
I want a little contribution from you,

583
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:02,120
so I want some support from you both
symbolic support and financial support.

584
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:07,020
So that's what he's writing to them to
talk about is further mission to Spain.

585
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,310
He's writing him also because Rome is
the center of the Earth for uh, you know,

586
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,690
the Romans and for many people.

587
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,410
And so he's the apostle to the
gentiles or the whole earth.

588
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,460
So what more likely place for him to go
than to Rome at least sometime on his

589
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:24,510
way to Spain. So that's one thing
he's doing. Look also at, um,

590
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,380
we'll keep reading there at 15,

591
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:33,381
22 for I do hope can see
a verse 25 at present,

592
00:36:33,871 --> 00:36:38,190
however, I'm going to Jerusalem
in a ministry to the saints,

593
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,910
a liturgy.
He's,

594
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,820
he's taking some help to what he
calls the saints in Jerusalem.

595
00:36:44,821 --> 00:36:49,770
The sanctus means the holy ones. He's
probably talking about believing Jews,

596
00:36:49,771 --> 00:36:52,950
Jews, and Judy and Jerusalem who
believe that Jesus is the Messiah.

597
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:58,250
So he's taking them some kind of a
help too for Macedonia and Acadia.

598
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,430
Remember the where his churches and Philip
Pie and Fessel, Annika and Macedonia.

599
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:06,030
His church in Corinth is
in a Kia master and a k.

600
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:09,780
I have been pleased to share their
research sources with the poor among the

601
00:37:09,781 --> 00:37:10,830
saints in Jerusalem.

602
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:14,220
They were pleased to do this and indeed
they owed to them for if the gentiles

603
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:16,230
have come to share in
their spiritual blessings,

604
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:19,110
they also ought to be of service
to them in material things.

605
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:22,830
So he's taking money that he's been
collecting in his different churches that

606
00:37:22,831 --> 00:37:26,720
are gentile churches. Pat Back
as a gift to the poor, uh,

607
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,620
followers of Jesus in Jerusalem,
the Jews.

608
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,980
So when I have completed
this and if delivered to them
what was being collected,

609
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:35,130
I will set out by way of you to Spain.
And I know that when I come,

610
00:37:35,131 --> 00:37:37,350
I will come in the fullness
of the blessing of Christ.

611
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:41,310
This collection was much
more important to Paul then.

612
00:37:41,311 --> 00:37:44,140
A lot of modern Christians seem to
think it's just kind of, you know, Oh,

613
00:37:44,141 --> 00:37:45,660
well all churches take up money.

614
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:51,380
But remember Paul had agreed when
he met in Jerusalem with Peter,

615
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,440
James and John and other people that he
would go to the gentiles and they didn't

616
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:57,870
have to circumcise it installs.
Peter would go to the Jews,

617
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,690
but the one thing they
said is remember the poor.

618
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,800
And so this was interpreted that in the
different churches that Paul founded

619
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,310
among non Jews,

620
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:12,780
he would continue to take up financial
contributions to send back to Jerusalem.

621
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:15,510
This was partly just of
course they were poor there,

622
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:20,511
but it's also apparently seen by
Paul as very symbolically important.

623
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,930
The giving of money from
the gentile churches to the
Jerusalem churches would be

624
00:38:24,931 --> 00:38:26,610
an acknowledgement by them,

625
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,630
by the gentiles of the
somewhat superiority,

626
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:35,160
at least in time in the Gospel,
they got their Gospel from the Jews.

627
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:40,090
It's an acknowledgement of the importance
in this [inaudible] of Jews in the

628
00:38:40,091 --> 00:38:44,560
Jesus movement by gentiles
and it's also reciprocal.

629
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,790
Remember I talked about,

630
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,840
we've talked about the
patron client structures and
we've talked about gifts and

631
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:52,450
people giving things to other
people in the ancient world.

632
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:55,780
The whole Patriot constructs, we very
much centered around giving and receiving.

633
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,870
So if I give you something,
you're indebted to me.

634
00:38:58,871 --> 00:39:02,680
And if you don't want to be shamed,
you have to give something back to me.

635
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,270
So giving and receiving is always a
very important issue with status and

636
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:09,430
relationships and friendships
in the ancient world,

637
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,790
whether you're talking about equals our
people on different social statuses.

638
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:16,780
So Paul, setting up the relationship
between the Jerusalem, the Judy churches,

639
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:20,620
predominantly gentile and his gentile
churches that he's founded as a,

640
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,590
something like a patron client structure
where the Jews gave the gentile

641
00:39:24,591 --> 00:39:26,290
something,
the Gospel.

642
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,060
Now the gentiles owe it to the Jewish
followers to give them something.

643
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:33,460
So he's taking this collection.
So Paul has,

644
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,980
he's talked about this collection
and several of his letters.

645
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,330
It's been very important to him. And so
he's on his way to Jerusalem to do this.

646
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,780
But now notice what happens.
We don't. We know about,

647
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:47,710
a little bit about Paul's last trip
to Jerusalem as it's depicted in acts.

648
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,100
How does acts portrayed?
This? Paul goes to Jerusalem.

649
00:39:51,101 --> 00:39:54,360
He's got some gentiles with him. He's
got some other dudes with him. He's in,

650
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,310
he goes to the temple purely
to pray to be a good Jew.

651
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,730
Other people not believing Jews see them
there and they think that he's trying

652
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:04,040
to bring gentiles into the
temple. So he's arrested. Uh,

653
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:08,380
he tried and then he has to eventually
appeal to Caesar to get to Rome.

654
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,950
What does acs tell us
about the collection?

655
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,530
What happened to the collection in acts?

656
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:20,800
We don't know.
The writer of acts

657
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:24,160
may have known about this collection.

658
00:40:24,161 --> 00:40:26,950
It was certainly one of the most
important things to Paul and his ministry.

659
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,860
The writer of acts tells us nothing.
Notice also,

660
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,830
Paul seems to be a little nervous
if you read between the lines,

661
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,270
because what happens if he's collected
all this money and he takes it to

662
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:40,480
Jerusalem and the Jewish leaders say,
Paul,

663
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,510
do you know what kind of rumors had been
flying about what you're saying about

664
00:40:43,511 --> 00:40:46,600
the law?
Do you know what we've heard?

665
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,030
We're not going to take your money.

666
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,050
We're not going to
justify your activities.

667
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,840
I think Paul was concerned that the
Jerusalem churches wouldn't take his money

668
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:05,250
and that would be catastrophic for his
vision of having a United church that

669
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:07,390
included both Jews and gentiles.

670
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,800
He writes to the Romans partly
because he'd go into his painting,

671
00:41:11,801 --> 00:41:15,270
he wants to start, you know, uh, um,

672
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:18,400
prepare the ground for a
trip to Rome and the Spain.

673
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:23,580
But also he goes so careful to explain
what he really believes about the law and

674
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:29,671
justification because I think he's
afraid of what may happen in Jerusalem.

675
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:35,090
He's in a sense trying to get the Roman
Christians on his side before his trip

676
00:41:35,091 --> 00:41:35,924
to Jerusalem.

677
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:40,820
And that takes us to what's become
a new interpretation of Romans.

678
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:44,480
I'm going to do this quickly and we can
talk about it maybe more after the break,

679
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:49,190
but the traditional interpretation
of Romans was that this was Paul's

680
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,660
theological treatise.

681
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,180
It didn't have much of anything
to do with the circumstances.

682
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,130
Paul just kind of decided
he's going to go, go to Rome.

683
00:41:55,131 --> 00:41:59,090
So he sits down and he says,
what's really my Gospel in 16 chapters?

684
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:01,040
And he writes it up.

685
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,210
He sends it to the churches in Rome
to present my gospel to them. This is,

686
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,020
this is sort of a,

687
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:10,130
a theological treatise and the main
point of the treatise is you're not

688
00:42:10,131 --> 00:42:12,770
justified by works of law,
by any works.

689
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,580
No matter which law you're justified
by grace through faith alone.

690
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,630
So the big Protestant, the Lutheran,
the Calvinist reading of Romans,

691
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,740
set Romans as the center book
of the Bible and start that.

692
00:42:24,741 --> 00:42:28,580
What it's mainly about is individual
salvation, your personal salvation.

693
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:32,300
You need to recognize that you won't be
saved by your works, by anything you do.

694
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,980
Not only,
you're not say by Jewish law,

695
00:42:33,981 --> 00:42:36,410
you're not say by Roman Catholic
rules or not say by any law.

696
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,990
You're saved by putting
your faith in Jesus,

697
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:42,650
having accepting Jesus as your Lord and
personal savior or something like that.

698
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:46,460
And it's individual salvation and it's
a doctrine of individuals have Asian by

699
00:42:46,461 --> 00:42:50,000
faith. That's the reason Paul wrote Romans
and that's what the central messages,

700
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:54,050
very individualistic, very
doctrinal, very theological.

701
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:58,610
That reading of Romans has been severely
challenged in the last 40 years or so.

702
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,780
Now people are starting to say it's not
the first few chapters of Romans that

703
00:43:02,781 --> 00:43:04,490
constitute the most
important part of Romans,

704
00:43:04,491 --> 00:43:07,190
which has always been the
process interpretation cause
that's where Paul talks.

705
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:11,570
Dot Tryon only about justification
by faith. Scholars have said,

706
00:43:11,571 --> 00:43:16,571
now look to the end of Romans chapters
nine to 11 the latter part of Romans.

707
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:20,360
That's where you'll see what
the real point of Romans is.

708
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,490
And it's not about individual salvation,

709
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:26,780
it's about the relationship between the
nations. When I say gentiles number,

710
00:43:26,781 --> 00:43:29,930
that's just a term that Jews used for
all the nations except themselves.

711
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,950
So I want to say the nations, I mean all
non Jewish people's in ancient world,

712
00:43:33,951 --> 00:43:35,120
that's the way the gent
tells you the term.

713
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:40,240
And in fact gentiles is just sort of a
Latinized translation of the Greek word

714
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:45,050
nations. So when you see gentiles
in Paul's text, read nations,

715
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,970
we referred to the non Jewish nations.

716
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,630
What's the relationship of the nations
to Israel and the God of Israel?

717
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:51,950
Look at a few places.

718
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:57,470
In chapter nine Paul basically
gives this apocalyptic expectation,

719
00:43:57,471 --> 00:44:02,300
even quotes Hosea saying, the people
who are not my people will be my people.

720
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:03,891
In other words,
again,

721
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:08,891
Paul is quoting Jewish scripture to
enforce his belief that at the end of time

722
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:12,050
gentiles would become people of God.

723
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:14,330
And this was common in
Jewish apocalyptic idea.

724
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:17,750
The basic scenario was the messiah
is going to come at the end,

725
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:20,660
the Messiah will bring in,

726
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:25,520
will overthrow the oppressors of the Jews
and the Messiah will bring in all the

727
00:44:25,521 --> 00:44:28,370
other nations, all the nations,
the Egyptians, the Greeks,

728
00:44:28,371 --> 00:44:31,770
the Romans will all come to the
temple. In Jerusalem, they'll gifts,

729
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:35,580
they'll all worship the god of Israel.
And you find this in Isaiah,

730
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:40,200
you find it in Hosea. So Jewish scripture
itself gave Jews appalls Paul's Day.

731
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:45,000
The idea that the apocalyptic end would
bring all the nations in the Osi had

732
00:44:45,001 --> 00:44:48,840
already come for Paul. So that's why
he sees himself as going to get the,

733
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:53,990
the gentiles in his whole mission
is part of this end time scenario.

734
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:59,220
So what does that mean? Look at Romans
1113 I'm speaking to you gentiles.

735
00:44:59,221 --> 00:45:01,860
So he turns directly to
the Romans in as much.

736
00:45:01,861 --> 00:45:03,300
Then as I'm an apostle to the gentiles,

737
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:07,140
I glorify my an industry in order to
make my own people jealous and thus save

738
00:45:07,141 --> 00:45:10,620
some of them for if their objection
is the reconciliation of the world,

739
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,960
what will their acceptance be?
But life from the dead.

740
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:18,260
If the part of the doe offered is as first
fruit is holy than the whole batch is

741
00:45:18,511 --> 00:45:20,940
holy. If the root is hold it
in, the branches are also holy.

742
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:24,420
So Paul gives a theology here
of the remnant, not some of it.

743
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:27,210
A lot of the Jews have not
accepted that Jesus the Messiah.

744
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,280
Therefore they seem to be cut off.

745
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:32,850
They're like branches of an olive tree
that are cut off and the gentiles who are

746
00:45:32,851 --> 00:45:36,510
not natural branches of the dollar tree
had been grafted in their place that

747
00:45:36,511 --> 00:45:39,810
needs they're part of Israel now,
but notice what this means

748
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:45,090
so that you may not claim to be wiser
than you are brothers and sisters.

749
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:49,410
I want you to understand this mystery.
A hardening has come upon part of Israel.

750
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:54,900
Some of the Jews don't believe until
the full number of the gentiles has come

751
00:45:54,901 --> 00:45:58,530
in. That's his job is trying to bring
in the full number of the gentiles,

752
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:03,510
and so all Israel will be saved.
Wow.

753
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,310
All Israel. Notice he doesn't
explain how this happens,

754
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:13,530
but in Romans nine through 11 Paul
presents this magnificent scenario that he

755
00:46:13,531 --> 00:46:16,320
believes was prophesied in
Jewish scripture itself,

756
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:19,860
that at the end of this cosmos,
the end of this world,

757
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:22,920
the Messiah would come overthrow
the oppressors of the Jews,

758
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:27,030
set up Jerusalem as the center of
the earth, and then all the gentiles,

759
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:28,950
all the nations would
come to the god of Israel.

760
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:32,490
They would be grafted in
to the nation of Israel.

761
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:34,320
They would worship the god of Israel.

762
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:40,110
Paul's addition to this myth is simply
that you don't need to keep the law in

763
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:40,944
order to do this.

764
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:45,870
So all the pulse about the law
is secondary to his main point,

765
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:48,030
which is you're now part of Israel.

766
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:52,020
Paul is not about starting a new religion.

767
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:57,300
There's no Christianity and Paul,
there are no Christians in Paul's letters.

768
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,150
You can't find the word.
You can't find the concept.

769
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:03,240
There is no Christianity or
Christians in Paul's world.

770
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:08,460
He believed that he was the apostle to
the gentiles to bring them into Israel,

771
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,830
to make the gentiles part of Israel.
And then as he says right here,

772
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,410
most widely along,
he somehow believes,

773
00:47:16,411 --> 00:47:17,820
although he doesn't tell us
how it's going to happen,

774
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:22,980
that somehow God and God's miraculous
mercy is going to figure out a way in the

775
00:47:22,981 --> 00:47:25,830
end to even bring all of Israel back in.
Also,

776
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,440
all Israel, he says, we'll be saved.

777
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:34,750
Paul is not necessarily the
first Christian theologian.

778
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,560
He's one of the most radical Jewish
theologians in the ancient world.

779
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:46,800
Okay, we'll stop now and
papers will be handed out. Yup.

780
00:47:46,801 --> 00:47:48,070
Come up here to handle the papers.
