[ Silence ]

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.840
&gt;&gt; On behalf of the
audience thank you.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:32.710
[ Applause ]

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.000
&gt;&gt; And my first question
to you Jason is

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.510
when exactly did you sell
your soul to the devil?

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.080

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.380
Jason Robert Brown

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.120
&gt;&gt; The real question is
what did I get in exchange?

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.260
No, you know, I started, I started
playing, I begged my parents

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.100
for a piano when I was 7 I think.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.440
And I have no musicians in
my family that's not sort

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.530
of part of the family tree.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.040
We have no artists anywhere or at
least no actual artists anywhere.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.990 position:56%
And, but I said I wanted a piano and
my grandfather was sort of a hoarder

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.350
and he had them in his basement
and he had an old upright

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.140
in his basement which they
sort of brushed up a little bit

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.040
and one day I came into my
living room and there it was.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.750 position:56%
And so I sat down and started trying
to figure out how to play the thing

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.400 position:56%
from Star Wars or something that
was kind of, that was that you know,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.260
what I always say is, I was
the second child and as anyone

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.280 position:56%
who is a second child or especially
anyone who is the first child knows,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.840 position:56%
you know, that means all I'm trying
to do all the time is get attention.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.970
And so, you know, I was working
from a very early age to make sure

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.290
that people noticed me, so this
turned out to be the way to do it.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.350
&gt;&gt; Did you start piano
lessons then or you?

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.650
Jason Robert Brown

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.950
&gt;&gt; I did, but only in the
most sort of rudimentary way,

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.510
because I wouldn't practice
because it wasn't gratifying.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.140
[ Laughter ]

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.910
Uh-huh. And so I you know, I
took lessons for 3 or 4 years

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.690
but I never got to
any particular level.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.580
I was sort of on you know the
John Brimhall book 3 and you know,

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.910
it was sort of you know, everyone
rolling their eyes every week.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.970
But while I while I was doing
that I was also writing songs

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.820
and I would sit and write
songs and play in my own sort

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.460
of crazy idiosyncratic
way and do that.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.880
So that I kind of then, my mother
was like well I'm not going

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.520
to keep paying for lessons if
you're never going to practice.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.430
So I just kept playing
and playing and playing,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.650
but I never was doing it
according to the books and I sort

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.970
of got self-taught as far as
theory and how to read charts

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.560
and chords and things like that.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.800
And then right when I was about
to graduate from high school,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.660
my mother said well what is
it you're planning to do?

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.010 position:56%
I said, well I have to go to a music
school of course that's what I do.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.100
And she said, well it would help
if you could read music probably,

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.250
that would, that might be
valuable and we sort of shoved me

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.010
into piano lessons for the last
year of high school and I sort

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.640
of crammed, how to figure out how
to integrate what I knew how to do

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.220
with what actually was on the page.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.400
And I'm still not sensational
with the page

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.680
but I'm obviously a
lot better than I was.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.190
&gt;&gt; I think there are a lot of sort

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.020 position:56%
of aspiring musical theater
performers and writers here and ones

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.830
who are beyond aspiring, but I.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.130
Jason Robert Brown

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.430
&gt;&gt; In both senses that way.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.040
&gt;&gt; In both senses of the word.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.220
I'm just fascinated about
how you guys work together.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.780
I was able to watch a little
bit of your rehearsal before.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.720
How do you evolve this
relationship and is there,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.260
it's sort of like there's almost
a psychic connection there

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.960
of how you know reading each other

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.340
and how you're going
to work together.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.660
Jason Robert Brown

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.030
&gt;&gt; I mean on my end,
really my belief is

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.450
that when you find the people
who connects to your material

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.210
and who you connect to musically,

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.460
the best thing you can do
is let them go do their job.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.590
So, it's I don't sort of,
I don't think Shoshana

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.480
and I have ever had a rehearsal
where we sit and I sort

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.440 position:56%
of micromanage the phrasing and sort

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.090
of say oh it should
be this and that.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.040
Often what happens is
exactly what you saw today

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.030
where she's learned the song
from a recording that I send her

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.980
or something like that and then we
have like 20 minutes before the gig

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.280 position:56%
and I'm like all right let's try it.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.120
I might say one thing about oh,
no-no that's E flat not E natural

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.820
and she'll be like ahh, that'll
be the entirety of our rehearsal.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.940
But, but it's, that's as much
as that's been the entirety

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.550
of our rehearsal, it's also one

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.340
of my favorite collaborations
in my life.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.480
And whenever I can
sing with Shoshana I do

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.920
because she just gets the material.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.320
And so I don't have to say oh
no the phrase should go this way

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.460 position:56%
or what I meant for that, what
that's supposed to mean acting wise.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.990 position:56%
She gets it, she does it, she brings
herself to it and then I can get

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.720
out of the way, so
that's, that's my response.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.770
You? Shoshana Bean

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I think, well it took me a number
of years to get out of the way

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.230
and just let the, let
our connection be there

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.360
and let the music does it for you.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.370 position:56%
But I was so terrified of him and so
wanting to please him and so wanting

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.470
to do his incredible music justice
that I think it was just kind

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.790
of not stale but just a little
stiff and terrifying for me.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.630
I don't know how it came across
but it was terrifying and then.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.100
&gt;&gt; Jason Robert Brown

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.900
&gt;&gt; You were fine huh?

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.040
[ Laughter &amp; Applause ]

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.340
Shoshana Bean

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.210
&gt;&gt; The gift for me
is, it's very rare

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.980 position:56%
that you come across, thank you sir.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.280
Psychic connection.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.030
You see how that works?

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:19.020
That you as a singer or just an
artist in general with something

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.250
to say or feelings that you come
across someone who articulates them

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.490
so perfectly and also writes so
perfectly for your instrument.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.360
And I think a lot of women
say that about Jason's work.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:37.260
But me in particular, I feel like
myself in particular, It's just,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.910
I think it's powerful connection to
his music and us together you know.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.360
So for me it was just
getting out of the way

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.630
and just letting the connection
be there and not be afraid of it.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.160
&gt;&gt; How do you set keys
and things like that

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.460
if you haven't rehearsed it?

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.760
Shoshana Bean

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.060
&gt;&gt; That's the magic of him.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.360
He just knows, I've never gone to
him and been like this is too high

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.800
or this sits in a weird place.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.680
There are very few male
composers who know exactly

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.090
where to put music for women.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.700
And for me, I mean the songs aren't
even technically challenging.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.120
I don't have to go through and
maneuver with my voice teacher

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.600
or anything like I do with
a lot of other composers

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.300
because they just fit
in my voice and a lot

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.610
of women's voices so easily.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.620
Every once and awhile
there's a murderess vowel

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.760
or consonant on a murderess
note but.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.060
Jason Robert Brown

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.360
&gt;&gt; Mine too.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.660
Shoshana Bean

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.960
&gt;&gt; And they're not easy.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.190
They're challenging but I
love, it's like, it's a one,

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.510
I feel like this is the moment I
get to feel like an Olympic athlete

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.390
as a singer when I'm
approaching Jason's material.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.690
Jason Robert Brown

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.060
&gt;&gt; I mean part of that really
is, part of why Shoshana

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.460 position:56%
and I can do the work we do together
is that part of her voice happens

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.900
to be just the part of the
voice that I work in the most

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.200
and that I like the most.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.550
So, it's not like oh maybe I'll
take this down a half step,

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.950
because Shoshana's singing it
which I will do with other signers.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.090
But Shoshana it's been pretty
much whatever key I throw

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.450
at her she's always like
oh that's good, that works.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.750
Shoshana Bean

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.050
&gt;&gt; Are you serious?!

Jason Robert Brown

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.970
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.

Jason Robert Brown

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.040
&gt;&gt; No.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.940 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Do you do it from a recording, do
you provide the recording that she.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.240
&gt;&gt; Jason Robert Brown

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.300
&gt;&gt; Well yeah, for the most
part, I mean you know,

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.910
we've now been doing these shows,

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.370
this has been more
than like 10 years.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.480
It's probably been 12 years of
doing these things together,

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.330
so I don't even remember
how we first.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:19.780
I think honestly when we first
did the gig you knew a lot

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:21.820
of the songs already that you just
sort of showed up and you were

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.420
like I know Still Hurting
and I know how

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.270
to do I'd Give It All
for You, oh okay.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.660
Shoshana Bean

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.430
&gt;&gt; No, I think you gave me, now
I don't remember the original,

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.460
I mean some of them I
had done in college.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.060
But now he just sends me, now
I'm known to ask for things.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.980
&gt;&gt; Do you read music?

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.280
Shoshana Bean

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.580
&gt;&gt; I do, but I don't
need to with Jason.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.300
With Jason it's a feeling
thing and if there's a question

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.180
of a specific note, I
mean I just, I ask him.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.480
I don't look at the music.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.780
Jason Robert Brown

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.080
&gt;&gt; No, I mean with, with Cassandra

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.380
which tonight she did
for the first time.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.710
I mean that's the first time that
anyone's done that song here.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.680
I sent her a recording of me
sort of, she had heard me do it.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.230
We did a concert together in
London I guess, 2 months ago

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.130
and I sang Cassandra then and I
said, but when we do the concert

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.960
in D.C. you're singing
it and she was like okay.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.350
And so, she had said you
better send it to me.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:12.490
So I sent her a recording where
I was playing the piano part

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.170
and plunking out the
note at the same time

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.880
and then I sent her
just an accompaniment

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.350
that she could sing along to.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.850
And so I sent that I and I
again, today was the first time

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:22.520
that we worked on it and you heard
you know, I started playing it,

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.410
she sang it and at the
end of it I said one thing

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.710
about one phrase and she said okay.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.160
And she was like okay let's
do it again and that was it.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.120
&gt;&gt; That was one of the
most fascinating things

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.010
when you were doing sort
of the run through is

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:37.450
as I recall you sang something
and then after you've gone

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.320
through the song you said,
remember that phrase.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.790
She's not angry at him there,
she's genuinely wishing him well.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.090
Shoshana Bean

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:48.390
&gt;&gt; Did I do, did I do it tonight?

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:49.690
Jason Robert Brown

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:50.990
&gt;&gt; I wasn't paying attention.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.290
I was playing.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.590
[ Laughter ]

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:54.890
Shoshana Bean

00:08:54.890 --> 00:09:01.600
&gt;&gt; Mark, did I do it?

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.900
Did I do it?

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.560
&gt;&gt; Everything you do is perfect.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.440
Shoshana Bean

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:13.460
&gt;&gt; I'm never leaving
the Library of Congress.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.760
Isn't it great?

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.830
&gt;&gt; But it's fascinating
to me that the idea

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.890
of what an intension is
behind a song and a moment

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:25.340
versus what the singers bring
to it and I'm not even sure how

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.080
to articulate this question.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.380
Jason Robert Brown

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.680
&gt;&gt; No, I think what
you're asking is this.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.880
When you're a storyteller and I
think both of us are storytellers

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.180
as that's part of what we do.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.010
It's much more effective for me
to tell you what the story is

00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:41.540
that I need you tell than for me
to tell you how to tell that story.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.730
If I had said to her, oh no do
it with this, go lighter on it

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:46.450
and you know, it should be
more piano and maybe sort

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.160
of hang this one note over by an
extra eighth note, that may be sort

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.110
of what I'm hoping comes out,

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.840
but it doesn't mean
she'll understand the story

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.140
that I want to tell.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.440
All I have to say to her is no
that's supposed to be genuine

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.740
and it's supposed to
be sort of kind.

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.040
And by saying that I know
that she's going to interpret

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.340
that musically to mean something.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.640
I don't know that with
every singer I work with

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.940
but I know that with Shoshana.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.240
If I say something about what the
storytelling is supposed to be,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.540
she knows how to tell stories with
the music as well as just sort

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:06.840
of say the words, but the music
is going to tell a story also

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.140
and I can, you know I can trust
that, I can say that and it works.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.440
I hope.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.740
Shoshana Bean

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.040
&gt;&gt; I'm flattered.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.340
I nailed it tonight.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.640
As you all can see, I nailed it.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:15.940
[ Laughter ]

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; It interests me that most of what
you sang tonight are theater songs

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.880
and in a couple of cases you
sort of explicated the story,

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.420
especially with the new song.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:28.900
But so often it seemed unnecessary
and yet there's a lot of detail

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:32.460
that may not be clear to the
audiences but somehow the meaning

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.320
and understanding comes through.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.620
Shoshana Bean

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.280
&gt;&gt; That's because he's
a genius storyteller.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.280
He's a genius and this is the
other thing I say to highlight

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.210
that fact is as singers
who learn music,

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.630
I don't know if you notice some
of the songs are 5 minutes long

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.520
and there's a lot of words.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.130
And so whenever, like when
I got Cassandra I was like

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.050 position:56%
and I called Eden, because my friend
Eden had just done it a couple

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:58.230
of weeks ago and I'm like did
you have to learn Cassandra?

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.930
She was like girl I did.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.450
It's been a long time since I
had to learn a new song of his

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.360
and then I checked
myself and I was like,

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.360
the thing with Jason's
music is it's very wordy

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.050
and there are intricate changes
each time that make it difficult

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.090
to learn, but it also
tells such a clear story.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.600 position:56%
It's actually not difficult to
learn, because once you see the arch

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.240
of the story it tells itself

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.160
and your memory just
kind of hold on to it.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.950
There are not a lot of
composers that do that.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.290
Sometimes, even pop songs
today, I mean like the dumbest,

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.650
easiest pop songs, if they don't
tell a story they don't stick

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:33.270
in my mind, so that's, I mean
and also he's a great storyteller

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.570
which is why you don't
need to know the context.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.390
You can just for your own.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:39.000
Like King of the World, I'm
like what's that about and he's

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.720
like what do you want
it to be about?

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.130
[ Laughter ]

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:44.430
Jason Robert Brown

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.400
&gt;&gt; I, you know I used to
do a lot more explaining,

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.610
but I've been doing these concerts
for you know 25 years or something.

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.870
At this point I figure
people just go with it.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.060
I used to just take
decades and decades

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.180
to explain what every
song was about.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.660
I got so tired of the
sound of my voice

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.520
and I figured nobody's
here to hear me talk.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.230
So I just moved on and
it seems to be all right.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:08.250
Also, I suspected of
this audience, you know,

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.970
85% of them don't know everything

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.270
that I sang anyway
they don't need me

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:12.640
to tell the whole story
at this show.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.500
&gt;&gt; Do you still enjoy
singing the songs over again?

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.470
Do you feel like okay I've got
to do this one now or it's?

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:20.770
Jason Robert Brown

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.500
&gt;&gt; No luckily, if I'm not
into it I don't do it anymore.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.740
There's actually one song I
don't, I rarely let anybody do

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.450
and I would never do it on my own.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.750
I haven't done.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:31.050
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.210
I think in the last 5 years it
just got burned out on it so much.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:36.700
It's a perfectly fine song I
just, I can't get behind it.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.090
And if I can't get behind
it it's hard for me to play.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:42.040
But we Stars and the Moon at
the rehearsal today and Stars

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:47.090
and the Moon you know, was I wrote
when I was 21 and it comes out

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:49.850
and I play it and it feels
great to play and so I'm sort

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.480
of like okay we can do that one.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:55.240
I can always find something
in the music to connect me

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.640
to why wrote the song and
if I know why I wrote it

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.690
that usually helps me.

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:05.770 position:56%
But I get burned out on things sure
but none of the stuff we did tonight

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.450 position:56%
because if I'm burned out on it I
don't have to put it in the program.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Why didn't you do Stars and Moon?

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.000
Jason Robert Brown

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.510
&gt;&gt; We just ran out of time I mean.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.810
We didn't do everything.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:16.550
We didn't do Everywhere but Here,
we didn't do Stars and Moon.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.850
&gt;&gt; No pressure.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.150
Jason Robert Brown

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.450
&gt;&gt; We did songs.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:21.750
Shoshana Bean

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.050
&gt;&gt; It was fun to run it today.

00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:26.100
&gt;&gt; I think the most recent song
you wrote and performed was Hope.

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.200
Jason Robert Brown

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.500
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.800
&gt;&gt; And I know, at least
as I understand it,

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.380
it was sort of a burst
of inspiration.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:41.030
But do you remember why Hope
instead of fear or prayer

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:44.420
or I mean just the way you
came into that song it sort of,

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.720
there's something unexpected

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.350
about that word being the direction
you went with that feeling.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:51.650
Jason Robert Brown

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.050
&gt;&gt; It actually it's the
serendipity of what happened.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:58.650 position:56%
I had been scheduled to perform,
Kristin Chenoweth was doing her show

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.850
on Broadway for about 2 weeks.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.130 position:56%
And one of the night, every night
she would have a special guest come.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.050
And she had asked if I would
come and be a special guest

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.550
that she was doing 50 Years
Long actually in her set.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.330
And she said, would you
come and be a special

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.150
and maybe sing something
new because the audience,

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:13.110
that would be kinky
for the audience.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:16.590
And so on Election Day
itself it was sort of like,

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.570
hey I wonder what I'm going to sing
for Kristin's show, I have no idea.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:22.510
And then you know, the end
of the world and then I.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:29.200
[ Applause ]

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.740
If you're not one of us it's fine,
just know that's how we feel.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.540
All right.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:42.040
[ Applause ]

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.440
So I got up that morning and
I really thought I'm not going

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:50.290
to go sing with Kristin Chenoweth,
that's not how that's going to go.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.340
But I thought well I can't
leave Kristin in the lurch,

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.220
what am I supposed to sing?

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:59.260
And I was like if I sing you know,
if I sing like the Old Red Hills

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.010
of Home or [inaudible] it's
just, it's deeply hostile.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:05.940
There's just no way to and I
didn't want to be hostile, I didn't

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.660
and especially if Kristin's show
which is all you know, sparkly

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.950
and twirly and you
know all that stuff.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:13.570
And so I thought what
am I supposed to say.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:18.350 position:56%
The first two lines of the song
while I was making breakfast in sort

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.500
of daze, because I don't think
any of us slept, I sort of,

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.670
I said I've come to
sing a song about hope.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.670
And I don't mean it but that's
what I'm here to sing about.

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:31.640
And so as I said that I thought,
I guess maybe I'll write a song.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.860
Maybe, I don't know what
time is it, can I, cause I,

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.560
I'm a very slow writer in general

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.570
but I thought I don't
know maybe I can do it.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:41.720
And we had to go that morning
my daughter was interviewing,

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.170
she's going into 7th grade
and she was interviewing

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:47.730
for a very schwansy [assumed
spelling] private girls school

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:49.520
on the Upper East Side.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.180 position:56%
And so my wife and daughter went off
to go to the interview and I said,

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.830
I'll meet you in a minute I
just have to take a shower.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:58.830 position:56%
And while I was in the shower I was
sort of working on the song and sort

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:01.180
of coming up with it, which
again this is not my process

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.560
but words were coming, words
were coming, words were coming.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:09.580
And I got in the cab
to go to the school

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:14.050
and I wrote fear never
wins that's what I hope.

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:17.270
See I said hope the work begins
as I was sitting in the cab.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:21.110
And I was just holding the note
pad open like that and I walked

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:24.020 position:56%
into a girls' school which was like,

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.340
that morning it was
like going to a wake.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:30.390
It was unbearable what it was
like and it was totally silent.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:33.820
But at the same time it was
this place that was all about,

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.810
even in light of what had just
happened lifting girls you

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.310
without saying to them you
can be what you want to be.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:42.190
You can be the best
things that you have to be.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:43.490
We will support you.

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.790
We will be behind you.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.090
We will understand.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:47.950
And I thought while I'm sitting
there with this notepad in my hand

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:50.550
that sings this song, I thought yes
this is exactly what I want to say.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:54.520
I want to be in this place right
now with this, with this sentiment.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:57.510
And our daughter was in doing
her interview and my wife

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:00.660
and I was just sitting out
there sort of in shock you know.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.190
And she said to me,
what's on the pad?

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:08.880 position:56%
And I said, I think it's a song that
I'm singing tonight for Kristin.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.680
And she said, well do you
want to show it to me?

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.020
And I was about to start, just
in the hallway sort of singing it

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.680
and I couldn't actually,
I tried to open my mouth

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.220
and I started crying
and I said I can't yet.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.520
I can't do it yet.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.020
I don't even know if I'll be
able to do it tonight by I can.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.010
And so then we got done
with the interview,

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.600
we dropped our daughter off
at school and we got back

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.100
into the house and Hillary was
about to give her concession speech

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:37.880 position:56%
and we went into my room with the
piano and I said all right I'm going

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.710 position:56%
to do this and this is the only time
I'm going to do it before tonight,

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.080
because I'm going to
have a nervous breakdown

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.380
if I keep singing this song.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.680
So this is it.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.410
And I played it sort of, I
mean I hadn't put my hands

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:50.970
on the piano at all
while writing it.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:52.530
You had asked me about
this this morning.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.120
I'm not usually a guy who can sort
of conceive all of this structure

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.620
without writing anything down
or playing it, but I just sort

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.120
of knew what the chords were.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:03.360
So I played it, we just sort of
had our moment to send in catharsis

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.980
and then we went down
and watched the speech.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:10.580
And I, you know, 6 hours
later I had to be on Broadway.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:15.030
And at some point during that day I
think I finally did just record it

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:18.590
you know, on my little tape
recorder and I just put it online

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.970
which at least sort of said to
me all right, what I really,

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:24.890
I did that honestly so that Kristen
and her director could hear it

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.670
in case they were like oh God don't
sing that tonight, don't do that.

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:30.730
But fortunately they were both
like oh my God, you have to.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.850
So I went and I sang it you know,

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:35.370
like I said Kristen's show
was all sort of sparkles

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:40.360
and you know soprano and
popular and all of that stuff.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.880
And then she sang 50 Years
Long which is a you know kind

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:46.780
of moving moment, a nice moment and
then she introduced me and asked me

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.970
to come out on stage and I did.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:53.660
And I said, I wrote
this this morning.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.410
I don't know what to tell you.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:59.570
This was the best I could
do and so I sang the song.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:01.480
And I couldn't tell, you
know, there's a couple

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.300
of laugh lines early on in
the song as you guys know.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.390
And so the audience
laughed thank God.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.420
You know, they were sort
of relaxing with me.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:10.020
And I got to the end and I
couldn't actually finish the song.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.310
I sort of got the words out
somehow but it was just too much.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:16.200
But we got to the end of the song
and the whole audience just stood

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.690
up in the middle of the show
and it was, it meant so much

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:21.910
to me, not like oh yay Jason.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:25.690
But it was like, it was just a
moment where I was connecting

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:28.860
and saying something for all of
those people that they needed

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.440
to hear and I felt
very grateful for that.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.790
And then there were the two guys
probably from West Virginia sitting

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:40.250
over here like this the whole time.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:50.610
But you know, so that was
[inaudible] I got through 2 hours

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:53.520
without the f bomb, you've
got to give me a break.

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.120
&gt;&gt; This is the Library of Congress.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.420
Shoshana Bean

00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.720
&gt;&gt; There's no cursing here.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.020
No cursing.

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.320
Jason Robert Brown

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.620
&gt;&gt; No cursing at all.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.080
&gt;&gt; What is your relation,
both of you,

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.720
your relationship with an audience?

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.340
How does that effect you, influence
you, change your performance?

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.030
Shoshana Bean

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:18.460
&gt;&gt; I think for me, I think my
real, my strongest relationship

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:22.850
with audience has just
really begun as of late only

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:27.480
because I've stopped trying to
convince them or win them over

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.600
or impress them or get a
certain type of reaction.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.170
Now when I come out my only
intention is to connect.

00:20:33.170 --> 00:20:37.160
So regardless of the material,
if it's mine, if it's not,

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:43.680
my intention is just to
connect heart to heart and get

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.120
out of my head basically.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:49.340
So, yeah I mean that's as
articulate as I can be.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:53.210
&gt;&gt; But does what they give
you back effect what you do?

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.070
Shoshana Bean

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.400
&gt;&gt; I, it has the potential to yes.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:06.400 position:56%
And when they are excited and
enthusiastic and enjoying themselves

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.160
and making that plain it
certainly fuels the fire.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:16.240
And when they are not it's
a challenge to keep grounded

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.650
and keep doing you know keep giving
your blood and your heart the way

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.230
that you would if they
were enthusiastic about it.

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.970
But I think my job is the same
regardless and that's kind of,

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:29.670
I don't know that you fall
into that trap like I do but.

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:30.970
Jason Robert Brown

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:35.090 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I mean for me, I've always worked
blessedly under the assumption

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:36.850
since I started doing
concerts like this.

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:39.410
I work under the assumption that no
one's here to sort of hear me sing

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.270
and no one's really here
to hear me play piano,

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:44.660
they're here for the songs and
so I'm here to serve the songs.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.900
And that's, I mean
that's a little bit coy

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:51.140
because obviously I know what
I can do and that I can sing

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.730
in a certain way and that I can
play the piano in a certain way

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.860
and I'll certainly throw
that out there you know.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:02.300
But I like to think the songs
are doing the work for me

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.460 position:56%
and I'm really here to channel them.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:05.970
That said, I've had audiences

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:08.980
that are not prepared
to receive the songs.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.430
It doesn't happen very often
obviously I mean you know,

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.830
I don't play to very large rooms

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.450
and honestly I don't
do that many concerts.

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:17.690
But I've had a couple of shows
in 20 years where I can just feel

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:22.050
like the audience was not really
buying what I was selling.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.100
And honestly, you can
get crazy about that,

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:29.460
but maybe I just all those
years of having no one like me

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.200
in high school train
me to just you know.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.030
You know, it's okay you
can have your experience

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:39.020 position:56%
and if it's not the same one I
wanted you to have that's all right.

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:41.050
You paid your money,
you get what you want.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:43.020
I'm sorry you're having
a miserable time.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.770
It's going to be long
night but you know.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:51.710
You know, I love to, there's
something about this kind of mix

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:55.360
that we have tonight where I can
tell there's easily half the crowd

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.360
that kind of can sing along
with all of it and know it.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.660
And then another half of the crowd

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.030
that really doesn't entirely
know what they're in for.

00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:03.410
And when there's that
balance it's a great thing

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:06.230 position:56%
because you can feel the audience
sort of talk to each other you know,

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.990
that they just share this thing
that it's all right to like it

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:10.480
and it's all right to
be challenged by it

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.780 position:56%
and it's all right to respond to it.

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.550
Were all going to be fine.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:14.850
Whenever I have to
play for an audience

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:18.080
that really doesn't know
anything about my work,

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.500
that's a big uphill climb
because the material is so dense.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:26.610
And a lot of it is so hard on you
know, first hearing that I have

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:29.600
to be very careful about
how I program that set.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.400
And I tend to do a lot of
jiggering around while I'm

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.700
in the middle of playing.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.570 position:56%
I'll be like oh I was going to do
this song, I'm not going to do that.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:36.870
Now let me just play.

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:39.870
So I can respond to the energy
that way and feel that way,

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:43.380
but so much of what I do with the
audience doesn't have to do with me

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.790
as a performer because I really,

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.600
most of my time I don't spend
thinking about when I sing it.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.610
I spend most of my time thinking
about when the actor sings it,

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:50.980
when the character sings it.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:54.310
So nights like this are sort
of fun, kicky little break.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:57.720
But most of the work is about
eliciting and audience response

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.780
in a very specific way that's
built into the writing.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:01.190
So if I've done that right,

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:05.110
hopefully when I perform
it, it's just sort of there.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:08.660
&gt;&gt; What does it feel like having
sometimes say I Love Betsy is the

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:10.660
best opening number
since the Music Man?

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:11.960
Shoshana Bean

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.260
&gt;&gt; What?!

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.560
&gt;&gt; It did.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.080
It's true.

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.300
[ Laughter ]

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.760
Jason Robert Brown

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:23.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; It was, you know, it was awesome.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:24.950
The funny thing is, Honeymoon

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:26.440
in Vegas was never the
show I thought was going

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.740
to be Steve's cup of tea.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.030
You know, I've known
Steve for a while

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.110
and like any young
writer Steve, he's Steve.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:34.750
I can call him Steve.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:38.310
But you know, like any young
writer of musical theater,

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.890
all I ever wanted to do was
to get Steve to like me.

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:42.710
I was like Steve please
like my work.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:45.640
And so I think parade in the
last 5 years, those were the kind

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.760
of shows I thought he's really
going to get behind those.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.060
He's going to be into those.

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:53.250
And he was kind of like yeah
those are nice and then you know.

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:57.690 position:56%
Honeymoon in Vegas which is so like
down the middle 1961 musical comedy,

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:00.080
that's the one he's
like I love that show

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.070
and that opening number is the
greatest thing I ever heard.

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:05.630
He says, he told me that
he, he puts on the CD,

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.320
he drives out to Connecticut to
his country house every weekend

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.570
and he puts on I Love Betsy is the
first thing that he wants to listen

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:13.910
to in the car and he just puts in
on repeat and he listens to it over

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:15.210
and over again and he cries.

00:25:15.210 --> 00:25:17.130
If anybody wants to know,
he cries all the time.

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:20.670
And, and I was like I Love Betsy?

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:23.620
Really? That's the one?

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:27.380
So I mean I'm grateful but,
that was, it was a surprise

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.490 position:56%
that that was the one I mean I guess
he could've said Freaky Freaky,

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.360
that would've been even
weirder but you know.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.770
Still, I Love Betsy, okay great,
I mean I worked really hard on it.

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:38.070
I'm glad it worked.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:40.580
&gt;&gt; What do guys like
other than each other?

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.880
Are there?

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.180
Jason Robert Brown &amp; Shoshana Bean

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.790
&gt;&gt; Nothing.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.100
[ Laughter ]

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.400
Shoshana Bean

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.700
&gt;&gt; Very little.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.000
&gt;&gt; Are there other songwriters
we should be looking for

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.180
and other performers who are up and
coming that we wouldn't know yet

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.240
but you guys see the spark in.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.540
Shoshana Bean

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:00.510
&gt;&gt; Your, if you don't already know
Pasek and Paul you're about to.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:03.270
[ Applause ]

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:07.700
That, those are the only other
composers that I get excited

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:16.660
about working with besides him,
like and I hope to God before one

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:20.220
of us goes that I get to
work with Steve, Steve.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:24.470
But as far as up and
coming I'm not interested

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.480
in anybody else really
besides Pasek and Paul.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.780
Jason Robert Brown

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.820
&gt;&gt; You know, yeah I
like Benj and Justin.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:34.180
I think Joey Konas is really
talented, a very talented guy.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:38.140
And you know, I'm married to
a very exceptional songwriter

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.410
so that helps.

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:46.120
Georgia Stitt, S - t - i
- t - t. There are a lot

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.110
of sensational performers.

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:51.760
I think in a lot of ways we've
reached a real golden age in terms

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.890
of the performers because
there's so much fluidity.

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.980
When I started, when we did songs
for A New World, it was really hard

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.940
to find that cast, especially
for the $20 we were paying them

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:05.700
but it was really hard you know.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.990
Billy Porter and Andrea were both
people I knew you know, for many,

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.250
many years beforehand so they
sort of did it as a favor to me

00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:13.950
and I built the show on them.

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:18.010
But it was a really hard show
to cast and it would not be hard

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:22.110
to cast it now, because the
vernacular has kind of grown

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:25.160
into what people are
more used to singing.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.230
And I think that's true
of the musicians also,

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:29.240
I think with the stuff
I used to write,

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.560
nobody could play it you know.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.100
Others are like oh I can do this
and now there's a lot of guys who

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.800
and girls who can get their
fingers around my stuff

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.330
and that's very gratifying.

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:41.860
I don't, I don't it's because
it's necessarily so much ahead

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:43.160
of my time, but I just think

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.410
that the work is kind
of filtered in its way.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:46.710
Shoshana Bean

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:48.690
&gt;&gt; Well you change the
game for those of us coming

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:50.180
up like before you,
there weren't songs

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.770
like that you were
working on in college.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:54.830
There weren't challenges
like that to be had.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:57.760
You know, there's musical
theater singer's anthology

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.780
with like the basic soprano stuff,
the altos you know the usual stuff.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:06.210
So you've changed that and
then as time has gone on,

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:09.350
social media has made that
more like accessible in a way

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:10.750
that wasn't necessarily for us.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:12.320
We had to go to the
library and check out CDs.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.620
Jason Robert Brown

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.510
&gt;&gt; We didn't even have
CDs when I was a kid.

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:18.250
[ Laughter ]

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:19.550
Shoshana Bean

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:20.850
&gt;&gt; Well yeah, well.

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:22.150
&gt;&gt; Did your daughter
get in the school?

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:23.450
Shoshana Bean

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:24.750
&gt;&gt; Did what?

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.050
Jason Robert Brown

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:27.350
&gt;&gt; Oh, we don't know
yet to be honest.

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:28.650
I sort of, I got over the hole.

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:29.950
She has to go to a girls school.

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:31.250
It was that morning, it was
really, really seductive.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:32.550
And after that I was
like just, because I want

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:33.850
that doesn't mean that's
right for her.

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:35.710
And we went to a couple of other
non-girls schools and I was

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:37.840
like no actually she sort
of belongs here more.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.130
No, I'm sure you're all
deeply, deeply interested.

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:46.580
&gt;&gt; They say leave them wanting
more and I want to save your voice

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.990
for Sunday after all
you've given us.

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:50.410
So thank you both for being here.

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:51.710
Jason Robert Brown

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:53.510
