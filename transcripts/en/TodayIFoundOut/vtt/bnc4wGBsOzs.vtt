00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.620
The Invention of Non-Alcoholic Grape Juice

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.680
You’ve probably heard about Jesus turning
water into wine, but Dr. Thomas Bramwell Welch

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.180
is a lesser-known drink magician who developed
a way to turn something that would have been

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.009
wine into a non-alcoholic version of the drink,
in an attempt to make an “unfermented sacramental

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.009
wine”.

00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:37.920
Dr. Welch was a physician, a dentist and a
Methodist minister in Vineland, New Jersey.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.930
At the time, Methodists were strongly opposed
to the consumption of alcohol.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.910
This made serving wine for communion somewhat
hypocritical, a discrepancy that Welch was

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.340
quick to point out.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.730
His stance on the matter was so strong that
he was even opposed to touching a container

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.770
holding wine—a problem, since he was the
communion steward.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.850
The last straw was supposedly when a member
of the church turned up at the Welch home

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.360
one Sunday evening after partaking in a little
too much of the communion wine.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.979
Welch was furious at the man’s raucous behaviour.

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.210
So, what to do about it?

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.259
Being something of a jack-of-all-trades, Welch
took on the endeavour himself.

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.600
He sought to come up with a way to bottle
grape juice so that it wouldn’t eventually

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.790
turn into wine.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.540
In 1869, he pressed juice from Concord grapes,
filtered and bottled it in his own kitchen,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.390
and then used Louis Pasteur’s innovative
new technique called “pasteurization.”

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.760
He boiled the bottles of grape juice, which
not only helped preserve the juice, but also

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.960
killed all of the yeast in the bottles.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.830
This prevented fermentation, so the drinks
would not be alcoholic.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.850
After successfully preparing the drink, Dr.
Welch delivered it to his church and even

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.630
advertised it to surrounding churches as well.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.500
However, many clergymen were uninterested
in Dr. Welch’s Unfermented Wine; some even

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.790
called serving it “heresy.”

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.710
Needless to say, the unfermented sacramental
wine did not get off to a great start.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.270
Welch was forced to set his product on the
back-burner, though he remained heavily involved

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.580
in the temperance movement.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.599
That said, a small amount of his grape juice
continued to be produced for a few churches

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.020
in the area.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.689
It wasn’t until Welch’s son, Charles,
who was also a dentist, started advertising

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.230
Welch’s in the 1890s that it became more
popular.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.530
At the time, Thomas Welch’s advise to Charles
was the same as what so many parents tell

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.190
their children when the youngsters are pursuing
a new career path that the parent’s don’t

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.160
necessarily think has much of a future,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.099
Now don’t think I’m trying to discourage
your pushing the grape juice.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.650
It is right for you to do so, so far as you
can, without interfering with your profession

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.290
and your health.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.830
Thanks to the rise of the Temperance Movement,
Charles’ profession was about to change.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.800
The juice’s appearance at the World Fair
in Chicago didn’t hurt, either; thousands

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.540
of people were able to sample it there in
1893.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.030
In 1896, Welch’s Fruit Juice Company became
too big for one family to handle.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.230
To help meet the demand, Charles packed up
and moved the company to a factory in New

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.660
York, where he continued to grow the business.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.780
(Thomas Welch died a few years later in 1903.)

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.069
Welch’s soon became the natural drink substitute
for wine; it was made from the same fruit

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.920
and suited the taste of the Temperance Society.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.250
In 1913, Secretary of State William Jennings
Bryan hosted a dinner for the visiting British

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.300
ambassador; while it was traditional to serve
wine, Bryan decided to serve Welch’s instead,

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.650
making it more fashionable.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.540
That same year, alcohol was banned on Navy
ships and Welch’s grape juice was served

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.540
instead.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.819
Today, the company is a household name, featured
on juice, jellies, and jams.

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.420
They reportedly rake in nearly a half a billion
dollars every year and have since moved their

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.970
headquarters to Concord, Massachusetts, where
they grow cuttings from the original Concord

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.500
grape vine used.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.090
Not bad for something that started out as
the result of a pet peeve of one man who simply

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.970
wanted to provide a way for people to take
communion without alcohol crossing their lips.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.120
During the 1500-1800s Catholic, Protestant,
and even Puritans taught that alcohol was

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.690
a gift from God and was created by God to
be used in moderation for the pleasure of

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.140
man and to aid in health.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.199
Drunkenness was viewed as a sin, as it often
is even today, but it’s only been relatively

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.879
recently in Christianity that drinking in
general has been considered sinful.

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:25.099
This change took place primarily due to the
increased concern over the negative effects

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:29.580
of drunkenness among the church, beginning
around the 18th century when mass-drunkenness

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.680
became a major problem largely thanks to the
Industrial Revolution, both because of the

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.550
concentration of the uneducated in urban slums
and technological advances in the mass production

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.550
of alcohol.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.629
(Given the working conditions, hours and little
hope of escaping that life, it’s no wonder

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:50.580
so many chose to remain drunk as much as possible.)

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.620
During Prohibition, Grape growers of the day
began selling “bricks of wine”, which

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.229
were primarily blocks of “Rhine Wine”.

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.110
These often included the following instructions:
“After dissolving the brick in a gallon

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.110
of water, do not place the liquid in a jug
away in the cupboard for twenty days, because

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.539
then it would turn into wine.”

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.919
Thomas Welch was involved in the underground
railroad during the Civil War, successfully

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.979
smuggling several former slaves from the south
to freedom.

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.649
In the 1930s, Welch’s—then run by Thomas’
grandsons—distributed 10% of the company’s

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:30.110
shares to their 300 employees as a Christmas
present at the height of the Great Depression.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:36.630
Welch’s initial foray into the world of
grape jam was in 1918 during World War I with

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.749
a product called “Grapelade.”

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:43.740
The entire first batch was snapped up by the
United States Army which doled it out to soldiers.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.839
When the soldiers returned home, they demanded
the delicious Grapelade as part of their breakfast.

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:51.759
This went a long way in helping to popularize
the relatively newly invented peanut butter

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.149
and jelly sandwich.

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:57.129
Are you a fan of frozen juice concentrate?

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:59.680
You have Welch’s to thank for that!

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.899
In 1949, they introduced the first juice concentrate
you stored in the freezer to make juice later

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:05.889
with.

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:11.199
The Concord grape was developed from native
New England grapes by Ephraim Wales Bull in

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:12.470
Concord, Massachusetts.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.849
Many varieties of grapes brought over from
Europe simply weren’t doing very well in

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:16.929
the Americas.

00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:21.229
Bull planted around 22,000 seedlings before
he hit upon the perfect grape.

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.800
He presented his grapes to the public in 1853
and even won a prize for them at the Boston

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.979
Horticultural Society Exhibition.

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:42.419
The grapes brought him fame, but not fortune;
he earned $1000 for each cutting, but still

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:43.949
died a poor man.

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:46.250
His tombstone reads “He sowed—others reaped.”
