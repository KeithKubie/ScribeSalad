It's Jett Jackson the movie! based on the popular Disney Channel show that I haven't seen one episode of, so yeah...

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.349
I'm kind of going into this a little blind, but I did a little research

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.479
and here's what I discovered. Jett Jackson is an actor who plays a super spy called Silverstone.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.959
He enjoys that the show is a big hit but he also just wants to be a kid again,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.140
so the production moves out from LA to North Carolina

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.659
where big-time Hollywood people have to interact with small-town everyday people and thus hilarity ensues.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.260
That's about the most I know.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.260
The movie pretty much represents there which it Jackson filming his show, going to school, possibly going out on a date,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.999
but he discovers he's getting tired of playing the part, so when asked to do another season he's considering saying no,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.269
but things take a surprising turn when somehow Jett Jackson

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.760
and Silverstone switch places. That's right, the real actor is in the fictional world and the fictional character is in the real world.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.920
A super spy have to learn to blend in as a real kid and the real kid has to save the world from Michael

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.400
Ironside, oh how can any production go wrong with him in it?

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.720
Yeah, okay almost...

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.380
On the one hand, I think this is a pretty clever idea.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.820
I mean we've always seen stuff with the fish-out-of-water stories or somebody switching places,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.070
but the idea of a fictional character switching places with a real-life character,

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.019
and not just focusing on one but both of their lives as they tried to blend in is actually kind of

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.349
interesting and a little funny. Just as Jett is getting sick of the character

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.169
he suddenly becomes the character. Just as Silverstone was trying to stop Chicago from blowing up, he then finds out

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.960
he has to deal with people yelling at him for not doing the show anymore.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.580
Yeah, it turns out the town kind of depended on the show to create jobs and tourism

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.688
and yeah, it's actually a detail most kids films would overlook. And both sides have some good comedy, like when Jett discovers that New York is

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.999
about to blow up by the evil bad guy what does he do?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.019
He just goes around telling everybody, "Leave, New York leave, New York!" Yeah, that'll work.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.439
Silverstone also has a hard time putting the super spy away. When he keeps seeing cast members who were villains in his world, he tries to

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:12.469
tell the cops, and when they don't do anything he takes matters into his own hands.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.939
As humorous as this is it does also take time to show the trouble both characters are going through,

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.480
each one trying to figure out what to do with their future or where they belong.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.760
Actual high school stuff that a lot kids think about around this age. There's even a prom scene where they don't show the prom!

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.729
Holy smokes! has that ever happened in Disney history?

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.878
There's a prom and yet you don't see it occur?

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.718
Don't we have to hear the pop songs or see the girls in the latest dresses?

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.420
And wha-what? This isn't going on? Wow! I'm kind of speechless.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.080
While that's all fine and good I do have to question though, does this have a lot to do with the original show?

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.680
Now again, I haven't watched the original show so I don't know, but looking at the summary of it

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.849
this doesn't seem like what the show was about.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.429
It seemed to go back and forth between showing the Silverstone TV series and Jett Jackson just living his everyday life.

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:07.269
When you suddenly bring the fictional character to life does that overstep what the original show was doing? I'm not sure if

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.269
this is a really clever change of pace, or if it's something

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.119
that's so different that a lot of fans wouldn't relate to it.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.139
So if you're asking as someone who grew up with the show, I'm not able to give you an answer.

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:23.168
I have no idea if this is faithful or not. but, as a 30-something who was forced to watch a Disney Channel kids movie,

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:27.609
I thought it was kind of clever. I like that's not all jokes and when there are jokes a lot of them work,

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.638
I like that the Silverstone show does look like a lot of fun,

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:35.349
but you're also interested in what's going on Jetts life as well, so I think it's clever enough though

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.509
I have no idea what fans of the show would think of it.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.539
But I think there's enough smart writing and good acting to pull it off.

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:43.029
If you're looking for a decent Disney Channel movie,

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:44.460
this isn't a bad one to check out.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.620
Put on your backpack, and your spy gear, and take a look.
