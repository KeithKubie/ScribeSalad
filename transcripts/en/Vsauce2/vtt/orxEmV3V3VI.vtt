And he considers his moving sculptures to
be living things - in which every piece has

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.800
its place and after it eventually breaks down
- the pieces can be dismantled and reused

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.600
as a type of rebirth.&nbsp;

her work.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.350
