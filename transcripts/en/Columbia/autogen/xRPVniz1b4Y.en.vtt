running around without a head it's
 

01:18:31.630 --> 01:18:36.770

1969 the squib is invented so that you

01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:45.670
1969 the squib is invented so that you
 

01:18:45.670 --> 01:18:47.610
1969 the squib is invented so that you
can shoot someone in the movies and have

01:18:47.610 --> 01:18:47.620
can shoot someone in the movies and have
 

01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:50.520

the blood squirt out from then on we've

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:50.530
the blood squirt out from then on we've
 

01:18:50.530 --> 01:18:54.870
the blood squirt out from then on we've
had more and more blood and I think that

01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880
had more and more blood and I think that
 

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:57.840
had more and more blood and I think that
we have moved a tremendous amount of our

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:57.850
we have moved a tremendous amount of our
 

01:18:57.850 --> 01:19:00.470
we have moved a tremendous amount of our
violence into the imaginary realm and

01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480
violence into the imaginary realm and
 

01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:04.350
violence into the imaginary realm and
out of the realm of organized

01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:04.360
out of the realm of organized
 

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:11.899
out of the realm of organized
socialization so my inclination is to

01:19:11.899 --> 01:19:11.909
socialization so my inclination is to
 

01:19:11.909 --> 01:19:16.800
socialization so my inclination is to
agree that with respect to the the idea

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:16.810
agree that with respect to the the idea
 

01:19:16.810 --> 01:19:20.910
agree that with respect to the the idea
of peace being probably with us for a

01:19:20.910 --> 01:19:20.920
of peace being probably with us for a
 

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:24.330
of peace being probably with us for a
long time that those societies that have

01:19:24.330 --> 01:19:24.340
long time that those societies that have
 

01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:32.010
long time that those societies that have
made this transition to a to a world of

01:19:32.010 --> 01:19:32.020
made this transition to a to a world of
 

01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:34.740
made this transition to a to a world of
the violent imagination rather than the

01:19:34.740 --> 01:19:34.750
the violent imagination rather than the
 

01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:37.729
the violent imagination rather than the
violent reality and to have put the

01:19:37.729 --> 01:19:37.739
violent reality and to have put the
 

01:19:37.739 --> 01:19:43.380
violent reality and to have put the
militarization of male youth aside or

01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:43.390
militarization of male youth aside or
 

01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:45.540
militarization of male youth aside or
the male youth for put it aside all by

01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:45.550
the male youth for put it aside all by
 

01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:47.669
the male youth for put it aside all by
themselves that they're going to have a

01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679
themselves that they're going to have a
 

01:19:47.679 --> 01:19:50.370
themselves that they're going to have a
very hard time conducting substantial

01:19:50.370 --> 01:19:50.380
very hard time conducting substantial
 

01:19:50.380 --> 01:19:52.380
very hard time conducting substantial
warfare but that doesn't apply to

01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:52.390
warfare but that doesn't apply to
 

01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:54.899
warfare but that doesn't apply to
everyone in the world and when you go

01:19:54.899 --> 01:19:54.909
everyone in the world and when you go
 

01:19:54.909 --> 01:19:59.610
everyone in the world and when you go
back and look now at certain guerrilla

01:19:59.610 --> 01:19:59.620
back and look now at certain guerrilla
 

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:02.040
back and look now at certain guerrilla
organizations or terrorist organizations

01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:02.050
organizations or terrorist organizations
 

01:20:02.050 --> 01:20:03.840
organizations or terrorist organizations
what do you find is that they still have

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:03.850
what do you find is that they still have
 

01:20:03.850 --> 01:20:07.939
what do you find is that they still have
the old notion of socialization of

01:20:07.939 --> 01:20:07.949
the old notion of socialization of
 

01:20:07.949 --> 01:20:10.350
the old notion of socialization of
bringing the Shabaab the boys together

01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:10.360
bringing the Shabaab the boys together
 

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:13.779
bringing the Shabaab the boys together
to do something violent

01:20:13.779 --> 01:20:13.789
to do something violent
 

01:20:13.789 --> 01:20:16.660
to do something violent
so I think we're in a period of

01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:16.670
so I think we're in a period of
 

01:20:16.670 --> 01:20:19.450
so I think we're in a period of
transition Cory might hope that we can

01:20:19.450 --> 01:20:19.460
transition Cory might hope that we can
 

01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:22.259
transition Cory might hope that we can
move into a largely post violent

01:20:22.259 --> 01:20:22.269
move into a largely post violent
 

01:20:22.269 --> 01:20:26.049
move into a largely post violent
post-war era but there were not there

01:20:26.049 --> 01:20:26.059
post-war era but there were not there
 

01:20:26.059 --> 01:20:32.200
post-war era but there were not there
yet on a world basis but but we may but

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:32.210
yet on a world basis but but we may but
 

01:20:32.210 --> 01:20:34.089
yet on a world basis but but we may but
we may achieve it just not for the

01:20:34.089 --> 01:20:34.099
we may achieve it just not for the
 

01:20:34.099 --> 01:20:38.260
we may achieve it just not for the
reasons that Steven Pinker puts forward
