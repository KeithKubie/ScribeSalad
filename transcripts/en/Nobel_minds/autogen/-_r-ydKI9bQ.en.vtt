so<00:07:15.830><c> can</c><00:07:16.010><c> we</c><00:07:16.100><c> briefly</c><00:07:16.370><c> talk</c><00:07:16.640><c> about</c><00:07:16.670><c> what</c><00:07:17.120><c> is</c>

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.300 align:start position:0%
so can we briefly talk about what is
 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.630 align:start position:0%
so can we briefly talk about what is
kind<00:07:17.570><c> of</c><00:07:17.600><c> the</c><00:07:17.840><c> the</c><00:07:18.380><c> compass</c><00:07:18.860><c> that</c><00:07:18.890><c> guides</c><00:07:19.130><c> us</c>

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
kind of the the compass that guides us

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
thermodynamics you did the experiment
 

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.230 align:start position:0%
thermodynamics you did the experiment
because<00:16:27.800><c> you</c><00:16:27.949><c> showed</c><00:16:28.459><c> that</c><00:16:28.490><c> you</c><00:16:28.730><c> can</c><00:16:28.939><c> trust</c>

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
because you showed that you can trust
 

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.629 align:start position:0%
because you showed that you can trust
science<00:16:29.720><c> there</c><00:16:30.470><c> was</c><00:16:30.589><c> a</c><00:16:30.620><c> law</c><00:16:30.920><c> of</c><00:16:31.189><c> nature</c><00:16:31.459><c> that</c>

00:16:31.629 --> 00:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
science there was a law of nature that
 

00:16:31.639 --> 00:16:33.699 align:start position:0%
science there was a law of nature that

00:16:33.699 --> 00:16:33.709 align:start position:0%
prevented this magic trick from going
 

00:16:33.709 --> 00:16:36.699 align:start position:0%
prevented this magic trick from going
