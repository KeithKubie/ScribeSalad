00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.050
CAT: I'm Cat and I'm a member
of the Authors at Google Team.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.630
It's truly a pleasure for
me to welcome chef Roy Choi

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.660
and introduce his new book
"L.A. Son" at Google L.A. today.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.020
Back in early 2009, Kogi was the
first food truck to visit us.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.240
And I remember we had a long
line of Googlers stretching

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.290
around the block all eager
to try Roy's delicious food.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.600
Roy was born Korean but
raised in Los Angeles

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.210
since he was two years old.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.640
He graduated from the
Culinary Institute of America.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.550
After several years of
cooking in New York, Tokyo,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.510
and throughout California,
Roy started Kogi

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.720
and started three
different restaurants

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.700
in L.A. with a fourth one
coming soon to Korea Town.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.950
Now please help me
welcome Roy Choi.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.310
ROY CHOI: Thank you.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.320
And that's "L.A. Son."

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.620
We're done.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.277
That's my whole life
story right there.

00:01:03.277 --> 00:01:04.360
It's good to be here, man.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.160
I know this area really well.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.230
I hang out in Venice, got
restaurants in Venice.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.720
I was looking at opening a
spot right next door here

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.430
on Sunset and Fourth.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.520
I heard the rumor you guys
don't leave this building.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.530
That's what the outside
world thinks of you.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.697
It's like you guys
are trapped here.

00:01:23.697 --> 00:01:25.780
But yeah, over there, but
it just didn't work out.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.724
I was going to open this
spot with my friend,

00:01:28.724 --> 00:01:29.640
like a breakfast spot.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.120
But we're still
looking for a location,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.025
so if you think it's
good, then maybe.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.690
Kogi has been an amazing
thing in my life.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.390
In our whole team--
in a way it maybe

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.910
mirrors a lot of things that
you guys may experience,

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.470
not on food level but as far
as puncturing the atmosphere

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.460
or puncturing universe
with maybe your thoughts

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.650
and your engineering
innovations and with startups.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.490
We were part of a wave
and we hit a nerve.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.449
It was digital, but instead
of it just being digital,

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.215
it was also human, as well.

00:02:11.215 --> 00:02:17.090
It became something that really
just affected people and made

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.930
smart people dumb and
dumb people smart.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.820
I don't know, it's crazy.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.840
But this book that we're
going to talk about today

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.496
is not the Kogi book.

00:02:28.496 --> 00:02:36.400
It's strange that I didn't write
the Kogi book because like it's

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.540
like having a race car
but never driving it.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.720
It was most expected thing
to just go ahead and write

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.680
the Kogi book, but
I don't like doing

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.350
things that aren't
ready to do it yet.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.840
I don't like doing things
that are forced just

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.850
for the sake of
commerce or attention.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.920
So like, to me the Kogi
book isn't ready yet.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.457
We're still out there.

00:03:04.457 --> 00:03:06.790
After I'm done talking to
you, you're going to eat Kogi.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.950
We're still in the moment.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.420
We're still figuring
our own story out.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.800
I had to figure out-- to
confront the issue of actually

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.400
writing a book
itself, because-- I

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.200
guess I can backtrack
a little bit.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.380
I don't know if I'm telling
you this for empathy

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.710
or to try to explain
this book, but I never

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.940
wanted to write a book, ever.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.490
To me it seemed kind of douchey
to write a book about yourself.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.980
It's like, what the fuck.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:57.680
Sometimes you wake up and you
can't architect or imagine

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.150
things or moments where
people want things--

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.230
I grew up in an
environment in my life

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.200
where not many people
wanted things from me.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.847
And then usually, I created
a little bit of a force field

00:04:09.847 --> 00:04:10.430
around myself.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.710
She told me you guys don't talk
to each other when you work.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:13.630
So kind of like that.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.610
I created a force
field around myself

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.810
where even if you did
want something from me,

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.530
I really didn't want to
explain it or give it to you.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.730
But then after the first couple
of years of Kogi, what happened

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.270
was things started to
unravel in that force field.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.520
Instead of me always raising
an eyebrow of suspicion,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.270
I allowed these questions
to come through.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.680
And they start
coming tenfold where

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.180
people were asking
the same question of,

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.100
how did you come
up with this food?

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.710
Tell me everything
about this food.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.060
I can't stop eating it.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.147
Why did you cook it?

00:04:58.147 --> 00:04:59.730
Where did you come
up with the flavor?

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.400
I need to know right now.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.390
And these were people I just
met grabbing me by the lapels.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:13.440
And so I decided
maybe it's time to not

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.800
react the same way that
I've done my whole life.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.610
Maybe these are signals from
somewhere for me to look at it.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.870
Maybe it's not
just about myself.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.590
Maybe the way this food has
affected yourselves and others

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.520
and why you're raising
these questions

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.330
to a complete
stranger, maybe it's

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.240
a gateway or a little
clue into something

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.650
that I should explore.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.670
And that was kind of the thing
that pushed me over the hump.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.600
Because I'm a really shy dude.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.290
I was not ever prepared or
read to sit in this chair

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.460
and speak to you about
a book about my life.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.540
But once I had confronted
that, I woke up.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:59.390
And sometimes you wake up and
you realize that-- you just

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.890
know something, and
you just realize it.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.560
You'll read
throughout this book,

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.310
there are those moments
that had I've had.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.684
And I realized
that this was just

00:06:06.684 --> 00:06:08.200
another succession
of those moments.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.500
I was a deadbeat.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.040
And then I woke up
on a couch and I

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.740
realized that I had to cook,
and then I just started cooking.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.980
It was kind of the same I
guess epiphany with this book,

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.060
was I was fighting
it for so long.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.130
Any of you true
OG Kogi followers,

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.130
like from the beginning?

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.770
OK.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.030
I was pretty hardcore
at the beginning.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.170
When I was cooking,
I had like sonars.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.960
If you talked any
shit about the food,

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.190
I would come outside, pull
that shit out your hand,

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.439
close the doors, and take off.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.757
I was not in a place to write a
book to share things with you.

00:06:54.757 --> 00:06:56.840
I just felt like I could
share this food with you,

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.423
and that's it.

00:06:57.423 --> 00:07:00.740
But I woke up and I was
like, you know what?

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.620
Maybe I shouldn't be
so angry about things.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.600
Maybe I can confront
these things with a smile

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.490
and actually look and
go down this road.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:17.210
So once I woke up with that, I
called the two co-authors, Tim

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.680
and Natasha, and we met.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:27.110
Do you have those moments
where you can see everything

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.260
almost in a parallel
universe, where it already

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.040
exists in full form, and
it's almost like you just

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.490
have to go to that
place in order

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:40.379
to populate it in
and bring it to life?

00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:41.420
That's how this book was.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.560
We called them.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.630
We met on Pico and
Union at Lucy's.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:51.000
Lucy's drive-in, like
Mexican American Cafe.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.760
Beautiful place.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:56.460
Outdoors, brick building, adobe
style, with benches out front.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.440
You get the wind, a little bit
of the wind from the downtown

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:04.970
buildings, and also the sun
from setting here in Venice.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.890
And I just sat there on
a piece of scratch paper

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.570
and the whole book as you see
it now was kind of laid out.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:14.560
And it was our job to
fill in those spaces.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.490
When I look back, is
the exact same book

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.630
that we saw just on
that scribble page.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.770
So that was how we started
this process for the book.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:32.630
But the book itself
is not a chef book,

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:34.140
let me start off with that.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.409
It's not a chef book.

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:37.809
It's not a how to start
a food truck book.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:44.220
Is not the secrets
of a restaurant book.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:51.790
It's really a book about
a confused kid trying

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:59.210
to figure out his place in
worlds in which nothing ever

00:08:59.210 --> 00:08:59.990
fit.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:02.480
And it's a book about struggle.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.270
book I think it speaks to
immigration, addiction.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:11.640
I think it speaks
to a lot of issues

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:17.570
of being outcast and
also just compulsion.

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:21.480
Also just not really
finding a voice,

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.780
and then finding maybe
vices or just destructive

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:31.394
elements to fill in those
voids in order to continue on.

00:09:31.394 --> 00:09:33.310
You guys are smart, so
I know you never really

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.846
had those struggles, probably.

00:09:35.846 --> 00:09:36.970
Maybe you do, I don't know.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.320
But I've never fit into the
fucking regular shit, man.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:47.460
And so for me, as you go
through the chapters--

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.760
my parents were immigrants.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.520
They were very educated
people, but they got to America

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.670
in the early '70s--
any family that

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:02.710
is an immigrant-- it's hard to
explain in a general context.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.370
You have to go through it.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.400
But this book is a step to
try to find that bridge.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.000
When you use the
word racism, it's

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.560
hard to understand
that context of racism

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.340
from when the racism
is coming at you.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.960
If you try to speak about
the nuances of what it feels

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.170
like to be ostracized
or not being

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:33.670
able to get a job in a
country that you moved to,

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.260
in a place where it's
not your first language

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.410
and where you look
different, it's very hard

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.900
to explain those
nuances and to explain

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.455
that pain and that struggle
and that confusion.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:56.270
And then also to explain the
transgression and the evolution

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.850
of a human spirit and a soul
that is under that pressure,

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:09.300
almost like geothermal pressure.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.660
It changes a person.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.540
For my family, it
changed my parents.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.790
It changed them into alcoholics.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:19.590
It changed them
into people that put

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.690
their hopes and their
dreams in their children,

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:27.570
but also lived within the vortex
of losing their own dreams

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.150
and hopes.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.580
And then for me, it
travels through that,

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.220
and it travels
through myself, going

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.080
through a lot different
neighborhoods.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.940
And then really
trying to figure out

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.980
for a lot of immigrants kids,
especially from my generation,

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.180
and especially a lot of
Asian-American kids--

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.660
I know a Latino kids may go
through, it as well-- but just

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.420
living in this weird,
kind of suspended state

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.530
where you live double lives.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:07.060
Food wasn't that big in our
society like 20, 30 years ago.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.100
Not everybody was into kimchi
and fish guts and things

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.600
like that.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:18.110
So in many ways, the
foods that we grow up on

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:24.270
were kind of hidden
and were labeled

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.485
stinky and disgusting and ugly.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:32.320
I know a lot of Asian
kids will relate to this,

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.780
and a lot of Indian
kids will relate.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:39.480
So we go through
that in this book

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.830
of just trying to explore that.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.450
Not trying to make a
social commentary on it,

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.050
but just telling
you the real deal

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:50.757
of what it felt like to not show
your friends your refrigerator.

00:12:50.757 --> 00:12:52.840
Or when you showed your
friends your refrigerator,

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.130
what the reactions were like.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:58.885
How you want to just fight it,
but also you embarrassed by it.

00:12:58.885 --> 00:13:02.380
You couldn't find the
words to explain it.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:04.050
But then at the same
time, you loved it,

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.720
and this is the
food you grew up on.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:12.650
It also talks about the culture
of L.A. I tried to really write

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.850
about three to four
decades of Los Angeles

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:22.560
and really let the pages
breathe L.A. all the way,

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:27.530
from the '70s and "Happy
Days," and the Dodgers,

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:33.060
and chili dogs, and
Eastside, and Legion Park,

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:38.192
all the way through
Korea Town into the '80s

00:13:38.192 --> 00:13:39.400
and then through high school.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:43.340
And then it gets into the '90s.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.780
The book, even though it
travels in a linear form,

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.377
we tried to write
it in a way where,

00:13:49.377 --> 00:13:51.710
almost like a movie, where
you could suspend your belief

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:55.880
and it could travel and
it goes into folklore

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.320
thousands of years
ago but also speaks

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.080
on what's going on at that time.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.890
And then it reaches
a point-- and we

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.100
write about three really
strong addictions,

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:11.530
which is gambling,
alcohol, and then drugs.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:17.424
And then at the end of
it, we find the food.

00:14:17.424 --> 00:14:19.840
And then through the food, we
take you to different lands.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.050
We take you to Japan.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.460
I had the fortunate ability
to work in Japan for awhile.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.580
And then it goes through
my career a little bit.

00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:38.970
I'm really proud
of this book, man.

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.550
Every single corner of it.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:45.800
The story, the recipes.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.400
I wanted to write a
book, also, where--

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.360
I'll read a little
quick chapter for you.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.250
But there was like
three or four things

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.070
we really wanted from this book.

00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.810
And do you ever
have those moments

00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:00.750
where you want something
and you create it?

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:04.010
And it maybe it doesn't come
out exactly the same way

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:09.610
as you imagined it, but
when you complete it,

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:13.430
it fulfilled the criteria,
but it also went beyond it?

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.600
Like, when we started
this book, one,

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:19.100
I wanted it to be affordable.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.980
So the big goal was
to keep it under $30,

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.820
and we achieved that, even
with all the content in here.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:31.770
Another thing was anyone
who read this book,

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.525
I wanted it to feel
like Los Angeles.

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.080
I wanted it to feel
like the living

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:43.485
rooms of immigrant children
that grew up in Los Angeles.

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:47.050
The cardboard boxes,
the mix-match furniture,

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:51.240
the smells, everything.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:55.180
The language, the
noise, everything.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:56.820
And it does, I think.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:00.720
When you flip through it,
it feels like Los Angeles.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.350
And then I wanted,
also, the book

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:12.222
to read in a very infectious way
to where once you started it,

00:16:12.222 --> 00:16:12.930
it sucked you in.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.637
Because I always
considered this book

00:16:15.637 --> 00:16:16.970
to be more than just a cookbook.

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:19.420
And that's why we went
with Anthony Bourdain

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.045
as a publisher.

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:27.080
For me, growing up, I didn't
have many people to relate

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:34.370
to as far as like--
when I read the classics

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:36.060
throughout high
school and stuff,

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:40.610
I could understand and
relate to whether it's

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:44.160
Chaucer or Fitzgerald or
Hemingway or whoever it is,

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.060
but I didn't live that life.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.900
Even though intellectually
I could relate,

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.550
and from an imagination
standpoint I could relate,

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:57.200
but I never could relate
as far as understanding

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.670
the little nuances or
the traditions and stuff.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:05.839
So I wanted to write a book
where there's a lot of kids

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:08.500
out there that are going through
it, that they could relate.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.579
And not just immigration,
but also people going through

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:12.800
addictions right now.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.619
We don't talk about
it a lot in society,

00:17:14.619 --> 00:17:16.710
but people are
going through stuff.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:20.390
A lot of my friends,
they don't read.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:22.442
A lot of people, since
the book has come out,

00:17:22.442 --> 00:17:24.900
I get texts and friends come
up to me, and they're like yo,

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.970
man, I haven't read a book in
like fucking 15 years, man.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.380
I just finished your book,
and they're like, thank you.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.580
And so like that was a big goal.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.020
And then on the same topic
of reading, a lot of people

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:37.460
don't cook in their life.

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.570
And so we wanted
to create recipes

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:44.320
where after you read the
chapter, the recipes,

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:47.520
you could approach them and not
only theoretically make them,

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.640
but you would make
them, they would

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.130
become a part of your life.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.025
And so there was no
showboating here.

00:17:54.025 --> 00:17:55.400
I just flipped to
this right now,

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.230
but the ghetto Pillsbury
donuts are a perfect example.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.610
Just creating recipe
that are gateways.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.950
This is literally, you go
and get Pillsbury dough

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:05.730
and you put it in hot oil.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.600
That's all you do.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.220
But there's a lot
of tongue in cheek.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.690
There's a lot of playing around.

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.740
What it is it's a gateway.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.520
Because if you do
this, all you're doing

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.050
is putting dough
inside fried oil.

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.630
But if you do it,
what happens is one,

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.360
you yield a beautiful,
delicious product.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.310
And then secondly,
what happens is

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.200
you're actually learning
about cooking technique

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.550
without it feeling
like you're learning,

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.162
or feeling like it's a lecture.

00:18:36.162 --> 00:18:37.620
You're actually
having fun with it.

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.220
So that's what a lot of
these recipes are about.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:43.750
But just to end this
real quick, I'll

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:48.630
read you a little excerpt
of the chapter that

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:49.820
actually got us the deal.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:56.640
This chapter is called
"You Very Lucky Man."

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.720
And this deals with
a period of my life

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.690
in my early '20s when I
got addicted to gambling.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:05.790
We have car clubs here
in Los Angeles-- Commerce

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.316
Club, Bicycle Club, used
to be Normandy Club,

00:19:08.316 --> 00:19:09.190
it's now the Hustler.

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.440
Yeah, it's not like
Vegas in these clubs.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:23.240
They're like quicksand
and black holes.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:27.110
Once you enter these worlds, is
really, really hard to escape.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:31.690
So it starts off,
"You very lucky, man.

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:34.320
I didn't mean to get
into gambling, I swear.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.000
I told you, he's the best.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.680
By the time I got
back from New York,

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.570
it was the end of January 1991.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:43.010
I had nowhere to go other
than back to school.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.180
So there I was, a 21-year-old
junior majoring in philosophy

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.640
and studying logic.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.890
I figured I'd try to stay
clean, now hit the books,

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.190
get it right.

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:56.270
But try as I might, school
was as boring as shit,

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:57.769
and my mind started to wander.

00:19:57.769 --> 00:19:59.810
I looked up some guys I
knew from high school who

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:01.230
were studying at
UCLA and ended up

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.000
moving in with the
Korean kid I met back

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.940
in honors English, Paul.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.340
Week after week, we wasted
time playing video games,

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:10.590
trying to get laid, partying
hard, drinking harder.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.910
Then he and his crew
started to hit the casinos.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.650
At first I was just
going along for the ride.

00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:16.770
Home run, all the way!"

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:19.324
These quotes are like what
they say at the casinos.

00:20:19.324 --> 00:20:20.740
When you went in,
they were always

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.450
patting you on the
back and stuff.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.020
"Home run, all the way.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.820
But the instant I sat down at
the table and felt the felt,

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.640
I was jolted out of my routine.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.810
Everything suddenly
became new, alive, fresh.

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:35.500
I could smoke, drink, watch
sports, gamble, talk shit,

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.220
make friends, flirt and eat.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.170
Time didn't exist.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:39.450
Neither did judgments.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:41.640
Only possibilities and action.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.680
The amenities just
made it sweeter.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:47.550
Pats on the back, massages,
cheers, ladies, and the food.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.665
Oh man, and the
motherfucking food, man.

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:52.180
The 710 freeway
runs north to south

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:54.140
along the eastern
outskirts of Los Angeles,

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.620
connecting the
San Gabriel Valley

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.296
to the ports of Long Beach.

00:20:57.296 --> 00:20:59.170
The Bicycle Club-- or,
as we like to call it,

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.245
The Bike-- is
located off the 710

00:21:01.245 --> 00:21:04.630
in the industrial section
of South Los Angeles.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:06.750
On the way there
from almost anywhere

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.420
in L.A., Orange County,
or the Inland Empire,

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.680
you drive past South Gate,
Huntington Park, Vernon,

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.240
Cudahy, Paramount,
Gardena, Commerce, Bell

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.990
Gardens, and Bell-- places
that were cattle ranches

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.590
and farmland before they
morphed into lower-middle class

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:24.830
towns submerged
in smog and dust,

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.360
dominated by raw
industry-- meat packing,

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.600
smelt, metal, rubber,
food processing.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.730
The Florence avenue exit
takes you off the 710 almost

00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:35.290
directly to The Bike.

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:39.010
The lights flash on the sign
like any one of the oozing neon

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.670
signs lining the
Las Vegas strip.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.280
There are three entrances to
The Bike-- two in the front,

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.380
one in the back.

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.050
It should be easy to just
walk in the goddamn building,

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:51.330
but when you've gambled so
much that it affects you mind,

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.930
body, and soul, everything
feels like Monty Hall asking you

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:55.200
for a door number.

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.970
I choose a door based on what
the spirits or glow of luck

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:58.920
dictated.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.360
Some days, I knew
the big deal was

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.020
hidden behind door number three.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.900
Other days, store number one
pulled me in like a vacuum.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.110
No matter the
door, you instantly

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:09.450
feel the sense of place
the minute you enter.

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.920
The beetle-black heads of
Chinese, Koreans, Vietnamese,

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:17.150
Mexicans, and Armenians crowded
the tables-- populations that

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:18.705
have both ready
access to the 710

00:22:18.705 --> 00:22:21.690
and a penchant for the casino's
Asian Pan Nine and Pai Gow

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:22.570
games.

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:25.520
There are some old timers, a
handful of fresh new faces,

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.660
college kids, and
blue-collar workers.

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:31.910
There are hangers on,
trolls with sunken eyes

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:34.870
and furrowed brows who stand
behind rails overlooking

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:35.820
the tables.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:39.700
They throw out sycophantic
words of encouragement

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.790
in hopes of catching
crummy tips.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:44.860
Rail birds squawking
at the action.

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.640
There's a pulsating white noise
of murmuring chatter, chips

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.760
clicking and clacking,
the squeaking wheels

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:52.310
of the candy girls' carts
rolling from one player

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:53.290
to another.

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:56.340
The place is huge and separated
into three major rooms.

00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.940
The poker room and Asian games
room flank the Dragon room.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.170
This room is the home of
the big city gangsters.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.230
The Hong Kong and
Vegas big shots

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:06.740
were the lucky bastards who
won temporary riches elsewhere

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.940
in the casino and decided to
swim here with the sharks.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.560
When I first started, you could
have found me day after day,

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.660
night after night, in
the Asian games room.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.880
At ease amongst
residents who many

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.490
may refer to as social
deviants-- prostitutes, drug

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:25.470
addicts, delinquents, criminals,
gypsies, carnies, bums,

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.530
drunks sat in those
chairs, congregated

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.220
around those tables,
touched those cards.

00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:32.970
Say what you will and
make your judgments,

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:37.380
but understand that there, even
in the underbelly of the city,

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:40.250
the ethics of the game-- the
challenge-- reign supreme.

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:43.580
You could leave $150,000
in chips on a card table,

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.280
walk away, take a
piss, and come back

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.190
to find your money
untouched, as if it

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:49.230
had been insured by the FDIC.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:52.530
Try doing that a Google party.

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:55.920
On my first day at The
Bike, I started with $150.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.850
The game was Pan Nine.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:59.250
Ten players are at the
table, each with the goal

00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:01.180
to beat the dealer
at his own game.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.530
Each player gets three cards,
with one more optional.

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.820
The object is to add up
the value of the cards

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.020
and get the sum of nine.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.790
Face cards are worth zero.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:13.680
If you're Vietnamese and you
see a face card, all you say is,

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:17.610
[SPEAKING VIETNAMESE], which
loosely translates as, fuck me.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:18.570
I won.

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:20.630
I won again and again.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.110
And I was on the street
fresh out of the gate.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:26.610
I turned that 150 to
500 in 10 minutes.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:30.590
I went from small $100
hands to huge $10,000 hands

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:31.950
and never looked back.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:33.150
I should've looked back.

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:36.490
I should have reaped
my rewards and left

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:39.300
behind that room filled with
the hollow eyes and big nostrils

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.560
of Southeast Asia.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.540
But I didn't.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:42.960
Fuck the odds, I thought.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.850
Fuck fate.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:45.140
I was doomed from the start.

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:47.050
[SPEAKING VIETNAMESE]"

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:52.116
So from here, that was like our
splash into our sample chapter.

00:24:52.116 --> 00:24:53.740
And then from here,
it really takes you

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:58.290
through the food of the casinos,
then through the addiction,

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:00.400
then through the fall,
and then where I end up

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:04.090
is basically I lost everything,
burned every bridge,

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:06.490
and then I was down at the end.

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:10.070
And the book is also
about certain saviors.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.460
Like, my parents were there.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.124
And then my friends
and my family

00:25:14.124 --> 00:25:15.290
pulled me out of the casino.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:21.800
It's a pretty heavy
book, so don't we

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.281
read it to your kids
at night unless they're

00:25:24.281 --> 00:25:25.280
going through some shit.

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:32.480
And it ends right when
the Kogi truck starts.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.800
That's pretty much "L.A. Son."

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.280
I'm proud of what it's done
so far in the first month.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.970
It just came out in the
beginning of November.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:44.680
I'm really proud of what it's
done for the first month.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.830
It's really put a voice
out there for the city

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:50.045
and also for the struggle.

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:58.475
I think it inspired not only
people who are reading it,

00:25:58.475 --> 00:26:00.785
but inspired our
publishers, as well,

00:26:00.785 --> 00:26:03.035
to get behind a book that
was a little unconventional.

00:26:06.882 --> 00:26:07.465
Any questions?

00:26:10.995 --> 00:26:11.495
Yes.

00:26:11.495 --> 00:26:14.814
AUDIENCE: Do you know what
you said [INAUDIBLE] talk?

00:26:14.814 --> 00:26:21.854
[INAUDIBLE] your
thoughts on where

00:26:21.854 --> 00:26:25.291
you see food going in terms
of accessibility [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:25.291 --> 00:26:29.701
in the next 10, 15 years,
where you see yourself in that?

00:26:29.701 --> 00:26:30.201
[INAUDIBLE].

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:38.290
ROY CHOI: I think it's
first-- for the evolution

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:43.140
in the development of food, I
think one of the first steps

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:46.100
as we have to have open
conversations about it.

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:56.600
That was the biggest
kind of hurdle and thing

00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:01.800
I was thinking about
right before I went out

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:08.400
to Copenhagen, was I didn't know
how the chef community would

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.040
react to the speech.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.750
But I just knew I
had to tell them.

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:17.400
I didn't really care whether
or exiled me or not afterwards.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.990
But I think first,
just talking about it.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.220
For me, I'm only one person.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.840
I would love to continue
to stay involved.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.950
I think where I want to move in
the next five to 10 years is,

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:33.380
instead of it just being a
physical thing for me where I'm

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:37.650
actually out there just
hand-to-mouth feeding people,

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:42.710
which I'll always do, sparking
smart people like yourself

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:45.550
for us to collectively
not only talk about it,

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:49.270
but come up with systems
and new processes

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:51.920
to figure these things out.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.090
Combine technology.

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:54.850
Combine engineering.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:28:03.480
New modules and serving
systems and thoroughfare

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.410
some pathways to actually
feed communities.

00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:11.840
Not thinking that
everything has to be

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.240
exactly the way we
currently eat right now.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.010
So that's really what I see.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:20.630
I think it's taking
vacant lots, creating

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:24.470
the kind of like Hawker Centres.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:27.330
Creating outdoor eating
environments for us

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:29.890
to congregate and eat.

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:35.450
Maybe almost creating
shells, almost like library

00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:36.580
cubicles, or whatever.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:41.880
Or almost like co-op shells.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.520
You guys at Google
can design them.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.950
Really, really cool shit.

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:50.640
Where you can go in and then
develop concepts, or try out

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.540
concepts of food.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:56.190
The main thing is,
we have to make food

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.000
a part of the culture.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.660
I think another angle
that you guys can really

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:03.000
help-- especially
not just Google,

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.190
but your guys' world--
is through our messaging

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:11.610
and our media and
advertising and corporations.

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:13.710
Making food a part
of pop culture.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:17.180
Because the thing about the
accessibility and the landscape

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:21.610
of food and the disparities
is it's not just about money.

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:25.800
It's about messaging and
importance and culture.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.750
Because even though
there are neighborhoods

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:30.810
that don't have that
much money, there's

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:33.250
still enough money to buy junk.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:37.380
There's still enough money
to buy sodas and junk

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:40.750
and also phones and products
that you guys are creating.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:42.340
There's still money to buy that.

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.840
So it's really maybe just
taking some of our energy

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:50.160
and focusing some of our
skills on making food

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.445
a part of that conversation.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.900
So I'd like to get
involved with that.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:30:01.920
I want to use whatever resources
I have-- ground level and also

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:02.730
top scale.

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:03.690
Musicians, artists.

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:09.020
Use my agency.

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.220
Use foundations.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:16.100
Try to create a
full 360 map for it.

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:21.540
I think it's going to
take at least-- Matt,

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:25.090
I mentioned the five year cycle
because I lived through it.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:29.040
I'm not an intellectual,
but I can only

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.540
tell you from
first-hand experience,

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:36.060
I saw a whole world change in
front of my eyes in five years.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:39.220
A lot of you guys weren't eating
off trucks five years ago,

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.970
straight up.

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:41.650
But you are now.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:47.740
So now we're saying,
we have food deserts

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.870
where we're not getting
food to the right places.

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:52.590
But if we change
that in five years,

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:56.290
we may not be having that
same conversation anymore.

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:56.790
Yes.

00:30:56.790 --> 00:31:01.427
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
special about now?

00:31:01.427 --> 00:31:03.260
ROY CHOI: I think it's
a generational thing.

00:31:08.656 --> 00:31:10.330
A lot of us are
going through it now.

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:18.470
So you hear all the comparisons
of it being like music.

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:24.220
Everyone is interested in food.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.900
I think it's because
it's a human thing.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.290
It's us.

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:30.989
We grew up.

00:31:30.989 --> 00:31:32.030
I think it's the economy.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:36.860
It's also a lot of the
things that you guys

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.150
are involved with, the
ability to share these things

00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:41.350
immediately.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:46.570
And then just from
our generation

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:52.730
some walls broken down to
where we are not-- our energies

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:56.050
aren't focused on
the same things

00:31:56.050 --> 00:32:01.430
maybe previous generations are,
like exclusivity or just things

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:06.690
equating price with excellence.

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:10.840
And so I think all of
that converged together.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.892
Also, just growing up.

00:32:12.892 --> 00:32:13.850
Generations growing up.

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:15.540
People got smarter.

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:16.630
The chefs grew up.

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:22.160
The chefs actually trained.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.150
So if you want to break it back
down to some specific things,

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:28.930
is we're a very young
eating culture in America.

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:36.650
This whole new wave started
about what, 15 years ago?

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:40.370
Because I remember when I was
in culinary school in '97, '98,

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:44.120
not that many people were
interested in the food

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.620
that they are now,
especially media.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:47.661
And especially-- let's
just take even a microcosm

00:32:47.661 --> 00:32:48.740
of that-- Asian.

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.500
Asian Americans.

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:51.610
They were not into food.

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:54.210
But now you go to
restaurants-- like I just

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:56.200
went to Bestia the other
night-- like fucking

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.550
80% of their dining
room were Asian kids,

00:32:58.550 --> 00:32:59.890
like Asian American kids.

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:01.170
I was like, damn.

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:04.224
But when I was in
culinary school,

00:33:04.224 --> 00:33:06.640
I was like one of the only
Asian dudes in culinary school.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.200
Now I just went
back to CIA, it's

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:11.560
like half Asian
American kids there.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.820
But that's just one
small microcosm.

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:16.230
I think the thing
is, what happened

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:20.390
is a lot of chefs in the
previous generation went out

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:25.740
to stage and to work in
Europe in different places.

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.960
And they came back
and work in kitchens.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.850
And our whole--
obviously, we didn't

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:32.730
have social media and stuff.

00:33:32.730 --> 00:33:34.890
The life of a cook
was very insular.

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.820
So we lived within, like,
a martial arts code.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.020
So we trained under a chef,
whether it was in New York

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.070
or in Europe, and we
worked our way up,

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:46.640
and everything just
stay very inside.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.820
But what happened was
it just all conversed.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:52.190
It was a perfect storm.

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:56.590
A lot of these chefs,
they worked their stages.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:58.290
It was time for
them to expand out.

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.945
Social media happened.

00:34:03.945 --> 00:34:09.260
The ingredients start-- and
then the economy crashed.

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:10.770
You guys started making money.

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:11.679
You're young.

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:13.260
You wanted different things.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.520
All those things came
together, and now we're here.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:19.699
But now I think it's a
chance to-- since we're here,

00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:24.010
and we're so interested by it,
it's a chance to really like

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:27.750
dissect it and take it
apart, and really look at,

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:28.750
has it changed?

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:32.580
Or are we just
another reflection

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.580
of a privileged society?

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.554
It's just cooler and funner.

00:34:36.554 --> 00:34:38.179
Because there are
still the same people

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:40.030
that aren't getting food.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:43.160
But I think it's
all those things.

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:43.659
Yes.

00:34:50.337 --> 00:34:52.245
AUDIENCE: What are
your thoughts on Yelp

00:34:52.245 --> 00:34:57.270
and how chefs in L.A.
react to Yelp reviews?

00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:00.200
ROY CHOI: Yelp reviews.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.960
Yelp is a tough thing for me
because I'm a little older

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.540
and I don't get the
passive aggressive shit.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:09.260
Like, I really don't get that.

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:14.070
I come from a generation-- an
O.G. Generation of you say what

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.810
you mean, or you
back up what you say.

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:18.780
The thing about Yelp
for me that's difficult

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:23.050
is how a lot of
the reviewers can't

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:27.100
stay upon one razor's edge.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:31.790
Like, they say, you suck, but
I'll give you another chance,

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:35.530
but then I would never go back,
but if someone paid I would,

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:40.650
but only if they
paid all the way.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:43.270
If I had to leave a
tip, I wouldn't go back.

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:46.240
But then if it was
a family member

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.910
and they were a little
down, then maybe I would.

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:52.590
And they always give like
one trap door after another.

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:54.800
So I think for me on
Yelp it's the trap doors.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.156
Like, if the place
sucks, say it sucks.

00:35:57.156 --> 00:35:59.030
And if you say you're
never going to go back,

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:00.740
fucking stand
behind those words.

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:03.440
But don't say you're never
going to go back and say

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.120
you would if someone
else would pay for it.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.130
So for me, that's Yelp.

00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:14.090
It's so fucking like--
I don't know, man.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:15.570
It's a yellow streak.

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:18.650
It's just so cowardly.

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:20.720
But it's a great
resource as far as

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:27.210
like a soundbite for
people to look at something

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:30.250
and say, oh, here's a list.

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:33.980
As far chefs go, I can
only speak for myself,

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.760
but I feel like I
understand chef culture

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:41.460
in L.A. I don't look
at Yelp that much.

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:45.780
Because as much as that
is a wishy-washy kind

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.400
of environment, chefs
are the exact opposite.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:53.650
We are like this is what
I'm cooking for you.

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:55.290
I think it's delicious.

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:57.650
And I hope you like it.

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:00.520
If you don't, tell me
why you don't like it,

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:03.650
and I may listen to
you or I may not.

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:09.500
So on for chef to read
Yelp and structure

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.260
their business or their
kitchen behind that-- man,

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:15.460
we would just pull our hair out.

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:18.691
Because I don't understand if
you like me or not, and that's

00:37:18.691 --> 00:37:19.440
the biggest thing.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.750
So we don't really
pay attention to it.

00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:23.480
I think some of
the front of house

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:27.990
does, and uses it as
a model or as a marker

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:32.540
to see whether or not so they
need to make improvements

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:35.250
in their restaurants
or their facilities.

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:36.970
But most people on
the industry, they

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:41.650
look at Yelp over a period
of an average period.

00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:43.650
So they'll take the
good with the bad,

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:46.980
and try to find is there
pattern or algorithm to it.

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:48.620
And then if there
is an algorithm,

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:49.590
maybe that is a truth.

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:56.511
So that's how we
feel about Yelp.

00:37:56.511 --> 00:37:57.010
Yes.

00:38:02.062 --> 00:38:03.770
AUDIENCE: You partnered
earlier this year

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:07.970
with Three Worlds cafe to
serve in South Central.

00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:10.770
Do you have plans
to expand out to

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:12.165
other underserved communities?

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:19.570
ROY CHOI: Yeah, I mean
I'm trying, definitely.

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:22.090
But I need help.

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:26.660
So I need help.

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:29.410
I need help in all aspects.

00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:33.030
And I don't even want
to be the leader of it.

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:35.040
I just want to be a part of it.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:38.160
I'm not doing it as a
crusade or anything.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:44.970
I'm just doing it because
it's just a part of what I do.

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:46.940
It's the people I care about.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:49.130
These are my friends
and neighbors.

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:56.750
But I'm doing everything
I can and trying

00:38:56.750 --> 00:39:04.870
to-- but the thing is, we
need other chefs to do it

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:06.950
in their cities.

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:11.040
Again, we need to use some
of your guys' brainpower

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:16.990
to focus our energies to
figure out how we can just

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:20.290
get food a little
more accessible.

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:21.875
I think that's the first step.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:28.090
We throw so much money
and so many resources--

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:36.890
let's take, for example,
skateboarding events,

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:38.030
or whatever.

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:40.600
We throw so much money
and fill their bodies

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:44.410
with energy drinks.

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:48.830
And these kids, they go back
home to fucking nothing.

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:56.210
And so it's really about just
shifting some of our priorities

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:58.630
and some of our energies
and our brainpower to like,

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:04.180
OK, let's continue to use this
marketing monster and animal,

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:09.580
but maybe figure out
a way to also make

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:14.530
food a little more
relative to culture.

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:17.370
So I need help on that end.

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:24.080
I need help as far as resources,
generating money and capital,

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:28.000
to get business owners
and companies to help

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.250
us build business
plans and programs that

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:33.830
aren't solely based upon profit.

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:36.574
That's a huge mountain to climb.

00:40:36.574 --> 00:40:37.990
Everyone's going
this way, and I'm

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:39.750
telling everyone, go that way.

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:42.850
So I don't know.

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:45.170
I'm just starting.

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:46.200
I'm doing what I can.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.550
Maybe in the next two
years, gather as many people

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:51.490
as I can together and
try to influence change,

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:55.250
but I can't stop now.

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:59.539
I woke up with it
a couple years ago.

00:40:59.539 --> 00:41:01.080
When you read this
book, you see it's

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.621
been a part of my
life my whole life,

00:41:02.621 --> 00:41:09.740
but this whole moment happened
to me on the anniversary

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.360
of the L.A. riots a
year and a half ago.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.840
I woke up and I
was like fuck, man.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.230
This shit is horrible.

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.995
It's horrible.

00:41:24.239 --> 00:41:26.030
You guys have to relate
to this situation--

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:29.041
if you walk through south
central Los Angeles,

00:41:29.041 --> 00:41:30.540
what you'll walk
through is not only

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:32.890
the disparity of
food and options,

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:38.250
but you also walk through an
educational system that is not

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:44.410
fostering advancement
and growth and learning.

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:48.160
So I was walking through it,
and I just woke up that day,

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.740
and I was just like,
this shit is horrible.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:52.120
We're feeding them shit.

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.380
We're shoving them
in classrooms.

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:57.600
And we're not really
teaching them and giving them

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.190
the resources to
thrive and succeed.

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:01.890
So I was like, OK.

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:07.620
Let me do whatever little
I can do to at least try

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:09.920
to move that needle
over a little bit.

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.950
So ever since then, I've
just been doing that.

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:13.500
We started with the fruit.

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.410
Moved into a cafe.

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:22.860
Continue to use the truck
as a touchstone for the city

00:42:22.860 --> 00:42:23.830
to connect to.

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:30.670
I spoke about it in Copenhagen,
and I'm also now trying

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:33.700
to use whatever resources
I have through this book,

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:38.060
and also through whatever
agency I'm affiliated with

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.660
to try to get foundations going.

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.160
Big thing, long
story short, is I'm

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.080
going to try to start
my own nonprofit now.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.810
So that was the biggest
revelation for me

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:50.620
over the last six months was
I thought that you could only

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:53.080
start a nonprofit
if you were a rich.

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:56.240
But I found out that you
can start it any time.

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.540
I really didn't know that shit.

00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:59.760
I really didn't know.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.030
I thought it was this arc.

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:03.700
Like you had to get
really, really rich,

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.547
and then you start a nonprofit.

00:43:05.547 --> 00:43:07.380
I found you could start
at any time in life,

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:08.463
so I'm going to start one.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.336
Yes.

00:43:13.336 --> 00:43:16.288
AUDIENCE: After Kogi
started really happening,

00:43:16.288 --> 00:43:18.502
it seemed like all the
restaurants and trucks

00:43:18.502 --> 00:43:23.176
in L.A. were sort of
Korean. [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:23.176 --> 00:43:25.636
spark a trend, or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:35.670
ROY CHOI: That question as
a few facets to the answer.

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:38.400
A lot of people only write
about the gourmet food truck

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:44.210
movement, but what it did-- not
only did it feed the streets

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:47.740
and create great eating options
for yourselves at lunch--

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:49.230
and you can just
see if you go over

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:51.605
by your old offices on
26th and Pennsylvania

00:43:51.605 --> 00:43:55.040
over there, Santa Monica.

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:59.870
But it also created a whole
wave of entrepreneurs,

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:02.970
young entrepreneurs.

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:06.630
Back four years ago,
I read about it,

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:10.860
but like Kogi opened up kind
of a spiritual gateway for me.

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.110
I could almost feel it,
almost like in a movie.

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:16.630
Like I just imagined people just
getting up out of their cubicle

00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:18.640
and walking the fuck
out of the office

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.310
and then starting
a waffle truck.

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:25.120
And that happened in multitudes
in every city across America.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:29.480
And so I'm really proud
that, five years later,

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.800
I close my eyes and imagine how
many people out there started

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.770
a whole new life
because of this.

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:38.440
I mean, there's got
be like thousands.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:42.760
Thousands of new lives that
have been created where they're

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:46.730
out there right now in
Seattle serving food, and four

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:48.050
years ago they were miserable.

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:50.590
And they're having the time
of their life right now.

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:52.820
I'm really, really
happy about that.

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:58.990
As far as the actual duplicate
of the taco-- it's weird, man.

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:04.500
Everyone's had every-- it's
almost like-- I went out there.

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:06.260
I put everything
out there, naked.

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:08.760
Like every recipe of Kogi is
out there in the universe,

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.210
but in five years, no one's
been able to replicate it.

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:17.660
And I think because Kogi
is not just the food.

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:21.500
It's something else.

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:23.397
I mean, you guys understand.

00:45:23.397 --> 00:45:25.230
You work for a company
that represents that.

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:26.410
It's something else.

00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:27.560
It's not one thing.

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.340
It's everything.

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.910
You are a part of Kogi.

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:32.550
I'm a part of Kogi.

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:34.410
My team members, the
food, the flavor.

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:37.030
But also the street,
the environment.

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:38.490
The chase.

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:40.600
The Twitter.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:41.440
The connection.

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:44.970
The conversations that happen
in line, sitting on the corner.

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:46.140
All those things.

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.830
The culture.

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:50.780
You can't just replicate that.

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:52.740
It is its own beast.

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:56.440
And I think that's why no
one's been able to do it.

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.800
Also, the food is very personal.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.920
You have the recipe for
salsa verde or whatever,

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:06.540
but the Kogi taco
itself is actually

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:08.330
like a piece of my skin.

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:10.970
It's like a fingerprint.

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:14.820
It's just an expression of
what I went through in life.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:19.080
And the style of Kogi
itself-- that's the food.

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:21.630
The style of Kogi
is a fingerprint

00:46:21.630 --> 00:46:24.450
of our team members,
of who we are.

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:29.810
I feel like if anyone
could have copied it,

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:31.980
they should have been able
to figure it out by now,

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:32.688
and they haven't.

00:46:32.688 --> 00:46:35.170
So I'm cool with that.

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:37.880
I'm not even mad.

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.800
Yeah.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.380
AUDIENCE: I think what makes
your food great is it's just

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.800
a fusion of a lot of
different parts of L.A.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:49.020
and just parts of different
cultures without explicitly

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:51.700
being fusion, like
combining these two cultures

00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:55.470
and just combining
what tastes good.

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:57.840
Like Chago, which
will severely be

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:01.174
missed on the West Side is an
expression of that, I think.

00:47:01.174 --> 00:47:02.590
When you come up
with new recipes,

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:07.777
do you play to what you're
familiar with, with Korean

00:47:07.777 --> 00:47:10.840
and Mexican street
food in L.A., or do you

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:16.080
explore other-- use
other tastes to try

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:17.668
to combine them into recipes?

00:47:17.668 --> 00:47:23.100
Is it an exploration
or more what just--

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:26.860
ROY CHOI: I'm in a very
fortunate place right now,

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:29.190
and I don't take
anything for granted as

00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:31.830
far as creative development.

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:35.410
Man, like what happened
to me five years ago,

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:38.740
it unlocked something in me.

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:44.270
So now the whole universe
is up for grabs for me.

00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:45.890
So it's like a DJ now for me.

00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:49.340
I just, I pull and take
anything I can or want.

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:54.370
And so I'm not trying to
adhere to any authenticity

00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:55.390
to anything.

00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:57.090
I just have a goal
of making food that's

00:47:57.090 --> 00:48:01.535
delicious and as
powerful as possible.

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.660
I just follow my gut on things.

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:10.580
Like, if I had a
plan for anything,

00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:15.270
I would've rode the Kogi wave
and been the next Chipotle,

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:16.050
or whatever.

00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:19.460
But everything I've opened
since then have been different.

00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:22.125
Because they've just
been like these--

00:48:22.125 --> 00:48:23.500
you'll read it
when you guys read

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:24.916
this book-- these
wake up moments.

00:48:24.916 --> 00:48:27.460
Just wake up, like, sunny spot.

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:28.990
Wake up and go, shit.

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:30.720
I want to cook Jamaican food.

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:34.789
And so it's just like I
go off on that tangent.

00:48:34.789 --> 00:48:36.830
And then when I go off on
that tangent, what I do

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:40.670
is I just open up all my
senses and everything.

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:43.830
I try to pull in
everything about what

00:48:43.830 --> 00:48:46.170
it means to cook Caribbean food.

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:49.620
Not just the cooking part of
it, but the culture, the music,

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:52.910
the people, the history, the
pain, the struggle, the joys,

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:53.840
all that stuff.

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.550
I try to pull that in the food.

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:58.170
And I think that's the flavor
of what we try to cook.

00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:01.670
That's why you can't pinpoint
where does it become Korean

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:03.280
or where does it become Mexican.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.850
Because there is no
pinpoint to that.

00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:08.630
It actually represents
Los Angeles.

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:10.520
So it's like,
traveling from here,

00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:13.540
if we take Venice Bo--
I'll end it like this.

00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:15.900
I like to equate it, like,
if you take Venice Boulevard

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:18.800
down-- if you start here
and you end up down at Pico

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:23.670
Union on Venice-- where
can you really pinpoint

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:24.430
where it changes?

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:30.240
You can see it change, but
it's all still Los Angeles.

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:31.980
It all represents Los Angeles.

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:36.310
And I think that's what
my food is right now.
