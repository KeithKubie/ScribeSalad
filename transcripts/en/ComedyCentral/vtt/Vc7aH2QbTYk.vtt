00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.501
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:02.428
- How many people have you killed,

00:00:02.428 --> 00:00:03.860
what do you think, in your life?

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.693
On purpose?

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.340
- I don't.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.770
On purpose, like.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.630
Well, I really feel bad about

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.740
all the insects I've killed in my life.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.565
- Insects, yeah.

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:16.604
- Yeah, I look back and I'm like,

00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:17.960
I didn't need to kill those spiders

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.230
or stomp on things.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.950
I hate all that now.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.580
The other day, this is a true story,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.110
I reached peak vegan.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.640
The other day, there was a house centipede

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.480
drowning in my bathtub
when I was taking a shower.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.534
You know a house centipede,

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:34.630
they're like the grossest bug ever.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.470
And I was like, I gotta save it

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.320
because if I think I'm,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.690
if I love every creature,
gotta save this thing.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.400
Why would I force it to drown?

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.330
So I went and I got a paper towel.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.330
I was so scared.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.100
I used to have the biggest
phobia of these things,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.450
so the fact that I was picking it up,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.190
I was really proud of
myself, and I was like,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.800
I'm gonna damp it off and get it cleaned.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.400
And I pulled back the paper
towel and I'm really scared.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.790
I was naked and afraid, and I'm like.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.264
And it was a clump of
pubes that I had rescued,

00:01:03.264 --> 00:01:05.705
that I had fully almost given CPR to.

00:01:05.705 --> 00:01:06.538
- That scares me.

00:01:06.538 --> 00:01:07.803
- It was like a lock.

00:01:07.803 --> 00:01:08.636
- It was house pubes.
- It was a giant lock.

00:01:08.636 --> 00:01:09.820
- How many legs did it have?

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.610
- Kevin Nealon is here.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.560
It's a big deal.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.470
I was saying yesterday,

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.904
I can't believe I'm like friends with you.

00:01:19.904 --> 00:01:21.034
There are certain people

00:01:21.034 --> 00:01:22.289
you become friends with in this business,

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:24.173
and you're just like, you
never could have predicted it.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.099
- You never could have.

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:27.680
- And I'm honestly, I
feel friends with you.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.620
We went hiking the other day.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.453
- We did.

00:01:30.453 --> 00:01:31.286
On my hiking show.
- I did your show

00:01:31.286 --> 00:01:32.119
Hiking with Kevin.

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.320
Judah Friedlander, you
need to do that show.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.560
Do you hike?

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.393
- I can hike.

00:01:35.393 --> 00:01:36.517
- You can hike.

00:01:36.517 --> 00:01:37.350
- Are you a flat liner?

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.819
Do you flat line hike?

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:39.652
- I don't know what that means.

00:01:39.652 --> 00:01:40.768
- Flat line, flat trail.

00:01:40.768 --> 00:01:43.044
Or can you do inclines?
- Whatever, dude.

00:01:43.044 --> 00:01:44.251
Whatever you need, man.

00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:45.399
- You can do inclines?

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.770
- Dude, Earth, it's my
planet, whatever you need.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.320
- Earth is his planet.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.400
- It's just that some hikers, Nikki,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.130
seem like they're flat liners, I think,

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.580
a cup of coffee as they're
hiking or a can of Diet Coke.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.640
And that's cool.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.859
- And they just want to kind of,

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:00.800
just take it easy, just walk.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.627
It's more of a walk.

00:02:02.627 --> 00:02:03.650
- Where do you go hiking?

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.291
- We went hiking up in.

00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:08.480
- TreePeople, up at the
top of Fryman Canyon.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.380
- Yes, that's right.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.890
- Los Angeles.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.250
- So I went hiking with Kevin.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.083
He does an interview.

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:16.050
It's on his Instagram,
it's also on his YouTube.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.323
What's your?

00:02:17.323 --> 00:02:20.278
- YouTube channel, it's
youtube.com/kevinnealoncomedy

00:02:20.278 --> 00:02:21.470
or #HikingWithKevin.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.090
- Hiking with Kevin, you can find,

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.090
he interviews different
celebrities on a hike,

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.940
and it's all done by him.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.980
He could have another
camera there following,

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.900
there could be other stuff,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.392
but it's him with a selfie
stick, interviewing you.

00:02:33.392 --> 00:02:34.225
- And a drone.

00:02:34.225 --> 00:02:35.520
- And a drone.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.000
Now he's got a drone shot.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.232
I watched Kevin Nealon
struggle with a drone

00:02:39.232 --> 00:02:42.080
for about 40 minutes
until we got the shot.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.310
But we got the shot.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.200
- We got the shot until
it crashed into the tree.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.290
- Oh yeah, it did crash into a tree.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.330
- But it looks, the
shot, you gotta see it.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.360
We're coming down the hillside,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.220
and we had so much rain.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.540
The hillside is so green.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.894
It looks like the beginning
of The Sound of Music.

00:02:53.894 --> 00:02:54.727
- Yes.

00:02:54.727 --> 00:02:55.560
- Walking down the path.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.051
- I'm so excited to see it.

00:02:57.051 --> 00:02:57.884
So that will be out soon.

00:02:57.884 --> 00:03:00.470
But yeah, you have so many
great people on that show.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.326
And you, how did that show come about?

00:03:03.326 --> 00:03:06.770
- Well, I was friends with
Matthew Modine, still am,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.551
from Full Metal Jacket.

00:03:08.551 --> 00:03:11.520
And I called him one
day about two years ago.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.760
I said, hey man, you want to go for a hike

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.930
up in the canyon near my house?

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.763
He goes, sure.

00:03:15.614 --> 00:03:16.990
He lives not too far from me.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.760
So we meet and we're hiking,

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.120
and it's a pretty rugged hike.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.470
We're up near the top and it's steep

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.850
and we're both out of breath.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.670
And I thought of a funny bit
where I'm interviewing him.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.940
We're so out of breath we can't
understand either one of us.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.470
And I was just holding my
camera like that, video taping.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.650
And that was funny.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.300
And then, on the way down the backside,

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.020
I interviewed him some more.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.060
I said, Matt, do you ever turn down

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.940
any movies that you regret?

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.100
And he rolled his eyes, he goes,

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.650
oh my god, after Full Metal Jacket,

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.900
I was so picky, I turned
down the Michael J. Fox role

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.190
in Back to the Future,

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.910
I turned down the Tom Hanks role in Big,

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.920
Charlie Sheen role in Wall Street,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.010
and let's see, the Tom
Cruise role in Top Gun.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.490
I said, you idiot.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.260
We both laughed, and I posted
it on Instagram and Twitter.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.410
And people loved it.
- And people loved it.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.077
- And I just thought, I
should just hike with somebody

00:04:05.077 --> 00:04:06.109
different every week.

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:07.362
And then, Stern liked it.

00:04:07.362 --> 00:04:08.195
He goes, you should make it longer.

00:04:08.195 --> 00:04:09.610
And so, I started a YouTube channel.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.000
- Yes, and has it been fulfilling?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.938
- It has been so fulfilling.
- It's good?

00:04:14.938 --> 00:04:16.580
- Every Thursday, I post a hike.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.170
And I started creating seasons.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.410
So I'm in my second season now.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.817
In the first season, I did 31 hikes.

00:04:21.817 --> 00:04:22.650
- God.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.070
- And this one, I'm already
into the 20s, I think.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.070
- Who was the best hiker out of everyone?

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.903
- You.

00:04:26.903 --> 00:04:27.736
- Really?

00:04:27.736 --> 00:04:29.050
- You were the best

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.810
because first of all, you were so prompt.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.490
I go by promptness.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.830
- I want to put it out there.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:36.930
- Thank you, Judah.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.252
Start an applause break.
- And you're in

00:04:39.252 --> 00:04:40.700
such great shape.
- Thank you.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.910
- And you were so flexible
and you're so accommodating

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.581
and you were so conversational.

00:04:47.581 --> 00:04:48.414
- Thank you.

00:04:48.414 --> 00:04:49.490
That really means a lot.
- That you were just so easy.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.130
And you were patient when I
was trying to do the drone.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.440
- I just enjoy hanging
out with Kevin Nealon.

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.430
That was kind of what I was in it for.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.990
And then you gave me a bag of swag

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.806
that I actually loved.

00:05:01.806 --> 00:05:02.907
- You did?
- I was just saying

00:05:02.907 --> 00:05:03.930
how I don't love bags of swag anymore,

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.200
and I don't want them.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.715
But I really loved that.

00:05:06.715 --> 00:05:07.936
- What'd you get?
- You gave me a hat

00:05:07.936 --> 00:05:10.630
and a cool backpack and a
shirt that I've been wearing

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.840
that says Hiking with Kevin.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.245
- Really? You wore it?

00:05:13.245 --> 00:05:14.230
- And then you gave me two vegan bars,

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.400
not even knowing that
they were vegan probably.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.233
- No, I knew that.

00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:18.388
- You did?

00:05:18.388 --> 00:05:19.358
Oh my god, those were so good.

00:05:19.358 --> 00:05:20.395
- Because I saw on your Instagram

00:05:20.395 --> 00:05:21.230
that you like a certain
kind of protein bars.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.770
- Oh my god, Kevin, it was awesome,

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.940
so I didn't even know I was gonna,

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.700
and a $50 Starbucks card.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.460
How dare I forget.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.800
That was the best.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.670
I will never turn down a Starbucks card.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.530
That was awesome.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.130
- What do you like at Starbucks?

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.480
- Venti extra hot almond milk misto

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.130
with a sprinkle of powder and five stevia.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.120
- How many times do you have
to repeat that to the barista?

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.953
- I don't repeat it.

00:05:46.953 --> 00:05:48.420
I will order it on my mobile order

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.629
so as not to inconvenience anyone.

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:51.462
- Oh, that's the best.
- With me having to say it.

00:05:51.462 --> 00:05:52.993
- That's the best.

00:05:52.993 --> 00:05:53.826
I forgot about that service.
- It is the best.

00:05:53.826 --> 00:05:55.030
The mobile, if you're not
doing the mobile order.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.750
Judah, do you drink Starbucks?

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.060
- I don't drink coffee.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.534
- You don't?

00:05:59.534 --> 00:06:01.131
- I don't do caffeine or any other drugs.

00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:01.964
- How long has that been going on?

00:06:01.964 --> 00:06:03.630
- Legal or illegal.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:04.853
- No drugs?

00:06:04.853 --> 00:06:07.400
No caffeine your whole life?

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.380
- Straight edge.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.640
- Have you ever done it?

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.210
- I've done caffeine a
couple times in college.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.043
- ODs?

00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:17.960
- No, no, but I always
had a friend with me.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.413
- My problem is.

00:06:19.413 --> 00:06:21.050
- A shaman, a caffeine shaman?

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.800
- See Nikki, my problem is I don't,

00:06:23.813 --> 00:06:24.700
mine is very impulsive.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:25.660
I will go by a Starbucks and go,

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.499
oh, do I feel like coffee?

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:28.332
Yeah, I'll go in.

00:06:28.332 --> 00:06:29.610
So I don't have time
to pre-order and stuff.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.334
- Yeah, you're a normal person.

00:06:31.334 --> 00:06:32.430
- And I typically just
get a regular coffee.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.450
But I like it hot, I like it lawsuit hot.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.190
- I love it lawsuit hot.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:37.974
I need it so hot.

00:06:37.974 --> 00:06:40.310
That's why I order it extra hot.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.700
I take it hot because I chug everything,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.020
and it's the only way for me to slow down

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.591
and not have it done.
- You chug life.

00:06:47.591 --> 00:06:48.510
That's how you are in life.
- I chug life.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.343
- You chug life.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.809
- Yeah, I really do.

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:52.921
I'm a fast person.

00:06:52.921 --> 00:06:54.620
- Here's what you need to get.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.580
I just recently found out
about these coffee cups

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.460
that keep it hot for a long time.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.920
- Okay yes.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.340
I don't even think I need.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.556
I chug it.
- It keeps it hot.

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:04.389
You can have a sip in the morning

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:06.150
and then come back to it at
two o'clock in the afternoon

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.090
and it's still hot.
- I don't sip anything, Kevin.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:10.540
It is, if I start a
coffee, it will be done.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.770
I clean my plate every
time I start a meal.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.730
I don't leave, I don't
take my time with things.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:16.770
I rush things.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.491
- Do you have indigestion a lot?

00:07:18.491 --> 00:07:19.945
- No, no.

00:07:19.945 --> 00:07:20.778
- Wow, you have a good system.

00:07:20.778 --> 00:07:22.940
- I just remember as a kid.
- She's a fast chewer too.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.379
She chews fast.

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:25.871
- You talk fast.
- I remember as a kid

00:07:25.871 --> 00:07:28.310
being like, I talk fast,
I move fast, everything,

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.390
I really do everything way too fast.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.210
- When are you totally, besides sleeping,

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.570
shut down and relaxed?

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.060
You ever sit and.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.640
- When I meditate.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.180
- But that's kind of forced, isn't it?

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.160
- Yeah, who else?

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.700
Do you guys just sit and do?

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.450
I sit on my phone.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.090
But I'm fast on the phone.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:47.940
- Double thumber?

00:07:49.765 --> 00:07:50.883
- No, but that would be.

00:07:50.883 --> 00:07:51.716
That would expedite.
- You're not a double thumber?

00:07:51.716 --> 00:07:53.287
- No, are you?

00:07:53.287 --> 00:07:54.435
- Yeah.

00:07:54.435 --> 00:07:55.268
- You hold your phone

00:07:55.268 --> 00:07:56.260
like this?
- Sometimes I'll flip it

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.093
sideways, yeah I'll do two thumbs.

00:07:57.093 --> 00:07:58.881
Not all the time, but one thumb sometimes,

00:07:58.881 --> 00:07:59.965
sometimes it's two thumbs.

00:07:59.965 --> 00:08:01.687
Sometimes I got all 10
fingers going on it.

00:08:01.687 --> 00:08:02.670
- How big is your phone?

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.043
- It's a really tiny phone.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.563
It's a microchip phone.

00:08:07.634 --> 00:08:08.728
- That's so cool.

00:08:08.728 --> 00:08:10.084
- I keep it in my mouth.

00:08:10.084 --> 00:08:12.162
- That's good technique you
have, just good technique.

00:08:12.162 --> 00:08:13.864
- No, I would think
you're a double thumber.

00:08:13.864 --> 00:08:14.697
- I don't have hobbies.

00:08:14.697 --> 00:08:15.900
Do you guys have hobbies?
- You don't have a hobby?

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.580
- No I don't and I need to get some.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.298
Do you have any?

00:08:19.298 --> 00:08:20.131
- You should learn how to knit.

00:08:20.131 --> 00:08:20.964
- [Nikki] No.

00:08:20.964 --> 00:08:21.797
- Because that will slow you down.

00:08:21.797 --> 00:08:22.630
- That would slow me down.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.826
I just don't like, I
don't like the feeling of.

00:08:25.826 --> 00:08:26.690
- I know what your hobby is.
- The yarn.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.050
- It's Instagram.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:28.883
That's your hobby.
- Yeah it is.

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:29.890
Yeah, that's not a hobby.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:31.393
That doesn't count.

00:08:31.393 --> 00:08:32.489
- You have to count something as a hobby.

00:08:32.489 --> 00:08:33.930
- I can't.
- Do you read?

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:34.865
- Sometimes.

00:08:34.865 --> 00:08:37.200
- You don't like to sit down
and read a good mystery?

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.670
- No because.
- Do you get therapy?

00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:40.600
- I used to.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.620
- Why did you let that go?

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.550
Was that a hobby?

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:43.540
- That felt like a.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:46.439
I let it go because I had
a really bad therapist

00:08:46.439 --> 00:08:47.660
and then I had a therapist
that I just felt like,

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.730
this is about as good
as having a conversation

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.600
with one of my smart friends.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.440
Why am I paying for this
person to give me exactly what

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.260
all my intellectual friends give me?

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.660
- Why were you going to therapy?

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.810
- Because I want to be a better person,

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.540
I want to be happy, I don't
want to be in a relationship,

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.360
and I want to stop needing things

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.210
and I want to feel good about myself.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.118
- Get a hobby.
- That's a weird reason to go,

00:09:09.118 --> 00:09:11.290
but whatever.
(laughs)

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:13.316
- I mean, what's your hobby?

00:09:13.316 --> 00:09:14.617
And you can't say hiking now

00:09:14.617 --> 00:09:15.450
because now that's a part of your job.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.840
- When can I stop talking about hobbies?

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.880
I have so many hobbies.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.150
I love to sketch.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:20.916
- Yeah, that's true, you do.

00:09:20.916 --> 00:09:21.749
- I put caricatures on my Instagram,

00:09:21.749 --> 00:09:23.780
kevinnealonartwork.com.
- I do drawing too.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.230
I like drawing.
- Yeah, you do.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.960
- That's therapy in itself.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.490
I like to play, I play the
five-string banjo and the guitar

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:30.960
and I'm learning how
to play the piano now.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.700
I love playing the piano.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.500
I'm not even that good,
but I'm learning the scales

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.950
and my chords and stuff

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.397
because I figured
there's pianos everywhere

00:09:37.397 --> 00:09:40.410
and so many people play the
piano that it must be easy.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:42.780
- Yeah, I know, people
do play the piano a lot.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.940
And it doesn't seem easy.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.272
- It is.

00:09:46.272 --> 00:09:48.750
Once you get the idea, both
hands doing two different things

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.351
at the same time.

00:09:50.351 --> 00:09:52.484
- You're a double thumber,

00:09:52.484 --> 00:09:54.721
so you're a natural for the piano.

00:09:54.721 --> 00:09:56.103
- So let's recap.
- Guitar.

00:09:56.103 --> 00:09:57.521
I've tried to play guitar
so many times in my life.

00:09:57.521 --> 00:09:58.500
- You'd be a great guitar player.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.323
Just you'd look good playing the guitar.

00:10:00.323 --> 00:10:01.180
- Oh, I look so cool.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.770
I can play, I know chords,
but I have no rhythm.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.360
I can do all the fingering part.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.193
- Do you dance?

00:10:07.193 --> 00:10:08.480
Dancing With the Stars.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.683
- Yeah, and I got first voted off.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.493
- I thought you won first.

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.534
But you seem like you'd be
a good club dancer though.

00:10:18.534 --> 00:10:20.372
- No, no.

00:10:20.372 --> 00:10:21.205
- But you're athletic.

00:10:21.205 --> 00:10:22.038
I've seen you on.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:24.210
- I can run.
- American Ninja Warrior.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.543
- And I got last on that too.
- First, first.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.923
- I really did.

00:10:29.923 --> 00:10:31.013
I did the worst on that show too.

00:10:31.013 --> 00:10:32.324
- You're not afraid to do anything.

00:10:32.324 --> 00:10:33.157
- I'm not afraid to fail.
- You did my hike.

00:10:33.157 --> 00:10:34.490
You're not afraid to fail.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:35.960
- I'm good at running, I'm good at hiking,

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.390
but there's no Running with the Stars.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.352
Now there's Hiking with the Stars

00:10:39.352 --> 00:10:40.426
because you have that show.

00:10:40.426 --> 00:10:41.804
- I just realized what I love about you.

00:10:41.804 --> 00:10:42.637
- What?

00:10:42.637 --> 00:10:43.660
- You are open to do anything

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.690
because you want to explore

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.770
and you want to experience things.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:50.089
You do it all.

00:10:50.089 --> 00:10:51.450
What have you turned down lately?

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.810
- I've turned down quite a lot, no.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.410
- Nothing, you'll take anything.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.240
- I like Joan Rivers for that.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.200
I always heard Joan Rivers did anything,

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.860
and I did a rap battle show.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.351
I'll just, I'll do stuff that seems.

00:11:06.351 --> 00:11:07.444
- What was the rap battle?

00:11:07.444 --> 00:11:08.277
- It's called Drop the Mic.

00:11:08.277 --> 00:11:09.181
It's on TBS.

00:11:09.181 --> 00:11:10.014
- Oh yeah, okay.

00:11:10.014 --> 00:11:11.347
- It's fun, it was fun.

00:11:11.347 --> 00:11:12.180
- And it scared me.
- Who'd you do it against?

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:14.510
- Brad Williams, little person.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.011
- Yeah, yeah, I know Brad.

00:11:16.011 --> 00:11:17.144
- See, you do, you're open to do anything.

00:11:17.144 --> 00:11:18.045
I think if I had a show

00:11:18.045 --> 00:11:19.130
where I drag people along the street,

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:22.388
like with their jacket,
just drag them along

00:11:22.388 --> 00:11:23.380
for like three blocks,
you'd go, I'll do it.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.251
- Premiere episode, sign me up.

00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:26.447
That would be hilarious.

00:11:26.447 --> 00:11:28.500
I wouldn't have to do anything,

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.470
and I could look bad.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.150
A lot of doing these things
is you want to look good

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.820
and it's exhausting for
me to do hair and makeup.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:36.750
I feel like if I was on a show

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.920
where I'm being dragged on
the street by my jacket,

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.830
you should look a little disheveled.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.370
- But you came on my hiking,
you were like perfect.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.940
You looked perfect.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.470
Have you seen her legs?
- That's so nice.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:47.910
- I mean, in shape.

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.559
- Thank you.

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:50.392
I do have great legs.
- Pretty.

00:11:50.392 --> 00:11:52.470
Talks, keeps it going.
- I'm going to lean into

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.040
my legs now because I used
to hate my legs my whole life

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.600
and now I'm like, you know what,

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.510
I'm just gonna like them because.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:00.170
- Get them insured, please, for me.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.140
Will you please insure those legs?

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.630
- That's so nice, Kevin, oh my god.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.530
- I'm serious, at least the right leg.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:13.280
The left leg I wasn't crazy about.

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.340
- So what do you do for hobbies, Judah?

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.630
So you draw.

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:21.630
- Draw sometimes, read,
ping pong, I play ping pong.

00:12:22.304 --> 00:12:23.374
- Dude, I love ping pong.
- Yeah, you're really good at

00:12:23.374 --> 00:12:24.207
ping pong.
- I'm playing later today.

00:12:24.207 --> 00:12:25.040
- I'll play you anytime.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:25.873
- I'll play you today.
- I'll take you to

00:12:25.873 --> 00:12:27.101
the cleaners.

00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:27.934
- I'll play you today.

00:12:27.934 --> 00:12:28.907
I have my paddle with me right now.

00:12:28.907 --> 00:12:29.740
- I have my table with me.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.310
- Great.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:32.333
I have my net.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:35.470
There's actually this one ping pong place.

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.130
It's like a rec center in Queens.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.140
- Is that Susan Sarandon's place?

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.726
- The one I'm going to today is, yes, SPiN

00:12:42.726 --> 00:12:43.843
on 23rd Street.
- I got a locker there,

00:12:43.843 --> 00:12:45.430
I got a locker.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:47.620
- But this one place, there's
this one place in Queens,

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:51.740
it's like a rec center Y kind of a place.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:56.740
And from six to nine
or something at night,

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.730
they have ping pong, and it's
really competitive there.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:02.520
And there's a lot of regulars.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.100
And so, if you don't get
there right at the beginning,

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.516
you could wait an hour to play.

00:13:06.516 --> 00:13:08.640
So one time, so the
first time I got there,

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.560
I couldn't even get in because
there was so many people.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.420
And the second time I got there early

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.670
and I had a table and
then I realized the venue,

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.473
they provide the tables but
they don't provide the nets.

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:23.960
And then everyone's looking at me like

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.260
I'm the biggest idiot.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.150
They're like, you didn't
bring your own net?

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.523
And I'm like, no, I
usually don't bring a net.

00:13:30.602 --> 00:13:32.310
- I do that with tennis.
- So I couldn't play a game.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:33.630
- I have my own net for tennis,

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.502
but I don't have a ping pong net.

00:13:35.502 --> 00:13:36.335
I have my own paddle, do
you have your own paddle?

00:13:36.335 --> 00:13:38.059
- Yeah, I have it right here.

00:13:38.059 --> 00:13:38.892
- Sweet, man.

00:13:38.892 --> 00:13:40.370
I don't want to brag, but in college,

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:41.660
I was on the table tennis team.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.984
We played Yale and schools like that.

00:13:44.984 --> 00:13:47.350
- Yale's known for
having one of the weaker

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:48.470
table tennis teams.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.780
- No, this was back in the 1900s.

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.800
Do you have a sandpaper paddle

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.180
or is it the foam?
- I do.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.510
It's in storage though.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.963
I'm in the middle of trying to move.

00:13:59.963 --> 00:14:01.197
- Look at you.

00:14:01.197 --> 00:14:03.166
- Ian, are you pong-er?

00:14:03.166 --> 00:14:04.190
What do you call it?

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.146
- That's fine, anything you want.

00:14:06.146 --> 00:14:07.320
- I like playing ping pong.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.153
- But is there a normal thing to call it?

00:14:08.153 --> 00:14:10.130
Is there a cool word for
people who play ping pong?

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.640
- Have you ever watched on YouTube

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.640
table tennis, like the pros?

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.070
- I've seen some cool.
- It's crazy.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:18.020
- It's amazing the way
they return the ball

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.520
from 30 feet away from the table.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:21.070
- I saw Forrest Gump, I get it.

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:23.460
- That was fake, that was fake.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.120
- I know, but I know that
people can do what he did.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.256
- Yeah they can.

00:14:27.256 --> 00:14:28.750
- What, play against a wall by themselves?

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.241
- No, just be so fast.

00:14:30.241 --> 00:14:33.510
- I played this wall one
time, it was so good.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:34.960
I couldn't hit anything back.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.310
- Ian, what are your hobbies?

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:41.880
- I like ping pong, I shoot pool.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.215
- That's right.
- Pool's great.

00:14:43.215 --> 00:14:44.830
That's really relaxing.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.378
- Yeah it is.

00:14:46.378 --> 00:14:47.211
Yeah, I like shooting pool.

00:14:47.211 --> 00:14:49.000
I ride a bicycle, read.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.630
I color, I don't draw.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.550
I have a coloring book.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.780
- How often do you color?

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:53.790
Is this a real thing

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.410
that you're doing every day?
- I colored two weeks ago.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:56.928
- Two weeks is not.
- It's very relaxing.

00:14:56.928 --> 00:14:59.100
- What kind of crayons are
you working with, Crayolas or?

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.444
- I got Crayolas.

00:15:00.444 --> 00:15:02.597
- Crayolas are the best.

00:15:02.597 --> 00:15:04.264
- 64 box.
- Violet.

00:15:04.264 --> 00:15:06.050
What's your favorite color, violet?

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.219
- Like a cyan.
- Let me tell you something.

00:15:08.219 --> 00:15:09.353
- Cyan's great.
- The crayon world.

00:15:09.353 --> 00:15:10.490
- Magenta.
- Has expanded so much

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:11.723
since I was a kid.
- Colored pencils,

00:15:12.585 --> 00:15:13.609
I love colored pencils.

00:15:13.609 --> 00:15:14.703
- What brand do you get, Eagle?

00:15:16.142 --> 00:15:17.585
- What is happening?

00:15:17.585 --> 00:15:18.418
- Can we go back to the
crayons for a minute?

00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:19.750
Do you ever strip the paper off

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.079
and just hold it bare in your hand?

00:15:22.079 --> 00:15:23.416
- I have, but not for years.

00:15:23.416 --> 00:15:24.471
- That's where you get the best contact.

00:15:24.471 --> 00:15:25.546
- Not for years.

00:15:25.546 --> 00:15:26.656
- Yeah, I love it, man.

00:15:26.656 --> 00:15:27.500
- Do you color, really, Kevin?

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.059
- I color if, when my son was younger.

00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:32.890
- Yeah, it's fun with kids.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.847
- I really outshine him

00:15:34.847 --> 00:15:36.719
because I wouldn't go
outside the line at all.

00:15:36.719 --> 00:15:37.950
I would keep it inside the lines.

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:38.783
- See, I have a hard time with it.

00:15:38.783 --> 00:15:39.616
- Do you really?

00:15:39.616 --> 00:15:40.449
- No.

00:15:40.449 --> 00:15:41.490
- Do you bring your own lines?

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:42.323
- No.

00:15:43.684 --> 00:15:44.517
I don't.

00:15:44.517 --> 00:15:46.325
But we didn't finish my hobbies.

00:15:46.325 --> 00:15:47.690
- Okay, let's get back to that.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:48.841
- Okay, let's recap them.

00:15:48.841 --> 00:15:49.674
- Because I don't have any.

00:15:49.674 --> 00:15:50.507
- [Kevin] Let's recap.

00:15:50.507 --> 00:15:51.340
- Okay, let's recap.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.173
- And maybe you might enjoy some of these

00:15:52.173 --> 00:15:53.006
and you might want to do them.

00:15:53.006 --> 00:15:54.230
- Banjo.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:58.160
- Banjo, guitar, sketching,
drawing, painting.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.340
- You do great sketches.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:00.750
Can we talk about your
sketches for a second?

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:02.780
You do caricatures of people.

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.290
It's almost caricature-like
sketching, right?

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:06.123
- Yeah, it's caricatures.

00:16:06.123 --> 00:16:08.310
- What makes something a caricature

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:10.600
as opposed to I'm trying to
make this look like a person,

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.440
it's just a drawing of a person?

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.350
- A caricature is you
accentuate their features,

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:16.370
you exaggerate.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:20.173
- You bully them with a crayon.

00:16:22.721 --> 00:16:26.880
I got a caricature done
of me when I was 11,

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:31.880
and there is a picture of me
sitting on this picnic table

00:16:32.127 --> 00:16:34.280
at this art fair or something,

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.170
and I'm sitting across from
this guy who's sketching me,

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.060
and I'm so excited.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.280
All the attention is on me.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.615
This is fulfilling every need I needed.

00:16:41.615 --> 00:16:45.230
There's gonna be a piece of
art made with my image on it?

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.563
It couldn't be cooler.

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:48.830
And I'm sitting there and I'm like,

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:50.830
I am famous, this is awesome.

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.650
And you can see me, I'm just
like smiling, so excited.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:57.550
And it was the last moment of my innocence

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:02.060
because it was broken seconds
later when he handed it to me

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.339
and I had such severe buckteeth,

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:08.580
he made me a rabbit that
was like roller blading.

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:12.030
You pick a hobby that
you're like, I like that,

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.422
and they throw it.

00:17:13.422 --> 00:17:16.117
And I did not know that I had buckteeth,

00:17:16.117 --> 00:17:18.510
and then everyone knew after that.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:19.417
- Did you have buckteeth?

00:17:19.417 --> 00:17:20.330
- Yeah, yeah, I was called like,

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:21.856
that was pretty much.

00:17:21.856 --> 00:17:23.420
- Were you Freddie Mercury for Halloween?

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.253
- I should have been.

00:17:24.253 --> 00:17:25.830
My parents should have been on that.

00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:27.720
But I just like, you know I was,

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.270
I just had, my teeth are
as big as they are now,

00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:32.470
my head was very small,
and they just stuck out

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.350
and everyone called me
a bucktoothed beaver.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:35.785
- Do you know, one time I was.

00:17:35.785 --> 00:17:37.530
- You get it, Ian.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.908
- Oh yeah, I had Chiclets
hanging out of my mouth.

00:17:40.908 --> 00:17:42.580
- Yeah, we both were bucktoothed beavers.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.200
- Well, you grew into your teeth.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.033
- We did.

00:17:45.033 --> 00:17:46.860
So you'll do this to people on planes,

00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.730
like you'll post a picture that you have,

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.050
or a sketch that you've done
of a caricature of someone

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.680
that you're kind of
observing on the plane.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.215
Do they ever find out?

00:17:55.215 --> 00:17:58.930
Has anyone ever seen
themselves in your Instagram?

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.320
- No, not that I know of.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.697
- Do they ever get

00:18:01.697 --> 00:18:02.846
creeped out?
- Usually they're sleeping.

00:18:02.846 --> 00:18:03.679
- Oh, they're sleeping.
- And I'll sketch them.

00:18:03.679 --> 00:18:05.525
If it's a long flight.

00:18:05.525 --> 00:18:06.570
- I want to be on a
flight with you some day.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:07.830
- I'd love to sketch you sometime,

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.220
even not on a flight.

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.010
- Will you leave my teeth alone?

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:11.920
- You have great teeth.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.355
- I do now.

00:18:13.355 --> 00:18:14.188
- You have really interesting.
- Because of braces.

00:18:14.188 --> 00:18:15.727
- Because you don't have veneers

00:18:15.727 --> 00:18:17.740
or like the perfect smile.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.779
- Okay, well, easy there.

00:18:19.779 --> 00:18:22.500
- Perfectly, it's perfectly.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.686
- Imperfect.
- Imperfect, thank you.

00:18:24.686 --> 00:18:25.620
- Great.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.750
Well, I did get Invisalign to fix it,

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:27.910
and it didn't really fix it.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:29.220
So I was trying to fix it.
- You have perfectly straight

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.016
teeth, but you have.

00:18:31.016 --> 00:18:33.370
Teeth, I think, are such,
they're so identifying

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:34.913
with people.

00:18:34.913 --> 00:18:35.746
- Yes, literally.

00:18:35.746 --> 00:18:37.550
If you were in a burn accident,

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.098
they're the only
identifying thing of people.

00:18:40.098 --> 00:18:42.233
- Don't you think it's easier

00:18:42.233 --> 00:18:44.456
if you're going to kill somebody,

00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:46.780
they'll identify them by their teeth?

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.770
Go to the dentist's office,
get their files and burn them,

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:52.270
so they can't have anything
to compare them to.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:53.773
- Throw it in with the burn.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:57.010
- I'm remembering a joke
that made me really laugh

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:59.530
that you said, I think I
heard it a couple years ago.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:00.977
- Oh, I don't know.

00:19:00.977 --> 00:19:01.970
- How you met your girlfriend.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:02.950
- I don't know.

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.460
- You met your girlfriend on Google Earth.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.980
Is that true?
- Oh, that was an old joke

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.304
that I used to do.
- I still remember that one.

00:19:09.304 --> 00:19:10.137
In fact, it works great for me.

00:19:10.137 --> 00:19:12.683
- She had been stalking
me for years, yeah.

00:19:13.629 --> 00:19:16.110
- It works great for you.
- It's so funny.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:17.680
- I haven't done that in years.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.970
- Judah has some, speaking
of, Kevin Nealon's here,

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:22.620
who has inspired me so much comedically.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.670
Judah as well, I remember
seeing Judah in 2005,

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.960
I took a trip with my
best friend to New York.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.610
I had just started doing
comedy, like open mics.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:34.380
I was in the Midwest and we came here

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.410
and we went to the Comedy Cellar.

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:38.460
And I still remember you
talking about going fishing

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:40.030
and what did you catch?

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:43.333
- Oh yeah, that, I caught a whale.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.740
When I cut it open, there
were about 14 tarpon inside,

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.801
mostly in the 100 to 200 pound range.

00:19:52.801 --> 00:19:56.140
I'm glad you other people have
had your little fishing trips

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.890
and feel good about yourselves.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.530
- You're just so smart and
your comedy is so funny.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:03.200
It's just really, you see
him in person, you think,

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.950
this guy must be crazy.

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.827
But he gets on stage and
it's so clever and funny.

00:20:07.827 --> 00:20:09.680
That's all I had to say.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.290
- No, you're right about Judah.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:15.230
I think, as everyone we
judge people based on,

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.850
I judged him based on his comedy

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:18.740
and was just so intimidated by him.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.770
I never wanted to even attempt
to be friends with him.

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.850
And everyone says this about Judah.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:25.790
And I'm trying to tell
people how I feel about them

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:28.320
before it's too late, not that.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.880
Because with Brody and stuff, I'm like,

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.440
I wish I would have let Brody know.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.280
I wish I would have let people.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.980
But Judah, what Judah means to me is like,

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:40.640
he is so, he's someone, and
this is rare with comedians,

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.930
they really want to,
they ask good questions,

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:44.760
they're interested in you, he's just,

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.180
he's someone who always
I'm excited to see because

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:50.200
you actually care about other people.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.320
And you're not only so funny

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.710
and definitely care about
yourself enough to be so,

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.230
you have to be somewhat of a narcissist,

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.190
but for some reason, you're
actually a really good friend

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:02.124
and you care about people.

00:21:02.124 --> 00:21:03.864
- We just want to say that we love you.

00:21:03.864 --> 00:21:04.697
We love you so much.
- Thank you.

00:21:04.697 --> 00:21:06.607
- And don't let anything happen to you.

00:21:06.607 --> 00:21:07.956
- See, this sucks.

00:21:07.956 --> 00:21:08.789
- Kevin, I love you too.

00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:10.738
- Thank you.
- Nikki, I love you too.

00:21:10.738 --> 00:21:12.905
- I mean, it's corny.
- Ian, I love you too.

00:21:12.905 --> 00:21:13.960
- But every time someone dies, we all go,

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.240
why didn't I tell them before,

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.180
and it's not that I
think anyone's gonna die,

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.880
but it's like why not just spread that,

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.211
why not tell people how you feel?

00:21:21.211 --> 00:21:23.620
- Can I just say one thing that I,

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.820
because it's on my mind?

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.030
Tom Davis was a writer
on Saturday Night Live.

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:30.431
He was partners with Al Franken.

00:21:30.431 --> 00:21:31.640
And Al Franken wrote a book
and he tells us about this.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.400
And he says that Tom Davis came
down with a terminal illness

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.690
and he only was given
a few months to live.

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:39.830
So I think Lorne Michaels
threw a party for him.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:40.800
And a lot of people came,

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.730
and they were just, it was like, you know,

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.160
to pay your respects
to him when he's alive

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.430
and give him your love and
everybody made speeches

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:49.629
and they loved him.

00:21:49.629 --> 00:21:53.790
And that was a very nice thing
and they said goodbye to him.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.880
Well, he lasted longer than
he thought he was gonna last,

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.620
and he was embarrassed to
come out and see these people.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:00.453
Are you still alive?

00:22:00.453 --> 00:22:03.420
Yes, I am, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.430
And he kept living and living

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:07.950
until eventually he did pass away,

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:10.490
but it was really
uncomfortable for him I think.

00:22:11.719 --> 00:22:13.060
And he was embarrassed he was alive still.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.510
- That's so funny.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:16.690
That's, I mean.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.550
- Yeah, Franken and Davis,
they were a comedy team.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:20.750
Well, that's gotta be the way you feel

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.770
when you get married and
then you get divorced

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:25.926
like really soon after some couples.

00:22:25.926 --> 00:22:27.130
I know a couple that just
got married and got divorced

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:28.770
before a year.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.270
- Before the warranties were
up on the blenders and stuff?

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:32.200
- Yeah.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.060
And it's just so, that's gotta
be the same kind of feeling.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.550
- Or what if you get married again

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:38.360
and you invite the same people?

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.145
Do we got to get them another gift?

00:22:40.145 --> 00:22:40.978
- Do you?

00:22:40.978 --> 00:22:41.811
I don't know.

00:22:41.811 --> 00:22:42.644
You've been married twice.

00:22:42.644 --> 00:22:44.354
- What's your all's take on?

00:22:44.354 --> 00:22:45.187
- Yeah, but the second
time, I didn't have a

00:22:45.187 --> 00:22:46.622
really a wedding.

00:22:46.622 --> 00:22:48.455
We went to Italy and got
married, just her and me.

00:22:48.455 --> 00:22:49.288
- Oh, that's the best, that's great.

00:22:49.288 --> 00:22:51.403
- What's your take on
destination weddings?

00:22:52.298 --> 00:22:53.356
What's your take on those?

00:22:53.356 --> 00:22:55.060
- I did one in Italy in Lake Como.

00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:58.273
- And you said, was it a big
wedding or a small wedding?

00:22:58.273 --> 00:22:59.170
- It was just me and her.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.473
We had to pay two Italians to witness it.

00:23:02.644 --> 00:23:05.160
- Okay, but what about when
it's a destination wedding

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.410
and you're having a big wedding

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:08.380
and inviting tons of people?

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.214
- Then you gotta fly them in.

00:23:09.214 --> 00:23:10.940
- Yes, absolutely fly them in.

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.655
But I think it would be a
good excuse for a fun time.

00:23:13.655 --> 00:23:15.130
- But what if they don't fly you in?

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:16.210
They just expect you to.

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.870
- Then you hope the marriage doesn't last.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:20.703
- Who does that?

00:23:20.703 --> 00:23:21.536
Who really does that?

00:23:21.536 --> 00:23:22.619
- I think a lot of people do that.

00:23:22.619 --> 00:23:24.370
- Everyone I know that's done
that has gotten divorced.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:25.310
- Oh really?

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:27.210
There's actually a
statistic that just came out

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:29.430
that said the more money
you spend on your wedding,

00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:30.883
the less likely you're.
- The more likely you're.

00:23:30.883 --> 00:23:32.250
- To last.
- Oh, interesting.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:33.380
- Which completely makes sense.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:36.330
That means you're kind
of like a materialistic,

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.100
we're doing it for the
event, it makes sense

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.380
that there's not like a real connection.

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.630
- Do they have a statistic on

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.120
the size of the engagement rings too?

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.900
- Probably around, it's
probably the same kind of deal.

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.220
- Nikki, did I tell you
when I went to Lake Como

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.570
to get married in Bellagio?

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.090
- At the Bellagio?

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:54.475
- No.

00:23:54.475 --> 00:23:55.386
- Oh, there's just a
place called Bellagio?

00:23:55.386 --> 00:23:56.423
- There's an actually, yeah.

00:23:56.423 --> 00:23:57.256
- Named after the casino, right?

00:23:57.256 --> 00:23:58.903
- They named it after the casino, yeah.

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:01.360
We get there.
- Honestly didn't know

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.800
that there was a city
called Bellagio, go on.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.030
- It's in the town hall and
the mayor's marrying us.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.103
It's all in Italian.

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:09.803
I don't even know if we got married.

00:24:09.803 --> 00:24:11.542
Maybe it's a restraining order.

00:24:11.542 --> 00:24:14.970
But I look outside and all
these paparazzi are forming

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.090
outside in the courtyard,
and I'm thinking, oh no,

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:18.400
what's going on?

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.680
Nobody knows we're getting married,

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.440
and even if they did, they
wouldn't be like this.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.930
And there's like probably
50 paparazzi out there,

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.060
cameras and everything.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:28.520
And I come outside and they
take pictures and stuff

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.030
and they follow us down the walkway.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:34.057
And I found out that they
thought I was Matt Damon.

00:24:34.057 --> 00:24:34.947
- What?

00:24:34.947 --> 00:24:37.590
- Because Matt Damon had been looking at,

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:39.470
eight weeks earlier, for
a place to get married,

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:40.660
or a couple months earlier,

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.170
and they thought he was coming back.

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:43.990
They heard an American celebrity
was coming to get married,

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:46.441
so they thought it was Matt Damon.

00:24:46.441 --> 00:24:47.276
- Amazing.

00:24:47.276 --> 00:24:49.240
- So the whole walk back, I'm
saying, I'm not Matt Damon.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.380
No Matt Damon.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:51.410
- And they kept taking pictures.

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.160
And the next day, we're
sitting at the cafe by the lake

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.340
and there's somebody reading

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.480
the Italian newspaper next to us

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.390
and there's a picture of
me and my wife on the front

00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:59.887
and above it, it says
(speaks foreign language).

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.586
- No way.

00:25:02.586 --> 00:25:04.280
That's amazing.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.930
- It was so bizarre.
- That's awesome.

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:07.276
- Oh, that's so good.

00:25:07.276 --> 00:25:09.100
- Was that your wedding photo?

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.358
- That was, yeah.

00:25:10.358 --> 00:25:12.270
- Oh my god, I would love, I mean,

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:14.068
that is a dream of mine.

00:25:14.068 --> 00:25:15.186
- That's perfect.
- To get married

00:25:15.186 --> 00:25:16.680
and have the paparazzi
want a picture of it.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:17.513
- [Judah] In Italy,

00:25:17.513 --> 00:25:18.585
they just call pap.
- See, there's your hobby.

00:25:18.585 --> 00:25:19.682
You like attention.

00:25:19.682 --> 00:25:20.515
- I do.

00:25:20.515 --> 00:25:21.684
- That is your hobby.

00:25:21.684 --> 00:25:22.700
- I do like attention.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:23.840
It's a problem.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.290
I think that.

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.210
- Kathy Griffin was like that too I think.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:28.580
- Yeah, yeah I know.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.213
We have a problem.

00:25:30.213 --> 00:25:31.482
- So you and Kathy
Griffin have a lot alike.

00:25:31.482 --> 00:25:33.390
- Well, I loved her reality
show, My Life on the D List,

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:35.160
and that's exactly what I want to do now,

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.540
is I just want to live my life

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:37.960
and have cameras follow me around.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.380
I'd be totally okay with that.

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.270
I would actually be
more than okay with it.

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.240
I actually actively want it.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.670
- You should pitch it.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:45.710
- I am, I am.

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:48.050
- Do you mind people staring at you?

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:49.610
- I don't like that.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:50.965
I don't like if,

00:25:50.965 --> 00:25:54.556
I would, well, maybe.

00:25:54.556 --> 00:25:55.737
- How many cameras do
you want following you?

00:25:55.737 --> 00:25:56.684
- I mean, I like to perform on stage,

00:25:56.684 --> 00:25:57.517
so I think.

00:25:57.517 --> 00:25:59.240
- Do you mind a camera from the back only?

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:02.640
- Yes because my butt is so disappointing.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.871
I would mind that, I'd
want to keep it front.

00:26:05.871 --> 00:26:06.704
- Really?

00:26:06.704 --> 00:26:09.060
- I'm thinking about
getting butt injections.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.340
I'm gonna be completely
honest with everyone here.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.900
- Dude, when you go into a
dressing room to try on clothes

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.390
and they have the three
mirrors behind you,

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:17.223
are you kind of surprised

00:26:17.223 --> 00:26:18.702
at how you look?
- I haven't done,

00:26:18.702 --> 00:26:19.535
I haven't done that before.

00:26:19.535 --> 00:26:20.439
- You haven't?

00:26:20.439 --> 00:26:21.290
- No way.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.753
You've never been into.

00:26:22.753 --> 00:26:23.860
- No, I'm joking.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.920
No, I've had to do it for.
- He has shoppers.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.974
- No, I think I had to get.

00:26:27.974 --> 00:26:28.807
- He likes house centipedes.

00:26:28.807 --> 00:26:30.090
He's never been in a bath.

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:32.610
- No, I think I had to
get a suit a couple times,

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:34.750
so I saw those things, yeah.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:36.820
- Yeah, they're devastating.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:39.516
- No, you're thinking, who's that person?

00:26:39.516 --> 00:26:40.665
That's my butt?

00:26:40.665 --> 00:26:42.187
- I know, that's my butt.

00:26:42.187 --> 00:26:43.089
- [Ian] I like it.

00:26:43.089 --> 00:26:44.202
- Well, it was a suit.

00:26:44.202 --> 00:26:45.220
It wasn't like, it's kind of loose.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:48.639
It's not like, the suit
wasn't form fitting so.

00:26:48.639 --> 00:26:49.530
- You don't like those suits they wear now

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.690
that look like Pee-wee Herman suits?

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:53.160
- Oh, the tight ones?

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.155
No, I don't like those.
- Yeah, short and tight.

00:26:55.155 --> 00:26:56.363
- Yeah, I don't like those.

00:26:56.363 --> 00:26:57.196
- No, I think that's a good look.

00:26:57.196 --> 00:26:58.218
- You like that look?
- Yeah, I like it.

00:26:58.218 --> 00:26:59.051
- Even with a tall guy.

00:26:59.051 --> 00:26:59.884
- Yeah, yeah.

00:26:59.884 --> 00:27:00.717
- Why?

00:27:00.717 --> 00:27:02.952
It's like Pee-wee Herman, isn't it?

00:27:02.952 --> 00:27:03.840
- I guess it just like looks fashionable

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.000
and so it looks like.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.733
- Who makes up these ideas,

00:27:06.733 --> 00:27:07.720
they look fashionable,
what they should be?

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.850
- I don't know, I don't know.

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:10.980
I don't know.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.830
I have heard recently that

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:14.840
there's just nothing new in fashion,

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.150
fashion is just done.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:17.740
They've done literally everything.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.500
Everyone hold on to whatever
90s clothes you're wearing now

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.880
because it's back in style.
- They'll come back.

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:22.713
- It's gonna be back in 20 years.

00:27:22.713 --> 00:27:23.800
So just hold onto it now.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.840
Don't go buy new stuff.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.900
- How about balloon pants?

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:27.733
Is that what they're called?

00:27:27.733 --> 00:27:29.044
- Oh, like the MC Hammer pants?

00:27:29.044 --> 00:27:29.930
- MC Hammer, yeah.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:30.867
- I don't know that those are back yet.

00:27:30.867 --> 00:27:31.700
- Parachute pants?

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.250
- Yeah, I don't know
that those are back yet.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:34.633
Fashion is exhausting.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.400
- What an industry
though to make money in.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.840
- I know.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.010
And I just read some
statistics about fast fashion,

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:47.010
just clothing is, clothing
contributes to more pollution

00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:51.700
in the air, making
clothing, than every plane,

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:56.700
every ship, every car, for any
kind of shipping and handling

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:00.240
that is happening in the world,

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.990
it creates more pollution
than all of that.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.890
- I always knew models were jerks.

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:08.573
- I see no rings on you
or bracelets or anything.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:11.690
- What does this mean to you?

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:13.020
- It means that you're gonna make

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:14.620
somebody very happy one day.

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:15.453
- Because I'm low maintenance.

00:28:15.453 --> 00:28:16.770
- Yes, you're very independent.

00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:18.080
You're not needy.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.860
Maybe you're needy,
but you're independent.

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:21.693
Can you be

00:28:21.693 --> 00:28:23.211
independent and needy?
- Jewelry is attention.

00:28:23.211 --> 00:28:25.770
- I can be very needy, yeah,

00:28:25.770 --> 00:28:27.544
like I feel like I can be.

00:28:27.544 --> 00:28:28.430
- Do you wear contacts?

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.160
- No, I mean yes, sometimes.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.743
- Do you have them in now?

00:28:31.743 --> 00:28:32.850
- No, that would be weird.

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:33.830
I'm wearing glasses.

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:34.663
- I know.

00:28:34.663 --> 00:28:37.218
- But I just read about
this woman who got Lasik

00:28:37.218 --> 00:28:38.210
in November.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:39.043
- Blind?

00:28:39.043 --> 00:28:42.573
- It made her blind and
she, it's really tragic,

00:28:42.573 --> 00:28:45.880
she killed herself in
December because from Lasik.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.930
I almost got Lasik in July.

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:48.920
I had the appointment made.

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:50.220
And then the day before,

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.160
The New York Times put
out an article about

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.540
people who have really
bad reactions to Lasik

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.130
that no one's talking about.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:57.210
Everyone's just like, it's so easy.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:28:59.220
They just cut your eye
open and then you're fine.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.860
And it's one percent of people though

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.370
have really, really bad side effects.

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:04.420
That's not nothing.

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:05.840
One percent is something.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.720
You could be that one percent.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.010
Take it from me who thought
I wouldn't be voted off first

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:10.890
of Dancing with the Stars.

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:12.943
It's like someone has to be.

00:29:12.943 --> 00:29:13.820
You have a one in 13 chance.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:14.870
It's gonna be someone.

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:16.785
I literally thought no one could be.

00:29:16.785 --> 00:29:19.500
There's a one percent
chance, one in a hundred,

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.450
you're gonna screw up your eyes.

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:22.500
So I canceled the thing,

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.900
and then I read this
story about this woman.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.484
A lot of people go blind after it.

00:29:26.484 --> 00:29:27.496
- I will tell you that,

00:29:27.496 --> 00:29:28.329
and maybe Judah you've experienced this,

00:29:28.329 --> 00:29:31.210
I had Lasik on my nipple and nothing.

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:34.083
No side effects at all, Judah.

00:29:34.083 --> 00:29:37.820
- Clear, are you
near-nippled or far-nippled?

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.890
- Far-nippled now, but I was near-nippled.

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:40.900
- Got it, got it, got it.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:42.462
What about you, Judah?

00:29:42.462 --> 00:29:43.295
You only wear glasses.
- I had a lot,

00:29:43.295 --> 00:29:46.910
I had a lot of what Kevin just said.

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:48.784
- Lot of Lasik all over the body.

00:29:48.784 --> 00:29:50.637
- I don't want to talk about it.

00:29:50.637 --> 00:29:52.173
It didn't go well.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.080
Thanks for bringing it up though.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:57.485
- I'm sorry.

00:29:57.485 --> 00:29:59.628
I didn't realize that was
such a sore spot for you.

00:29:59.628 --> 00:30:00.890
- Literally.
- It still is a sore spot.

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:03.815
- After Lasik, it
shouldn't be sore though.

00:30:03.815 --> 00:30:05.065
- It still is.
