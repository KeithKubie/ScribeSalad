00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259
so the last time last lecture I ended
 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.470
so the last time last lecture I ended
with the Abrahamic stories with the

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480
with the Abrahamic stories with the
 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.660
with the Abrahamic stories with the
death of Sarah and that was Abraham's

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670
death of Sarah and that was Abraham's
 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.120
death of Sarah and that was Abraham's
wife and so we're gonna continue from

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130
wife and so we're gonna continue from
 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.180
wife and so we're gonna continue from
from there remember Abraham had a son

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190
from there remember Abraham had a son

Isaac and he was asked by God to

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920
Isaac and he was asked by God to
 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.370
Isaac and he was asked by God to
sacrifice his son which we talked about

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
sacrifice his son which we talked about
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.259
sacrifice his son which we talked about
in in some depth and I was attempting to

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269
in in some depth and I was attempting to
 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.330
in in some depth and I was attempting to
make the case that you know the idea of

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340
make the case that you know the idea of
 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.849
make the case that you know the idea of
sacrifice was one of humankind's great

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859
sacrifice was one of humankind's great
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.609
sacrifice was one of humankind's great
discoveries because it meant the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619
discoveries because it meant the
 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.709
discoveries because it meant the
discovery of the future essentially but

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719
discovery of the future essentially but
 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.240
discovery of the future essentially but
it also meant the discovery that the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250
it also meant the discovery that the
 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.100
it also meant the discovery that the
future was something that you could make

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110
future was something that you could make
 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.840
future was something that you could make
a bargain with and that you could give

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850
a bargain with and that you could give
 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.670
a bargain with and that you could give
up something now something impulsive

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680
up something now something impulsive
 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.250
up something now something impulsive
some pleasure even a deep pleasure in

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260
some pleasure even a deep pleasure in
 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.330
some pleasure even a deep pleasure in
the moment and you could strive and

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340
the moment and you could strive and
 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.350
the moment and you could strive and
hypothetically you could make a covenant

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360
hypothetically you could make a covenant
 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.510
hypothetically you could make a covenant
a bargain with the future and if your

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520
a bargain with the future and if your
 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.910
a bargain with the future and if your
sacrifices were acceptable and that

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920
sacrifices were acceptable and that
 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.500
sacrifices were acceptable and that
seemed to mean an ethically acceptable

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510
seemed to mean an ethically acceptable
 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.720
seemed to mean an ethically acceptable
you had to sacrifice the right thing

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730
you had to sacrifice the right thing
 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.490
you had to sacrifice the right thing
that that vastly increased the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500
that that vastly increased the
 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.529
that that vastly increased the
probability that not only you would be

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539
probability that not only you would be
 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.139
probability that not only you would be
successful let's say but that your

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149
successful let's say but that your
 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.050
successful let's say but that your
descendants would be too and I don't

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
descendants would be too and I don't
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.760
descendants would be too and I don't
think that that's an irrational

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
think that that's an irrational
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.340
think that that's an irrational
proposition I mean you have to leave in

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350
proposition I mean you have to leave in
 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.660
proposition I mean you have to leave in
it a bit with the realization that

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670
it a bit with the realization that
 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.240
it a bit with the realization that
sometimes you know you get sliced off at

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250
sometimes you know you get sliced off at
 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.340
sometimes you know you get sliced off at
the knees no matter what right because

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350
the knees no matter what right because
 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.499
the knees no matter what right because
life has an arbitrary element and and

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509
life has an arbitrary element and and
 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.670
life has an arbitrary element and and
that can't be tossed out but building in

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680
that can't be tossed out but building in
 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.010
that can't be tossed out but building in
the arbitrary element will say you still

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020
the arbitrary element will say you still
 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.780
the arbitrary element will say you still
want to think well what's your best bet

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790
want to think well what's your best bet
 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.940
want to think well what's your best bet
given a certain amount of randomness and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950
given a certain amount of randomness and
 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.440
given a certain amount of randomness and
it seems to me that conscious self-aware

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450
it seems to me that conscious self-aware
 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.600
it seems to me that conscious self-aware
sacrifice and proper ethical striving is

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610
sacrifice and proper ethical striving is
 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.880
sacrifice and proper ethical striving is
your best bet and you know there's

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
your best bet and you know there's
 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.550
your best bet and you know there's
another idea that well I've always

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560
another idea that well I've always
 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.100
another idea that well I've always
explained it when I've explained it to

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110
explained it when I've explained it to
 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.810
explained it when I've explained it to
people I've always used the movie

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820
people I've always used the movie
 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.280
people I've always used the movie
Pinocchio as an example you know that

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290
Pinocchio as an example you know that
 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.679
Pinocchio as an example you know that
when Geppetto was trying to make his

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689
when Geppetto was trying to make his
 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.600
when Geppetto was trying to make his
puppet into a self-aware and autonomous

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610
puppet into a self-aware and autonomous
 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.510
puppet into a self-aware and autonomous
moral agent which is what he wants above

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
moral agent which is what he wants above
 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.179
moral agent which is what he wants above
all else you know he aims at the highest

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189
all else you know he aims at the highest
 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.520
all else you know he aims at the highest
good that he can conceive which is the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530
good that he can conceive which is the
 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.289
good that he can conceive which is the
star that he prays to essentially and

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299
star that he prays to essentially and
 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.929
star that he prays to essentially and
hopes for the transformation and there's

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939
hopes for the transformation and there's
 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.010
hopes for the transformation and there's
also something in that that's

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020
also something in that that's
 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.710
also something in that that's
unutterably profound and maybe that is

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720
unutterably profound and maybe that is
 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.650
unutterably profound and maybe that is
somewhat independent of the idea that

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660
somewhat independent of the idea that
 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.350
somewhat independent of the idea that
you

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360
you
 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.390
you
have to believe in God I would also say

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400
have to believe in God I would also say
 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.550
have to believe in God I would also say
that what it means to believe in God in

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560
that what it means to believe in God in
 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.140
that what it means to believe in God in
the Old Testament is by no means clear

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150
the Old Testament is by no means clear
 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.390
the Old Testament is by no means clear
and that's something I also really want

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400
and that's something I also really want
 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.160
and that's something I also really want
to talk about tonight it's not obvious

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170
to talk about tonight it's not obvious
 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.020
to talk about tonight it's not obvious
what it means and well Gepetto what he

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030
what it means and well Gepetto what he
 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.470
what it means and well Gepetto what he
does at least is aim at the highest good

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480
does at least is aim at the highest good
 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.420
does at least is aim at the highest good
of which he can conceive you know and

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430
of which he can conceive you know and
 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.710
of which he can conceive you know and
that that's actually being a

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720
that that's actually being a
 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.600
that that's actually being a
philosophical definition of God upon

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610
philosophical definition of God upon
 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.820
philosophical definition of God upon
occasion that God is the highest good of

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830
occasion that God is the highest good of
 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.290
occasion that God is the highest good of
which you conceived and you know that's

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300
which you conceived and you know that's
 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.360
which you conceived and you know that's
different than the idea of a

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370
different than the idea of a
 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.120
different than the idea of a
transcendent being precisely but it's in

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130
transcendent being precisely but it's in
 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.740
transcendent being precisely but it's in
line with it's in line with certain

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750
line with it's in line with certain
 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.840
line with it's in line with certain
interesting psychoanalytic speculations

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850
interesting psychoanalytic speculations
 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.190
interesting psychoanalytic speculations
this is one of the things I really liked

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200
this is one of the things I really liked
 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.430
this is one of the things I really liked
about Carl Jung you know
