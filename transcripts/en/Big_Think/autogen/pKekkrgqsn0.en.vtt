00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.099
JOSCHA BACH: I think that religion probably
got us from the first million individuals—and

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.459
we had been at a million individuals for a
very long time in history—to the first one

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:16.920
hundred million.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.220
And then this monotheistic religion, we got
to something like three hundred million.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.560
And at the turn of the times at 1 BC we were
about three hundred million individuals.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.330
And at the beginning of enlightenment, that
is somewhere around seven hundred AD approximately,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.090
we were still four hundred million individuals.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.690
And at this point we evolved in our culture
the ability to doubt.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.859
We started doubting the religion.

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:44.659
And feudalism broke down as a result, and
we started building a modern much more productive

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:45.659
society.

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.319
This society got us two billions of individuals.

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:51.480
And then came the next revolution and the
twentieth century.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.420
These were systemic societies.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.390
Societies that were grown in the lab from
people that created ideologies.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.729
Fascism, socialism, communism, market liberalism—These
were all things that people thought of and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.480
invented and lapsed [??] and then implanted
them in societies.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.912
Incidentally they all failed, and now in something
like a post-systemic age and we don’t really

00:01:11.912 --> 00:01:14.200
know what works and what doesn’t work.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.180
And when we want to describe our society we
sometimes use words like “resilience”

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.670
or “anti-fragility” and so on, which are
good words for muddling through.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.330
Because we don’t really know how to organize
these societies in these days anymore.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.460
It’s a very big problem; we need to deal
with this and many countries try to find different

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.070
answers to their problem.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.320
So in a way this ability to program ideologies
and then project them onto people has been

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.950
a very big breakthrough for our species, and
important it is for mass media.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.600
Mass media made the twentieth century possible,
because mass media synchronized the dreams

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.800
of large numbers of people, the ideas about
the world that they lived in.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.200
And now due to social media, mass media has
lost much of their appeal.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.010
You know that U.S. in some sense had two realities,
the CNN and the Fox News reality.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.390
They were two narratives that were pretty
much incompatible.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.619
Two stories that were being told to the people
and that affected their minds.

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.569
And now due to social media people have stopped
believing these media narratives to a very

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.909
large extent.

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.439
People believe random stuff basically.

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:21.849
That’s why we are so obsessed with the idea
of fake news, which is incidentally not the

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.499
propaganda that we are afraid of falling victim
to.

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:27.610
It’s a propaganda that we don’t want others
to infect.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.610
Right?

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.499
Random bits of information, viral bits of
information that come from the internet and

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:36.349
that get people to disbelieve the same dream
that we are dreaming.

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.050
It’s actually very dangerous because it’s
going to splinter society into parts that

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.790
we don’t know how to glue together again.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.099
I think that our brain is doing an amazing
thing that we don’t know how to do out there

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.859
in the real world.

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:54.849
Our brain is a self-organizing system that
processes information in a near-optimal way.

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.379
Sometimes you have defects where the brain
starts lying to itself, but mostly it doesn’t

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.379
happen.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.659
Our nervous system is pretty accurate in the
sense that it doesn’t lie to itself very

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:03.659
much.

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.189
And the way we build our organization in the
world of our governments and so on, which

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.099
are in some sense the nervous systems of our
societies, they lie to themselves.

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.409
They are corrupted by local interests and
so on.

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.620
And we haven’t really found a way to build
information processing networks out in the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.879
world that manage to be for the most part
always truthful and relevant.

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:29.120
And if we understand how our brain is pulling
this off to self-organize in such a way that

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.150
many, many small units can link up in a way
that organizes itself to do the best for that

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.169
particular organism, this is something that
we need to pull up in our societies too.

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:45.239
So I do think that insights from understanding
how our minds work and how our nervous systems

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.279
work are going to be very helpful in understanding
how to build better societies and better organizations.
