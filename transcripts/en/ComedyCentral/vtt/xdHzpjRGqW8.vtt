00:00:01.502 --> 00:00:04.137
&gt;&gt; IT'S TIME FOR, IT WAS THE
WORST OF TIMES, IT WAS THE WORST

00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:10.644
OF TIMES.

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:13.380
IT'S TIME TO ANGERLY SWIPE
EVERYTHING OFF THE NIGHT STAND.

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:18.252

GREAT AGAIN."

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.394
I HAVE TO BE HONEST I HAVEN'T
READ IT YET.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:31.532
BUT I'M GUESSING ALL THE PAGES
LOOK LIKE THIS.

00:00:31.565 --> 00:00:42.009
[LAUGHING]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.178
&gt;&gt; NOW COMEDIANS SINCE I'M NOT
SURE WE WILL ALL READ THIS RIGHT

00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:47.014

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:51.451
CHAPTERS FROM THIS BOOK AS YOU
CAN IN 60 SECONDS AND BEGIN.

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:57.024
&gt;&gt; VIETNAM, PAYING TAXES AND
OTHER THINGS I'VE AVOIDED.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:59.560

&gt;&gt; POINTS.

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:08.902
&gt;&gt; WHY I HATE ALL IMMIGRANTS
EXCEPT MY MOTHER AND MY WIVES.

00:01:08.936 --> 00:01:10.304
&gt;&gt; ELIZA.

00:01:10.337 --> 00:01:13.073
&gt;&gt; DUMB BROADS WHO THINK I'M
CHAUVINISTIC.

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:16.076
&gt;&gt; POINTS. DAVE HILL.

&gt;&gt; FIVE MEXICANS I'M NOT EXACTLY
CRAZY ABOUT.

&gt;&gt; PENELOPE CRUZ AND OTHER
HISPANICS WHO CAN STAY.

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:26.854
&gt;&gt; DAVE HILL.

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:29.423
&gt;&gt; FIVE THINGS I WOULD USE A
MEXICAN FOR IF I ABSOLUTELY HAD

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:33.227
TO.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.964
&gt;&gt; COMB, PRAY, LOVE.

00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:40.534
&gt;&gt; FIVE PEOPLE I THOUGHT WERE
MEXICAN WHO TURNED OUT TO NOT BE

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:41.335
MEXICAN.

00:01:41.368 --> 00:01:41.435
