00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.063
Where were we,
last time?

00:00:17.063 --> 00:00:22.049
Last time, we said we were
setting aside the problem of the

00:00:22.049 --> 00:00:26.004
structure of the atom.
We were setting it aside

00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:30.303
because we were stuck,
and what we had to do was to

00:00:30.303 --> 00:00:34.000
look at another area of
discussion.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.960
And that is this wave-particle
duality of light and matter,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.835
because it is that discussion
that is going to give us the

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:48.197
clues about how to proceed.
We are putting aside the

00:00:48.197 --> 00:00:53.414
discussion of the structure of
the atom all the way until next

00:00:53.414 --> 00:00:57.348
Wednesday, because next Monday,
I was reminded,

00:00:57.348 --> 00:01:10.000
is a student holiday.
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.510
And so we started.
We talked about the wave-like

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.116
properties of light.
We said that the property of

00:01:19.116 --> 00:01:23.434
superposition,
the fact that you can put waves

00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:29.000
at the same point in space and
their amplitudes add.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.076
Since waves have both positive
and negative amplitude,

00:01:33.076 --> 00:01:37.076
that means that you have
constructive and destructive

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:40.230
interference.
And it is those interference

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.846
phenomena, then,
that are evidence for wave-like

00:01:43.846 --> 00:01:46.307
property.
And we did the two-slit

00:01:46.307 --> 00:01:50.538
experiment to try to give you an
example of interference

00:01:50.538 --> 00:01:53.461
phenomena.
We were trying to understand

00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:57.769
those interference phenomena,
and did so in terms of this

00:01:57.769 --> 00:02:02.769
diagram here.
The interference phenomena that

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:07.325
we saw was an array,
actually a row of bright spots,

00:02:07.325 --> 00:02:10.541
dark spots, bright spots,
dark spots.

00:02:10.541 --> 00:02:15.544
And we drew these semicircles
here around each one of the

00:02:15.544 --> 00:02:18.760
slits.
They represent a little bit of

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.512
the wave that emanated through
those slits.

00:02:22.512 --> 00:02:27.515
Because those slits are small,
then, those waves emanated

00:02:27.515 --> 00:02:33.291
equally in all directions.
That is why these semicircles

00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:37.716
represent the wave maxima.
And what we discovered is that

00:02:37.716 --> 00:02:42.141
if we looked along this line
here, this line which led to

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:45.618
this bright spot,
that all of the waves along

00:02:45.618 --> 00:02:48.858
this line were constructively
interfering.

00:02:48.858 --> 00:02:53.678
That is, we had the maximum of
the two waves at the same point

00:02:53.678 --> 00:02:58.498
in space, or the minimum of the
two waves at the same point in

00:02:58.498 --> 00:03:02.066
space.
And we noticed that everywhere

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:05.235
along this line,
where we had that constructive

00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:08.197
interference,
the difference in the distance

00:03:08.197 --> 00:03:10.677
of the waves traveled was one
lambda.

00:03:10.677 --> 00:03:13.984
We noticed, here,
that everywhere along this line

00:03:13.984 --> 00:03:17.428
that led to a very bright spot,
we had constructive

00:03:17.428 --> 00:03:20.391
interference.
And the difference in distance

00:03:20.391 --> 00:03:23.284
traveled by those two waves was
two lambda.

00:03:23.284 --> 00:03:25.971
And, likewise,
up here, along this line,

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:31.000
the difference in the distance
traveled was zero lambda.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.618
And from just that,
in a sense, qualitative

00:03:34.618 --> 00:03:37.461
observation, we drew a
conclusion.

00:03:37.461 --> 00:03:41.424
And that conclusion was in
order to get maximum

00:03:41.424 --> 00:03:46.076
constructive interference,
a condition that had obtain,

00:03:46.076 --> 00:03:50.987
is that the difference in the
distance traveled by the two

00:03:50.987 --> 00:03:55.639
waves has to be an integral
multiple of the wavelength.

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.000
N could be 0,
1, 2, 3, etc.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.439
And so, the very bright spot
here that always bisects the two

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.917
slits, since N is 0,
we call that the zero-order

00:04:06.917 --> 00:04:10.394
interference feature,
or the zero-order fraction

00:04:10.394 --> 00:04:13.206
feature.
The bright spot that is either

00:04:13.206 --> 00:04:17.793
to the left or to the right or
up or down of that center bright

00:04:17.793 --> 00:04:21.419
spot is the first-order
diffraction feature or the

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.786
first-order interference
feature.

00:04:23.786 --> 00:04:28.374
And then the second bright spot
up or down from the center is a

00:04:28.374 --> 00:04:32.000
second-order diffraction
feature.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.867
And so on and so on.
And in recitation section,

00:04:35.867 --> 00:04:40.744
what you also should have done,
is you should have reasoned

00:04:40.744 --> 00:04:45.705
through what the condition was
for destructive interference.

00:04:45.705 --> 00:04:50.918
That is in between these bright
spots, you have dark spots as a

00:04:50.918 --> 00:04:53.777
result of destructive
interference.

00:04:53.777 --> 00:04:58.402
And that results because,
say, right here you get a dark

00:04:58.402 --> 00:05:02.456
spot --
Right here at that point you

00:05:02.456 --> 00:05:07.631
would see the maximum of one
wave at the same point in space

00:05:07.631 --> 00:05:12.456
as the minimum of the other,
and so they exactly cancel.

00:05:12.456 --> 00:05:17.105
And so by just analyzing what
waves were destructively

00:05:17.105 --> 00:05:21.491
interfering, you should have
come up with a general

00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:24.912
expression for destructive
interference,

00:05:24.912 --> 00:05:27.719
of N plus one-half,
that quanity,

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:32.393
times lambda.
That is your general condition

00:05:32.393 --> 00:05:37.099
for destructive interference,
the difference in the distance

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.407
traveled by the two waves.
This kind of diagram here we

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:45.954
are also going to see on Friday,
because this interference

00:05:45.954 --> 00:05:49.783
phenomenon is the property
associated with waves.

00:05:49.783 --> 00:05:54.569
And what we are going to do is
see this diagram again when we

00:05:54.569 --> 00:06:00.436
scatter electrons for particles.
We are going to see that

00:06:00.436 --> 00:06:04.295
particles, also,
will destructively and

00:06:04.295 --> 00:06:09.270
constructively interfere.
They also have wave-like

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.027
properties.
That is what we will do on

00:06:13.027 --> 00:06:15.769
Friday.
We have established,

00:06:15.769 --> 00:06:20.033
now, the wave-like properties
of radiation,

00:06:20.033 --> 00:06:26.227
so I would like to move on and
talk about the evidence for the

00:06:26.227 --> 00:06:31.000
particle-like nature of
radiation.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.104
The evidence for the
particle-like nature of

00:06:41.104 --> 00:06:48.464
radiation comes from an effect
called the photoelectric effect.

00:06:48.464 --> 00:06:53.924
Shortly after Thompson
discovered the electron,

00:06:53.924 --> 00:07:00.928
scientists were noticing that
if you took a metal and shined

00:07:00.928 --> 00:07:06.863
radiation on that metal,
that indeed electrons were

00:07:06.863 --> 00:07:10.871
emitted.
Electrons came off.

00:07:10.871 --> 00:07:14.024
These were called
photoelectrons.

00:07:14.024 --> 00:07:20.133
However, the radiation that you
shined on the metal had to have

00:07:20.133 --> 00:07:26.241
a frequency nu that was greater
than or equal to some threshold

00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:32.512
frequency, nu nought.
That is, if you took radiation

00:07:32.512 --> 00:07:38.367
of some frequency here,
nu, that was less than this

00:07:38.367 --> 00:07:43.636
threshold frequency,
well, you did not get any

00:07:43.636 --> 00:07:48.553
electrons off.
Well, another way to kind of

00:07:48.553 --> 00:07:54.876
understand that data or that
effect is to just plot the

00:07:54.876 --> 00:08:01.550
number of the electrons that
come off as a function of the

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:08.054
frequency of the radiation.
And so at low frequency,

00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:12.591
there are no electrons,
but all of a sudden you get to

00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:16.529
nu nought, and then electrons
start coming off.

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:21.151
And no matter how high you
increase the frequency here,

00:08:21.151 --> 00:08:25.774
the number of electrons that
come off remains the same,

00:08:25.774 --> 00:08:30.698
remains constant.
And it turned out that for the

00:08:30.698 --> 00:08:34.296
metals that were looked at,
at that time,

00:08:34.296 --> 00:08:38.973
the threshold frequency,
here, was in the UV range of

00:08:38.973 --> 00:08:43.830
the electromagnetic spectrum.
Well, in addition to just

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.968
measuring the number of
electrons and generally

00:08:47.968 --> 00:08:52.555
observing this effect,
scientists did not understand

00:08:52.555 --> 00:08:56.873
what was going on.
So they just started measuring

00:08:56.873 --> 00:09:02.000
everything they could think
about measuring.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.885
And one quantity that they
measured was the kinetic energy

00:09:06.885 --> 00:09:10.485
of these electrons that were
being emitted.

00:09:10.485 --> 00:09:15.628
And so you take kinetic energy
here, KE, as a function of the

00:09:15.628 --> 00:09:18.371
frequency.
They found that at low

00:09:18.371 --> 00:09:22.142
frequency, again,
there is no kinetic energy,

00:09:22.142 --> 00:09:27.114
because there are no electrons.
And then at some frequency,

00:09:27.114 --> 00:09:32.000
all of a sudden electrons
started coming off.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.070
And the kinetic energy of those
electrons seemed to increase

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:43.524
with the frequency once past
that threshold frequency,

00:09:43.524 --> 00:09:47.536
nu nought.
Well, this was really another

00:09:47.536 --> 00:09:51.961
one of these conundrums,
here, at that time,

00:09:51.961 --> 00:09:57.414
because classical physics,
classical electromagnetism,

00:09:57.414 --> 00:10:04.000
classical physics had no way of
explaining these data.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.519
And, in fact,
what classical physics

00:10:06.519 --> 00:10:10.480
predicted is that the kinetic
energy of these electrons,

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.655
that that kinetic energy should
have nothing to do with the

00:10:14.655 --> 00:10:18.543
frequency of the light.
That is, the kinetic energy was

00:10:18.543 --> 00:10:21.351
constant.
As you increased the frequency

00:10:21.351 --> 00:10:24.303
of the light,
classical physics would tell

00:10:24.303 --> 00:10:28.336
you that the kinetic energy
should not be affected by the

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:33.146
frequency of the light.
There was nothing in the

00:10:33.146 --> 00:10:38.243
classical way of thinking,
classical electromagnetism that

00:10:38.243 --> 00:10:43.430
connected the frequency of the
light to the kind of energy,

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:48.170
to the kinetic energy.
There was no way for blue light

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:52.642
to make the electrons have a
larger kinetic energy,

00:10:52.642 --> 00:10:57.829
and for blue light to have an
effect on the kinetic energy,

00:10:57.829 --> 00:11:04.000
and red light to not have an
effect on the kinetic energy.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.335
In addition,
what classical physics

00:11:07.335 --> 00:11:13.124
predicted is that the kinetic
energy of the electrons should

00:11:13.124 --> 00:11:17.245
be dependent on the intensity of
the light.

00:11:17.245 --> 00:11:22.543
That is, the more and more
intense the radiation on the

00:11:22.543 --> 00:11:28.528
metal, the more and more kinetic
energy those electrons should

00:11:28.528 --> 00:11:31.673
have.
Because, after all,

00:11:31.673 --> 00:11:36.607
if you increase the intensity
of the light going into the

00:11:36.607 --> 00:11:41.100
metal, you are putting more and
more energy into it.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.592
That should be reflected in
just how energetic those

00:11:45.592 --> 00:11:49.557
electrons were picked out.
The more energy in,

00:11:49.557 --> 00:11:54.930
the electrons ought to come out
with larger and larger kinetic

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:58.190
energy.
Of course, the observation was

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:03.652
that the kinetic energy of the
electrons had nothing to do with

00:12:03.652 --> 00:12:09.203
the intensity of light.
The kinetic energy of the

00:12:09.203 --> 00:12:14.492
electrons did not increase as
you made the light brighter and

00:12:14.492 --> 00:12:18.018
brighter.
As you put more and more energy

00:12:18.018 --> 00:12:21.544
in, the kinetic energy remained
the same.

00:12:21.544 --> 00:12:26.480
It didn't have an effect.
This was a real conundrum here.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.857
The known classical physics was
making predictions really just

00:12:31.857 --> 00:12:36.000
contrary to what was being
observed.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.142
These data, here,
of the kinetic energy versus

00:12:41.142 --> 00:12:45.828
the frequency,
were around for a few years

00:12:45.828 --> 00:12:50.742
before Einstein took a look at
them in 1905,

00:12:50.742 --> 00:12:56.571
a hundred years ago.
And he looked at these data for

00:12:56.571 --> 00:13:03.030
many different metals.
Here is some data for metal A,

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:07.373
for example,
and here is some data for metal

00:13:07.373 --> 00:13:09.494
B.
And, in both cases,

00:13:09.494 --> 00:13:15.050
it certainly looked like the
kinetic energy was linearly

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:19.393
dependent on the frequency of
the radiation.

00:13:19.393 --> 00:13:25.252
But what was different for the
two different metals was the

00:13:25.252 --> 00:13:30.000
threshold frequency here,
nu nought.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.722
What Einstein did was,
he went and fitted a straight

00:13:36.722 --> 00:13:43.049
line to these data,
y equals mx plus b.

00:13:43.049 --> 00:13:46.345
And when he did that,

00:13:46.345 --> 00:13:51.881
and he went to calculate the
slope here, m,

00:13:51.881 --> 00:13:59.000
of these lines,
he thought "very interesting."

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.396
Because the slope of those
lines was 6.626x10^-34 joule

00:14:05.396 --> 00:14:09.661
seconds.
The slope of those lines was

00:14:09.661 --> 00:14:14.044
something called Planck's
constant, h.

00:14:14.044 --> 00:14:19.019
You say so what?
Well, the reason he was so

00:14:19.019 --> 00:14:25.415
interested in this is because
just a few years earlier,

00:14:25.415 --> 00:14:31.812
there was a scientist by the
name of Max Planck who was

00:14:31.812 --> 00:14:38.564
interested in understanding what
was called the black-body

00:14:38.564 --> 00:14:44.000
radiation data.
What is a black-body?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.904
Well, let's just,
for simplicity purposes,

00:14:47.904 --> 00:14:53.428
think of the black-body as the
burner on an electric stove.

00:14:53.428 --> 00:14:58.666
What you know is that if you
turn up the voltage on that

00:14:58.666 --> 00:15:04.000
burner, the burner gets hot.
It increased in temperature.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.285
And you increase the
temperature, and sooner or

00:15:07.285 --> 00:15:10.142
later, that burner is glowing
bright red.

00:15:10.142 --> 00:15:13.142
And you increase the
temperature some more,

00:15:13.142 --> 00:15:16.000
and the burner is glowing a
brighter red.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.928
And you increase it some more,
and it is glowing orange.

00:15:19.928 --> 00:15:23.714
And you increase it some more,
which you shouldn't do,

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:27.571
and it's glowing yellow.
And then if you could increase

00:15:27.571 --> 00:15:31.000
it some more,
it's glowing white.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.478
What is happening,
as you increase the

00:15:34.478 --> 00:15:39.649
temperature, is that the
radiation from that black-body,

00:15:39.649 --> 00:15:44.256
this is the black-body
radiation, is increasing in

00:15:44.256 --> 00:15:47.264
intensity.
But, more importantly,

00:15:47.264 --> 00:15:51.213
the frequency is getting larger
and larger.

00:15:51.213 --> 00:15:54.598
Dark red, bright red,
orange, yellow,

00:15:54.598 --> 00:15:57.606
white, those are all
frequencies.

00:15:57.606 --> 00:16:04.000
The frequency is shifting to
higher and higher values.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.166
And what was actually done at
that time is that the intensity

00:16:10.166 --> 00:16:16.332
of that black-body radiation,
oh, and this material is not in

00:16:16.332 --> 00:16:21.470
your notes, because you are not
responsible for it.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:27.533
I am just trying to make this
surprise that Einstein noticed

00:16:27.533 --> 00:16:32.457
about the slope.
I am just trying to put it in

00:16:32.457 --> 00:16:35.847
some context,
why he was so surprised and

00:16:35.847 --> 00:16:39.576
amazed at it.
This black-body intensity here,

00:16:39.576 --> 00:16:43.983
people had dispersed that
radiation and looked at the

00:16:43.983 --> 00:16:46.694
frequencies that were coming
off.

00:16:46.694 --> 00:16:49.576
This is intensity versus
frequency.

00:16:49.576 --> 00:16:54.491
Here is a general shape of that
intensity versus frequency.

00:16:54.491 --> 00:17:00.000
That was observed for some
temperature T one.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.119
That was a low temperature.
And then, when the temperature

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:10.598
was increased and the intensity
versus frequency was observed,

00:17:10.598 --> 00:17:14.371
well, the frequencies generally
got higher.

00:17:14.371 --> 00:17:18.413
This is higher temperature.
Intensity goes up.

00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:22.185
And you increase the
temperature some more,

00:17:22.185 --> 00:17:25.149
and you get even higher
frequency.

00:17:25.149 --> 00:17:30.000
T three is the highest
temperature.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.709
And that is what the data were.
What Planck was trying to do

00:17:36.709 --> 00:17:43.192
was to understand the origin of
that black-body radiation.

00:17:43.192 --> 00:17:48.082
What he said was that in these
black-bodies,

00:17:48.082 --> 00:17:52.745
in these materials,
what there must be are

00:17:52.745 --> 00:17:59.000
oscillators that are giving off
this radiation.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.448
But he had another little kick
to these oscillators.

00:18:04.448 --> 00:18:10.323
These oscillators were giving
off radiation or energy in

00:18:10.323 --> 00:18:13.635
chunks, in quanta,
in particles.

00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:18.014
And using that idea,
plus some statistical

00:18:18.014 --> 00:18:23.783
mechanics, he was able to
calculate the shapes of these

00:18:23.783 --> 00:18:26.988
curves.
That is, he indeed got,

00:18:26.988 --> 00:18:32.970
for the lowest temperature
here, a curve that looked like

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:36.834
this.
And for T two,

00:18:36.834 --> 00:18:39.978
he got a curve that looked like
this.

00:18:39.978 --> 00:18:44.695
And for T three,
he got a curve that looked like

00:18:44.695 --> 00:18:47.141
this.
He got the shape right,

00:18:47.141 --> 00:18:50.635
but he wanted to get the
intensity right,

00:18:50.635 --> 00:18:53.518
too.
What he realized he had to do

00:18:53.518 --> 00:18:57.885
was he essentially needed to
have a scaling factor,

00:18:57.885 --> 00:19:04.000
actually, in front of his
frequencies of his oscillators.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.483
He wanted a constant.
And so he said,

00:19:07.483 --> 00:19:13.290
what constant do I have to have
in order to make all of these

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:18.129
data fit the observation?
That constant is Planck's

00:19:18.129 --> 00:19:22.387
constant, his own 6.626x10^-34
joule seconds.

00:19:22.387 --> 00:19:26.064
There it is.
That is Planck's constant.

00:19:26.064 --> 00:19:31.000
That is it.
There is nothing deeper here.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.761
It is a natural constant.
It comes from our observations

00:19:36.761 --> 00:19:39.171
of the world,
of nature.

00:19:39.171 --> 00:19:42.942
That is it.
It is a fitting constant.

00:19:42.942 --> 00:19:47.866
And so that is why Einstein was
so amazed, here,

00:19:47.866 --> 00:19:54.152
when he realized this number is
the same as what comes out of

00:19:54.152 --> 00:19:57.609
here.
There must be something very

00:19:57.609 --> 00:20:04.000
fundamental about this h,
this Planck's constant.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.560
That is the story.
Isn't that amazing?

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:16.323
What Einstein then proceeded to
do, of course,

00:20:16.323 --> 00:20:24.890
is to write down the equation
of the straight line that he

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:33.306
just put through these data.
And so that equation is the

00:20:33.306 --> 00:20:38.448
kinetic energy equal to nu,
which is our x,

00:20:38.448 --> 00:20:44.938
h, which is the slope.
And then what he found was that

00:20:44.938 --> 00:20:50.938
the intercept here,
of course, is minus h times nu

00:20:50.938 --> 00:20:56.693
nought.
This is plus minus h times nu

00:20:56.693 --> 00:21:02.543
nought.
And that is the equation of a

00:21:02.543 --> 00:21:05.789
straight line.
Of course, he realized,

00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:11.140
if this is energy on this side,
boy, there better be energy on

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.561
this side.
And so this h times nu

00:21:14.561 --> 00:21:18.508
better be an energy.
And since this nu was the

00:21:18.508 --> 00:21:22.543
frequency of the incident
radiation, therefore,

00:21:22.543 --> 00:21:27.543
h times nu better be the energy
of the incident radiation,

00:21:27.543 --> 00:21:32.682
E sub i.
That is where this expression,

00:21:32.682 --> 00:21:36.796
energy equals h times nu
comes from.

00:21:36.796 --> 00:21:40.463
Nothing more.
That is where it comes from,

00:21:40.463 --> 00:21:45.203
the photoelectric effect.
This was the first time that

00:21:45.203 --> 00:21:50.032
there was any relationship
between the frequency of the

00:21:50.032 --> 00:21:53.699
radiation and the energy of the
radiation.

00:21:53.699 --> 00:21:58.528
In classical electromagnetism,
there is no relationship

00:21:58.528 --> 00:22:03.000
between the frequency and the
energy.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.746
This was the first time in
which that relationship was

00:22:08.746 --> 00:22:12.975
observed.
And what this is saying is the

00:22:12.975 --> 00:22:16.987
following.
This is saying that you can

00:22:16.987 --> 00:22:23.710
have any frequency of radiation
you want, but the corresponding

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:30.000
energy comes in these chunks of
h times nu.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.784
h is a quantization constant.
Radiation, nu,

00:22:35.784 --> 00:22:41.838
is continuous,
but the energy that corresponds

00:22:41.838 --> 00:22:48.430
to any given frequency of
radiation is h times nu.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:56.502
This E equals h times nu,
here, is thought of as a

00:22:56.502 --> 00:23:02.669
quantum of energy.
A particle of energy.

00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:08.898
A chunk of energy.
Later on, it became the photon,

00:23:08.898 --> 00:23:15.635
the energy of a photon.
If this h times nu here

00:23:15.635 --> 00:23:20.974
was an energy,
well, this h times nu nought

00:23:20.974 --> 00:23:25.423
also better be an  energy.

00:23:25.423 --> 00:23:32.856
It is the threshold energy.
Let's draw an energy level

00:23:32.856 --> 00:23:36.481
diagram to try to understand
that.

00:23:36.481 --> 00:23:40.106
I am going to plot an energy
here.

00:23:40.106 --> 00:23:44.719
Let's draw an energy level for
an electron.

00:23:44.719 --> 00:23:49.662
This is an electron,
here, bound to the metal.

00:23:49.662 --> 00:23:56.363
And we know that it takes some
energy to rip this electron off

00:23:56.363 --> 00:24:01.126
of the metal.
Up here, at higher energy,

00:24:01.126 --> 00:24:03.744
is going to be our free
electron.

00:24:03.744 --> 00:24:06.443
I will just call it
electron-free,

00:24:06.443 --> 00:24:11.514
not bound to the metal anymore.
And the energy that is required

00:24:11.514 --> 00:24:15.767
to pull the electron off,
from the bound state to its

00:24:15.767 --> 00:24:20.511
free state, is this threshold
energy, h times nu nought.

00:24:20.511 --> 00:24:23.456
This threshold energy is like

00:24:23.456 --> 00:24:27.709
an ionization potential.
You know what the ionization

00:24:27.709 --> 00:24:32.121
potential is.
Just the energy required to

00:24:32.121 --> 00:24:35.421
pull an electron off an atom or
a molecule.

00:24:35.421 --> 00:24:40.371
However, when we are pulling an
electron off a chunk of a metal,

00:24:40.371 --> 00:24:43.200
we actually have another name
for it.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.521
It is called the work function.
That is just historical,

00:24:47.521 --> 00:24:51.528
but it is the same thing as an
ionization potential.

00:24:51.528 --> 00:24:54.278
And we often give it the symbol
phi.

00:24:54.278 --> 00:24:58.364
That threshold energy,
ionization energy for a metal,

00:24:58.364 --> 00:25:01.349
is the work function,
here, h times nu,

00:25:01.349 --> 00:25:06.789
phi.
The important point here is

00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:11.842
this.
In order to get an electron off

00:25:11.842 --> 00:25:17.035
of the metal,
what you have to have is

00:25:17.035 --> 00:25:24.333
energy, E sub i.
That energy E sub i has to be

00:25:24.333 --> 00:25:32.754
equal to at least the threshold
energy, h times nu nought.

00:25:32.754 --> 00:25:37.660
If you come in with energy of

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.513
this radiation,
of this wavelength and that

00:25:41.513 --> 00:25:45.000
frequency, you pulled the
electron off,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.229
and then the electron is off
the metal and it just kind of

00:25:50.229 --> 00:25:53.256
stays there.
It doesn't move away.

00:25:53.256 --> 00:25:57.844
But you can also come in with
energy here, E sub i,

00:25:57.844 --> 00:26:03.165
that is greater than this work
function, than the threshold

00:26:03.165 --> 00:26:07.287
energy.
And you can pull the electron

00:26:07.287 --> 00:26:09.574
off.
But then, the electron is

00:26:09.574 --> 00:26:14.463
actually going to move away from
the metal, and the energy with

00:26:14.463 --> 00:26:18.722
which it moves away from the
metal, its kinetic energy,

00:26:18.722 --> 00:26:23.059
is just the incident energy
minus this threshold energy.

00:26:23.059 --> 00:26:27.634
It is the excess energy here.
And I am going to write it as

00:26:27.634 --> 00:26:33.660
the kinetic energy.
From that energy level diagram,

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:37.439
this energy,
the incident energy,

00:26:37.439 --> 00:26:43.225
has to be equal to the work
function, h nu nought,

00:26:43.225 --> 00:26:48.066
plus the kinetic energy.

00:26:48.066 --> 00:26:54.915
Or, if I turned this around,
the kinetic energy is equal to

00:26:54.915 --> 00:27:02.000
the incident energy minus h nu
nought.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.237
The actual expression for the
energy that Einstein found,

00:27:06.237 --> 00:27:08.810
I just turned that equation
around.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.913
This is an equation that you
have to know.

00:27:11.913 --> 00:27:14.789
I will not give this to you on
an exam.

00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:17.362
Now, you don't have to memorize
it.

00:27:17.362 --> 00:27:21.145
You just have to reason it.
Draw yourself an energy

00:27:21.145 --> 00:27:23.567
diagram.
You know conservation of

00:27:23.567 --> 00:27:26.291
energy.
The sum of these two energies

00:27:26.291 --> 00:27:30.000
has to equal the incident
energy.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:37.302
Then you will be all set.
Now, what is very important

00:27:37.302 --> 00:27:44.182
here is the following.
If I come in with radiation

00:27:44.182 --> 00:27:50.361
that is, say,
a half of the threshold energy.

00:27:50.361 --> 00:27:58.085
Suppose I come in with two
photons, where each photon is

00:27:58.085 --> 00:28:03.000
one half h nu --

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.861
The bottom line is that you are
not going to get an electron

00:28:12.861 --> 00:28:15.580
off.
Even though you are coming in

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:19.205
with two photons,
which together are going to

00:28:19.205 --> 00:28:23.902
give you the threshold energy,
you won't get a photon off.

00:28:23.902 --> 00:28:28.434
You have to come in with at
least the energy of the work

00:28:28.434 --> 00:28:33.366
function.
A photon has to have at least

00:28:33.366 --> 00:28:37.312
this energy to get an electron
off.

00:28:37.312 --> 00:28:42.535
That is the particle-like
nature of radiation.

00:28:42.535 --> 00:28:47.875
Energy comes in chunks,
in particles of energy,

00:28:47.875 --> 00:28:53.330
in quanta of energy.
Likewise, if I came in here

00:28:53.330 --> 00:29:00.526
with a photon that had twice the
energy of the work function or

00:29:00.526 --> 00:29:05.982
the threshold energy,
I would still only get one

00:29:05.982 --> 00:29:11.587
electron off.
I would not get two electrons

00:29:11.587 --> 00:29:15.870
off, even though energetically
you would be able,

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:19.261
in principle,
to get two electrons off.

00:29:19.261 --> 00:29:23.187
But you won't.
You will only get one electron

00:29:23.187 --> 00:29:26.221
off.
Whenever you send a photon in,

00:29:26.221 --> 00:29:31.039
if it has enough energy,
that is if its energy is equal

00:29:31.039 --> 00:29:35.680
to or greater than the work
function, you will get an

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:40.939
electron off.
There is one electron for every

00:29:40.939 --> 00:29:44.543
photon.
You never get two electrons for

00:29:44.543 --> 00:29:48.051
every photon,
or you can never get one

00:29:48.051 --> 00:29:52.413
electron for two photons that
are lower energy.

00:29:52.413 --> 00:29:56.965
That is the particle quantum
nature of radiation.

00:29:56.965 --> 00:30:00.000
That is important.
Yes?

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:18.352
What is the form of the photon?
What do you mean by form?

00:30:18.352 --> 00:30:25.008
Oh, you want a picture of the
photon.

00:30:25.008 --> 00:30:33.259
You're looking at them.
You cannot draw a picture of a

00:30:33.259 --> 00:30:39.342
photon because you want to
relate it to something that is

00:30:39.342 --> 00:30:42.818
within your classical
experience.

00:30:42.818 --> 00:30:48.576
And you cannot do that.
It isn't a classical particle.

00:30:48.576 --> 00:30:53.247
That is what you're working
with right here.

00:30:53.247 --> 00:30:59.331
You are trying to use your
experiences, that are everyday

00:30:59.331 --> 00:31:05.306
experiences, to explain
something that isn't within your

00:31:05.306 --> 00:31:13.673
everyday experiences.
You don't have a frame or a

00:31:13.673 --> 00:31:18.000
format to do that.
Yeah?

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.805
Yes.
If you have a constant flux of

00:31:33.805 --> 00:31:39.850
photons onto the surface,
you will have a constant flux

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:44.440
of electrons.
Now, there is a probability.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:50.708
It is not necessarily the case
that every photon gets in,

00:31:50.708 --> 00:31:56.305
will eject electrons,
because there are other kinds

00:31:56.305 --> 00:32:02.718
of competing processes.
Whatever the rate with which

00:32:02.718 --> 00:32:07.475
the photons come in.
It depends on the flux of the

00:32:07.475 --> 00:32:11.165
photons.
And we will have some problems

00:32:11.165 --> 00:32:17.184
like that, where we are going to
assume that the probability of

00:32:17.184 --> 00:32:23.203
the electron coming off is going
to be one, so one electron for

00:32:23.203 --> 00:32:26.019
every photon.
But, in reality,

00:32:26.019 --> 00:32:32.459
there are competing processes.
Are all electrons being

00:32:32.459 --> 00:32:35.987
ejected?
Actually, some electrons.

00:32:35.987 --> 00:32:39.729
Again, this goes to the
probability.

00:32:39.729 --> 00:32:47.000
Some are actually kind of going
in, too, into deeper the metal.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.500
Not the probability,
right.

00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:01.269
The rate at which the electrons
come out with is dependent on

00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:06.303
the intensity.
The more photons you send in,

00:33:06.303 --> 00:33:12.341
the larger the number of
photons per second coming in,

00:33:12.341 --> 00:33:18.721
the larger the number of
electrons per second coming out.

00:33:18.721 --> 00:33:23.392
This is a plot,
here, of the energy of the

00:33:23.392 --> 00:33:26.468
electrons.
That's all right.

00:33:26.468 --> 00:33:30.000
Other questions?
Yeah?

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.354
Eventually.
Yes.

00:33:36.354 --> 00:33:39.967
Absolutely.
There are other problems that

00:33:39.967 --> 00:33:43.490
will come in.
Usually, your light source

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:48.006
isn't so energetic that you
could possibly do that.

00:33:48.006 --> 00:33:53.335
Now, also usually what happens
is that you've got your metal

00:33:53.335 --> 00:33:58.845
grounded, so that as you lose
electrons, new electrons come in

00:33:58.845 --> 00:34:03.000
and fill it up to the fermi
level.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.344
And so you don't charge up your
sample.

00:34:06.344 --> 00:34:10.480
In an experiment,
if you had your metal just not

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:15.936
grounded and you did shine some
radiation, what would happen is

00:34:15.936 --> 00:34:18.927
the metal would start to charge
up.

00:34:18.927 --> 00:34:23.768
Then, that would make it
difficult to get electrons off.

00:34:23.768 --> 00:34:25.000
Yes?

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.438
Yes.
How strongly those electrons

00:34:37.438 --> 00:34:42.009
are bound to the metal depends
on the electronic structure of

00:34:42.009 --> 00:34:44.752
the metal.
And we are going to talk a

00:34:44.752 --> 00:34:49.552
little bit about what determines
the strength of the interaction

00:34:49.552 --> 00:34:53.895
for electrons on atoms and
molecules, but it is similar to

00:34:53.895 --> 00:34:57.780
what it is for metals.
That is coming in a few days.

00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:59.000
Yes?

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.456
Yes, there is.
Right.

00:35:05.456 --> 00:35:08.296
You don't actually have to have
a metal.

00:35:08.296 --> 00:35:11.210
You could do it.
There are usually higher

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:14.414
frequencies on insulators and
semiconductors,

00:35:14.414 --> 00:35:17.109
right.
It is harder to see the effect,

00:35:17.109 --> 00:35:19.731
but it can be done and has been
done.

00:35:19.731 --> 00:35:24.173
Well, what I want to do right
now is to show you an experiment

00:35:24.173 --> 00:35:27.014
we are going to do.
We are going to do a

00:35:27.014 --> 00:35:30.000
photoelectron experiment.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:53.863
And the experiment is this.
We have a device up here.

00:35:53.863 --> 00:36:00.000
What we have is an aluminum
plate.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.480
And that aluminum plate is
mounted on this blue metal rod.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:10.480
And in the middle of this rod
is a needle on a pivot.

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.230
And this is a fairly
frictionless pivot.

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:17.980
This black ring,
here, is just a support

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:22.019
structure, an insulating support
structure.

00:36:22.019 --> 00:36:27.403
What we are going to do is put
some excess charge on this

00:36:27.403 --> 00:36:32.208
aluminum plate.
And that excess charge is going

00:36:32.208 --> 00:36:35.913
to run down this metal rod and
then onto this needle.

00:36:35.913 --> 00:36:40.330
And because that excess charge,
the electrons on the needle and

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:43.465
the electrons on the metal rod
are repulsive,

00:36:43.465 --> 00:36:45.816
since this is rather
frictionless,

00:36:45.816 --> 00:36:49.521
that needle is going to move
because of the repulsive

00:36:49.521 --> 00:36:52.086
interactions between these
electrons.

00:36:52.086 --> 00:36:56.147
What we're then going to do is
try to do the photoelectron

00:36:56.147 --> 00:37:00.918
experiment.
We are going to take some UV

00:37:00.918 --> 00:37:07.068
radiation and shine it on this
metal and drive the electrons

00:37:07.068 --> 00:37:09.361
off.
And we should see,

00:37:09.361 --> 00:37:14.781
then, the needle swing back to
its original position.

00:37:14.781 --> 00:37:20.931
I need a couple of volunteers
in order to do this experiment

00:37:20.931 --> 00:37:22.599
here.
Come on up.

00:37:22.599 --> 00:37:24.684
All right.
Fantastic.

00:37:24.684 --> 00:37:27.915
I think that is all right.
Good.

00:37:27.915 --> 00:37:32.058
Okay.
One of you needs to be the

00:37:32.058 --> 00:37:35.936
charger, and the other needs to
be the discharger.

00:37:35.936 --> 00:37:38.469
Which one?
You want to discharge?

00:37:38.469 --> 00:37:41.240
Discharge, okay.
You come over here.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:45.910
And what you are going to do is
discharge the aluminum plate

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:48.839
after we get some excess charge
on it.

00:37:48.839 --> 00:37:52.955
You are going to do it just by
holding it up to here.

00:37:52.955 --> 00:37:57.387
You have to get it kind of
close because it is not a very

00:37:57.387 --> 00:38:03.169
intense UV source.
Could you get the video cam on

00:38:03.169 --> 00:38:09.084
the side or on the center to get
where we are putting it?

00:38:09.084 --> 00:38:13.732
I guess we are putting it on
the side, right?

00:38:13.732 --> 00:38:15.528
Okay.
There we go.

00:38:15.528 --> 00:38:19.753
There is the device.
You are the charger.

00:38:19.753 --> 00:38:24.929
What we are going to do,
to get the excess charge,

00:38:24.929 --> 00:38:30.000
we are taking a piece of
natural fur.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.135
We are going to rub it on this
Lucite rod.

00:38:33.135 --> 00:38:37.189
You have to keep your fingers
on the yellow tape here.

00:38:37.189 --> 00:38:41.549
And we are going to transfer
some of the natural oils here

00:38:41.549 --> 00:38:44.379
onto this rod.
And there are plenty of

00:38:44.379 --> 00:38:47.745
negative ions around here and
free electrons.

00:38:47.745 --> 00:38:52.334
That oil likes those negative
charges, and so there are going

00:38:52.334 --> 00:38:57.000
to be excess negative charges on
this Lucite rod.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.154
And then you are going to come
over here and just touch the

00:39:03.154 --> 00:39:08.459
edge of this and let the
electrons flow onto there.

00:39:08.459 --> 00:39:13.659
Are you right-handed?
You have to rub that really,

00:39:13.659 --> 00:39:16.736
really hard.
[LAUGHTER] Great.

00:39:16.736 --> 00:39:19.707
Go over there.
Touch the end.

00:39:19.707 --> 00:39:23.315
Cool.
Why don't you give it another

00:39:23.315 --> 00:39:30.000
jolt here and we will really
move that needle over.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.262
Okay.
Discharger.

00:39:31.262 --> 00:39:33.707
We have to give it another
jolt.

00:39:33.707 --> 00:39:36.941
That is okay.
You may have touched it with

00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:40.491
something else and discharged it
a little bit.

00:39:40.491 --> 00:39:43.882
No, that's okay.
You have to get the hang of

00:39:43.882 --> 00:39:46.643
this, here.
You are doing fantastic.

00:39:46.643 --> 00:39:49.010
Take it off.
That's what it is.

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:53.506
You are holding it on too long.
Okay, that is pretty good.

00:39:53.506 --> 00:39:57.371
Put it in front there.
Get it a little bit closer.

00:39:57.371 --> 00:40:02.106
Here comes the UV radiation.
We did it.

00:40:02.106 --> 00:40:06.423
Try it again really hard.
Just touch it.

00:40:06.423 --> 00:40:09.080
Take it off.
Do it again.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:14.614
You need to do it again.
You've got to get it right

00:40:14.614 --> 00:40:16.606
here.
Not too much,

00:40:16.606 --> 00:40:18.820
not too little.
Okay.

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:22.583
It is doing it.
Discharge in front.

00:40:22.583 --> 00:40:27.122
Electrons off.
Now we have to do a control

00:40:27.122 --> 00:40:33.286
experiment.
That is, you have got to charge

00:40:33.286 --> 00:40:38.586
it up again, but now,
when you put the light there,

00:40:38.586 --> 00:40:44.946
what I am going to do is hold
up a Pyrex plate in between the

00:40:44.946 --> 00:40:49.611
light and the metal.
It is going to block the

00:40:49.611 --> 00:40:53.639
radiation, and it should not
discharge.

00:40:53.639 --> 00:40:57.349
You need to get on there.
Fantastic.

00:40:57.349 --> 00:41:02.042
There it goes.
Here is the plate.

00:41:02.042 --> 00:41:07.602
Get it to a little bit lower.
Do a good discharge.

00:41:07.602 --> 00:41:12.255
[APPLAUSE] Fantastic.
Thank you very much.

00:41:12.255 --> 00:41:15.886
Thank you for being a good
sport.

00:41:15.886 --> 00:41:19.971
That is the photoelectron
experiment.

00:41:19.971 --> 00:41:24.964
Hey, it works.
Well, what I want to do now is

00:41:24.964 --> 00:41:32.000
just spend a few minutes working
on a few problems.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.274
I think these are pretty
straightforward,

00:41:36.274 --> 00:41:42.366
but I just want to make sure
that everybody is on the same

00:41:42.366 --> 00:41:47.816
page here in terms of being able
to do the homework.

00:41:47.816 --> 00:41:53.053
Here is the first problem.
The first problem says,

00:41:53.053 --> 00:41:57.755
how many photons?
And remember what we said a

00:41:57.755 --> 00:42:02.145
photon was?
E equals h nu.

00:42:02.145 --> 00:42:07.296
This is the number of joules.
Implied is the number of joules

00:42:07.296 --> 00:42:11.416
per photon, although we don't
usually write this,

00:42:11.416 --> 00:42:15.107
but that is what that is,
joules per photon.

00:42:15.107 --> 00:42:20.000
You may want to write it as you
do these problems.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:28.028
How many photons associated
with radiation of a wavelength

00:42:28.028 --> 00:42:35.774
lambda equals one picometer,
which is 1.0x10^-12 meters,

00:42:35.774 --> 00:42:42.535
how many of these do you need
in order to create,

00:42:42.535 --> 00:42:49.014
say, a laser pulse of energy
that is one joule?

00:42:49.014 --> 00:42:55.633
Lasers are pulsed,
so I am talking about a pulse

00:42:55.633 --> 00:43:02.454
of energy, one joule.
You want to draw yourself a

00:43:02.454 --> 00:43:06.545
picture, here.
We are drawing a picture of one

00:43:06.545 --> 00:43:08.909
pulse of energy,
one joule.

00:43:08.909 --> 00:43:13.181
Now, we have not been given the
frequency, here,

00:43:13.181 --> 00:43:17.272
of this radiation,
but we know the wavelength,

00:43:17.272 --> 00:43:21.727
and we know the relationship
between frequency and

00:43:21.727 --> 00:43:25.000
wavelength.
It is just c over lambda.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
I know what lambda is.
I can calculate nu.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.766
And, when I do that,
I find that the energy of the

00:43:34.766 --> 00:43:40.700
photon, hc over lambda,
that energy of the

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:44.494
photon is 1.99x10^-13 joules per
photon.

00:43:44.494 --> 00:43:50.330
And I am using one more figure
than is significant since this

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:55.000
an intermediate step in the
calculation.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:02.929
If I want a pulse of one joule
of energy and I am asked how

00:44:02.929 --> 00:44:10.175
many photons do I need to get
that, and each photon is

00:44:10.175 --> 00:44:16.328
1.99x10^-13 joules,
well, that means that I am

00:44:16.328 --> 00:44:24.257
going to need 5.0x10^12 photons.
There was a question here?

00:44:24.257 --> 00:44:30.000
All right.
Let's work another one.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.909
Here, we want to define what we
mean by power.

00:44:34.909 --> 00:44:40.472
This says the power of
radiation from the continuous

00:44:40.472 --> 00:44:44.618
laser is three milliwatts.

00:44:44.618 --> 00:44:50.072
We have some laser,
and the power of that radiation

00:44:50.072 --> 00:44:55.636
coming out is three milliwatts.
Well, what is power?

00:44:55.636 --> 00:45:02.865
Power is energy per unit time.
It is the energy delivered or

00:45:02.865 --> 00:45:06.125
the energy expended per unit
time.

00:45:06.125 --> 00:45:11.263
The unit of power that we are
going to use is a watt.

00:45:11.263 --> 00:45:16.500
A watt is a joule per second.
We are told that we have

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:22.230
radiation of three milliwatts.
That is 3.0x10^-3 joules per

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:25.095
second.
And the question asks,

00:45:25.095 --> 00:45:30.826
how long will it take for a
total energy of one joule to be

00:45:30.826 --> 00:45:36.176
supplied?
Well, one joule.

00:45:36.176 --> 00:45:47.691
And we have the rate of energy
supply as 3x10^-3 joules per

00:45:47.691 --> 00:45:54.242
second.
That gives us 330 seconds.

00:45:54.242 --> 00:46:04.051
That is straightforward.
Finally, we have one more.

00:46:04.051 --> 00:46:11.220
It says, how many photons per
second of, again,

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:17.922
the same radiation,
of the wavelength of one

00:46:17.922 --> 00:46:22.285
picometer.
That means, again,

00:46:22.285 --> 00:46:29.922
we are dealing with photons
that have an energy of

00:46:29.922 --> 00:46:39.027
1.99x10^-13 joules per photon.
How many photons per second,

00:46:39.027 --> 00:46:45.189
the rate of photons at the
wavelength do you have to have,

00:46:45.189 --> 00:46:49.945
or do you have,
if the power of the radiation

00:46:49.945 --> 00:46:54.486
is three milliwatts?
Well, the power of the

00:46:54.486 --> 00:47:00.000
radiation is 3.0x10^-3 joules
per second, --

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:06.000
-- and we have 1.99x10^-13
joules per photon.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:18.538
In order to have this kind of
power, what we have to have

00:47:18.538 --> 00:47:25.000
being emitted is 1.5x10^10
photons per second.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.191
All right.
The photoelectric effect is one

00:47:38.191 --> 00:47:43.608
of the experiments that
demonstrated the particle-like

00:47:43.608 --> 00:47:46.573
nature of light,
of radiation.

00:47:46.573 --> 00:47:52.706
Particle-like nature because
you have to have these chunks of

00:47:52.706 --> 00:47:57.000
energy to make some process
occur.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:03.134
Next time, we are going to look
at and will just talk briefly

00:48:03.134 --> 00:48:09.474
about the other experiments that
demonstrated the particle-like

00:48:09.474 --> 00:48:14.382
nature of radiation.
And that other experiment is

00:48:14.382 --> 00:48:18.881
the demonstration that a photon
has momentum,

00:48:18.881 --> 00:48:22.562
even though it doesn't have any
mass.

00:48:22.562 --> 00:48:24.762
See you Wednesday.
See you Friday.
